z7529,1,2012-09-01,What should I do with my career and my life?,ProtagonistForHire,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z7529/what_should_i_do_with_my_career_and_my_life/,"

I graduated from Law school last year from the UK, and became a [1] barrister. Now I'm currently interning at the top law firm in my country. Unfortunately, this is a career that I absolutely hate and I'm completely miserable.

I never really had a choice with what I wanted to study at university or choose my profession. I come from a kind of typical upper-middle class, indian family (Bangladeshi to be specific), so I was raised to obey and not question. My father kind of forced me to study law, which I did for 5 years. I tried to tell him for the first two years that I didn't like it at all and don't want to be in this profession, but that really did not go anywhere. The last three years of university was just a haze of severe depression and still going strong, but I still managed to finish my 3 degrees.

After I came back home, I was lucky enough to be able to join a law firm. It is the best in the country, the people who work there are great (really intelligent and polite) and even my supervisor likes me a lot (which I heard just today through the grapevine). I'm certainly learning a lot, and everyone who hears where I work is immediately very impressed. And if I stay here I will probably be making very good money in 3 to 4 years time (I'm getting currently a salary of zero, since I'm just a lowly intern now). Honestly the only complaint I have is the 10-12 hour work day, six days a week, which would not be a problem if I loved my job since the office environment is really chill.

But the thing is, I've hated law from day one of university. I never had any interest in the subject and still do not. I also kind of hated being in the UK for those 5 years, mainly due to the circumstances. The fact that I had to study law, more or less against my will has made me really hate law and myself. I feel like a prisoner in my own life.

I realize that I really need to change my career, but I'm at a complete loss as to what I should do. I have zero adult guidance now, and I was raised such a sheltered life (eg: not allowed to play sports outside, because I would get kidnapped...wtf right?) that I am completely confused about my life.

I do not want to do this law shit any longer. I just want to quit so bad. But I have no idea what I can do alternatively. I am really hesitant to quit this job, because of all the goods things about it I said before. I am worried that quitting is going to be a really big mistake. But this is definitely not the life I want to live.

My years of depression as completely sucked the life out of me. I don't have the energy to study again, mainly because university was a form prolonged mental torture for me. And mainly because I would need to save a lot of money to put me through uni, which I cannot do without a salary.

I also feel like a bitch complaining about my life because I am well provided for. I live in a nice house, I am fed, and loved. But I am extremely unhappy and have been so for the last 6 years. I really really hate myself for not standing up for myself. I know that this is all my fault. I was too scared to just quit law school, mainly because so much money was spent behind me. And the social pressure from back home for me to finish school was immense. I wish I was more mature and not a little shit who just followed the path of least resistance. But now I am trying to correct my stupid mistakes.

I've thought of teaching law, but teachers aren't really paid anything in this country, and I hate talking in public (also another reason I do not want to be a lawyer).

Though about working in the legal division in a company, but I have to wait till February 2013 because I have to sit for a national exam first for me to be employable in any kind of decent job.

I apologise for the wall to text and poor writing, but language is not my strength (another reason I hate law). . I do not really have anyone who's an adult to talk to about this. Most of my friends are still students, so they don't know anything, just like me. My head has been a mess for the last month and I can tell I'm burning out after all this time. Every night all I fantasize about is suicide, only to wake up to another 10 hours of work which I hate. But I could please use some advise on what I can do career wise and what I should want from my life (right now I just want to die).

What I am most worried about is making the wrong decision out of fear (which is partly how I got into my current mess). I do not want to wait 1 more year to realize that the last 7 years of my life has been a big mistake (I'm pretty sure it has).

I literally have no idea what to do with my life anymore. And I also do not feel like I am able to make any rational and objective decision about my long term goals. Mainly because I have been sheltered and kept away from a lot of things, so I'm quite immature, naive and don't yet understand how real life works. And since I don't have any adult to talk to about these things, I feel like I'm completely in the dark.

Should I do something else (but what?), or should I stop being a whiny bitch and just suck it up and work at my law firm (since any one to gets to work there is extremely lucky)? Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

z6pmu,1,2012-09-01,From cop to criminal [Bipolar/OCD] and hookers!,mhj123,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/z6pmu/from_cop_to_criminal_bipolarocd_and_hookers/,"Well I am not sure exactly how to begin this but perhaps that is simply the best intro there is. 

This is a throwaway account. Ever since I found out about this subreddit I have wanted to post, but over the years I have developed a very cynical outlook in regards to mental health. Per my own conditions I have never really found anything that has helped me and the years spent in therapy have made me feel jaded. I never truly trust my psychologist because I think they are all about the money (I know this isn't true). 

But I mean what a joke job, the guy sits there and listens to me moan for an hour and collects 150$ at the end. A hooker costs 50% less for a half hour and comes with a happy ending. 

When I was really little lets say 3 I was visiting my fathers mother in NY (my grandfather died before I could meet him). Anyway to make a long story short I was playing with my dad in the park and started freaking out about 'germs' being all over me. I have no recollection of this incident but based on my fathers description it definitely sounds like I was having some sort of a panic attack. 

Anyway shortly after that my pre-school teachers started telling my parents that I spent an abnormal amount of time in the bathroom and when they asked me why I apparently told them it was because I was washing my hand. And indeed I was washing my hands, until they bled. 

So that led to the first encounter with a psychatrist. I got diagnosed with OCD and thrown on Prozac or Zoloft for kids, anyway my mom used to sprinkle it onto my applesauce. 

Now usually I get this far in my story and just delete it because who wants to hear me this drama. But I am going to push forward because for some reason. Mainly because I am high as shit. In fact I need a cigarette I will brb.

Ok I am back. Where were we? Hand washing. Oh yes I definitely did that. I was terrified of germs and especially the thought of them being on my toys. In addition to this my grandmother (same one I was visiting in NY past away). Ever since that moment I have also been obsessed with death and dying.....

Even now just writing that part tears swell in my eyes. She was my best friend. Every time she came to visit I got spoiled rotten and I loved every second of it. She made me feel like I was a prince or someone very special. If there was a toy I wanted she bought it! We used to always go to the toy store when she would visit (Toy's R Us). 

Even though I was only a child when she passed away I can recall the exact moment when my father told me she was gone. I was playing a formula one racing game and my dad was behind me sitting on the couch watching. I got like 3rd place or some shit and I was pumped up  being like 4 years old. My dad was pumping me up as well and then he told me to sit on the couch because he needed to talk to me. 

I instantly was stricken with fear. God that fear. He looked me in the eyes and we both began crying at the same time. He explained to me that she passed away from an aneurysm in her brain. 

After I learned about what it felt like to lose a loved one my mind fixated on death and especially on my mother as she is to this day the person I feel closest with. I began having panic attacks at night, unable to sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about what happens when we die? Would I never see my mother again?

So blah blah blah I have seen therapist all my life...... Always on medication even in middle/high school I was on something like;

Valium
Generic SSRI
Ambien

Funny thing was I was a straight edge kid all the way up until the time I killed myself at age 24. Smoked weed like twice once at age 15 and once at age 22. 

I was like that because I wanted to be a fighter pilot as a child. Watched too much Top Gun and my dad is a commercial pilot. Some psychologist told me once that 80% of pilots exhibit symptoms of hypo-mania, fun fact. I quickly realized that my vision was way to shitty to be a pilot. So then I changed my mind to becoming an FBI agent when I was like 13. 

^This later turned out to be a REALLY dumb ass idea because while I loved the investigative side of things there is no way in hell I was going to be able to handle the anxiety ridden anarchy of patrol duty.

So yeah once I got to college things began to settle. I partied (drank) and developed ulcerative colitis. I was living with my buddies and wasting my life on WoW. I was fat as hell but I got in shape while in college. Never got laid and always felt like a loser because of it lawl. 

I did well in college graduated with a 3.3/3.5 gpa or some shit. I did get a 4.0 my last two semesters which was cool because it put me on the dean's list of scholars. I also did a pretty cool law enforcement internship. 

After I graduated I started applying for all federal law enforcement jobs I could find. I didn't want to work for a local agency and the fact that in my state you have to self sponsor yourself through the academy (without the guarantee of a job after graduation) continued to deter my interest in local departments.

Eventually I got an interview with the Secret Service and since I don't want the feds up my ass I am just going to leave that process as classified. I failed the polygraph because I couldn't sleep for two days before it and my anxiety was off the charts. They offered to re-test me but I knew if I couldn't handle the stress of that stupid test. Which indeed I was 100% truthful on then what right did I have to protect the PoTUS. 

My fellow officers couldn't count on someone like me. 

This sense of failure drove me into a great depression.... I moved back home and dwelled in my old room spending my unemployed days playing league of legends and as luck would have it, World of Warcraft. 

I was working at UPS as a seasonal helper and basically felt so lost like such a failure that I lined up all my medications and then I took my 1911 out of the case pulled a round out of a clip and said to my self:

""I can keep taking these medications for the rest of my life or I can take this one bullet and be free forever"" 

I couldn't stop thinking about my mom at my funeral so that stopped me. But during all this time my sister's drug habit had revealed its ugly head. 

I knew in college that she had gotten into my moms meds a few times but one time when I was in her room helping my mom look for drugs I found the key to my moms safe in my sisters pillow case. 

We then found out about her roxycodone addiction and that she had been stealing stuff from our house left and right and pawning it at local pawn shops. 

Shit the bitch stole and pawned my mothers 25 year anniversary ring.

Eventually my sister stole my Alienware laptop which had a bunch of classified files on with regard to the internship I did in college, as well as all of my school work/resumes etc.... etc........

Angry beyond belief I stormed down the stairs with a knife and when my mom stopped me hypothetically someone yelled ""Tell me why I shouldn't slit that bitch from ear to ear"". 

I love my sister. I swore an oath on the day she was born to protect her. I swore from that day that I would give my life for her. Then she became a monster.

I got in the car drove to the parking lot of where I had been working at the time and tried to settle down. I was so tired I just wanted to go to sleep, but I was soooooo pissed off that I couldn't.

I took my Xanax, Lunesta, Lamictal drank a little bottle of absinthe and started drinking hydromet syrup until I passed out. I knew I was at the risk of over dosing but I didn't care. I even wrote a note that said ""If found dead, this wasn't a suicide I just wanted to sleep"". Somehow I ended up finding an 'escort' online and making a visit to her hotel room. 

Something I have done since which I am way not proud of. Not with the same one even. Massage parlors, erotic hair cuts. I have done some fucked up shit. 

Shit this has been a long winded rant and I really don't feel like writing anymore. 

Anyway I started experimenting with spice about 1.5 years ago and had a bad panic attack. Started smoking regular trees to help with my anxiety. It really has helped.... in some ways or is that just the drugs talking? Who knows.......

Anyway I have a few different personas I use when I visit these escorts as well. 

AMA if you want, idgaf.

Oh and I tried to become a mental health counselor to try and help people like me but the grad school basically told me I was too crazy to help the crazy people."
z6jqu,1,2012-09-01,Totally cracked out girl in my apartment. I have no idea what to do with her. Please help.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z6jqu/totally_cracked_out_girl_in_my_apartment_i_have/,"Sorry if this isn't exactly the correct subreddit for this, but it seemed like the past chance at getting a response quickly. Reddit knows everything. So, yesterday I'm meeting my buddy on campus. Says he's hanging out with some girl and to find him. I get there and there is this sort of jittery girl of 24 years hanging out with him (whom he just met). She seems friendly and highly intelligent. Says she's here to scope out an internship program at the hospital and is planning to apply for a PhD in biochemistry. Drinking coffee. The three of us meet up with another female friend and go eat Chinese food at the beach. She's slamming successive energy drinks. She bails as soon as we get there and says somebody is coming to get her. We don't see anyone, but she leaves anyway.

A few hours later she calls us and wants to know what we're up to. My friend said something about hanging earlier. Except now my friend suddenly has to bail to go take care of his sick sister, and the other girl had to go for some other reason. So suddenly I'm all alone with this girl, and she explains that she needs me to drive her to go get a key from some guy whose lettering her stay in his place. I spend an hour and half waiting in a parking lot behind Dunkin Donuts. She walks off because she says she has to meet him behind 711. I wait where I am. I get a call from some thug sounding guy who asks if she has his money (she used my cell phone to call him). I want to get in my car and drive, but her purse is in my car. She comes back says she couldn't find him. FYI, I think she wanted painkillers because she mentioned she needed those later for her pains that were a result of some fall down a stairs.

So obviously she was trying to do some kind of drug deal and it fell through. So now that she can't stay at his place (couldn't meet him for the key, as was the original story), she asks if we can hang out in this hookah bar for a bit while she calls some friends and finds a place she can crash. She tries to no avail. Also, she's slamming these energy packet things. As sketchy as this all sounds, she doesn't seem like a bad person. Highly, highly intelligent.. probably gifted, which engenders some sympathy with me. Well, now it's almost midnight and she has nowhere to go and I'm getting tired. I say she can sleep at my place, and I can give her some Valium to help her sleep. I hid away all the little things with value just to be sure, and she doesn't seem interested in robbing or harming me. Just trying to offer her a hot shower and a couch or bed (I take the other) to sleep it off. Well she didn't sleep at all, and was just pottering about all night. I'm seeing some evidence of OCD or something because my bathroom is all organized (first with my stuff alone, now with all of her stuff). She spent most of the night in there, I suppose because she didn't want to disturb me with the light on. See, she doesn't seem like a bad person. Anyway, it's morning now and I come down stairs to find my can of ground coffee open and empty. I think she was eating it with a spoon or something. So I need to start my day soon and she still has nowhere to go. Apparently she lives about 40 minutes from here at her parents house, but they're on vacation and won't be back until the following day. This means I have to do something with her. And also I'd prefer she doesn't die and stuff. I checked her pulse and it was pretty fast. Not like running from a T-rex fast, but definitely a great deal higher than I would like mine at 7am. 

So my questions are 1) WTF is going on with this girl? 2) Why is she consuming so much caffeine? and 3) How to I get myself out of this situation? 

FYI. I did not have sex with her, try to have sex with her, or anything like like that."

I eventually want to move out of India. I'd like some general advice with building up a good résumé over the next four years. 

I realise how important a summer internship is - unfortunately, my uni only gives us 15 days vacation between semesters, assuming I can even FIND an internship. I'm very depressed with the system, which seems more focused on making code monkeys rather than people who can actually think. What is some useful and INTERESTING stuff I can work on, parallel with getting my degree? (I AM very interested in CS, I love programming - unlike maybe 70% of my class). Also, what sort of stuff do American universities look at? I'd like to keep tuition costs to a minimum, get a few scholarships if possible.

This probably sounds like more of a rant than anything, and I sound like a stereotypical douchey college kid with an overblown superiority complex - but I'm really frustrated and depressed, seeing so many thousands of people - including my best friends - get into streams they hate (read: engineering/CS), just for the promise of a nice job and an arranged marriage 10 years down the line. And nobody CARES about anything - not the students, not the professors, not the companies, nobody has any passion. The system is more focused on giving marks to the students who mug up the most - but then again, that's one of the hallowed traditions of Indian education."

[1\) Do you feel like the job makes you less scared of your own death?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rclq?context=5)|2) When picking up a body, ""We'll take good care of him/her"" I try to stay away from, ""He's in a better place now."" I don't believe in heaven so I just feel weird saying it.
[2\) Are there sort of catch-phrases that you use to comfort people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rclq?context=5)|3) I was always curious about it in High School and when I graduated I just went to school for it on a whim. The more I learned the more I liked it.
[3\) What got you interested in the job? Anything that you really like about the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rclq?context=5)|3.5) Being able to help people in what's probably the worst moments of their lives. Whenever someone comes up to me with tears in their eyes and hugs me and shakes my hand thanking me for giving them closure...it really does feel good.
[4\) Were you squeamish at first, or can you still be sometimes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rclq?context=5)|4) At the very beginning I was. But the schooling takes care of that. First night in embalming lab was a lady that was in a car accident and launched out of her front windshield.
[5\) Cremation or burial, or being set in amber or taxidermied?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rclq?context=5)|5) I'm always back and forth on this. Right now, I'd say cremation. 
[Are there any conditions in which you simply cannot allow an open casket funeral?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61qyrv?context=5)|It depends I guess. We had a person who died in a nasty car accident and on top of that had a full autopsy, so needless to say they were pretty messed up. The family INSISTED on an open casket and in situations like that you have to be honest with them and say something like, ""We'll try our best with restoring and embalming him and we'll let you know how everything goes by the end of the day.""
 |That particular case ended up being open casket. Dude actually looked pretty good (all things considered) 
[My sister-in-law committed suicide (gun to temple\) and sat in her car, in the hot texas sun for 24-hours before being found. my mother-in-law insisted on a private viewing. they told us the same thing. it was horrible. :\ she didn't look like the same person at all. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c620sve?context=5)|Yeh, that is unfortunate. Anything involving trauma to the head or face is very tough for a funeral director. We all look different when we die, regardless what the cause of death was. So when I'm embalming people, I really have no reference as to what they actually looked like. It can be tough...

Don't get me wrong, there have been some sad moments but I've never full out cried. Saddest day for me personally was when a 19 year old kid came in to make arrangements for his dad that died out of state. 
[Hey, my sister in law is a janitor at a funeral home who is totally into the zombie craze.  I'm going to prank the shit out of her.  Would she get fired?

You should go into the funeral home and steal a body when shes not around and then put it in the back seat of her car.
 |But seriously don't do that. 
[My friend, Frank Reynolds, asks ""You bang the dead bodies?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61wa4x?context=5)|Nah. I'm not even banging living bodies right now.

Solid mahogany casket and a bronze burial vault. I know what you're thinking, and I agree with you. It's ridiculous.
 |Also in case you're wondering I don't make any commissions. Strictly salary.
[Man, it must be a humbling experience to see people spend that much money on the deceased. But I can understand why they would want to spend money on someone that close to them, but still, that's a lot of money haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rc8z?context=5)|They paid in cash too &gt;.&gt;

It smells horrible. And one time they absolutely butchered a body on us. They didn't use sterile instruments for the autopsy and gave the  body whats known as ""Tissue gas."" Really really bad stuff. They also cut the left common carotid artery almost all the way up the neck. Not sure if it was an accident or whatever but I was not a happy camper.
[How do you go about dressing up the decedents, since they're all stiff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61vigl?context=5)|It's hard dressing them. We don't cut clothes either. You just have to lift them up with one hand and slip the clothes on.
[What is the embalming process like? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61vigl?context=5)|Embalmings not that bad. You have to make sure the body is positioned the right way on the table and you'll be fine. Once the embalming fluid sets in, the body is going to become hard and it's not going to break position. The actual process is typically just one incision above the right clavicle and then fishing for the right common carotid artery. Raise that up, cut a slit into it and put the arterial tube in and start shooting down into the body.

[Why do funerals cost so much? What is the average profit do you make a week? How long does it take to embalm a whole body?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61rbpd?context=5)|It's hard to explain why funerals cost so much. A funeral home operates differently from most normal businesses. There's no guarantee of steady income for the funeral home owner. So what I guess I'm trying to say is when you pay that 10,000 dollar funeral bill a good part of that money is going to pay for the funeral home's overhead. There are other reasons too but that's a big factor in things.
 |It's hard to say how much business we do dollar wise in a week. We've gone weeks without any deaths and we've had other weeks were it's just nonstop. But if you're talking me personally, I make the same amount every week regardless of what's going on.
 |To answer your embalming question, it varies by body. But anywhere from an hour and a half to two and a half hours. 
[It's not steady income when your Clients are dying to get in there?!  Sorry i'll see myself out. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61wtef?context=5)|[Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obKLdou0LH0)
[So what you're saying is...funeral homes aren't assured of a steady income?

[That's utterly fascinating.

[What kind of prep goes into the bodies before they can be veiwed? Any differences for prep between open casket and cremation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61qlud?context=5)|Huge difference. For a direct cremation you honestly don't have to do anything preparation wise. If the deceased had a pace-maker or other battery powered medical device it needs to be removed before the cremation can take place, and that's just one incision on the chest.
 |For an open casket viewing the whole body is washed, basic sanitary care (cleaning fingernails etc...) embalmed, dressed, casketed, and finally cosmetized.
 |And if they were in any sort of accident then we have to get into using wax for restorative work but that's a whole other thing, and I honestly don't have much experience working with wax. 
[Do you guys always at least try to get a photo of the deceased, so you know how to best ""cosmetize"" them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61ynio?context=5)|We usually don't have a photo to go by which is why situations like that occur.
[An old friend of mine died; he was a true redneck.  His hair was always a mess and his beard scraggly.

 |Embalming bodies with a damaged circulatory system is a pain in the ass. Instead of a one point injection using the carotid artery, typically we'd have to make incisions in the arms and legs and raise the corresponding arteries to inject (axillary for arms and femoral for legs) and that's whats called a 6 point injection. 
[A friend of mine recently decided that she wanted to be a mortician and at first I couldn't believe it and could not understand why anyone would choose this career.

I have a lot of books that may be outdated, I wonder if they change the test too much to reflect new material?

Even if you get a question you don't know, you'll be able to rule out which answers are wrong because you can recognize key words. It helped me out a lot, and also your books probably aren't all that out dated. I really don't think they update boards all that much.

I notice that when I'm near the coffin, most of the times you don't smell anything, but on rare occasions theres this weird smell. A couple of weeks ago, when it was very hot in my country, we had a coffin which smellt awful. The thing I can compare it most with is sour milk or something. My questions are: is that the body you smell or something else (chemicals to preserve the body for example\) and is this something the director is responsible for? Thank you for this ama.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61w6wp?context=5)|It could be a few different things. I suspect it could be a tiny bit of feces falling out of the bodies rectum. That shit happens pretty often. Or it could be that a limb didn't take the embalming fluid very well and is starting to decompose, and that's not always the directors fault. 
[How does your job relate to your personal life and style? Do you consider yourself 'weird'? Are you interested in 'darker' stuff, horror movies, collect skulls, anything like that?

Also I love metal, and I played guitar in a couple metal bands that never went anywhere. 
[I hope I'm not too late to the party for this. What do you do when you get a body that was discovered weeks or even a month after the time of death? Does that qualify for an automatic cremation?

One time we went ahead with the embalming and only allowed a private viewing. The other time the family just wanted direct cremation. Which is good...the body was pretty badly decomped at that point.
[What are your/the industry's views?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c62alka?context=5)|It depends on the funeral home. The place I did my internship at allowed me to come in looking scruffy with relatively long hair and stuff. The place I'm at now on the other hand makes me shave every day and get a haircut every 2 weeks.
[Edit: Also, any tips on getting an internship at a funeral home after schooling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c62alka?context=5)|But I wouldn't worry too much about it.

The funeral home I work at is family owned and we've never been dogged by corporate to sell. Even then I don't even think corporate funeral homes are bad. I'd work for one. 
[Sorry to ask another question. How about the restoration of the bodies? They often talk about things that seem rather unorthodox, like cans of cat food under the body to make it look more life-like. How much goes into restoring the bodies? And whats the best restorative work you have seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c61wzhm?context=5)|Ask away man. The best restoration I saw actually came out of a different funeral home. It was some politician lady who was in a head on car crash and her face got absolutely destroyed. But because she was a public figure the family wanted an open casket viewing so the funeral home restored this ladies entire face. I know the directors that did it and they took pictures of the whole process to show students, absolutely incredible. They used a series of hidden sutures and wax and she looked ended up looking pretty good.
 |We do unorthodox things I guess. When an autopsy is performed the persons throat is removed so I like rolling up some cotton and sticking in the person throat and then taking another sheet of cotton and rolling it into a ball to make an adams apple. We'll also take empty embalming fluid bottles and put them under their feet to prop them up and stuff like that. While we're dressing them we'll take pieces of tissue paper and stick it under parts of their jacket to make them look ""fuller""
 |A lot of funeral service is strictly visual. And sometimes you just gotta do some weird stuff to get the job done I guess. 
[Do you bury them with that stuff in the casket, or is there a time period in which you can remove it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z5yrv/i_know_these_have_been_done_to_death_but_ive_got/c620k1f?context=5)|Sometimes we get the chance to remove it but we mostly leave it in.

[I'd like to either be cremated or buried in a very simple box.  I used to be weirded out by being in the ground and worms and bugs coming in, but over time I like the idea of being ""recycled"".  I don't want to be buried in some sealed coffin though (e.g.: lead lined or something\).

zas93,2,2012-09-03,Teachers: How can I make the best impression as a Student Intern when I visit my 3rd grade class tomorrow? ,Elasti-Girl,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/zas93/teachers_how_can_i_make_the_best_impression_as_a/,"So tomorrow is going to be the day I  just visit my classroom where I am placed: a 3rd grade, highly Hispanic populated, ESL classroom. Wednesday will be my actual start day. I read the thread about the teacher interviewing her student teacher tomorrow and I was scared that was me, so I read every suggestion and question that was asked and tried to answer them myself. They were extremely helpful. 

But now I want to ask what can I do to show my eagerness and my devotion and my yearn to learn as much as I can from the very start? Some of my ideas so far:

- introduce myself to the class, talk about my background, why I am there, what I will do, show and tell my excitement; ask my friend to translate some of my introduction to Spanish on paper so that I can read that to the class as well. 
- bring cookies/cupcakes. (What is the rule about bringing snacks now? Does it have to be store bought and packaged?) 
- bring a book to read aloud (if permitted) possibly a dual language book, in Spanish. (my accent is terrible and I don't know many words but I want to show that I am willing to try. Is this a good idea?)

If you have any other suggestions, PLEASE let me know what I can do. This is going to be my second internship, it will not be my student teaching which will be in the spring. If all goes well, fingers crossed, and I like my experience at this school and classroom, I will have the option of staying there in the Spring which would be amazing for my transition and learning experience.

Thank you very much!"
zagri,21,2012-09-03,It seems like everything I've done is undone,holdmykeysimgoingin,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/zagri/it_seems_like_everything_ive_done_is_undone/,"So I just got back from a wonderful internship on the West Coast in LA. I've always had horrible social anxiety and I decided putting myself out on a limb would be a wonderful way to build character, and it was. I had an amazing time, learned so much about myself, and changed so much as a person. I was right where I wanted to be on my road to recovery.

The problem is that now I am back on the east coast. Settling back into the same environment, it's almost like I settled back into the same old person I was before I left. My old thought habits, my old self-image, they all overpower me. I was very calm, relaxed, and optimistic in LA. However, back here I had my first anxiety attack in a while before I had to move back in to college. I'm also feeling the depression creeping back in. The critic in me, having been mute for a while, has found it's voice again and is picking up right where it left off. I forgot who and how to be the person I was this summer. **Seeing the same people again and the same environment again is somehow reinforcing my old self.**

I keep trying to be positive, but I just can't. My positive thoughts don't affect my emotions and anxiety at all, and trying to think positive just makes me feel more uncomfortable and anxious. I don't know what to do."
z9dp8,1,2012-09-02,Getting an internship without a degree.,N0_Context,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/z9dp8/getting_an_internship_without_a_degree/,"I am currently not going to school for cs (school for me now is prohibitively expensive), but I'd like to pursue a career in programming/cs. It seems like an internship would be the best way to get my foot in the door, but when looking at the offerings, most of them seem to require going to school at the same time or being enrolled in a program. 

My question is somewhat open ended. Would it be reasonable to apply for those like one would apply for a job, relying on the strength of your project portfolio? Are there any places where an internship can be acquired where that is not a strict requirement? Or would it be possible/advisable to skip the internship and attempt to go straight to a job, again leading with the portfolio?

Thanks for any advice."

Currently I'm 23 years old and trying to finish college. I did pretty well in high school and managed to get into college and ended up choosing an engineering major without giving too much thought, just because math and physics were my favorite subjects. The college I go to is in my hometown, so I still live with my parents and in the country I live you don't get into huge debts to get into college, so this all led to a situation where I never really needed to get out of my comfort zone.

All this while having social anxiety. Never outgoing in middle school and high school, I was pretty much just the smart kid. I managed to get a group of friends who went through pretty much all of middle school and high school with me, so at least I never had that problem of being bullied or not having any friends, but just because I pretty much grew up with them. 

Never had a girlfriend or even tried to pick up a girl because of how anxious I'd get, always finding a way to rationalize a reason to let it go and maybe next time I'd try something. Parties were a nightmare, the few times I'd go to one, the only thing going through my mind is how to leave as soon as possible.

Then college came and I got worse. Never made any friends, just some acquaintances because I'd avoid going out. Got really fat until last year when I pretty much needed to change all my eating habits. Getting less and less motivated in college because I was never sure if that was what I really wanted or if I could pull through.
Classes were easier because I'd just sign up for them online and show up and study alone for tests but still had a lot of anxiety every time I needed to speak in public, to the point of barely being able to brush my teeth because I felt like throwing up. Without the motivation I was a mediocre student pretty much in all of my classes.

But then came the part of needing internships and building up a resume and this is where I'm fucking everything up. I spent the last 5 years dreading internship interviews and would again rationalize some excuse to avoid it. That it was too soon to get an internship, that I'd need time to study for hard classes, that my classmates that were applying were better anyway so I shouldn't bother...Until I ran out of classes and just needed the experience to graduate. I couldn't even apply anywhere even though I needed to, took me almost a month to gather the courage to start a word document to type my resume, even though it is pretyt much empty. So last semester at the last minute I got something in a college lab with a pretty chill professor because a classmate suggested it. So he recommended me somethings to do, even though I could tell he was doing that just to help me out and never really needed it. And still I went home and started doing, but never feeling it was good enough to go back and show him, and the more the time passed the more I thought I needed to do and felt anxious about going back. Long story short, I spent the semester doing pretty much nothing worthwhile. So now here I am with a new semester starting up and I have to clean up my own mess and stop being a piece of shit.

At the end of July I went to a psychiatrist by myself and told her this stuff and she diagnosed me with depression and social anxiety, prescribing some meds and that I should see a therapist too. I didn't want to start the medication without talking to my family first about everything, so of course here we are at the beginning of september, I avoided this completely and I'm pretty sure the prescriptions are not even valid anymore and I was too scared to take the meds anyway.

I feel like my life has been falling apart while everyone else thinks I have it all figured out, an aspiring engineer about to graduate and everything while I know I'm messing everything up. And the worst thing is that I don't think social anxiety and depression are things people get, and telling all this I would just seem like some whiney spoiled dude who can't man up, and even I doubt I'm not just trying to make excuses for myself.

I don't really know what I'm trying to accomplish here, just needed to vent, I guess. I don't really feel like proof reading this, so sorry if this is terrible to read if you made it this far."

I already bought the previous one but it might not be too late to cancel, but I just wanted to see if anyone can confirm because I know barely anything when it comes to laptops. If the performance is going to be the same on the Intel machine, then I'll just stick with that.

zc9q9,1,2012-09-04,My Boss is (possibly) terminally ill and the staff can't continue to keep the company afloat in her absence. What do we do???,thisisjustterrible,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zc9q9/my_boss_is_possibly_terminally_ill_and_the_staff/,"Okay, so here's what's happening...

I have be a ""freelance"" employee of a very small (less than 5 staff) office for about 2.5 years. Earlier this year I went from a full time to part time position because I got another job. I put freelance in quotes above because we have never been treated as freelancers despite that being our title. Basically she called us that for taxes and so she didn't have to offer us any benefits. Why stay in such a job? It was in my field, which has freakishly limited opportunities where I live, I'm newer to the industry, and I needed the work.

The set up of the company is The Owner, and below her The Assistants. The Owner is the figure head of the company. None of The Assistants has the credentials or professional title that The Owner has. None of The Assistants has worked with her for more than three years. 

Since early this year, The Owner has gotten sick. Very sick. She won't tell any of us the full details of her condition or what if any prospect there is of recovery. I gather from her vague answers to questions (or avoidance of them) that it is possible that she is terminally ill. There is a myriad of things wrong with her it would seem. She hasn't been in the office more than 5 times in the last 6 months. She stopped talking to anyone on the phone as well (this appears to be in part because of her condition) and now only communicates via email, and the majority of her emails for months and months were full of vitriol and just the meanest things, quite out of character. I'm the only person that has seen her in about 3 months, only because I went to her house to bring her mail (so I can verify she really is sick). She talked to me a bit. She is pretty much going through every stage of grief. She is angry all the time, she is really young and most of the health stuff shouldn't be happening to someone her age. 

But we The Assistants are in quite the pickle. Well not me so much, I have the opportunity to go full time at my other job, so my only vested interest is the well-being of the Owner and other Assistants. We want to be there to help The Owner, but she is making it practically impossible. She is frustrated that the company isn't bringing in money, but she keeps giving discounts and none of us is in the position to pursue new clients because we all lack the credentials. We aren't comfortable making sales calls because we feel pretty morally icky selling our company's services when we can't guarantee the longevity of the company. She has put the entire responsibility of the company in the hands of her one full time Assistant, a girl with less than a year's experience in our industry. And then she wonders why the Assistant is stressed and upset and wants to pursue other job options. It's their right to know what the future of the company is so if they need to look for other work they can. 

We have all given her so much and want so badly to help her because we like her and all have a lot of time and energy invested in this small company. 

Her full time Assistant just put in her two weeks notice. I'm actually at a point were I am working almost freelance-ish, so I can just walk away. But we still feel this obligation to help. What do you do when a small business has to close because the owner is sick? What if she can't pay her medical bills? Has this happened to anyone else? Anyone had to close a business due to illness? I'm saying close because at this point she has no one to run the office for her. And I cannot imagine her interviewing and training new people, she's too sick. She's known that the full time Assistant has been wanting to look into other areas of our business for a while, really since she started working with us (she started as an intern but this was actually never her career path of choice, just sort of a foot in the door, God bless her for sticking it out as long as she has). 

We can't just wash our hands of it, is there anything we can do to make this situation better?

TL;DR Boss of a very small business is possibly terminally ill and the staff can no longer keep the company afloat in her absence. How can we help?"

First of all, I'm European, male, 26 years old, just gotten my Master's in Computer Sciences 2 months ago. I took 2 years longer than the rest of my peers, never really had straight A's and had to deal with a massive burnout in the last few months. Now I'm supposed to look for a job, but I haven't dared to send out my CV yet, as I'm just not convinced I'm really good at anything in this field. I know lots of things and can have very insightful moments, but I equally mess up immensely from time to time (something bad happened on my internship), so that has had a terrible effect on my confidence to apply for jobs requiring a MSc. degree. As you might have guessed, my self confidence is very, very low and that episode on the internship really shook me. IMO it wasn't even my fault, I got the blame though. Bad communication, even worse planning by the manager and him yelling obscenities instead of finding out what was going wrong were the root causes IMO. Also, I've only recently begun learning how to drive a car, while I'm making good progression, I can't yet go everywhere I want to go.

My skills are the following (From strongest to weakest):

 
C#, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, XML, Java, Android, HTML5, JSON, REST and SOAP webservices, C++, Wordpress, Drupal, QT, WP7.5

Since my internship my main focus has shifted towards Android/Java on Ubuntu rather than web development.

Furthermore I do know my way around in OO-programming and have a good understanding of Software Design Patterns and Project Management.


From the looks of it, it's more a psychological issue than a skill-related issue, anyone else have experience with this? How do you deal with it?


Any advice is welcome!"

From there on everything between us went straight downhill. It began with her doubting of being still in love with me followed by me losing faith in our whole relationship.
Long story short: we broke up 2 and a half months into her internship.
A fews days after that i started to realise this was a big mistake (at least for me) and now I'm going to try getting her back when her internship ends next month.

Within my circle of friends this created some kind of controversy since some of my friends fully support my attempts, others believe that getting back together never ends well and the rest stands in between.. That's why I decided to ask you reddit:



Do you think it is possible to get back together with a former love? Is it in the long term?

Did you ever try to start a 'comeback'? How did it work out so far?

I went to a different school 2 years into our relationship and we stayed together through it. I just moved back for us to be in the same city.

Moving back I figured things would change. We'd see each other so much more, be happier together. Really, nothing has changed. She's busy with grad school and I've got an internship. Even though We have time, we have seen each other maybe 5-6 times in the past few weeks. 

I am a mostly clean person, but not perfect, but lately I have been thinking the past week or so that I don't think I could live comfortably with her forever. Things need to be done her way or no other way. I once put my shoe on the bed rail on top of the bed skirt to tie it and that sparked a huge uproar about how I am a ""filthy person"" because I put my shoes on the bed. I was told to move my shoes off the ottoman despite the fact that her roommate's dog lays and licks the ottoman constantly.

I am a dog person, I have to have a dog when I am able to get one. You dog people will understand you can't just get any dog, it has to be the right kind of dog for you. It has to be an inside/outside dog because nothing is better than having a dog (or any animal) with you hanging out watching tv. She is completely against having a dog because it will shed. She's more worried about cleaning where as I don't care if I'm covered in dog hair because I have the company of an animal who doesn't judge. 

 Little things like that add up and make me tiptoe around when I do things so I don't upset her but then I can't live the way I would normally live.

My grades aren't fantastic, but I'm working on them so I can try to land an internship.  That said, I'm looking at building a portfolio or gaining some knowledge in a CS sub-field that pays well.  What are some highly desired skills in the Computer Science job market?   

My coding background has been entirely Java and I some experience with Unix."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How were you informed that China considered you an Enemy of the People? E-mail? Letter? Text Message? An arrow scroll shot into your intern's chest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63flxa?context=5)|People's Daily Newspaper publicly identified me as ""an enemy of the people"".    
[What do you think drives US Government as a whole? The President, Congress, Senate, Public interest, Party interest, Corporate interest, etc.?  Who or what has the most of decision power or influence which changes the future of the US?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63etx8?context=5)|People - definitely.  Never doubt that.  I have seen a congressman make a 3 star general wait in the lobby because the head of the local PTA was visiting.  
[Knowing what you know, are you more hopeful for the future or fearful? And is there a mind blowing tidbit of knowledge that you actually are able to share. (Just a small tiny crumb will do\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63eqv1?context=5)|Fearful in the short term (2 decades); hopeful after that.  Global reach is expanding.  There is going to be some friction.  With destructive power going up that means people are going to die.  But hopefully, after some time and exposure we all learn to live with each other a bit more.  As long as people keep thinking every meteorite shower is a message from God we are going to have problems.
[Is being declared an enemy of an entire county good or bad for a pickup line?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63em6z?context=5)|Bad if you are picking up Chinese.
[If you're allowed to say or speculate, what do you think the  X-37B was doing up there for a year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63e74l?context=5)|Sorry, I'm not going to touch that one.
[What does it feel like to be considered an 'enemy' by an entire country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63fn4z?context=5)|They have no sense of humor.
[In your opinion, does China want a peaceful, neighborly USA, or does it want to conquer it by long term attrition and side orders of investment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63dwoh?context=5)|Side orders of investment (LOL).  Great comment.  I don't think anyone wants conflict.  The issue is going to be whether we can manage a peaceful rise of China.  Remember there are factions in EVERY government.  Military, diplomatic, intelligence, legislative, etc.  It's like a car speeding down the highway with everybody grabbing at the wheel. Sometimes you slide into conflict; sometime you can manage your way out of it.
[What do you think the next major event between super powers will be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63dvcb?context=5)|Wow, that's the toughest one so far.  I'm not so sure it is a superpower issue.  Clearly the rise of China is a big issue.  Friction between the developed and developing world (exacerbated by extremist religions) is going to be with us for a while.      
[Most people believe China will become a superpower soon, however some historians think because of the high income inequality (along with a range of other reasons\) China's growth is unsustainable and will crash soon. What do you think is the most likely?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63um6i?context=5)|If I knew that.......  Seriously, that is the big question.  Most of China's leadership is clueless on the answer.  But I'll give you the confidential words of a very high ranking official ""We are going to do whatever works and we're going to call it Chinese socialism"".
[I like thinking about the difference in meaning between ""religious extremist"" and ""extremist religions"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63t8o3?context=5)|It is a question of scale. Religious extremist is an individual.  Extremist religion is not.
[How long till we go back to the moon? What about colonization of other moons/planets in the solar system? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63fwfh?context=5)|I've actually had this discussion with Buzz Aldrin and a group of congressmen one evening.  Hopefully we go in the next decade (+).  I think Mars will be the following decade.  
[Multi part question. A\) What do you think of the decline of NASA (budget cuts and closing of the shuttle program\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63epyc?context=5)|A. I think I'm one of the few space supporters that is not worried about the NASA budget. Considering we are coming out of a recession they did pretty well.  Also, there is enough waste in the space community to make up for the budget cuts (and more)
[B\) What do you see is the biggest threat to the United States?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63epyc?context=5)|B. WMD in the hands of radicals. Is it going to bring down the whole nation? No. But how do you explain that to a million people in a city.
[C\) Do you have an opinion on anonymous and the other activist communities that have been popping up that you can share? if so do you think they will be a large force in changing america?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63epyc?context=5)|C. Interesting question.  Probably.  There are a whole lot of groups and people that are attacking infrastructure.  That is not good for a society.  I'm really a believer they needs to be addressed.  Their actions threaten us all.
[With A, What waste would you cut?  With C, What about all the good they do (not talking about wikileaks and trapwire and all that, but about their takedown of pedophile rings and all that\). Do you believe that it is okay to have a balance of good and bad? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63ewtv?context=5)|Synergize programs between NASA centers.  Synergize technology developments with DoD.
[But how do you get NASA and DoD to cooperate? They've had several high profile failures on joint ventures in recent memory (see NPOESS in 2010\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63qere?context=5)|Dod Appropriations Bill; NASA appropriations bill.  Clear NASA people.
[Aside from China, are there any other nations you believe potentially could rise to superpower status in the next few decades?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63friu?context=5)|Superpower - certainly Russia is getting enough money to elevate themselves.  But a superpower is more than an economy and military.  Great nations must export ideas.  That is ultimately why the Soviet Union crumbled.  People just didn't like what they had to offer.  This is also China's problem for the future.
[The more we use them for cheap labor, the sooner we are enabling them to surpass us by not only pumping money into their economy and out of ours, but every worker we hire there must meet a certain level of qualification. We are building them up from the bottom and middle out while lying to our own country with this trickle down bullshit.  How long can this continue before chinas middle class becomes as complacent as our and they start exporting jobs to here for cheap labor from our growing number of slums.  Isn't our education system already behind them and plenty of other countries if you don't account for college levels? How long can we do that until the affects are too difficult to reverse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63vlau?context=5)|I think they are a ways from the scenario you've developed.  The CPC has been trying very hard to develop an internal economic infrastructure to develop domestic consumer demand.  But they really don't have a middle class yet.  Our educational systems suffers but it is not because of lack of resources, teacher pay or some other crap.  We pay more per student (K-12) than any other nation.  It is a cultural issue that is hurting us.
[Interesting, I have always heard China is the poised to be the next superpower, with India starting to head in that direction.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63tb71?context=5)|Define super power for me?  Most people are very limited in their definition - GNP.  Even if China's economy surged past ours their (larger) population would (per capita) probably be making only 1/5th of what the average US workers makes.  They have a few decades before they will be a blue water navy, so they have very limited force projection capabilities. They have no appealing political model.  Certainly no judicial model anyone would wants (other than dictators).  It is anyone's guess as to what their economic model will look like.  For any country to be considered a global power all these aspects will play a role.  India is pretty far behind as well.
[I read a lot of articles and watched a few documentaries about how first world countries will ultimately end up in conflict over fresh water supply, which is obviously critical for human survival. We've already seen the impact of natural resources on international tension (primarily oil obviously\), and most of the reasoning seems sound, but I don't generally hear about people who are concerned about this.  Is this something you agree will generate political tension between major powers in the near future? If so, are you willing to say how you think that might play out? And if not, can you explain why you think it's not a valid concern? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63fd10?context=5)|Fresh water is going to be a concern for the near future. But necessity is still the mother of invention.  There has already been progress in efficiencies in desalination plants.  Australia recently contracted for 11 new ones using currants and providing electrical power as well.  I thin technology will provide a solution (mid term). 
[Http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/zeaqb/siemens_breakthrough_halves_energy_cost_of_water/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63wkko?context=5)|Told you so.
[What will be the first battle that can said to have been held ""in space""? What weapons will it involve, what will it be fought over (comm. satellites for example?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63g2qx?context=5)|We wargame this stuff all the time so I can't comment.  Sorry.
[I love wargames.  Will that be any reason for me to try a job in intelligence?  Also, I know on paper, employment and opportunity are equal, but if I'm brown or yellow, I shouldn't expect to do well working for the DoD, right?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c642meb?context=5)|Yes you should apply.  And you should expect to do well.  You will find race does not make a difference.  Something I think the institution learned over the last few decades fighting and dying next to each other.
[For future tech - How will we be getting around in 50 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63eih2?context=5)|It won't be flying cars.  Green transportation is coming into being. Legacy systems (gas pump) will slow that down a bit but eventually fuel cell cars and much more efficient solar power.
[But I want green flying cars. :( Or hoverboards. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63qftc?context=5)|No. You can only have red ones.
[Someone somewhere mentioned that the Chinese government uses students sent to the US as spies, who report back anything of value (in business and otherwise\) that they can get their hands on.  does this have any truth to it or is it just another of the internet's xenophobic conspiracy theories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63el3o?context=5)|Using students and scholars is very popular collection means for the Chinese government.  In fact, if you look at some of the academy's web sites they offer free trips to China.  You fill in the engineering project you are working.  It is pretty pervasive. 
[What is the best way, in your opinion, for science educators and advocates to convince policymakers in Washington to allocate more funding into NASA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63frb7?context=5)|Educate the next generation.  You have very limited time in the classroom so this must be done outside.  As long as Americans spend 10B a year on make up, 55B on pets, and way more on entertainment this is going to be a challenge.  This requires a cultural change.  That is why I started Galaxy Explorers www.foge.org. 
[As a pet store worker, I shall encourage my younger guests not to get that hamster but instead to get interested in spaceships and astronomy. NASA gets funding, I don't have to pick up as many bitey little fuckers, everybody wins!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63vuve?context=5)|Or just encourage them to be more than a pet store worker.
[Unfortunately, sometimes it's necessary to work such jobs in order to become more than them, as in my case. I'm paying for my post secondary education by selling hamsters. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c654ozm?context=5)|Good, then keep working and inspire the kids when you can.
[28 years? Sounds like you're up for retirement soon. What does a mandarin-speaking, space strategist, sci-fi nerd do next? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63fhg8?context=5)|Write books?  Been asking myself the same thing.  I have been teaching at Kings College in the evenings here in London.  
[I'm off to King's in a week to study War Studies and History. Excited as hell, especially for lectures such as these! Thanks for the AMA and hopefully I'll be listening to you in person soon.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63s762?context=5)|Look me up.
[What would happen to you if you attempted to enter China as an ""Enemy of the People""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63dx62?context=5)|I don't think they would let me come in. But truthfully getting out would be my greater concern.
[Could you still go to Taiwan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63rlz5?context=5)|In I studied there I am sure I would be welcome.  Also, the person who wrote the preface (Lin Chongpin) rose to be number 3 in a previous Taiwan government.  So, I think I would have friends.
[You must be up to date with all this SOPA/PIPA/Net Neutrality business. What are your thoughts regarding privacy and freedom of information concerns for users of the web and the probability of organizations like the RIAA and MPAA successfully pushing through legislation that hurts net neutrality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63fei6?context=5)|Not as up on it as I should be.  I'm generally very much against government regulating of the internet in any way.
[1\) There's the pretty commonly held belief that Sci-Fi is simply a way of predicting the future through fiction. Do you see the world of today heading towards the world of ""Edward of Planet Earth?"" How do we keep that from happening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63dxpl?context=5)|Let me address the second question first - Yes, Quantum Communications was pushed.  That's okay, but not in the twenty year time frame we were working for that problem set.  I've heard a few outlandish ones but they are so mostly for the costs, technology direction, utility, etc;  not for the physics. (seems like you've had some experience in this area?).
[2\) Can you tell us about any crazy ideas that went through the future division while you were there and were seriously considered before being shot down for one reason or another?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63dxpl?context=5)|Yes, I do see the world heading that direction.  I think education and a different value system is the only way we would avoid it.  That is SLOWLY happening but it will take time.  It is a race is some ways.
[What are your impressions on the future of cyber warfare?  Are there any good defenses for malicious programs or viruses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63egzb?context=5)|This is like the wild, wild west.  There will always be an evolving set of defenses and new offensive techniques.  I speculate this will be the future of warfare along with advanced robotics.  People are getting very tired of shedding their blood (of that of their kids/parents etc.).  We will move towards forms of conflict that allow us (everyone) to wage war with minimal loss of one's own population. Cyber is in the lead here.
[People joke a lot about Skynet, but really it's not that far off. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63eox9?context=5)|It might not be; and then fast forward two hundred years.  Think of how fast the technology is progressing now.
[Are you kidding?  What free time?  No, actually I'm a big scifi fan.  I am going to London's Star Trek Con (5 captains\) in Oct.  I like catching a scifi movie when I can.  I also squeeze in writing.  But my life is actually very busy.  Work travel, receptions, etc.  Does that answer it?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63e5la?context=5)|P.S&gt; and Next year I swear to attend Comic Con for the first time.
[I'm not asking for a prediction, but what do you think the USA's best course of action should be for the chest beating going on with Iran and Israel?  If Iran attacks first?  What about if Israel?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63ezw0?context=5)|I was never big on chest thumping.  Eventually anyone who wants to, is going to get a nuclear capability.  Nations have to start dealing with that inevitability.   
[Is there going to be a war with Iran?  Also I've been hearing about how North Korea and Iran have been working together.  Thoughts on that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63epa1?context=5)|A war with Iran; probably not. Military action? I don't think anyone really knows. There are a lot of variables in that equation. I;m not sure what is in the public arena on North Korea.
[What is your opinion on the effectiveness of Special Operating Forces in the modern war on terror? Do you have any opinion about MARSOC?  I'm hearing good things about your book on Chinese intelligence. Looking forward to reading it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63f386?context=5)|No question that SOF has become tool of choice for the near-to-mid future.  Effective and cost efficient.  I have respect and admiration for any US Marine.  You can doubt a lot in life, but you cannot doubt the abilities, drive, dedication,and faithfulness of those men and women.
[Have you ever lived in China? And what were the sources you used for your research on the Chinese Intelligence Operations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63dmmd?context=5)|I went to undergrad and did grad work on Taiwan.  I traveled in China. In my research I used open source documents, media publications, and interviews with current and former Chinese Intelligence Officer and recruited assets. 
[So, give us a spoiler of your book: are there big differences between the way they operate in Intelligence and the way Western services do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63dsk4?context=5)|Yes, very big differences.  There focus on human intelligence (HUMINT) employees many more people overwhelming counterintelligence capabilities.  In addition, there aggressive use of cyber espionage is changing the dynamics of intelligence.  
[1.\) What is the most serious threat to security both on a personal and national scale.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63fncg?context=5)|Personal - being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  You don't want to be in the city in which someone has decided to set off something bad.
[2.\) What do you believe is the largest security risk (person and national\) is on the horizon? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63fncg?context=5)|National - probably a WMD incident. It won't take down the country but it will hurt us.  This is probably the highest risk (in my opinion).  It's not that difficult and teh knowledge to do it is spreading rapidly.
[How did you piss off the Chinese?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63e9dy?context=5)|I wrote a book ""Chinese Intelligence Operations"" that exposed their operational methodologies, structure and organization, and operatives. They even listed me in the ""things to be careful of"" notice that went to Chinese studying overseas.
[I'm interested in your thoughts on Iran and Syria. Do think there will be any American intervention in Syria? Also do you believe that Israel will actually attack Iran? If so, what do you believe the consequences would be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63ecnf?context=5)|I don't think this is a good area for me to speculate.  Whatever happens is likely going to be messy. 
[Fav sci-fi books?  Have you read Peter Hamilton's stufF?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63fm4h?context=5)|No and I should.  Doug Adams is my favorite.  Of course, Arthur Clarke as well.
[What do you do in your free time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63e2rt?context=5)|Are you kidding?  What free time?  No, actually I'm a big scifi fan.  I am going to London's Star Trek Con (5 captains) in Oct.  I like catching a scifi movie when I can.  I also squeeze in writing.  But my life is actually very busy.  Work travel, receptions, etc.  Does that answer it?   
[What do you see as the greatest hurdle facing America in the coming decades with the emergence of China as an economic power?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63f4ro?context=5)|China might not be that much of an economic power.  They have a LOT of internal problems; corruption, pollution, riots (by the 10s of thousands). etc.  The biggest problem for the US is going to be adjusting to the technology that is changing our democratic way of like. i.e.  Decision making in governments is moving to local and international levels, etc. I've written on this at wordpress.
[ NOTE: I'm speaking as someone who is intrigued by a certain small group of anecdotes about technological events such as the famous instance of Washington DC airspace being penetrated by vehicles or probes that demonstrated capabilities outside contemporary aviation, in the summer of 1952 as reported in the Washington Post and commented on by the sitting President, Mr. Truman.  Since this is a documented public incident, I accept it as fact.  With that admission, I'll just cut to it: in your opinion, are off-planet cultures monitoring the United States Space Program?  Can you comment on any specific incidents or research in this area carried out  by any official body connected (or not\) to the DIA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63f3fe?context=5)|No.  Exactly what is it we have worth monitoring?  We've just made it to the Moon.  Why would anyone bother monitoring us?   
[How many redditors in this thread do you think are chinese spies?  btw i never knew about your book.  I am going to purchase it now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63fiea?context=5)|Probably none.  And thanks.  Love to hear your comments.
[Being a sci-fan fan, and involved in future tech, have you watched a series called Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex?

From there, it was a serious look at humanity to extrapolate what the future might hold.  Remember, it is a comedy as well.  And that's what I think you get when humans are influenced by all the technology that is in their future. 
[How did you get into the line of work you do with East Asian Studies degree?  Sounds like an arts degree or some other degree that typically takes you to working at starbucks forever.  Did you go to the best school? have great connections? etc.  I really want to hear your story to success.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63fk7g?context=5)|Studied in Taiwan, went to George Washington U,  Applied to CIA (worked there for 3.5 years), Got a grad degree in Strategic Intelligence from National Defense Intelligence College, went on from there.  I think it is mostly an issue of staying focused on trying to do your job and not accepting failure (once you get in).

Given the power requirements there does not seem to me any reasoning behind these ""visitations"".  I'll believe it when an astronomer claims to have been visited.

[What do you think about Raymond Kurzweil's prediction of biological immortality around 2030 and his prediction of a singularity by 2045? The merging of man and machine, with hopefully enhancement of the human body \[transhumanism\]?

This technological jump is not linear and revolutionary.  It therefore, is difficult to establish a ""due date.""
[Also, do you have any thoughts about what he calls the technology explosion based on the doubling rate of technological progress (2, 4, 8, 16, 32\) as opposed to the commonly believed ( 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\) and what role will that have on our future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63gsti?context=5)|That one is really tough.

The information one deals with is owned by the government.  It is not yours to buy, sell, write about without approval.  That being the case the Pentagon sets a bad precedent as some generals violated that rule.   
[Sitting on a 3.3 GPA with a degree in Int'l Relations. If I get all As this semester I should be able to pull a 3.5. Talked to a Colonel at length who recruits for Contractors and he was saying I should either apply to the NGA, DIA, NRO, or Air Force Intelligence. I also talked to a former Executive Manager from the NSA and she gave me the same advice. When I mentioned that it was my dream to work for the CIA, they both went to great lengths to dissuade me from joining. You worked there for 3 years and then left? What is it about the CIA that has people running?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zchnb/ive_appeared_on_nbc_abc_bbc_npr_and_testified/c63gzwy?context=5)|Nothing.  Apply to the CIA.  Maybe they know something about the DoD budget that I don't (I doubt it) but it does not look good for new hires.  Also apply to Air Force Intel (comes out of a different pot of money and is not so affected).  Try DHS, FBI, Secret Service, State, and DoE.  Try contractors that support all agencies.  Once you have a clearance it is a lot easier to move around.

I don't think anyone has a business case yet for Mach+ speeds for commercial transport.

I really love the place I work and the people I work with but I'm worried that I could be doing better. I have enough to live off of but after bills and food for 2 (which I could spend less on but I don't think I spend way too much) I usually have only about 100-200 left over.

For the two last years or so, I have been consulting providing hardware and software configuration and deployment, website design and coding, and various other IT functions for several local small businesses.

I have

zgcf3,6,2012-09-06,Falling flat on my face....,buzzmcleadfoot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zgcf3/falling_flat_on_my_face/,"So back in Dec of '11 I somehow managed to talk myself into a job I have never done before in my life, even though Im really interested in it. The title is Network Engineer.....I kinda feel silly when people ask me what I do for a living and I sorta grin and mumble under my breath ""im a (pretend) network engineer.....""

Maybe its a combination of both who im working for and the people im working with but I cant really seem to make any headway, or it could be all me, which Im readily willing to accept.  Ive been here for almost a year and I still dont understand thing one about what exactly it is Im doing here. About the only thing I do know for sure is that I love the Data and Voice side of my job....the systems side i have no interest in whatsoever. We do have a senior tech that does everything I should be doing but he usually takes over any issues that are network related. Which in a sense I dont mind, but again, if hes capable then exactly what am I doing here?

I dont want to go up to my boss and tell him all this cause I fear it may not end well, after all he did hire me on the basis of my capabilities according to my resume. Which to be fair is honest about my knowledge of certain protocols and etc but what I left out is that I have never done any of those things in an enterprise environment. I cant and have no interest in hiding behind other techs who do actually know what they are doing, for fear of it hurting my career in the long run. 

The other part of my issue is confidence, ive always felt that I missed something by not getting an intern job after I graduated college and now im paying for it by struggling with my new job. I never got an intern job cause i switched into a computer career in my mid 30s and had a family to support so I couldnt afford to take a 10dollar an hour job. But then again... I know many of you IT professionals have never taken an intern job and flourished in your careers. So what gives with me?

So Reddit, heres my question.....
What do I do?....look for a different job or position that will allow me the freedom to expand my field experience? 
Or do I stick it out for as long as im willing and they will have me?

Any ideas or suggestions or anecdotes are much appreciated...

[How do you think some of the most terrible movies actually make it to the big screen?  I would assume at some point SOMEONE read the scripts and thought, ""Wow, that's awful.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xoeb?context=5)|Funny you should say that...  we interviewed Jason Statham, and some thing came up about some movies of his that weren't well received, and he said that you don't think you're making a bad movie when you're in the middle of shooting.  Cut to three months later, I'm interviewing Rosario Dawson, and she's joking about some of her Tomatometer scores, and I tell her what Statham said about not thinking a movie is going to be bad, and she says ""Oh no, I knew that Pluto Nash would be bad""  But she said she couldn't turn down the opportunity to work with Eddie Murphy.
[Aha! Great to see you here, I'm a producer on a Documentary called Beijing Punk that's somehow been listed incorrectly on your site, the descriptive text and cast info on Rotten Tomatoes is from another film called Beijing Bubbles. I've tried raising trouble tickets and emailing to get it fixed but nothing's been done for months so I figured what the hell and thought I'd ask here :\)  Also we received a glowing review from the Huffington post but the Rotten Tomatoes page hasn't picked it up. How do we connect the two?  And to ask a general question to be on topic, how hard is it for independent filmmakers to get their film listed on your site? Do they have any control over the information presented or is it gleaned from sources automatically such as the IMDB? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c640ril?context=5)|Hey, hit me on Twitter @matchity, and I can help you out.
[Any chance of getting rid of this popup? Or maybe just stop showing it after we have seen it 100 times?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63yqpy?context=5)|For what it's worth, I don't like that pop-up either.  
[Given how influential your site is, do you ever get pressure from studios to try and fudge the system to move an expensive stinker from rotten to fresh? If so, how do you respond?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xmo3?context=5)|We'll get a bunch of links to reviews from critics or sites that don't meet our qualifications.
 |We'll get asked to change a rotten review to a fresh one, because the review is neutral.
 |In the case of #1, we'll just say that the reviews don't qualify.  In the case of #2, we'll ask the critic if we've scored it right.  If they tell us to change it, we will, but we have to hear it from the critics.
[Going off the end of that, do you feel the critic's recommendation for each film is a good idea, rather than going strictly off the numbers? A 2.5/4 rating isn't necessarily ""rotten"" or ""fresh"", yet it goes either way. On top of that, I recently saw on early reviews of The Master, Richard Corliss' rating is a 7/10, and remains the only ""rotten"" rating (at this time\). Do you fee one way is better than the other?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63y1hr?context=5)|2.5/4 may mean fresh to some reviewers and rotten to others.  Our hope is that people are actually clicking through to read reviews, rather than basing their *entire* decision about the score.
 |We've thought about the possibility of changing things up, but in all honesty, keeping the system mostly simple is probably going to be our best bet.  It allows for a level of transparency that we like, where as averaging out scores adds in a lot more subjectivity and reinterpretation than I think we're comfortable with.
[Why isn't Taken 100%?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xkhj?context=5)|Because we didn't get a threatening call from Liam Neeson yet.
[What rating have you disagreed with the most? What has been your biggest surprise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xigy?context=5)|I *hated* The Tree of Life, but most of the critics loved it, so maybe I was missing something.
 |And I was pleasantly surprised to see Fast Five get a fresh rating, but I love those movies anyway.  I was kinda surprised to see Expendables 2 end up as fresh.
[Speaking of Terrence Malick have you seen his new film To the Wonder and if so what do you think of it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63yfsg?context=5)|Haven't seen it yet.

[I'm a long-time metacritic user.  How would you convince me that Rotten Tomatoes is better?  I prefer metacritic because they use numerical scores (which allows greater accuracy than a simple rotten or fresh\), among other reasons.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xsvd?context=5)|I think we have a broader pool, and a more democratic system, but I think Metacritic does a fine job doing what they do.
 |But if you like them better, then hey, that's like, your opinion man.
[Any thoughts on Metacritic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xp44?context=5)|I think they're good at what they do, but I think our site is more fun.  But obviously I'm biased.
 |I think a weighted average like theirs potentially opens the door to a lot of subjectivity on behalf of the aggregators, but we get similar criticism about how we handle neutral reviews.
 |Ultimately, we're both assigning numerical values to subjective analyses, so users have to pick which version of that they like more. 
[How does someone become a ""Top Critic""? Do you feel the ratings system is weighed fairly? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xngt?context=5)|The criteria for being a Top Critic are [here](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/help_desk/critics.php).  In a nutshell, we're looking for the people or sources that have the largest reach of the best writing.
 |We do try and make the system fair, in that it basically boils down to one critic - one vote.
[""Print publications must achieve and maintain status as one of the following: - A top 100 daily US newspaper - A top 100 weekly US newspaper""  What will you do when there are no more newspapers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c6402rr?context=5)|Not sure yet.

[Tomato a fruit or a vegetable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xnrt?context=5)|Botanists say fruit, government says vegetable, I think.
[Whats your favorite guilty pleasure movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63yw6q?context=5)|Probably The Fifth Element.  It's kind of a mess, but I love it.
[My question is how can you hope to control this, if at all on your website? Obviously when it got to death threats it was necessary not to allow commenting on the thread anymore, but there seems to be the amazing split with RT commenters where one person will trash the reviewer and the person directly below will say ""hey we're allowed our opinions"". Which side do you fall on, and how to you hope to gain traction with your users, if at all when it gets ugly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xv46?context=5)|Ultimately, we're going to change how our comment threads are set up so that there isn't a thread for each review, and I think that will help a bit.  But we're a pretty big platform, and once you hit a certain traffic level, the trolls definitely come out.
[*The Godfather Part II* shows 2 rotten reviews, but when I try to read them, only one critic is shown.  What did you do to the other guy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xw0y?context=5)|Ask Luca Brasi.
[How do you determine whether a critique is Rotten or Fresh if the general tone of the article seems to be neutral? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xv7t?context=5)|In many cases, the critic submits the review with their own rating.  But when we pick up the review, sometimes everyone in the office will read it, and if we really can't agree on a rating, we'll ask the critic.  But if something's truly neutral, we'll usually mark it fresh; the phrase we use in the office in that case is ""tie goes to the runner""
[I'm sure you remember the ordeal with internet users flooding message boards of movie critics who gave *The Dark Knight Rises* a negative review, but there was one article in particular that I read who admitted that he hadn't seen the film yet. How can you add to/take away from a movie's tomato score based on someone who hasn't seen the film's opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xv7t?context=5)|In that case, we took the link down to that review as soon as we saw it.
[How many miles do you recommend between tire rotations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xv7t?context=5)|About 5,000 miles, depending on how you drive.
[Will the Rotten Tomatoes Show ever come back? And what's your personal opinion regarding the scores? Would you see any ""fresh"" movie as a movie one should go watch? I personally like the seperation into fresh and rotten because oftentimes it's just too much about critics ratings.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xw34?context=5)|That incarnation of the show if over, but we're trying to cook up some other things.  And I'm trying to get Brett and Ellen to come on the Rotten Tomatoes Radio show; I see Brett every week at Current, when I'm shooting What the Flick.
 |Regarding scores, I think they can be a good tool in the decision making process if you're on the fence about seeing a movie.  But if you're dying to see a particular movie, then go see it; it's ok to see (and like) a movie that the critics don't like.
 |Except Twilight.  Those movies are terrible.

[I had a feeling you'd make movie references.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c644b2r?context=5)|We can't have any conversations in the office without some quote from something.

[How does the Flixster/TWX ownership structure work?  Do you get Time Warner stock?  How much editorial freedom do you have, and are there any guarantees?  Theoretically you could get a call from your boss's boss's boss's boss telling you to find a way to give the latest Warner Bros. film a push over that line from rotten to fresh or else he'll fire you and find someone who will--right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c641ehv?context=5)|No stock, but total freedom to write and cover what we want.
 |If I'd had any doubts about that, they were erased the week Dark Knight Rises opened.  No one at WB gave me any direction on how to handle the commenter issues, or what to do when the incident in Aurora happened.  After that week, we got some feedback from corporate PR that they thought we handled everything well, but at no point did they ask us to do anything differently.
 |We never heard anything like that while we were part of News Corp, either.
[Texting in theaters - what should we do here?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63yw3p?context=5)|I could go on a huge rant here (I just did on last week's Rotten Tomatoes Radio show), but I'll just say that I don't think there's any justification for texting in theater full of people.  You're either too dumb to realize you're distracting others that paid to see the movie, or you just don't care.  Take your pick.
[What actor do you dislike the most, out of everyone you can think of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xv6n?context=5)|There are some people I'd like to see do better movies, like Adam Sandler, but Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison still make me laugh.   But there's no one I really hate; I save my hate for people I know personally.
[What is the highest rated movie on Rotten Tomatoes? Lowest? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xm6i?context=5)|Best reviewed movie of all time is Toy Story 2 - 100% with 161 reviews.
 |Worst ever is Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever - 0% with 108 reviews.
[*Worst ever is Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever - 0% with 108 reviews.*  Already added to my downloads list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63zgb6?context=5)|There's more where that came from [here](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/guides/worst_of_the_worst/)
[Personally, what did you think of The Dark Knight Rises?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63yhqc?context=5)|I liked it a lot.  I don't know that it stands alone very well, but as a trilogy, Nolan's Batman movies are damn good.
[Do you receive fan mails? what's the weirdest one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xofr?context=5)|I don't get fan mail.
[Has any of the film promoters ever tried to bribe you to review their movies? what's the weirdest one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xofr?context=5)|No one's tried to bribe me, but we do get filmmakers challenging our interpretation of a review.  When that happens, we'll check with the reviewer to make sure it's right.
[What about hate mails?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xofr?context=5)|I don't get hate mail, but I do get nasty comments on YouTube.
[Hello.  What is your favourite movie that has a 'rotten' rating?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xiyv?context=5)|Probably the first thing to come to mind would the The Fast and the Furious franchise. 
[I feel that the neutral comments really get me.  For example, one of the reviews will be bad and i read it, and sometimes I feel like its a good review and shouldn't be a rotten tomato.  Is there a system to determine if some of the neutral comments are rotten or not? It throws me off sometimes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xplc?context=5)|The neutral ones can be really hard to interpret sometimes.  Sometimes three or four of us will read the same review to try and find a line that really defines where the critic stands.  If we really can't figure it out, we'll ask the critic directly.  That comes up a lot with Hollywood Reporter and Variety, where some of the reviews are as much about the box office potential as they are about the quality.
[Have you ever *eaten* rotten tomatoes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xis4?context=5)|Not knowingly.  I have been known to drink milk the day after it expires though.
[Thank you for doing this AMA. Welcome! Do you consider yourself to be movie-savvy? What was your occupation before this? Do you know of some amazing movies that have gotten little to no attention? If so, can you name a few? (Sorry to ask so many.. pick and choose if you wish!\) :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xuz9?context=5)|I like to think I'm relatively movie-savvy, but there are plenty of people who know more about the art and the business of movies than I do.
 |Before I was at RT, I had an online music business that failed (which is why I got back into web-based entertainment journalism) and before that I was at Yahoo Movies.  I've been covering entertainment on the web off and on for about 15 years.  I started out as a Universal Studios Tour Guide and I think I've taken that training to it's ridiculous extreme.
 |One movie I really tried to talk up last year was Warrior, and I was really happy to see Nolte get an Oscar nomination.  He had a scene in that movie that had me in tears.
[Hey Matt, what would you say is your favorite ultra-cheesy movie to watch for laughs (Something along the lines of The Day After Tomorrow or The Core\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xqgw?context=5)|My favorite genre of movie is probably sci-fi or action/adventure.  And I love a good martial arts movie.
[What is your favorite genre of movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xqgw?context=5)|I just re-watched The Rock on cable the other day - does that count as cheesy?  Loved it.
[What was it like in the beginning of your business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xjbc?context=5)|Rotten Tomatoes began as a side project for a few employees at a company called Design Reactor in Emeryville, CA. This allowed them to fully develop and take risks with the RT concept. Once it became clear this was going to be huge, the site branched off onto its own.
[Was it hard, did people have doubts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xjbc?context=5)|You can see some of the stories about the early days of the site [here](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rumble_in_the_bronx/news/1736415/an_oral_history_of_rt_part_one_the_beginning/)
[Have you ever spoke to an Actor/Actress who have had a joke or discussion with their film's ratings with you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63yg0g?context=5)|A lot.  One of the coolest things about working at Rotten Tomatoes is that almost everyone in the film industry seems to know who we are and they use the site.  I interviewed James Remar a couple of weeks back and he joked about how many bad movies he had on our site.
 |My favorite was probably interviewing the Broken Lizard guys.  I love Super Troopers, and they all said to us ""we love you guys, but you HATE us.""
[Is there any movie with a 0% critic and 100% user or the other way around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xyuw?context=5)|I don't think there is that large of a difference, but there are some with a difference of 40-50%.   But I think comparing critics scores to user scores is an apples/oranges comparison.  Users mostly choose movies they think they'll like, and they're usually right, so most users scores come from a self-selecting pool of people biased towards liking the film.  I'm painting in broad strokes here, but the I think the numbers are kind of a false comparison.
[ can you bring him back? Please, oh, please, will you let him on the site again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xvu7?context=5)|Armond has the ability to post on the site if he wants to.
[How do you feel about critics who slam overwhelmingly acclaimed movies, such as Toy Story 3 and E.T.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63y6ky?context=5)|If someone can legitimately back up their criticism, that's their right.  We don't expect everyone to agree.
[What is your opinion on critics writing a negative review to gain traffic to their personal website?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xrj9?context=5)|Regarding writing reviews to get traffic, if someone's flagrantly doing that, we try and address it.  But it's slippery slope - we're not trying to enforce some kind of group think, and if someone can legitimately argue against the popular opinion, that's their right.
[Did you ever want to be a filmmaker growing up (or still want to\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xxjw?context=5)|I wanted to be in movies, not really direct them or produce them.  And then I realized I'd rather watch movies than make them.
[**What is your opinion on the future of movie distribution as a whole?  Will the days of $15 movie tickets and $8 popcorn go the way of Betamax tapes?  Or do you feel that there is something stronger in a community experience (actually sharing the moment with a crowd of strangers, much like a concert\) that a home theatre can't convey?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63y39o?context=5)|I'm not sure what the future holds for movie distribution, but I think we're going to see fewer story concepts get distributed in a theatrical experience as the years go by.  But I don't know that it's going to be a sudden tipping point, so much as it will be a slow erosion.  I think we're going to end up in a place where most movies are released ""day-and-date"" - all countries across all media (theaters, TV, internet) at the same time, and movie theaters will be a specialized event experience, like going to a ball game, instead of staying home and watching it on TV.
[Would you be willing to become a regular contributor on the Adam Carolla podcast, like David Wild from Rolling Stone has? I would love a weekly segment discussing the crap coming out at the theaters.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63z86n?context=5)|We're working on that, but Adam's schedule gets really full really quickly (or so they tell me).
[How did you come up with the idea for the site's rating system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xl2y?context=5)|That was created by the founders of the site (not me), but my understanding is that 60% works as a pretty clear supermajority.
[Thanks for doing this. I love RT!  What's the process of deciding which reviewers should be listed/counted towards the Tomatometer like? Additionally, what are the qualifications needed for one of them to be a ""top critic"" on there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xpae?context=5)|I just posted about this, but we have our criteria [here](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/help_desk/critics.php)
[One of the things that really stand out to me on the website is the user comments on the professional reviews. I think there is a very clear hivemind mentality among the user comments that is really disturbing - there are SO many hostile comments towards negative reviews for those ""good"" films and then so many patronizing comments towards positive reviews for ""bad"" films. How would you go about regulating these comments and improving discussion of these professional reviews? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63y4vr?context=5)|Yeah, we're planning to move away from having individual comment threads linked to specific reviews, because I think that helps focus the dogpile that happens when someone goes against the majority.  We'll have one thread for each movie that will be easier to police.
[Hi Matt! I'm an accredited film critic (not listed on RT yet, though\). I love your site, but there are limits in the RT system because of review nuance. Would you ever consider putting the option on RT where a user could see a page based on ratings (ie 3 stars our of 4\), not the fresh/rotten binary? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xrgm?context=5)|We've thought about doing something like that, but we suffer from a severe lack of development resources, and it's hard make the case for that level of expense (developer time=money) when other parts of the larger corporate organization have other priorities.
[P.S. - I was the longest intern the Rotten Tomatoes show had. I enjoyed my time thoroughly and look fondly back on the company as a whole. If there are any ever positions open, you can be your bottom dollar I'll be applying! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63zu16?context=5)|Anyway, that was a decision by the producers, and we didn't have much input on it.  But my take is that since Rotten Tomatoes is about critics' reviews, I feel like having professionals was closer to the spirit of the site. 
[I love you on the Adam Carolla podcast when you come on. Do you think anyone has the balls to tell him that movie was not that good? I love me some Ace, but that movie was not that good. Have you seen it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63zrct?context=5)|I actually think it's a decent little movie.  It's not high art, but it's better than I would have expected out of him.
[What RT score do you think this AMA would get?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c648t5b?context=5)|Up votes are only at 56%, so I guess that means my own AMA is rotten.  (insert sad trombone sound here)
[If this AMA results in the removal of this popup then I will go to sleep tonight knowing we did something good for the world.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63zdb5?context=5)|The product team is telling me this is going to be addressed.  It probably won't go away completely, but it should show up less.
[Is there any chance of the search/sort feature becoming more specific.  For example it would be neat if I could search for something like ""Highest rated comedies in the last 5 years with more than 50 reviews"" or something to that effect.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63ymqm?context=5)|That's a long shot.  Our development team is handling a lot of different priorities right now, and although those sorts of improvements are on a ""to do"" list, it's a really, really long list.
[Describe your typical day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zer1a/iam_the_editor_in_chief_at_rotten_tomatoes_ama/c63xz91?context=5)|The days vary over the course of the week, because we see most of the reviews come in on Thursdays and Fridays.  Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays will be a lot of time planning coverage for the coming weeks, and then going to screenings in the evenings.  On Thursdays I do a bunch of radio press appearances, my team is amassing reviews, shoot What the Flick, and then we have Rotten Tomatoes Radio.  Fridays have more reviews, more press, and then eventually I go home.

To explain more about the title, I don't know if I am looking in the right places or not, or if I'm just an idiot. I graduated almost a year ago with a BS in Electrical engineering, and have been actively searching for entry level positions and internships, but I haven't had any luck.

I think that my fault was not looking for internships/research opportunities during my undergraduate years (I actually never knew what an internship was until my last quarter of my undergrad). So basically I have had no experience other than from school projects; which I've included in my resume. 

I have had only one real interview, and five phone interviews, which I did call them back to follow up, but they end up saying I wasn't the right person (I assume I'm not good at interviews too, based on those). I was thinking of getting a recruiter/consultant soon, and go back to my college and ask for career resources once they begin school. So my question is, what am I doing wrong? What else should I be doing? "

[How nice are the boobs you get to look at? Do you ever get a semi chubby?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64jbfj?context=5)|I'm happy that I didn't post it but that gif is the closest SFW image that I can stand by. That is basically what we do with bounce testing but the floor is more of a spring board, and we test 3 at a time. Any more and its just a room full of girls bouncing around in bras. Not a bad thing, just too much data to be collected at once! But yes, I do have whole days that consist of that sort of thing.
[Please for the love of god tell me your average day goes a little something like this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64jbfj?context=5)|And a straight male doing my work, HOW could I never react? I just keep it under wraps.
[Well, now that we've established that you have the best job in the world...  How much do you make, if you don't mind me asking? You don't have to be exact... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64jke0?context=5)|I don't mind due to the certain amount of anonimity that I somehow am about to maintain here ~80k it fluctuates depending on if/when patents go through.
[How can I sign up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64r02r?context=5)|Lol! Umm.... Apply?
[So do I just google boob tester? What's your job title? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64uvbf?context=5)|Lol that would be funny to see the results from that. And my official job title is quality engineer.
[I'm a 30G. My bras are insanely expensive. I'd like to be a VS customer, but I can't buy anything you sell (bra-wise, anyway. I love my VS bathrobe\). I know there's limited demand for some sizes, but why not sell some of the less-popular cup sizes with a range of adjustable bands? Would there be an engineering problem with making adjustable bands? Are the different sizes constructed differently, or are larger sizes just scaled-up versions of the smaller sizes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64ooki?context=5)|This is a very good question. The problem becomes more intense when the fact that Boobs don't scale up in proportion with height or width with body size. I know right? I was just as baffled when I learned this, having been a self appointed. Ion expert before this job. But long story short. In order to make a bra comfortable AND adjustable there would be so many places to adjust it that most girls I assume would go commando (is that what girls call it with bras too) instead of fool with it at all.
[Do you ever use a wind tunnel? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64iiy9?context=5)|Long story short, we have in the past. It is extremely more cost effective to just use a fan to implement most normal wind conditions. However, the factor of safety after bounce testing is well enough to withstand a gust of wind.
[Did you go to college? And if so, did you get an engineering degree?  What is something that we don't know about bras but should?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64iq7u?context=5)|Yes - Yes - and that when in a bind for a sling, a bra is better to use that a shirt. It yields more immediate support with essentially no strain. Other than that bras are pretty straight forward. Oh, and for the ladies - If you pop out when you are bending over or jumping, you are wearing the wrong size. Most people will probably think I'm stating the obvious but I've ran into testers that promised me that they knew their size and it was the bras fault. Then, when we sized them appropriately most of the time they were a whole cup size off.
[Would you be able at determining bra size than the girls in the store? They kinda suck at it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c656n3a?context=5)|Of course.
[What kind of engineer?  Mechanical?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64tgsc?context=5)|Mechanical indeed.
[Wait so when I finish my engineering degree I can work with boobs all day?  O.o.  (female here\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64lhk0?context=5)|If you apply I'm sure! Actually for obvious reasons they seem to be more motivated to hire females. I'm sure if I wasn't so relaxed and smooth with my words I would never have gotten this position. The last thing our testers want is a creepy slobbering guy taking measurements of their melons!

With Boobs this is not a problem. Boobs are good no matter how loose the girl. Waxes I imagine are not. Lol.
[I really don't believe this guy one bit ....  I've worked for Limited Brands as an intern and had frequent conversation with the Sr. Engineer of Innovation and Tech Services at VS.  *depending on if/when patents go through.*  Limited Brands/VS does not file patents with bra technologies.Les Wexner believes, by the time the competition figures it out, it is too late, and the fact that when you think of bra and lingerie, you always think of VS.   *Do you ever use a wind tunnel? Actually no,  the testing that are done with the bra is .... gas chamber - to test the reaction of the fabric with certain gases Laundry Machines - Test several different type of pH levels of water, reaction to detergents, and drying methods  Stretcher - Idk the real name for this machine but its primary use is to stretch the bra as far as possible and somehow measures usage over time.  Machine that literally spins the bra and shreds it, also it measures how long the shine lasts on the bra over time.*  What is interesting is, they have a lab with different types of lighting and a book of the different types of fabric. What they do is study how bras look under different lighting \) at the stores.   *Why doesn't your company create VS male underwear.*  I know this is a joke, but LB main focus is womens apparel. In the past LB has owned Abercrombie and Express but due to poor performance they were let go. LB recently started re-focusing on women's apparel and fragrances.  *Prove to us that you work with boobs all day. Prove us what's on the menu today!*  Actually people who work for VS do not work with boobs all day. Most of these people who are involved are from a textile background. The mentor I was with worked on Kevlar and now is the leading tech for Bra Technology.   *I'm a 30G. My bras are insanely expensive. I'd like to be a VS customer, but I can't buy anything you sell (bra-wise, anyway. I love my VS bathrobe\).*  You need to call Victoria Secret Direct, they have a wide variety and items not sold in stores. They are pretty good with shipping and you can always catch deals online. Always direct call.   *Did you go to college? And if so, did you get an engineering degree?*  Most of the people I met in Bra Tech had some sort of materials study or actually went to school for textiles.   *What is something that we don't know about bras but should? VS bras are not about comfort. The mentor I met explained this to me... VS can make the most comfortable bra in the world but thats not why people buy VS bras. People buy VS bras cause of the appeal of sex. What the tech has to gauge is comfort level, and how far they can go with style and sacrifice comfort. He explained to me that comfort is only a tolerance of pain.*  The one bra that intrigued me was the VS Incredible Bra. First of the the elasticity of the bra is amazing. It is able to attain its elasticity even after being stretched 2-3x its initial length. On top of that it has a high comfort level and does not have side fat build up (I really dont know what the real term is\). Another interesting thing about bra technology that is so hard to control are white bras. Many ladies get frustrated because the white bras will not stay white. First the edges will lose color (light brown/tan\) then the bra loses its shine. This occurs because of exposure to different gases in the environment, and simply the fact that over time materials will decompose towards its natural color/state.   *I've ran into testers that promised me that they knew their size and it was the bras fault. Then, when we sized them appropriately most of the time they were a whole cup size off.*  Seriously? VS bras even the same sizes fit differently, this is why they have a fitting procedure when you go to the stores. If you ever looked at the card it states the size, model, and color. A size from one brand or within the same brand isnt the same all across the board.   *How do I start a company for this?*  Www.limitedbrands.com apply there.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zh38t/iama_victoria_secret_quality_engineer_amaa_amaa/c64pvsu?context=5)|Sir I got a few lines into this comment and realized that you are either trying to hijack my thread for your own position or count an interns work as an equivalent engineers work at a company that sells essentially higher quality products.

I think most people get confused because many times its a clasp of many hooks. If you treat it like a single hook and then with one or more hands pull the two sides in and stick a finger between the material and the skin and give it a nice trust out (finger only not the hands that you're pulling the bra together with or else you snap it into her back when you let go) the forces holding it together will act as a jerk resistance to the hooks at it will release.

Being closer to my family brought on a lot more then I thought in regards to the box and the contents. My brother, even after hearing the tapes and wanting to never hear them again, sat me down and told me he wanted to talk about everything I was finding. 

He's never been someone to fear things, often in our childhood he would tease me over being cautious. You see, I have to be cautious because of how I am. I'm not dyslexic, but I do have trouble with balance and reading. At times it proves to take it's toll on me when I do my studies and my internship.

He sat with me and stared at the box. To be honest, he didn't really stare at it as much as he was *glaring* at it. I found it amusing and told him to be nice to the box, I said, ""If you glare at it you might hurt it's feelings."" 

He didn't find it very amusing. 

""That box is going to get you in trouble, Austin."" Yes, finally a name, my name is Austin. We'll leave out last names. 

I shrugged it off. 

I showed him the files on Evan and instead of looking at what I was showing him, he was looking at me. He was watching me carefully, almost as if he was trying to figure out a riddle. As kids, our parents gave us riddles to figure out to keep us busy.

While I was very eager to solve each riddle, and I was also very good at most of them, not all; my brother wasn't. He was always annoyed with the riddles and would have me give him the answers.

I told him simply, ""It's just to keep me busy."" 

It's the truth, this keeps my mind busy. Too much time and I often get very uneasy. I need to keep busy.

""No one wanted the case, that should be a hint.""

He took the papers and slammed them into the box. My mother came in and just crossed her arms over her chest. She told him to fix the papers and to apologize, but all he did was walk pass her.

I told her it was fine. He could be nervous for me, and he had his own worries on top of this, so he must have had a bad day. A bad week. Something bad.

My mother said something very odd to me, which is why I am putting this here for you all. 

""He must be nervous ever since last month.""

Last month? Well, what happened last month?

I asked her this.

""Your grandparents adopted me."" She said, and I laughed a bit. 

Just a coincidence, right? She was adopted. I don't love my grandparents any less. I don't love her any less. Just because a case had a foster family in it doesn't mean anything.

""They were foster kids, not adopted."" I said, and I took the box to put it into my car. My mom just smiled and sighed, hugging me before I was fully set to head back home with all of my things.

""They adopted me a little after they got me. I suppose they really enjoyed having me."" She waved at me and I watched her go into the house. 

The house we grew up in. From the apartment to this house, my mind was a bit confused. My parents stayed as long as they could with me in the apartment until they finally went to the house once more. Apartments aren't for them, they love having their own space without people above or below them.

I live in the apartment alone and pay some of the rent to help them, they own the house so they help me with the rent so I could get through school and my internship.

But the house, it was odd to me suddenly. Not familiar like you would expect from a house you grew up in.

I didn't stay long, just drove down the same road back to my place and unpacked everything. (When I say unpack, I mean I shoved the clothes from the bag to a hamper, clean or not, and then sat on my couch. I'm guilty of being a bit of a lazy person when I'm tired.)

With my eyes shut I remembered something and came here to type. I'm going to keep putting the things I find up here, but also some new things. Because I remember something from my childhood, I remember a riddle that was like a scavenger hunt. 

One of the hunts led us around our house and then over to some doors that were in the ground. It wasn't extremely close to the house, but not very far either. My father came to us during that hunt and said it was time to head back inside. 

I asked what it was, thinking it was some doorway to a magic world. I had a very wild imagination. He said it was a shelter, and that he never thought to really open it up at all. It was just there, and now, so many years later, I'm wondering if I can go to that shelter.

Coincidence is something common. An adopted mother and a shelter by our house. I texted my brother about it.

**Remember the shelter we found? Let's go there this Sunday together. You and me.**

**No.**

**I'm going anyway, I'll take pictures.**

**Don't go, now you're just being stupid.**

As you can imagine, this went on with us bickering like brothers do with one another over it. But now, he's agreed to go with me. We go, we look, we leave. No snooping, no lingering, no 'hunting', just looking. 

I'll post another content from the box tonight.

As I'm taking more Comp Sci classes, I'm noticing some people are completing multiple short internships with big(ger) name companies (bigger than the company I work for). So, this is my question: 

To Potential Employers, would multiple internships(say, 4-6 months each) at mid to large size companies look more attractive than one job (focused on programming in JavasScript, Python, and some c#) that I stayed at for 5 years? 

**TLDR: What looks more attractive on a resume: multiple short internships or one position held for 5 years?** 

Note: I'm also fairly positive that I have room to grow(position-wise) at my current company. "

[How effective has LinkedIn been in finding great candidates? 90% of my interview calls were based on my use of LinkedIn for networking with the right people.  In this economy is there a preference for hiring US citizens with less experience and skill (and provide them training\) instead of a highly qualified immigrant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e648?context=5)|Yes, I work for a company in the addiction treatment field.  A lot of our employees have a past and we work with them case by case.  Bigger companies might be more hard and fast in their selection process and disqualify workers because of a record.  Although google Seymour Schlager and see how some companies are clueless, I have a great story about this guy, personal experience.
[What personality traits do you look for in a candidate based on your experience with big companies? Working in a startup, apart from talent and skill, we look for people who fit the company culture versus 9-5ers.  Any experiences hiring candidates with criminal records? Are they vetted out in the application filters itself? From your experience what's the general policy among big corporations on hiring someone with a record?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e648?context=5)|I have primarily a small company background(inside) and a bigger company background working from the outside.  I always look for someone that can demonstrate ""flexibility"" to me especially if they are going from big company to a more entrepreneurial start-up environment.
[I posted this in the other AM, might as well try here!  At the company I work at, I went from being a Unit Manager to a Reporting Analyst, essentially two levels below.  Will this ""demotion"" of sorts have a negative impact when other companies look at my resume? How can I make it positive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64ebzj?context=5)|Was the demotion due to a company wide reduction in force or something similar?
[Not an official demotion, but the team was restructuring. So my role doesn't exist anymore. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64efpr?context=5)|It has been restructure mania for years so recruiters and HR get it.  Spin it by explaining that your position was eliminated but they valued you as an employee and wanted to keep you.  You loved the company and wanted to stay.  Coo, thing is they definitely took a risk by putting you in a position you were overqualified for knowing you would probably be looking.  Good HR people will get that.
[What is the largest salary you ever offered someone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64dx3q?context=5)|Base was over 500K, package with stock options and everything took it over a million.  Deal took over 9 months to put together and fell through at the last minute because of an amended non-compete the candidate had forgotten about, never got over that one.
[What is your cut on something like that, if it had gone threw?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e177?context=5)|In the firm I was working at it depended on how many people were assigned to the search.  On that one the total fee was probably just north of $150,000.00  I would have seen at least 30K.
[I work for an ex big firm partner who's gone on his/her own now - you should really do that if you have the contacts...pure profit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64fdmo?context=5)|I work on my own now, its all mine.
[Can you give a reference on the BEST way to format a resume? I can read five different sites and get five different answers..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64dy1n?context=5)|Love this question and you are right, you can get a million different answers.  For me the most important thing is that I shouldn't have to ""work"" to figure out who you are and what you do.  For those just graduating you should list your education first and then your employment history.  I think a chronological resume is best, use highlighting carefully, try an include a concise objective to tell the employer what type of position you seek.  Include a ""skills"" section listing your technical capabilities.  And whatever format you use check it 50 times for any grammar or spelling problems.  Hope that helps and feel fee to DM me for my email, be happy to review your resume.
[From your experience, what would you say is the percent of applicants found through online job postings versus applicants that ""knew"" someone in the company already and applied that way?  In other words, is filling out online job applications really just a huge waste of time that would be better spent trying to network?  Or does the private sector really actually hire people through online applications?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64eeb7?context=5)|Companies absolutely hire through job postings although they aren't my favorite way to find someone unless I am under a tight deadline or I need multiple people.  Always network as much as you can, best method by far for finding a new job.  
[Thank you for doing this. I have a few questions I've never really had the chance to ask someone who may actually have answers.  I graduated about a year ago from a very well-regarded university. Unfortunately, while I was in school my personal life severely imploded (repeatedly\) and my grades really suffered. Staying in school was difficult enough and I did not partake in any internships/jobs and hence have zero work experience in my field. I took the last year off to deal with all the aftermath and get my feet back on the ground. I feel like I'm finally ready to start working again. But I'm wondering how I can convey to a potential employer that I'm a good candidate despite the fact that I have these giant red flags? The last thing I want to do is throw a pity party on my cover letter/interview. I'm sure they don't want to hear my sob story. And how do I explain such a large gap in my history in a way that won't make it look like a potential liability in the future? I know I'm quite competent, but how do I convince them that I'm worth taking a chance on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64elnx?context=5)|Thanks for this and the biggest thing right now is that you must be sure in your heart and mind that you are ready to take on a job. Have you gotten the help that you need and is your personal life settled?  The worst thing that can happen is that you land a new gig and another nuke goes off and you implode again, make sense?  If you are ready you need to be as honest as you can be without going into too much detail.  Interviewers don't like to feel uncomfortable so don't take the there.  Try and paint your ability to overcome some personal obstacles and actually finish school as a positive achievement, which it is.  You have to really exude confidence if you get an interview and keep you expectations reasonable for a first job.  Also, get some good references lined up that can speak to your character.  I hope this helps a little, good luck.
[1\) Is an executive recruiter functionally a headhunter? I keep thinking of Mila Kunis in Friends with Benefits.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e7fm?context=5)|Yes, I am a headhunter and who is this Mila Kunis?  Kidding of course.
[2\) What does the fee look like? Is it 20% of a person's gross salary? Does the jobhunter pay you a fee?  3\) What fields do you work with? I'm asking because i'll be a PhD (no time soon though\) who might look to go into industry in a marketing or management capacity.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e7fm?context=5)|Fee can be anywhere between 10% if you are a shitty recruiter mucking up the profession to over 30% in a retained situation.  I am typically at 20 - 25% of a persons first year gross and guaranteed bonus.  Jobhunter pays no fee. 3) primarily healthcare, place many graduates from doctoral programs but primarily thise with at least 5-10 years of industry experience, pharma and biotech mostly.
[20% seems phenomenally high. You only need to make 5 placements a year working for yourself to hit median income? How many placements do you actually make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64omsn?context=5)|Working part-time I have place four people this year in positions ranging from 95 to 160K.  I hope to do 2 more by the end of the year.  Of course I have had at least 7 or 8 deals go south which I worked very hard on so yes when things work the fees are good, but it evens out I think.
[So minimum 114-192k before expenses part-time? That's ridiculous.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c650pfd?context=5)|I guess you could see it that way.  Expenses can be high, taxes are a killer.
[How much knowledge do you generally have in the field a candidate maye be applying for? For example if someone applies to be in IT or your software engineeeing department, would.you be well versed in that field or the requirements of the job, or is that something you leave to the technical team?  If it's a field.you don't necessarily know the details of,  what do you look for in a candidate when eeading their resume or interviewing them? Thanks for doing this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64e5oo?context=5)|Great question and on the executive recruitment side that is why I specialize in healthcare. I have learned the field and can talk somewhat intelligently about most positions.  Now in HR where I am asked to review resumes from all walks of life I am a bit hamstring by my lack of technical and subject matter knowledge for some positions.  I do however take the time to meet my hiring managers and learn as much about what they do and need as possible.  That being said I always get a list of must have from the hiring manager, if I don't see them on the resume I probably won't call the person.  If I see the must have then I look for stability and career progression.  If that makes sense then I call and do a quick screen.
[Can you explain what a recruiter does and who you (generally\) work for? Do you recruit within a certain field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64eclm?context=5)|Love the name, healthcare mostly.  Employers come to me when they are having a tough time finding the right person for a particular role.  My job is to learn about their company and basically sell it to a candidate.  I am lucky that I have been successful and can choose the companies I want to represent, my motto is cool jobs for cool people.
[If I was applying for a new job while currently having one, should I mention that I have a job already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64ei0g?context=5)|Yes, and make sure you tell them they cannot contact your current employer. 
[What if they ask for reference and says that they'll need to contact the references?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64o4hf?context=5)|Say you are currently employed and you can't jeopardize that status and give them refs from previous employers.  If a potential employer pushes and want refs from you current job then they are clueless and you don't want to work there, make sense?
[May I ask why not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64hu69?context=5)|Well I guess I should qualify that statement.  If your current employer knows that you are looking for a new job and they are ok with that, then by all means allow a prospective employer to contact your current one.
[If you tell a potential employer that you would rather they not contact your current employer, are they likely to ask why you're leaving in order to get a feel for the way you'd speak about your job / how you deal with stressful scenarios if you're leaving due to an unhealthy workplace? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64lyr8?context=5)|I ask that question right away and if they start bad mouthing their current employer I tend to shut down the interview pretty quickly.  You can explain a situation by painting a picture of what is making the workplace unhealthy.  If you have an a hole for a boss, don't say that, give an example of how he/she treats people.  Does that make sense?  
[What is your take on hiring veterans who have college degrees?  Does being a veteran matter at all and influence potential employers?  If it does, please explain how.  Thank you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64fmr1?context=5)|Personally I will do everything I can to hire a veteran, and I can tell you that the president of our company thinks the same way.  I guess the trick is to be able to show how your military experience directly relates to the position you are seeking.  Best of luck!
[I have two questions,  1.\) Why is it that most companies will not contact you if you didn't get the job?  2.\) Since applying to jobs online proves to be one of the worst methods with around a 4% success rate (What Color is Your Parachute by Richard N. Bolles\), what are some better methods to an effective job search? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64g17w?context=5)|Hi, first question is a pet peeve of mine since I always try and call the people that interviewed and weren't selected.  I have two answers, one is that people don't like giving people bad news and the second is that some HR people think they don't have the time, which sucks.  I find open positions online and then hunt down the players.  There are wonderful social and business networking tools that are very effective at assisting with the job search process.  Use LinkedIn, use twitter, use facebook and try and find a recruiter that specializes in your field.
[Is it socially acceptable after finding these people to contact them over LinkedIn or and equivalent source? and should they be contacted them after you apply or before?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64gcvw?context=5)|LinkedIn was built for professional networking and always feel free to reach out either before or after replying.

[Difficult situation...  My SO was fired 18 months ago and is finally looking for a job seriously now. He was fired after 7 years for not-optimal attendance, and has only a high school GED. But he is very personable and very very intelligent.  Again, not-ideal situation overall...  What's his best avenue he could use to find a mediocre but non-crappy job... something full time in an office environment doing something like billing or customer service, 35k-40kish/year? Hire a professional resume writer? Should he lie and say he tried running his own business during that 18 month gap? Etc? I already assume the firing circumstances will have to be sugar-coated/border-line lied about because they can't verify that anyway, only that he is not rehireable (right?\) Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64jynk?context=5)|Unemployment starting to run out huh?  So if I understand this correctly he was at his last position for 7 years?  What does he do?  Don't hire a professional resume writer, usually a waste of money.  Don't try and cover a gap by lying, we'll find out.  And you never know what a company contact will say so don't count on them saying only, he is not eligible for rehire, which in and of itself is a problem.  His best avenue right now is probably through a temp employment agency.  They can help with the resume, they get a shitload of job orders and if he gets out there working and does a good job he might get hired permanently.  Cover the gap by telling the truth.  he had attendance issues but was there 7 years, ready to work hard again it has been tough because of the economy, etc.
[I'm 43, no education, and have been running my own engineering consulting company for the last 10 years.  Prior to that I was an independent contractor for 13 years.  I also do a little bit of management consulting, but mostly programming and electrical engineering.  I've worked inside a lot of different companies (20 or so\), which gives me a very broad perspective on what works and what doesn't.

How can I spin this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64ux0u?context=5)|Love it, ""real company"", like what you have done doesn't count or something.  I would say your best chance would be for a smaller ""real"" company that doesn't have a degree requirement. I am sure you have met a ton of people, network and see what's out there.  So yes, if you want to go that route I think it is possible but you need to be ready to convince someone you really want to take on more of a traditional role.

I always tell candidates that switching careers is no easy task and you have to manage your expectations, you may have to settle for something that might seem a bit beneath you before you can actually start to make headway in to a new career. Stay focused and put yourself in the hiring company's shoes, does it make sense for them to hire you for the role?
[I've read articles such as these: Link to www.forbes.com that talk about obesity and salary. Did you find that to be the case? Does it influence hiring too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64f67g?context=5)|Unfortunately it does, people have biases whether well founded or not and employers can make a case that obese people will increase healthcare costs for the company.
[Lately I've been hearing that your degree isn't as important as it used to be when looking for your first job, but that recruiters primarily look at your (social\) and out-of-college activities. Is this actually true?  E.g. if you could pick between two candidates - One with good academic credidentials but 0 experience outside of it - One without a degree, but actively involved in planning and organising things for organisations.  Which would you pick, and why? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64gjq2?context=5)|Personally I would take candidate B without the Degree however most companies now require a 4 year degree for professional positions.  
[Thanks! Does make me wonder why on earth I spent 5 years in college :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64i7j0?context=5)|I'll share something with you, I attended but didn't graduate from college and I regret it to this day.  
[I'm hoping you can provide some guidance on my current situation. I've worked at a startup for a few years now, and am one of the first 10 employees (we have around 100 now\). We're very profitable. I've been in Support for that entire time, but have done a lot of other unrelated things for the company, so I make a bit more than a typical Support rep, around $64k / year.  1\) They want to wait until my annual review in December to adjust salary, despite a start date in October. Is this typical of internal promotions?  2\) They said a jump to an $80k+ salary from where I'm at is out of the question, reasoning that internal promotions are typically not paid market rate. They said a more realistic number is in the low $70s. Are internal promotions typically paid out at a lower rate than external hiring?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64it98?context=5)|Probably the best advice that I can give is never hold a current employer hostage over salary, even if you get paid they will be bitter.  We have an employee right now who did this and he doesn't know it but I am looking for his replacement right now.  From an employers perspective a jump to 84K would be a 31% increase which is in my opinion too big of a jump.  When you mention market rate for PMs, is that for an experienced PM?  And how many years of experience?  It is a new role for you so temper your expectations initially, 74K would be a healthy 16% increase and more reasonable I think.  They want to delay the salary increase so that don't have to re-visit it when they do the annual.  Try this, see if you can get 74 starting in October but would agree to no salary discussions in December during your annual.  However, since you believe the market for a good PM is higher, you would like a ""salary"" review in 6 months.
[This is a pretty general question but could you go over interview etiquette?  I.E. what are the best questions to ask, what makes candidates stand out, what are the little things you notice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64evym?context=5)|This has been fun although I am getting hungry, might have to grab lunch.  Have at least 2 or 3 questions, can be general about the company or job specific.  If I am the job seeker I want to know why the position is open, career path from here and ask the interviewer what he likes about his/her job, you can learn a lot.  Always dress professional, even if you think it might be a business casual environment.  Turn off your damn phone, don't forget.  Don't talk too much and give concrete examples when you answer questions. Show interest and at the end of the interview ask for the job.  Some red flags for me are lack of eye contact, inability to tell me what you did or do, no knowledge of the company, etc. Be yourself, be on time.

It never ceases to amaze me that people won't do that.  
[I don't understand. I'd feel like an idiot saying ""I'd like that job please"" since I'm already in the interview and have (hopefully\) appeared to be very interested in the company and the position.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64vayl?context=5)|Close the deal at the end.  Say something like, ""From what I have learned today about xyz company I am really excited about joining the team, what is the next step so that I can start as soon as possible?""  This leaves no doubt in the interviewer's mind as to your interest and will force them to make some type of decision on the spot. 
[What's been the biggest pay increase you've seen in a candidate?  What was their past salary and their newer salary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64enxq?context=5)|Not sure, typical increases are anywhere between 10 and 20%. Usually people don't make huge jumps.
[I was the subject of a large pay increase.  Had put in my 2 weeks to move to a better position in a new company, then I received a counter offer from another dept that beat the new company's offer (I went from ~$38k hourly to $58k salary\).  Future positions I apply to have no way of knowing, but what could that do to my reputation internally (essentially ""quitting"" to get a raise\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgknp/iama_hr_director_and_an_owner_of_an_executive/c64fovt?context=5)|I typically don't recommend accepting counter offers and I'd keep this as quiet as possible.

And sure, so in this example this person had already accepted and offer at a new company which means he really wasn't happy at his current company.  So bottom line he dissed the new company, will be happy for a short time in his new role because it pays more.  But there were other reasons he wasn't happy there as well, guarantee it.  He'll be looking again soon.

I'll touch on some basics.  Make sure that each career move that you make, makes sense.  You need to show progression and do not job hop.  Although the world has changed and certainly people don't stay at a job forever, don't move just for the sake of moving. That being said, don't get stuck.  If you find yourself in a role that you will be buried in for years with no chance for advancement, get out.  Find a mentor, learn how they moved up.  Every industry is different and I don't know engineering.  Don't burn bridges and learn everything you can.

Long story but here goes, back in 2003 I quit a position with a medical staffing company and ended up starting a recruiting business and did ok but my wife didn't appreciate the uncertainty of the business so when one of my clients approached me about joining them as their internal recruiter I took the job.  I helped grow the company from about 20 people to over 150 and then things at the company changed and we started letting people go.  One of the departments that was hit was HR, we let go our Director and generalist.  The President of the company kept me on because he knew that as we restructured and changed the business model we would need to recruit people again at some point.  So I took on all the HR duties and he has allowed me to have my business on the side.  There are some synergies between the roles so it works well.  So I primarily wear my HR hat during the day and my executive search activity is done in the evening and on weekends.

Ask them what the range is for the position and then tell them that you are seeking something withing their range, if indeed it is a fit.  If you are pressed and they won't move forward with anything before they learn your salary then you have a decision to make.  If you want to be considered for the position give them your current salary and just say that you feel you are worth more, comparable positions at my level of experience pay more, and that is one of the main reasons I am speaking with you today :)  Now, show me the money!

If it is an internal corporate recruiter I wouldn't tell them what I make during the first conversation, period.  Just tell them you would be more comfortable discussing salary at a later time.  If it is a third party recruiter you can usually get by at first by telling them the salary range you are seeking, but they will have to know at some pint exactly what you make.  I usually request W-2's from my candidates before I present them for senior roles.  Hope that helps.

If the range is 30 - 40% above what you are making you have done a great job actually getting through the interview process.  Shoot for 30 and be happy.

Currently I wear many different hats and would like to become a bit more focused in my career.

zibos,9,2012-09-07,How valuable is the CS Degree in obtaining employment?,lennybird,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zibos/how_valuable_is_the_cs_degree_in_obtaining/,"A friend of mine did a summer internship at Intel. Intriguingly, they told him (I'm paraphrasing), ""90% of what you'll learn in school will not be related to what you'll be doing here."" They then emphasized on-the-job training. This made me a little nervous. Am I wasting my time and money?

Similarly, I've just stumbled across this subreddit. And viewing the advice from others, it appears that a computer-science degree is less about application and programming and more about going into theory (which can be great to expand the mind's capabilities in some instances.).

I'm about half way through obtaining my Bachelors. I'll have obtained more than 64 credits at the community college due to switching from a BA to BS (can only transfer a max of 64 in the end). Following my current path I will have an associates in both arts and sciences after next summer—providing an okay platform to springboard into universities (I'm hoping).

But is it worth it?

Is there anything I learn with this degree that I cannot learn on my own? In regards to willpower, dedication, and ambition, I have no problems teaching myself. And is the portfolio or proving yourself more valuable than the degree?

My interests in the field of programming revolve around web-design (front end, back-end), software design, game development, and entrepreneurial ideas such as apps.

I'm unsure what the specific field/position would be, but I would also love to work on, say, Google's search algorithms, or Reddit or Digg. I would like to be in research, such as the IBM team who worked on Deep Blue or Watson.

In responding, would you mind explaining the path you took with your education and how long you've been in the field? 

Thank you."

I am very competent, and I know I'm a good coder. I am about a year out of school already and have about a year of experience now. About 2 months ago, I was laid off due to company budget, and have been working on my own projects/ going over data structures/algorithms etc. During these 2 months on working on myself, I realized how much I miss school and really regret how I pissed away some really important classes. 

Mind you at this point I'm really on top of my theories/fundementals, but I know I could learn more and I want to work at a company like Microsoft/Google/Amazon. The problem is actually getting the interview. 

So lately, I started thinking about trying to go to grad school (and actually striving for a 4.0), and trying to get an internship at google/microsoft while there. However, I don't want to go to just any grad school, I want to go to a top one like -- carnegie mellon, or..UC berkeley. I have a year of experience already, and I know my stuff, and I know for a fact given the opportunity to go to a great school I would definitely obtain a good GPA, however, I feel like my 2.8 undergrad GPA is essentially going to screw me in the ass when applying. 

Do I have any shot at this? Is there any way to prove to the college recruiters/ or to whomever looks at the applications that I would do well there? 

Also, is it even worth going back to school? Perhaps I can just find a lower end job and just get paid, create projects and teach myself for a couple of years then try to apply to the big companies? Any tips would be awesome.

I had an internship and a good GPA, but I didn't do much programming outside of class. I also never really mastered topics like algorithms and operating systems. I ended up taking a job that was billed as programming and system administration, which was also new to me. I went on autopilot for years and didn't really think about my career until the last few years, when I realized that my job has become less and less programming. My only programming now is modifying a few lines of code in an existing program, reading source code, or writing a one-off script to automate something. My typical day is modifying some software configuration, swapping hard drives, doing a backup, or trying to fix some Linux problem.

I'm now in a situation where I don't have much real programming experience, and I haven't really developed my sysadmin skills beyond what is necessary for the job, nor do I really like doing administration or working with hardware. My resume apparently still looks impressive because I get contacted by recruiters on LinkedIn for programming jobs, but I don't have the confidence to actually get through a technical interview. 

I'm trying to rectify the situation by working on a side project that has potential to be monetized and will let me learn new frameworks, and taking online courses like on Coursera and Udacity.

This made it very difficult for me to even get an interview. After months of improvement, knowledge, and perseverance I finally landed a dream job with a great offer. Unemployment was a miserable and depressing experience, however, I learned a lot a long the way. I kept finding myself saying ""fuck, I wish I would;ve known to do that"". I'm sure you've heard a lot of these, but I think it's more helpful to hear from someone who recently wen through first hand.


* Hopefully I'm not too late for this one, if you have the choice, choose your senior design project wisely. If you have no internship experience, this will be your major talking point. Make sure it's a project that you are interested in. Do good work and maintain a professional but also personal relationship with your company contact. Many people get job offers through this. This is especially important if you have a less than desirable GPA. They won't care about your GPA if you demonstrated your can produce good work. Even if they can't offer something you have added someone to your network.


* This one is obvious, but go to any career fair your school offers, even if you want to work in another geographic location. It will give you valuable interview experience. Also research the companies beforehand, to give you a talking point. This will also allow you to speak about any other location you are interested in.


* Start skimming job postings now. This is extremely helpful. See what types of opportunities are out there. For example, if you are an ME, you can be in multiple types of design, aeronautics, HVAC, testing, manufacturing and the list goes on. Once you see exactly what's out there, research and decide types are best suited for you. Then, look at the common qualifications associated and use the remainder of your year building towards them. For example, if you want to be a manufacturing engineer, take a production engineering class your last semester and gain a working knowledge of any program commonly listed in job postings. This will go miles.


* Start seriously applying right before your final semester. Like anything, you will get better at job hunting/interviewing the longer you do it. If you start early it gives you more time to figure it all out. 


* I personally recommend using engineerjobs.com as my main job search tool. It compiles searches from multiple job hunting sites. Craigslist is my #2. Nobody thinks of getting an engineering job on craigslist, but they are certainly out there. You have a much higher chance of getting a response, because less people apply, and your resume goes straight to the correct person.


* Develop a somewhat personal relationship with a couple professors. You don't have to kiss ass or work as their research assistant, just be a good student and a alright guy in their eyes. This is easier senior year as classes are smaller and professors tend to respect you a little more. Companies often ask professors for recommendations. As long as you ask them, they may be able to recommend you.

* If you have any sort of connections, utilize them. You can get a lot in life by simply asking.

* Update/Improve your cover letter/resume every few weeks. Just like doing a tough problem, sometimes just walking away from and later returning can really help. I can't tell you how many times I revised my resume/cover letter and said to myself ""well that's as good as I can possibly do."" only to come back 2 weeks later and saying ""wow I can definitely improve this area."" Also try to make your cover letter semi custom. I had a template and just went off that for every posting. My cover letter was 85% the same every time, but it still had that personalized feel.

* One more thing. Go back and skim any labs or projects that you have done in your Jr and Sr year just to jog your memory on what you actually did. Every once in awhile an interviewer will ask you about your experience with something. A lot of times you can use your experience with a simple lab or project to talk about. They eat that shit up. It's what got me an on site interview with the job I recently got. 


Cold calling/emailing random companies didn't seem to help. In my experience 90% don't answer and the other 10% turned me down, so don't waste your time.


There are a few more that are slipping my mind, This was more geared towards someone who who doesn't have a great GPA, internship experience or connections. I know it's not great, but it's something.

zkggg,0,2012-09-08,I need help reporting abusive behavior by an exec director...,Hana3487,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zkggg/i_need_help_reporting_abusive_behavior_by_an_exec/,"I was recently hired as an intern for a nonprofit. On my first day, the Executive Director, who was supposed to be training me, was extremely degrading and patronizing in his behavior. He scolded me for not doing my job, and often wouldn't even explain exactly what I had done wrong. When he told me that I had a bad attitude and that if I didn't watch out he'd hire someone else, he wouldn't give me any examples of what I had actually done wrong. After giving me a task, he would call me over to his desk every 20 to 30 minutes to remind me that work had to get done fast. 

During that same day, there was another woman (S) ""shadowing"" me. Rather than sitting down for an interview, my employer had asked this woman to donate a day of work so that he could observe her at work. He did the same thing with me. He was also very rude to this woman and almost had her in tears. 

At the end of the day, He refused to give me employment papers even though I had already worked a full day.

The next day, I sent my employer this email explaining how I felt about the situation:

I wanted to write you an email to say how very disappointed I am at how I was treated at work yesterday. Not only were you extremely rude to me, but you were unjustly rude to S. Even though you may think of her as a job applicant, she was also a volunteer, and deserves to be treated with the respect and dignity of a volunteer. In my view, even if you do not believe S's work was up to par as a paid intern, she should have at least been thanked for the work that she did do. I have worked with hundreds of volunteers while serving with AmeriCorps, and in that time I have learned that there is a huge range of natural ability and an even greater difference in learning styles. However, almost every single volunteer I have ever encountered--from eleven to eighty years of age--have, at the very least, been deserving of thanks and respect for trying their hardest,

I really do believe that ---- is doing some of the most important work of our time. The modern food industry is literally poisoning the population and we need to stop this trend. I would love to be part of an organization that is doing this great work, but I am not willing to sacrifice my self-respect in the process. I have come to this organization with years of work experience, an education, and superb writing skills that I am happy to utilize for very meager earnings. I love to work hard and I also love to be pushed to be better--but this push must come from a stance of positivity or else we will both be miserable people. I want a happy working environment for myself because I deserve it and because positivity will encourage me to thrive at whatever I attempt.

I understand that you are under a lot of pressure and the lack of sleep might be making you irritable. I am actually concerned that your lack of sleep might be affecting your judgement. You might not even be aware that your behavior is pushing people away and might be the cause of your inability to retain a reliable staff. If after a good night's sleep you believe that you can be polite and treat me with dignity, then I would be happy to return to work on tomorrow. But if you truly believe that you acted justly towards me yesterday, then I quite, because I will not stand for that sort of treatment. 

Sincerely,

H

Of course I never heard a word back.

I truly do believe this man is having some mental and emotional issues. He tended to blank out a lot without realizing it. At one point during the day, he asked me a question that involved multiplying 16 by 2. When I answered 32 he just stared at me with wide eyes until I spelled it out again. The man was actually wearing a shirt that said ""sleep is for the weak,"" and had made at least a few comments about living his work day and night. 


 I would like to contact the board of directors about this incident but I can't find a list anywhere. Can anybody help?"

:--|:--
[Have you encountered any stalkers ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654j6p?context=5)|Yes. And I've told Craig to stop. 
[I've seen a few instances where it seemed like you genuinely cracked Craig Ferguson up. Which time was your favorite? Is adlibbing jokes that cause the host to lose it encouraged?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654rqf?context=5)|Ad-libbing with intent to crack up is always encouraged. I'm particularly proud of the ""you gotta place there"" bit, which has become legendary. We're always making one another laugh.
[Hey Josh!  Follow you on facebook all the time!  Two questions here: First, have you ever said or done anything on the show that you got in trouble for? Second, is it the same two guys in Secretariat or do they just swap interns or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654n99?context=5)|Once. It was the last time I did Geoff as a drunk robot. For some unknown reason, it didn't go over well. That was the last time. And Secretariat is a real horse! How dare you! ;)
[What's it like working with the one and only Craig Ferguson?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654iky?context=5)|A treat. It's a dance out there. You gotta be quick. I'm honored he lets me play along.
[I know in the old studio they had you near Lesbian Row, where do they have you now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654oab?context=5)|Near Lesbian Row. CBS cares.
[JRT, I'm a big fan of your work on the LLS and your youtube stuff, but I do have a legit question. I've seen your name next to some scientology stuff, is that true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654k5t?context=5)|I did some acting stuff for them for a while, but I am definitely NOT a Scientologist.
[Who's that at the door?!?!??!!?!?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c65585f?context=5)|If you could see me, you'd know I was doing the dance. In my boxers. Probably better NOT to see me.
[Hi Josh.  How much of your bit is scripted, and how much do you come up with on the fly?  P.S. You are funny as hell !!  You and Craig make a great team.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654mcq?context=5)|Nothing Craig and I do together is scripted. Rarely a writer might work in a line or two, but that's it.
[The Late Late Show was great, but you helped make it amazing. One of the best shows on TV, period. Where do you sit while controlling the puppet? Can you tweet or facebook a photo of you in action sometime from the set? Keep up the fantastic work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654liw?context=5)|Thanks! I'd rather not show the controls or where I am. Gotta keep some of the mystique.  But I'm near the lesbians.
[Did you ever sit in the Richard Roundtree table at Luigi's? Did you prefer the Agora or Peabody's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654ldb?context=5)|The viral thing means very little to me. I mean, it's cool and all for promotion. But I know guys, professionals, who live and die by that stuff. That it was pulled is stupid and speaks to the stupidity of things today. It's like, here, I've made something that so many people love and respond to immediately and is an overnight sensation, and it gets ruined because a few people got a stick up their ass. Sad.
[Also--which surprises you more: going viral or having the video pulled 24 hours later?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654ldb?context=5)|The Agora.
[What happened to the creepy Secretariat!!!  I loved that, why isn't there anymore?  Somebody explain this to me!  And now to quote Arnold Schwarzenegger: arghalalghagharala.  Also you are awesome in every way.  Thankyou for making my life brighter.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654lm4?context=5)|Creepy Secretariat is around. We did some tonight, actually. But Craig and I get tired of certain things quickly. It comes and goes.
[I realize the Late Late Show probably takes up a considerable amount of time for you, but do you have any other big projects/events/venues/thingies coming up? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654j1w?context=5)|Actually, the Late Late Show takes up not too much. In the meantime, I do stand-up, voices for videos games, cartoons, side projects. And I am currently developing some shows of my own...
[Is there any way we could possibly hear a Morgan Freeman gangster rap?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654i7y?context=5)|Maybe. But according to Mr. Freeman's lawyers, I'll have to show my face when I do it. 
[Mouth organ or awkward pause?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c655e4y?context=5)|Mouth organ.
[Hey Josh! I've been a big fan for awhile and its been great watching your rise to success.  What's the one person you would absolutely love to do a project with? Like if they called you up today, you would immediately agree before they even finished asking you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654kct?context=5)|Larry David. Sascha Cohen. Anyone from Arrested Development.
[What kind of animals? Can you do a dolphin??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c655gpe?context=5)|Like, the voice? Or have sex with? Cause I can do both. Blowholes can do wonders.
[How did Geoff know he was gay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c655aki?context=5)|C-3PO gave him a 'tingly feeling' in his lug nut.
[What's it like being the voice of a character and not the face?  Do you sometimes feel like you wish you were able to be on screen as yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654it2?context=5)|All the time. On the show, it works. Having another actual person as a sidekick would be strange. But I've got a number of other projects that you'll see my face in.
[What is your favorite joke to tell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654pd1?context=5)|I really love having Geoff say that he has his robot friends over for a party. And always having Robby the Robot not be invited because he's a dick. I laugh at strange things.
[What are the chances we'll ever see you as a ""real"" guest on the show?  I've always thought it would be interesting to see you guys interact without the robot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654i12?context=5)|Not likely on the show, but I am starting to tour with Craig on his stand-up gigs. Playing the Venetian in Vegas all next weekend. 
[Oh! Another question: You know how you and Craig have done Paris week and Scotland week...any chance of Australia week in the future? What or who determines those destinations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c655709?context=5)|Who determines those destinations are powers far beyond mine (see: suits). Australia has been talked about though...
[How did you get into the acting business?  What motivated you to do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654lxx?context=5)|Growing up and only child in Cleveland. That'll do it. I've been doing voices and theatre since I was 8 or 9. It's been a part of me nearly my entire life.
[As someone who often tries his hand at impressions, what is your process behind assuming the voice of a celebrity like Morgan Freeman? Take us behind the scenes, if you could. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654kz7?context=5)|Listening is the main key. Other than that, everyone's technique is different. Can't reveal the trick!
[What do you think of the new LLS studio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654jf0?context=5)|I didn't like it at first. Change is tough. But now I love it! Great new energy to the show.
[Any perks being in a new studio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654sas?context=5)|More lesbians.
[Why does Secretariat look so much more like a serial killer in the new lighting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654rba?context=5)|It's the eye shadow.
[Love the show! You and Craig are quite the duo.  How was it when you guys took the show to France? Will Geoff ever move his other arm? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654yb1?context=5)|Thank you! France was cool. Scotland went much smoother. Geoff will prob never move the other arm. It's funnier that way. Poor robot.
[Is there a city/state Geoff doesn't have a place at?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654sc7?context=5)|Des Moines. Tax evasion.
[What ever happened to the old skits that Craig used to do? Like the Ask Aquaman bit, the Prince Charles and Sean Connery impressions, and one of my all-time favorite LLS bits, his James Bond audition tape?  Are they just one of those things Craig got tired of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c655bio?context=5)|Yeah, skits come and go. But it was also a space issue. Now that we have a bigger studio, you'll see more sketches.
[One of the only chances I'll probably ever get the chance to ask... But...  May I please have an autograph from you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654shl?context=5)|Sure! Send something to CBS in Television City.
[Would this be the address I would send it to?  CBS.  ATTN: Josh Robert Thompson.  7800 Beverly Boulevard.  Los Angeles, CA 90036 ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654vgr?context=5)|That's the one!

[I know you and Craig don't rehearse, but do you at least email or text each other before each show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654md7?context=5)|Nope. We prefer no to discuss the show at all beforehand. Very pure form of improv.

[Hey Josh! You're hilarious on TLLS!  If you could give Geoff more mobility, what would you have him be able to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654pog?context=5)|Thanks! He's more mobile now that he's an entirely self-contained robot, rather than being plugged into the wall. 
[If Geoff had flesh, who would he resemble?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c655jjm?context=5)|Ricardo Montalban.

[Have you ever used the GP voice on accident while not performing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654od4?context=5)|No. I don't use his voice at all when I'm not doing the show.

Rachel is HOT!
[Hi Josh. Huge fan of TLLS, you/Geoff, Craig. Thanks for doing this IAmA!  Is there anyone's voice who you have really wanted to be able to impersonate, but even after practice and study just haven't been able to nail? (insert creepy Craig face here from the double entendre\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c655kl3?context=5)|Not really. I think Ben Stiller, maybe. One of the things I do is called voice matching for movies. When an actor is not available, I record some of their dialogue.

[Does Geoff have something going on with the Reddit robot guy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c655g8j?context=5)|Probably. He's a sex robot.

[Have you ever been appauld by the behaviour of the guests on the show? Was there anyone that got very offended or just didnt want to be there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c655g0t?context=5)|Can't name names, but a few people have been upset that their funny, controversial statements were cut from the show.

[What is your relationship with Secretariat like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c6555jz?context=5)|I fear him. It's best not to look directly into his eyes.
[Some of the best stuff (if not the best stuff\) on the show is when you and Craig interact. Has there ever been any discussion of expanding your interactions? Or do you guys even talk about how the show will go?  I just want to see more of Craig and Geoff. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c654yk2?context=5)|Thank you! No, we prefer not to plan ahead at all. The one time we did it ruined everything. 
[Why was the big cash prize reduced? Was SAG or Morgan Freeman's lawyers to blame?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zjhae/i_am_josh_robert_thompson_actorcomedian_geoff/c655byx?context=5)|Not sure. I'm just the robot, man. ;)

zjjod,9,2012-09-08,Questions about post-college job prospects as a CompSci major.,qaruxj,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/zjjod/questions_about_postcollege_job_prospects_as_a/,"**tl;dr:** Are the claims of a massive shortage of CompSci majors true, and if so are the available jobs going to be mostly good or mostly bad? Finally, will the salaries still be as good, or will they somehow decrease and become more comparable with other STEM degrees?

I've seen a few articles talking about how there's going to be some huge shortage of Computer Science majors in the US come 2016 (which is about the time I'll be graduating), which obviously seems like good news insofar as it means I should definitely have a job. However, I have a couple of questions about that.

First, as context, I'm taking on *a lot* of debt to go to college. My family is quite poor and so I'm basically taking the maximum amount of loans I can get, since my university doesn't like to give scholarships to freshmen. Later, I expect this to subside since I'll be getting a job, hopefully scholarships, and will also be required to do a couple of paid internships my senior year that will pay $40,000, which obviously should help me out quite a lot, but I'm nonetheless worried about the prospect of having tens of thousands in loans, much of them accumulating debt over the 4+ years (my department says that, due to their internships, the average graduation time is actually four years and a term, and since I'm not some kind of crazy amazing student, I expect that I will probably do at least that).

Right now, I'm really excited for CompSci, but I know that a lot of people do change their majors and end up pursuing something completely different from what they started out with. I really don't think I could bring myself to major in something like English or History, having seen what's happening to all these people who've graduated with way better and more specific degrees and still failed to find a job, but I want to know how accurate these shortage claims are. Employment opportunities are not my only concern, because I do want to major in something that interests me, but when I see these claims that other Engineering degrees aren't experiencing much of a shortage while Computer Science majors are looking at crazy opportunities in four years' time, it really makes me want to stick with CompSci at all costs, just so I know I can have a good job that pays decent money.

Getting to actual questions:

First, are these claims even true at face value? I've seen a number of articles claiming flat out that this is a myth and that demand for CompSci majors is being greatly overstated. Some of them seemed rather dubious to me, but I feel like that might just be me being biased after having heard about there being a shortage of millions of CompSci majors and demand so high that salaries will be ridiculously good compared to the national average, which obviously sounds really appealing and too good to be true, but also would be so beneficial to me in terms of job opportunities and salary that it's hard for me to really weigh it equally.

Related to that, are there any ""gotchas"" that could turn this from true to not true really quickly? I read one article saying the response to the shortage should be decreased immigration restrictions, but I don't know to what extent that would change things. Is there anything with a reasonable chance of happening (so not an asteroid strike or WWIII) that would drastically alter my job prospects that I should be aware of?

Second, what are these jobs actually going to be like? I'm really interested in software engineering/development and databases, but I'm kind of worried that most of these jobs will be glorified IT jobs or something that won't really be what I'm interested in. I'm assuming the huge glut of jobs would have enough diversity that it wouldn't be a problem, but if it's a million small business owners who want me to set up their network for them and build a custom Access database to track their orders in, I'm probably not going to be very happy.

Third, I know software engineer salaries are really good right now, but is this expected to stay the same? I assume the increased demand would mean higher salaries all around, but if it's the small businesses I mentioned or something like that, I could see them going down because they're mostly intended to replace whatever the owner or their kid threw together and not increased demand in the same way that every major company needing a lot more software developers would be. I guess this is a largely irrational concern, but the reason I bring it up is, if I would end up making a similar salary to any of the other jobs that might interest me, I would not be quite as attached to CompSci as I am now.

Thanks for any help with this."

What were your most favorite and least favorite jobs?",Journeyman42,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zm9q5/reddit_what_is_your_job_history_what_were_your/,"I started a new job a couple weeks ago, and it made me realize how many jobs I've had.  I'm a 26 year old guy.

February 2001-August 2004: high school part-time job as a bus boy at a restaurant.  It wasn't too bad, but my boss left halfway through and her replacement didn't like me and stuck me on coffee detail, which I didn't mind because customers suck.  Left because I was starting college.

October 2004-May 2006:  part-time job at college campus food court.  Included work at Burger King, a taco place, and a panini place.  Left because serving food to high/hungover college students sucks.

Summers of 2005-2010: full-time seasonal cleaning assistant during the summer at first an elementary school for the first four years, then at a high school for the last year.  It wasn't too bad of a job, I didn't have to deal with customers and I could wear headphones while I cleaned.  Also the other janitors were laid back dudes who took hour breaks while only clocking out for a half hour.  Yeah, our tax dollars at work lol.  It wasn't bad money either.  Elementary and high school kids are equally messy, but the high school kids are definitely far more malicious about it.  I saw some little bastards throw their soda bottle at the feet of one of the other janitors and demanded that he throw it away.

September 2006-December 2006: part-time job as a cleaning person at a hotel.  Don't ask why I got it.  I sucked pretty hard at it as they needed the rooms perfectly cleaned in too little time, which I couldn't manage.  Left because job sucked and I sucked at it, and I found a better job.

February 2007-December 2008: part-time geology lab tutor at the university I went to.  I found out that geology minors can also be lab tutors, and they had need for one, so I did that until I graduated.  It was pretty good other than the students bitching about why they needed to take earth science classes (the school has a pretty big business and nursing colleges).  After I graduated, the economy had pretty much bottomed out and I didn't find work (aside from that seasonal cleaning assistant job I mentioned earlier) until fall 2009, when I was living with my parents and spending too much time on the internet.

September 2009-May 2010: Substitute teacher at the middle and high school level.  Found out that the only requirements you need to become a substitute teacher in my state are any 4-year degree and a clean criminal record, and I had both.  High school kids suck.

December 2010-January 2011: I wasn't getting asked enough to substitute teach so I took a job at a restaurant as a waiter.  The restaurant had just opened and the guy that owned it, who owned a bar previously, picked a really shitty manager to run it.  It was supposed to be a part-time job but increasingly worked more hours because other servers would call in ""sick"" or just not fucking show up.  Kitchen was too small to keep up with orders when the restaurant was food so I got a lot of complaints from people bitching about their food taking too long.  Eventually fired on a day I literally wasn't supposed to be there (I was covering for someone who asked to take the day off and I accepted) because of some customer's bullshit claim.  This was the shift after a particularly brutal steak night and, after I clocked out, the owner bought me a beer at the bar to thank me for working so hard.  Customers still suck.  One of two jobs that I would say were my least favorite.

It was during my time at the restaurant that I realized I should probably go back to school, because my 4 year degree wasn't helping with shit.  I eventually picked a 2 year degree in a biotechnology lab technician program at a tech school in the nearest big city from home.  After I got fired, I realized that I could apply to substitute in multiple school districts, and eventually was working at least two days a week (it paid about 100 dollars a day, depending on what the district paid).

September 2010-December 2011: Tutor at tech school.  I was randomly walking down the hallway near the library when I saw an ad for gen ed tutors.  I was virtually hired on the spot due to my geo lab tutoring.  I tutored mainly for chemistry, biology, and earth science because all the other tutors specialized in either math or English, though I did have to help with English and math sometimes.  Was a pretty sweet gig at first, I tutored at night and the last hour of the day was pretty much dead, so I could do my own homework or dick around on the computers, waiting for people to show up.  However, the next two semesters I switched to tutoring mornings and it was busier.  Left because there's only so many times you have to explain what a meter is or what chemical bonds are before you snap.

May 2011-May 2012: part-time research assistant to a PhD student internship at UW-Madison.  My first lab tech job.  I got it by asking one of my profs at the tech school (who did research at UW) if she knew of any open positions, and they created one for me.  PhD student researches iron-reducing bacteria that live in anaerobic conditions in sediment or rock.  I had to perform a lot of chemical assays, chromatography, and some molecular biology to sequence ID the bacteria in the samples.  Easily my most favorite job yet.  I had to leave after I graduated because it was a student-only position.

January 2012-May 2012: part-time lab tech internship at a bioenergy company.  Though it was more chemcial-oriented than biotech-oriented, it was a good time.  Would be instrumental later.

May 2012-July 2012: full-time (finally!) ""lab tech"" position at a huge contract research biotech/chemistry company.  Got the job through a recruiter who upsold the fuck out of it by saying I could transfer to a new department pretty much any time I wanted to.  The company was starting a new contract project that included refabbing existing build space and would last for six-ish months.  However, when I started working, I realized my error.  The specific department was sample prep for food chemistry, which involved putting cereal and other food into blenders and then dumping liquid nitrogen on them to send to the actual chemists.  I also did sample pitching, which was going through all the boxes of archived samples and then pitching (ie, throwing away) the expired samples.  I had to work near the trash compactor, which, due to the 100+ degree weather we had this summer, stunk the entire area to high hell.  I was let go because they overestimated the amount of people they needed for the project and apparently the other person was more of the drone-type they were looking for.  I was miserable there and was actually happy to be fired.

The job hunt after I was fired, however, wasn't too bad.  Like I said, I got a job a couple weeks ago at a startup that researches battery electrolytes, and it pays much better than the food chemistry place did.  And no garbage smell.  I'm also taking a night class this next year in Stem Cell Technologies, so hopefully that pans out after I get my certificate and I can finally get a stable full-time job."

zm0px,3,2012-09-09,"Here goes nothing.  Sorry, this is long.  It's years of explanation that have been pent up. ",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/zm0px/here_goes_nothing_sorry_this_is_long_its_years_of/,"I feel pathetic posting this on a public forum.  I guess I'm just looking for someone who would have some kind of reason or even can relate to what I've been going through almost my entire life.

I can remember my first thought of suicide at the age of 6.  I wanted to run out into the middle of the street and hoped to get hit by a passing car.  I remember where I was standing in front of my house, looking around to see if anyone saw me, and, then, I started running towards the street; but, I stopped.  My thoughts were, ""What if I don't succeed?  Then I'm going to get the worst beating of my life and still have to suffer through all of this."" 

It's almost 20 years later, and that has been my biggest fear ever since.  I do not want to get others involved, and I do not want to fail.  

At the age of 13, I started cutting myself, and I have been struggling with this off and on throughout the years.  I kept it a really hidden secret for two years until I confided in a close friend about my cutting and about a beating I had received from my father.  That friend then called the cops, and they came over to my house.  I told them that my father didn't beat me because I didn't want to see him go to jail; they took pictures of my scars from cutting and threatened to take me away if I did it again.  After the cops left, I kept getting yelled at for being a stupid, ignorant bitch for getting my father in trouble like that and for doing those things to my body.  I can understand this view of things.  I really can, but the cutting, for me, is almost like an addiction.  It has been my only friend during my depression and sadness.  The release is almost euphoric.  And, just the thought of how wonderful harming myself feels, gets me excited for the release that I could feel from the pain of suicide.

I have been planning my suicide for a very long time now.  I've had the gun to my head; I've had the rope around my neck.  I just haven't gone through with it because attempting suicide is like a gamble.  I do not want someone that I love to have to clean up a mess.  I do not want to have to see my mutilated corpse.  I don't want them to be the first to find me.  I wish there was just a place that could assure me that I will die and that the people that I love will not be able to view any part of it.  

I'm very confident in my choice to commit suicide.  I know that I will do it one day.  I just need to find the perfect way to do it.  

Lately, I have been thinking more heavily about it.  The only times that I don't think about suicide is when I feel like I have purpose in life and when someone is relying on me.  How pathetic, huh?  I see no point in having a life that imposes such burdens and frustration on others.  

I'm a complete failure.  I had my first professional internship in the engineering field before I even graduated high school.  I was accepted to some of the most prestigious colleges in the states.  I had a wonderful plan to marry my now ex-fiance (of 5.5 years) and have a family with him.  But, now, I was denied the ability to go to these colleges because my parents did not want me so far away.  And, even after going to a local college, I couldn't finish school due to finances.  That wonderful ex cheated on me with 5 girls in the time we were together and stole my virginity.  I can't even walk into my church for help in fear of getting excommunicated because I had sex with my ex.  My life is a complete waste now.  And, I would really like to be able to find a way to end it as soon as I can. 

Has anyone else felt this way for so long?  Do you know why?  Did you ever get over it?  How?

I like the company, I like the people, etc. I get paid the standard internship rate per hour and yeah, I'm pretty happy with it.

I work on multiple different products. Basically, every new product our company comes out with, I am responsible for a feature or two. The majority of my work though, is maintaining, updating, + testing our internal tools for software development ( we have our own language, own server architecture, and our own IDE.

Other than that, I would say about 40-50% of my remaining time I spend programming internal data reports ( work a little bit with R and integrate it into our own language) and also programming electronic forms.
So far, I've been at this company for about a year, but I definitely think that I can stay for the long haul if I'd like to.

As I'm taking more Comp Sci classes, I'm noticing some people are completing multiple short internships with big(ger) name companies (bigger than the company I work for). So, this is my question:

**To Potential Employers, would multiple internships(say, 4-6 months each) at mid to large size companies look more attractive than one job (focused on programming in JavasScript, Python, and some c#) that I stayed at for 5 years?**

Some people are advising me that It may look better for me to have 5 years experience on my resume than 2 or 3 five month internships. The only reason I've been questioning.that is because the company is not, you know, a huge company (it's not considered the number one tech place to work in my area or anything)


One of my other concerns, regarding internships, was the work they do. Most of my friends complain about how the work they do at their internships is quite **menial and boring**...(Sort of makes sense, too. Interns at my current company get all the busy/boring work as well).
Looking at it from the HR perspective, would my title be more respected than the title of intern?

Currently, my title is Junior Programmer and I feel that HR departments will consider that a notch or two higher than the title of intern...One of the HR guys I've talked to advised me to stay at my current job(especially since I think I have good chances of being promoted in in the next 4 years while I'm in college) because it would make my salary for my next job a bit higher than it would be for the average student who completed a few interns. Not that I necessarily agree with all this HR crap, but the more I think about it and the more people I meet, this seems to be increasingly true.


**TLDR: What looks more attractive on a resume: multiple short internships or one position held for 5 years?**

Note: I'm also fairly positive that I have room to grow(position-wise) at my current company."

Ever since I was a little tyke, my mom would read to me every single day. I remember being two or three years old and reading the book along with my mom in my mind. When I got to first grade, I never struggled with reading. It was just like reading the Cat in the Hat or Green Eggs and Ham with mom, except with different wording. In first grade, I was placed in the back of the room because the other students would get discouraged whenever I raised my hand, because I was right almost every time. 

Being the youngest child, I suffered from the traditional ""look at me"" syndrome. As a result, I really liked being the smartest kid in class. It brought me attention that was looked fondly upon in society, and it brought me a sense of superiority over other students, even if I only ever recognized that concept in my mind while playing with my friends during recess or interacting in class.

As we progressed in elementary school, I remember one day where I realized that being able to read better than everyone else was a skill I no longer had, as everyone was essentially on the same page (ha, pun). I then proceeded through middle school without ever getting any grade lower then a B, because that was my only way to maintain my edge that I had cherished so much as a 1st grader. 

High school progressed, and I basically ran the table. Valedictorian, Homecoming King, Class President, full academic scholarship to college, and above average in the sports I played in. 

The driving force behind so much of that was still maintaining that edge. I made the connection between money and power. In 1st grade, reading Harry Potter may have put me ahead of everyone else, but as adults, having a six or seven figure salary was the trick. 

If you look at the definition of psychopath, it includes having shallow emotions, superficial charm, impulsiveness, and a need for stimulation. I certainly feel for others I'd like to think, but I would be flat-out lying if I solely judge myself when talking to others to see if I can am dominant or not. 

I workout several days a week, and although I am not physically imposing (5' 9''), I still have a very muscular build and am in very good shape, as it is important to me that people can see me and respect me at first glance for being ripped or in great shape. 

In college, I currently have an internship at a large firm and am majoring in Accounting and Management. I chose these majors because although science may provide a steady stream of high-paying jobs, the opportunity in the financial world to get mega-rich was very alluring to me. 

I sometimes wonder if too much of my life has been centered around wealth and power (wealth in itself is a symbol of power). Has this internal motivation of mine provided me with great amounts of opportunity and success? I'd think yes. But at what cost? I know that I am hopelessly screwed if I fail, because I will have failed at basically everything I have ever worked for in my life. 

And for what it's worth, movies like Ocean's 11, Dark Knight, and Dark Knight Rises intrigue me to no end because the villains or freakin' Danny Ocean have such thorough plans executed that put the balls of their opponent right in the clenched fist. And I wonder to myself if I could ever pull off such a feat? So many criminals in today's world are seemingly foolish. I am curious to know if I could ever break the system and get away with it, like a Ponzi Scheme that never gets ousted. 

Am I alone? Have any of you corrupted your thoughts or motivations like I do? So many of my friends don't have that natural killer instinct that I do when it comes to striving for success. I know I can't be the only one. 



tl;dr Everything in my life has been driven by power and money, and Bane and the Joker are my idols. "

Some Halo PC modding. Mods ranged from simple projectile replacement (ex: make a sniper rifle fire rockets) and eventually some which reworked the combat system (made it melee only or removed shields entirely) and toying with how vehicles worked.

Attempted mapping in Jedi Knight 3. I eventually *did* come close to completion of a small map with functioning lighting and spawns, but no AI routing.

While it's not technically modding, I avidly used the Forge map editing tool for Halo 3/Reach. I have 10+ fully-functioning maps and many more which are unfinished.

I developed a few Flash games last year as part of a larger technology class, focusing mainly on web design. Most of this class was HTML and the like, but Flash was covered. I also learned C++ and Java in unrelated classes earlier in my school career.

I've been cut off from tools for a while now though, as the only computer in the house is my dad's laptop from 2008. I already have a student license for 3DS Max, but nowhere to install it. I plan on making a few trial items for Team Fortress 2, I believe my experience in mapping from JK3 may aid me in familiarizing myself with Max.

Now then, on to the questions. Since I am now a senior in high school, I need to start planning for college. I have heard from a professor at a local university that a Computer Science degree will get me farther than degrees such as game design or game programming. Is this true? Any courses I should strongly consider?

My dream studio job is as an environmental artist (mapping and architecture) at either Valve Software or Bungie (big surprise, given the 3 listed Halo titles). They ask for professional experience in the industry, what's a good way to *start* and get some professional experience?

My school has a game design club. But like most amateurs, probably +80% is composed of idealists who think they're making a AAA-level game as their first project. I've stopped attending because of this mindset, as I believe they're getting almost nowhere with this sort of goal. Should I attend and do what I can? Or should I find something more productive in my free time?

**TL;DR:** Is computer science a strong degree for college if I want to be in the gaming industry? If not, what would you suggest? What colleges offer the best courses in that degree? Where do I begin to get the often-requested ""professional experience""? Is it a good or bad idea to attend my school's game design club, no matter how unrealistic their ideas are? Also unlisted, is an internship at any local studios a good way to get some first-level experience?"

I'm in Computer Science and I'm looking from some life advice from you guys, I strongly need it.

Currently, I have a CEGEP DEC in Management Information Systems (Mostly about building IT systems, Done 2 internships as well). As a result of that, Concordia credited me 4 classes, which are: Object Oriented Programming I and II, System Hardware, and Statistics Math. I'm stuck in a situation where I have to take a bunch of generic I don't really want because I need at least 4 classes to get my loans/grants. I'm sort of getting bored over this, because I'm not going to have anything programming/production related for a whole year because I need to do Math for Computer Science and the ENCS writing class before doing anything.

I'm pondering what I should do about this. I've been thinking of looking into foreign study programs because I'd like to go study in the United States at some point, and maybe move to the American east coast eventually. Now, that's the other problem, I'm currently in the Computer Games option, and looking at the state of the games industry right now sort of scares me, and I'd like to immigrate to the US after a bachelor or a masters, I'm thinking of changing options, but I don't know what to pick or who to ask advice from on the matter.

I do have my own projects, and I'm currently okay with my finances, but I'd like to get involved somewhere where I can further my skills or put my skills to use, I've done the conception of a few IT systems while in cegep, the cegep also hired me for a contract after I finished in June to build an online system for a department in the cegep. I'm wondering if the university itself offers any possibility for students to help with research in the faculty of computer science, or if there's a possibility for me getting a part-time job somewhere, pocket money wouldn't hurt.

Another thing I'm pondering about is what I'm supposed to do to study, I'm not sure how to take notes during a lecture, and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to study. I usually go over the material covered in class, do exercises if applicable, and try to understand the material.

Anyone can help me with these issues?"

* Summer internship - Fortune 10 company - Worked on scripting project
* ~2yrs of phone technical support
* President of CIS Student Organization, was VP who handled website 
* MTA in Database Design 

Our organization is part of a national organization that puts on regional and national conference. These include contests. I took home 1st in the Application Development and 3rd in Database Design.

Next Question

I have a full time offer from the internship with a great starting salary/benefits. It wouldn't be guaranteed programming, but I could choose to have a technical career there. I'm looking at other opportunities in different cities within my state, so how should I, if possible, use my current offer to my advantage?

How is my resume looking as far as a candidate for software development?


Thanks!

I'm a 22 year old bisexual male, I've got a B.Sc. in a fairly broad computing/communications/media type degree (I'm trying to be a little vague here, I don't want to give away too much info that could be used to I.D me due to some family issues relating to my sexuality). I'm going on a one year internship visa, so any job I get must be at least semi related to my degree, but I'm really hoping to be able to find a job somewhere that will sponsor me for a H1-B visa so I can stay in the U.S. I'm willing to do pretty much whatever I need to in order to get by and make this work, be that slinging drinks at a bar for a while or cooking meth and dissolving dead bodies in barrels of acid. 

There are a few places I don't particularly want to live if I can avoid it, but I'd go there if it was my only option for a job. They are: California, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Maryland, Illinois, Connecticut, Michigan or Hawaii. 

I've been trying to read up on places online for the past week, but I think its better to hear from people who actually live somewhere rather than try to decide based on online statistics and articles.

zto3e,3,2012-09-13,I am worse than pathetic...,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/zto3e/i_am_worse_than_pathetic/,"I don't really know where else to turn to.  I have friends and family that would lend an ear and want to help, but for some reason I just can't face it, and I think in part I just don't really know how to describe what's going on... I guess I'm hoping that it might be easier for me to type it to strangers...

I have everything going for me... I'm in good health, I'm a good looking guy, I am widely recognised as being one of the most intelligent persons others meet, I have one of the best educations money can buy.  

I had a beautiful and amazing girlfriend all through college, an exceptional young woman in many respects, that I by and large neglected and didn't know or try hard enough to treat right.  She stood by me anyway because she knew that I was not in a good place in college, and she believed in my potential.  I hated education.  By the time it got to graduating from college, I was so good at doing the least amount of work possible to get the necessary grades, that I could learn entire courses from scratch in one or two days and get As.  I did the degree that was as difficult as possible for everyone else that I could imagine, but that I found exploitatively easy: theoretical physics.  I always liked physics, but the reality is that I did it at college because it is easy for me.  I'm sure some of you can relate to this.

As a result of my severe lack of engagement with my education, I turned to pot, video games, and the internet primarily through college to pass the time, which of course steadily built a number of bad habits, making me have destructive/evasive reactions to emotional discomfort, very bad work ethic, and a growing depression/dissatisfaction with my inability to apply myself to things that I thought were productive.  I can't count the number of times I've finished an epic video game, and then mournfully looked at the stats realising that at the end of the day, all that time means absolutely nothing.

I graduated college two years ago, and I moved away from my girlfriend back to my family to try to start a career.  I knew that the last few months had been particularly hard for her, since I'd been in a particularly depressive and dysfunctional state.  She'd been working for a year while I was in my final year of college, and it really contrasted against my life-style.  We agreed that I'd go home to my family after college and start to build a career, with the aim that not far down the road we could move to be in the same city.  For some reason, she decided that it would be better for us, two months after I moved away after college, that we go on a break.  I tried my best to fight that, but she wouldn't budge, and after a month or so of being extremely upset I finally caved in.  I was very upset that she had broken her promise to me only two months before, and that she didn't seem to care that I was agonized by what was going on.

Life went on though.  I got an internship at a pretty cool little company, and I dated a few girls too.  I got progressively more depressed with work though, and the girls I was dating were all not even in the same league of quality as my ""ex"", which made me even more lonely and hurt by what she did.  Eventually I found myself drinking too much in the evenings (I'd given up pot entirely then), working alone at the office and incapable of getting much of anything done but procrastination.  Ultimately the boss of the company and I decided I should work part time from home instead of full time, and while I did do that for a couple weeks, I ended up just falling into a depressive rut, returning to pot and video games, and somehow I managed to stop communicating with my (ex)boss for long enough that it became so awkward that I just couldn't bring myself to contact him.  I was living with a friend at the time and he eventually got fed up with my dysfunctional lifestyle too.

My ex-gf and I were in contact throughout the year, and by a stroke of luck really she invited me to come for a holiday with her family back in her home country.  We did have a good time there together, and at one point she actually asked me to marry her.  I was quite taken aback by that and I responded by saying I thought we should get back together as gf/bf first and work on the issues we had from the past before we make that decision, but it was something that I liked the idea of very much.  At the end of the holiday we had a fight.  I was hungry and tired at the end of a long day, and her and her parents randomly stopped at a mall on the way home and started buying her stuff (I don't speak their language fluently).  I was good company for a couple of hours, waited outside a boutique for 30 mins with the sun disappearing, and when she emerged I thought we were going to the car, but on the way she made a move towards a shoe store... I jokingly tried to stop her from going in, and she flipped out on me... I lost my patience and stormed back to the car to wait.  We had a further 5 minute argument in the car about it in front of her parents.  It seems now that as a result of this fight, it tainted the memory of the holiday quite significantly for her.  After I got home from the holiday, she was reluctant to agree to be gf/bf again.  I tried pushing her for a month over the internet/phone on that, before settling down with a reaction where if she would ask me what I did that day, I'd tell her that's an effort I would make for my girlfriend everyday, but it's a lot of bother otherwise to tell someone about your days all the time over IMs.

Behind this I was working on a new career direction, I was teaching myself how to trade financial instruments and getting myself set up with a system for that.  My hope was that I could use it as a way to make plenty of money on my own, and live a life intimately with my family and have time to pursue hobbies.  Unfortunately I never really fixed my bad work ethics, which is even worse when I work alone, and pot had managed to work its way back into my daily life.  About 3 or 4 months after the holiday with my girlfriend last summer, I decided with my mother that it would be good to get professional help for my alcohol/pot issues, and start working on the fundamental self-discipline issues too.  I told my (ex)gf this and she seemed to be happy with that and hopeful.  One month into doing this course (3 hours a day, 4 days a week), I find out from her that she's dating someone else... I tried and tried to tell her that this was really not ok with me, for her to be moving away from me after all that's been said and my efforts to set myself onto the rails... she kept telling me that it really wasn't a big deal, it didn't mean anything, she just missed the thrill of going on dates... and I kept telling her that if she respects my feelings and wants to be careful not to impede my efforts on the course to improve myself, she would stop.  She did finally stop, but not after 5 weeks or so of my being really very upset with her and talking with her almost every day, and not because she cared about my feelings after all, but because she went on a final date with him and decided that he wasn't inspiring enough.

This episode affected me harder and deeper than I realised at the time, it's difficult to describe the agony of feeling like you're losing someone you care about a lot and that you're helpless to stop it.  I came back to the city she was working in as soon as I could, after doing the minimum three months of the course.  I reasoned to myself that this city would be better for me to attempt to day trade financial instruments in too.  When I came back I was still in shock to be honest, and I still hadn't really solved the underlying work ethic issues that ultimately lead me to destructive avoidance behaviours like drinking and smoking and playing too many video games.  I started ok, this was March, and for the first month or two I was making some progress on my work, even though it was slow, and I did enjoy spending time with her, even though I was always feeling discomfort about the unresolved issues.  Her and I and not that good at communicating.  She has a family background that makes her generally quite a quite, private person, who likes to avoid conflict.  As I say too, I also just in part didn't understand what I was feeling towards her, I just knew that I was not happy.

Things started to slide.... she went on holiday, I went off to other places, she was always working and tired when around anyway.... I barely got to see her in person more than one or twice every fortnight, and it just wasn't enough for me to fix my feelings towards her.  I felt betrayed by her, I felt like she didn't really have my back like I thought she did, I felt like she didn't care as much about my future as she so much seemed to from her words... I was just angry and sad... I withdrew from the world... for some weeks the only other person I would see would be my pot dealer (yes, I fell back into pot after a few months back in her city, I just couldn't cope emotionally, but it makes it worse and worse... I know it's desperate).  I just... I just wanted to be alone... but in the end my hiding from the world and being constantly upset towards her, it drove her away.... and now she says that she's given up.  I really don't understand, from my perspective it seems like she's done almost nothing to reach out to me, to make peace with me over what happened, and I'm too stupid and upset to find a way to tell her what's bothering me about her behaviour in a way that gets her to respond to me in the way that I want....

I've reached a point now where I find it hard to eat any more, and I keep having suicidal thoughts.  I'm deeply depressed about the world, I struggle to find hope.  I can't find what I want to do with my life, I can't get myself to work effectively alone, I can't train my body like I want, the girl I thought was of my dreams is slipping away, and I can't tell if she's disappearing because she'll never really be the woman I thought she was and she doesn't know how to treat me in a way that gets the best from me, or if the best thing that ever happened to me is gone because I'm too fucking pathetic.

The only reason I'm not dead already is because I can't bare thinking about the damage it would cause to the people around me, especially my family.  But it's what I really really want right now.  I just want to escape, I can't take it any more.  I'm sorry for so many words, thank you if you listened to me."

I can work out the difficult parts if I get a short summary on the project and what I should make sure make sure I cover with my programing: different types of testing.

It was a tough interview and it certainly wasn't my best but I felt I still did well. Well enough to be offered a position, however it was not the position I wanted nor applied for. 

They offered me a ""*Systems Administrator*"" position possibly thanks to my few years of work experience in a related field. This position will not include any programming per se. It will be technical in nature and therefor I do not see how it can benefit me as I'm trying/hoping to get relevant programming experience and find an internship that can stimulate and aid my growth as a student of CS.
I'm unsure of what to do. The job will come with a few sacrifices, like reducing free-time I'll have available to study, and it will require more daily travel. But it is paid, not much but some.

I wonder if taking the job will help me land the one I wanted when another round of hires happens, but that's a risk. 
If there's no intrinsic value to this job, and no foreseeable long term value... is it worth it?

Please don't try to figure it out; it's probably possible. 

I graduated in May summa cum laude from a top 30 school. I grew up (and live in) a very wealthy town, and there was always something very ""special"" about me, yadda yadda yadda. 

So I go into college, destroy shit. Everyone talks about how great I am. I'm an amazing writer. I produce the type of work people expect out of students at Ivy League advanced degree programs. I have a lot of friends who care about me, which wasn't really true in high school. I loved college. I wrote an amazing Senior Thesis even though I shattered my collarbone in the middle of writing it and had to type with one hand. Everyone told me I should drop out and graduate a semester late, but I powered through it and got all As that last semester. 

Now I can't get a job. The job ""search"" been the most dehumanizing, degrading process in which I've been involved (including being ""initiated"" by a sports team and having to lick a used dildo) and I've felt sick the past few months. Not sick at myself, because I know I'm doing everything right. Sick at the country and sick at other people. 

I made it to the final round at a prestigious med-tech company for a position paying $65k out of college. They told me during the interview that I seemed like a great fit. I killed it at the interview and thought I was guaranteed a job. Two weeks later: rejected, and they wouldn't tell me why. Because of privacy. Whatever that means.

While that was devastating, I don't give up easily. I got to another final round interview for a consulting job at a Top 50 consulting firm and was asked a ridiculous case study question. The answer to the case was demeaning and unfair, and everyone I've spoken to agrees with me. Unsurprised and unruffled when they rejected me. 

This was all during the summer, and now it's fall. I can't find anything. I send out 50 applications a week, and nobody even responds to me. I do everything right. I try to network, and everyone tries to help. I've spoken with 100 alumni so far, and each phone call is the same. They gush over my resume, and then tell me that their company isn't hiring. Sometimes, when there is a position, they personally hand my resume and cover letter to HR, which is pretty much the best thing possible when applying for jobs. Doesn't matter, I don't hear anything back.

I don't want to see my friends anymore because I'm too embarrassed about not having a job. I can't sleep because I just dream about being offered jobs and actually being happy. My career counselor started crying while she was speaking with me because she felt so bad for me and couldn't understand why I wasn't getting interviews. 

I've felt myself become racist. If I weren't a white male, I would have a job now. I blame affirmative action. I'm becoming a cynical asshole. I used to be interested in learning, but now I don't care anymore. I regret picking my college (even though I loved it), my major (loved it), and my internships (loved them). 

For some reason, I can't get myself to apply to a post-grad internship. Money isn't the problem. I'm a very moral person (not my moral compass being amazing, just that I consider the ethics of every action I make), and I can't let myself apply. The thought of working for free contributing to an economy which hates me is a thought that makes me sick. 

I no longer want to contribute to the US economy because I don't believe in the country anymore. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't see what other choice I have. I'm the hero this country deserves, not the one it needs. :)

I don't want to go quietly. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I want to destroy something important. Some action to make everyone realize that this country is not OK, is not safe, and does not offer the opportunity it promises. I've given myself until November 1 to find a job. 

Tell me I'm a fucking dipshit. Don't tell me I'm smart and admirable and worthy, because that's what everyone has told me my entire life.

I do have some programming experience. I took Java and VB in high school, I took a course in C two years ago, and I use Matlab regularly. I honestly can't say I remember that much off the top of my head, but the ability to learn is there. 

I am an excellent communicator. I write and speak well. My experience as a tutor and in customer service have helped me with that.

Here are my current courses for the semester:

* Dynamical Systems

* Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics
* Electricity and Magnetism

I've also taken:

* Numerical Methods

:--|:--
[Thanks for doing this Rep. Ellison!  I am one of your constituents (Fightin' 5th!\) and am wondering how much the political landscape has changed in the last 10 years since you took office in the MN house and then the US house.  I voted for you in 2006 and remember how much attention you got when you swore in using a Qur'an.  Are people still making a big deal out of your religion?  Has it been difficult to get people focus on the issues, like social benefits and tax policy reform, because of your diverse background?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67lvrk?context=5)|Thanks for the question. Things have changed a lot since i began serving in Congress. We're out of Iraq, which is one of the issues I campaigned on. We have a Health Care law that will offer great benefits to people. When I started, it was only a hope.  We went thru a massive financial collapse, and then passed major reform.  When I started in Congress, I never dreamed GM and Chrysler would fail. not only did they fail, the American people picked them back up, and now both are hiring and thriving. When I entered Congress, Obama was an IL state legislator. Now he's President. Also, perhaps most threatening, Citizens United became the law of the land, and it's perverting our politics in a way none of us have ever seen before. So, many changes have occurred. At the end of the day, one thing remains the same: for working Americans to have a better quality of life, we have to organize, come together, and call for a new politics of inclusion and generosity.  
[Do you feel that, as a Muslim, you and your family are watched more closely by your local media?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67lotn?context=5)|No, i feel that my family and i have been treated with respect and fairness. i know many people who have reported unfair treatment, and disrespectful treatment, but that has not been my experience. also, in cases where there has been bigoted or hateful treatment, interfaith groups have stepped forward. for example. when Terry Jones protested in Dearborn to incite against the Muslim community there, a multitude of people of all faiths stood and said ""no.""  so, thanks for asking and please go out and build interfaith understanding.
[I was at OccupyMN and remember seeing you visit the plaza. Would you agree or disagree with this statement ""Money Out Of Politics""? and generally would you support the freedom to protest in the plaza again this year in the same manner? (Will we see you again this year if there is another large turnout at the plaza?\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67mb2x?context=5)|Yes, we need to get money out of politics. Let's do a Constitutional Amendment to overturn Citizen United. And also, let's publicly fund campaigns. In the meantime, let's pass Disclose Act; so, at least we know who's messin' with our elections. I really admire those Move to Amend guys. Sure, I will be happy to hang with the people on the plaza again. 
[What was it like to be on Colbert's Better know a District?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67lrz3?context=5)|Colbert is a cut-up, isn't he? It was really fun doing the ""Better Know a District"". Before we started, Colbert leaned into me and said ""I'm about to become a very different guy"". He was right. Real fun. 
[Is it difficult for you to interact with Rep. Bachmann on a personal level due to her repeated insinuations of ""Islamic infiltration"" of our country and her many demeaning and ignorant comments?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67m0lk?context=5)|No. no personal problems.

[As an absentee Uptown voter, thank you.  Question: Do you think debt reduction is important, and what, if any, measures would you support?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67lyh3?context=5)|Yes, debt reduction is very important. The real issue is how to address it. In the short term, it's more important to get people working. I prefer a major public works program, especially given that we have trillions in unmet infrastructure needs for schools, bridges, power grids, and transmission lines.  But we have a long term debt problem, and it will take a combination of spending cuts and new revenue to fix it.  Dramatic cuts now would cause the loss of public sector workers which increases unemployment.  Four features of any sensible debt reduction: invest in jobs to get more taxpayers to help shrink the debt, increase revenue by closing loopholes and asking the most well-to-do to do a little more, defense must share in the cuts, and finally protect social security, medicare, and medicaid.

If so, what have you done to advance this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67mfez?context=5)|Yes, drug war was always the wrong framing. Let's get rid of mandatory minimum sentencing requirements, crack-cocaine sentencing disparity, etc. i have voted and organized to emphasize public safety over simple retribution, and have argued for a greater role for mental and chemical health.

[The recent push for Voter ID laws both in Minnesota and around the country worries me. It seems like a clear effort to disenfranchise people who would be most likely to vote for democrats (or DFL\). Are you worried about this phenomenon? Do you think democrats will have more trouble in the future if these laws are passed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67m8a1?context=5)|Yes, i am worried about the ballot measure that would put a MN government issued photo ID requirement into the constitution. It would hurt thousands in MN and wouldn't help anything. The massive voter fraud claim is a fraud. But we can still win this. Spread the word. Tell people it's trick to steal their voice. 
[I've been listening and reading about the embassy attacks, and a recurring theme seems to be expressing to Libyans (and other Islamic majority nations\) the concept of democratic freedom of expression.  In your opinion, what would be an effective way the U.S. as a whole and the government could educate those countries on the concept of these freedoms and why they are a cornerstone for free nations? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztnhs/i_am_keith_ellison_us_representative_from/c67mnn1?context=5)|Freedom of expression has historic reference in the middle east. point folks to examples of free expression in their own tradition and urge them to embrace them.

zxp82,2,2012-09-15,19 Year old Guy With a Verbally and Physically Abusive Mother,xx5xx10,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zxp82/19_year_old_guy_with_a_verbally_and_physically/,"Hopefully I explain myself properly, but here goes..

For the past 3 years my mother has grown more and more abusive towards me. All my siblings have moved out of the house and my father is always working; Leaving just me and my mother home most of the day. She is 59, i'm 19. I'm a full time pre-med student who commutes to school, i also have a job along with an internship. My mother spends her free time bullying me to no end. Her goal from morning till night is to convince me I'm: Dumb, wimpy, lazy, a ""sissy"", pathetic, ""i sleep too much"", and i'm a failure. Shes a small old lady with bad arthritis, yet she constantly slaps me in my face, kicks me in my shins, hits me various objects, throws various objects, and pounds on the door to my room.

Basically my mom is a malicious bully who 24/7 is in attack mode. I've pleaded with her to stop treating me this way. She rationalizes her extreme behavior by saying ""This is the way you deserve to be treated"", because of my mothers age she constantly needs my assistance to do basic tasks (work the tv, use the computer, carry groceries out of her car) She takes advantage of this by demeaning me the entire time i'm helping her, and because of guilt, i have to carry on helping her and take it.


My mom has bad arthritis and knows i would never hurt her physically, she takes advantage of this by constantly getting in my face, (then she'll slap me or kick me)


Backstory: My mother has been sick her entire life, but has always been very lucky, and always had an amazing attitude about it. She first got breast cancer, but she received a double mastectomy immediately and was fine. 5 years later she gets ovarian cancer, has her ovaries removed and was completely fine and completely happy. 4 years later her kidneys begin to fail (caused by doctors malpractice) She began dialysis (still happy and loving as ever). But then she received a kidney transplant and everything changed.


Upon coming home from her kidney transplant my mother had developed this evil rotten attitude. Since the surgery her personality has changed. She is on a ton of meds and I'm afraid these have changed her brain chemistry. (just assuming but whatever).
My mother has had an amazing life, wealthy upbringing, loving successful children, loving grandkids (she has 6 little ones). She spends most of her days shopping. and doing whatever she wants. my father is very loving towards her. (he has always worked ridiculous hours, so this hasnt negatively affected their long 40 yr relationship)
Additional info: I've noticed my mother only bullies me and my grandmother (her mother). the first 2 years she desperately tried to hide her crazy tendencies from the rest of the family, and would only lashout in private. Now she can't really control herself and the cats out of the bag. No one really cares to fix her probelm because no one has to deal with it except me, and occasionally my grandmother. everyone just kinda shrugs it off, blaming her age. everyone just tells me to be strong and not to let her bother me.


Also, this has been happening for 3 years, but it has gotten worse this past year, only because we have moved into a new home, our old home had many stairs and it was easy for me to keep my distance from her. Also sound didnt travel far in our old house. In our new home, there are less stairs and sound carries much easier throughout the house.


SHe takes advantage of this by coming and pounding on my door when ever she feels. ""Just to see what i'm up too"", she'll also talk badly about me, to herself, knowing i'll be able to hear her.
She also comforts herself using projection. she's beginning to lose her hearing, so her new thing is that she's trying to convince me i'm deaf.
when she first came home from her kidney transplant, her short term memory and vocabulary became absolutely terrible. I didnt mind because i know she's been through alot, but she began doing everything in her power to convince me i'm an idiot.


I'm desperate for help, hope all this is coherent. Thanks in advance!
If i stick up for myself i feel terrible because i hate yelling all day, if i take her bull shit, i feel terrible for not sticking up to myself. This is ruining my self confidence and just fucking with my head...

**Edit: Should i go through her meds, figure out what she's taking, then mention to her that she should speak to her doctor about this drug?** The odds of her following through with this is slim, but if i hammer the idea that a drug is causing this she might follow through, she's extemely irresponsible, and blaming a drug (even though it may actually be a culprit) might be something she'll follow through with."

zwqg5,1,2012-09-14,Student teaching semester leads to worst time of my life.  Stick with it or change jobs / careers again?,storyblue,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/zwqg5/student_teaching_semester_leads_to_worst_time_of/,"I've graduated with a journalism degree years ago.  After a year of not landing a job, I decided to go back to college for a Teacher Education certification and become a school teacher.  

While taking Teacher Education classes, I landed a summer job in a big hotel (I hate it) to try to make a little more money.  They offered it to me full time and even gave me a supervisor position.  The pay wasn't great and most of the time I just dealt with dumbass customer complaints, but I got to supervisor a big staff in multiple departments and looked neat on a resume.

Well now I'm in the final semester of the teacher education program, where I become a student teacher under the mentorship of an experienced teacher.  She runs the classroom for the most part, but I start out slow, get involved, get my feet wet, and then eventually I take control of the classroom myself for many weeks. 

Unfortunately because of the demand of what is essentially a teaching internship, I made the hard decision to quit my hotel job.  

I regret it.  My mentoring teacher is a bully with a huge chip on her shoulder.  Her temper makes her very difficult to communicate with, let alone get any advice from her.  This particular week took its toll on me when the last comment she gave me caused me to walk into an office and cry in front of some unsuspecting grown men (other teachers).  She's a great teacher in front a students, but she is not very good as a colleague.  I think I maybe not putting in more effort than I should, but I'm still just learning.  It just sucks feeling so isolated.

Even while I was unemployed, I kept positive.  Now I'm more depressed than I ever remember.  I don't think I want to become a teacher any more, and not just because of my bad experiences with the mentoring teacher.  Every day I come home I look for another job to apply to, something as an Editorial Assistant, medical, technical writing or anything to do with publications where my first passion lies.  I now think I don't have what it takes to be a teacher, and even if I learn to be a good, I think it's currently a terrible industry to be in...overworked, low pay, and tremendous abuse.

SO!!!!!:  Do I try to tough it out, turn this around, and stay optimistic for my future as a teacher, despite my faith in the world of teaching becoming broken?  Or should I try for another career?  Should I even bother trying to find a job that can take advantage of my journalism and team management skills?  What do I have to do to become a part of a scientific, technical, or medical publication?  Should I look into it after I get my teaching certificate, or should I just abandon the teaching quest and go back to school yet again?

Sorry if this got a little unfocused, but I'm emotionally drained and I dread the next day I have to go into that classroom.  I just want to give up and try to find something better, but I feel hopelessly under qualified for anything else that's out there.  I could go back to school, but I don't want to return to this same position.

Please help me or offer some advice / insight during the weakest moment of my entire life.

The intern has been going to a german programming school for a while and can hopefully code his way out of a paper bag, but not much more than fundamental concepts of procedural programming (task-centric) and OO on the level of ""class Car : Vehicle"" have been taught. AFAIK they concentrate on teaching the platform (.NET, possibly php) just as soon as they're through with basic language features. I'll be very lucky if they did much more, maybe he's heard of design patterns and some of the more recently introduced (C#) language features - you get the idea.

I am quite experienced and have a broad knowledge, but i am self-taught so i never went through formal CS education, beyond a casual interest in some lectures. So i really don't know very well where to start.

While i have plenty of actual work i could dump on this guy, i want him to actually have a learning experience here.

What i am looking at is basically putting together a small curriculum, starting with evaluating how much he knows and hopefully fixing some bad habits he no doubt picked up, and then some weeks of sitting down and learning something interesting, with practical industry applications (so haskell is ruled out, sorry guys. =D).

What are your ideas - your own experiences while going from beginner to amateur are appreciated. What did you learn that proved useful, what did you wish you had learned that proved useful later?

Some ideas floating around my head:

- Intermediate level OO - working with established design patterns, their uses and limitations, in C#
- Asynchronous programming
- LINQ, anonymous methods, lambda, yield
- Another language, probably python
- c, so he learns pointer arithmetic etc.

A lot of what will actually happen depends on how he picks it up, so don't go into to much detail. Mostly interested in your most positive and negative experiences."
zzged,2,2012-09-16,Anyone else feel this way on meds?,mastaam,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/zzged/anyone_else_feel_this_way_on_meds/,"I'm a 20 y.o female college student, who has been taking ADD meds on and off since elementary school. Right now I'm mostly taking 10mg IR Adderall, but I also have 20mg Vyvanse. I haven't been taking the Vyvanse lately, as when I took it over the summer at my internship it made me feel depressed and anxious. 

On my medicine I feel like I'm never doing enough, and there's always something else that I need to be doing. Everything has to be perfect, and I feel the sudden desire to tackle everything until I burn out. I have also noticed that I feel really compelled to get in contact with people, especially those I've neglected or lost touch with. Since the Adderall isn't a very high dose I always feel the need to pop another one, even if I don't need really to. 

I'm really used to feeling strange on meds (I've tried them all) but I don't like the way they make me feel. I eat and drink a lot of water while taking them, this doesn't really seem to help. I cannot concentrate without my medicine, and the side effects make me very hesitant to take them, despite the fact that I desperately need them. I'm sure I'm not the only one with these feelings, how do you guys deal?

TL;DR: ADD meds make me feel anxious, slightly depressed and over-zealous. I hyper focus on stupid things (both academic and non-academic) and just feel strange over all. How do you guys deal with this? Any personal insight?"

* In my third year, I made a 2 paged resume (I know, breaking all resume rules) and landed a 16 month internship and several other offers. Mentioning my other non-engineering jobs helped me get my internship position (liked the lifeguard role, liked my volunteer job).

* Now, after reading through reddit, I'm worried my 2 paged resume will still turn off some potential employers so I'm wondering if r/engineering can offer some insight on how my new one paged resume is.

TLDR; tried one page resume before and didn't work. Need help on new one 

Edit: Apologies, updated imgur link

**Thanks to everyone for their comments. I'm going use my discretion when applying to individual companies to see how much they value EC's. I've taken my resume down for now (a bit paranoid about having it up for too long on the internet). "
zyjiv,6,2012-09-16,[For Hire] Recent Graduate in Accounting and Finance,[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/zyjiv/for_hire_recent_graduate_in_accounting_and_finance/,"Hello all,

I am a recent graduate with a BBA in Accounting &amp; Finance. I have been searching for work since graduating in May and have had little luck. As far as experience goes, I was unable to obtain an internship throughout school due to a heavy academic schedule--between class and extra-curricular activities. I did, however, hold the same part-time position my final three years and a couple of other part-time positions through the same duration--so I do understand what hard work means. I have all of the credentials to acquire my CPA and am considering that path, though not limiting myself to Accounting only. I have a heavy interest in securities, equity, and risk. Also, I am a very naturally analytic person. Furthermore, I am an advanced in all Microsoft Suite applications and hold experience with Peachtree Accounting Software as well as Bloomberg and Factset financial systems. Currently I am located in Kentucky, just south of Louisville. I am available to relocate with assistance/signing bonus.  

Thank you very much for your consideration!"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Have you ever seen any indication that this ""Maria"" is financially exploiting your dad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68k3sb?context=5)|Not really. I mean my dad certainly has treated her well and buys her things but nothing too extravagant and she seems like the type of person who doesnt really care about material things. Who knows though, there could be a side of this story im not aware of. She's been nothing but nice to me. I dont have many negative things to say about her other than shes the one who introduced my dad to it. I dont solely blame her for it because my dad made his own decision to believe in these things. 
[I mean, I liked that show ""V"" and all, but there are limits. Is your dad into all that orgone and chemtrail stuff? Can you tell us a little bit more about what your dad actually believes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j9de?context=5)|Yes big believer in that chemtrail stuff. Heres a bit more into what he believes.
 |He believes that the world is run by reptilian humanoids from another dimension that control every aspect of human life.
 |He believes that many high ranking people such as george bush, the queen, etc. are these reptilians.
 |He believes that the world governments are going to come together and create the New World Order.
 |He believes that the NWO will try and get the worlds population down to 500 million for better control over the people.
 |He believes that America will be a police state any time now. ( which I actually somewhat believe to a certain extent)
[He probably knows all about the Georgia Guidestones, right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68kf7b?context=5)|If those are those messages on the rocks or whatever then yes he showed me those before. Sorry to oversimplify it but im a bit hazy on the details of them. 
[Has your Dad ever tried to y'know, convert you? I can imagine that being a highly awkward conversation. If so, how did you respond? Did you ever give his ideas any credence? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j974?context=5)|Yes, he tried to convert me many times. It was honestly the weirdest thing Ive ever experienced the first time he tried. I think most people get the view of their parents as the super responsible and unflappable people and when one of your parents basically starts talking crazy its a very very scary situation. I cant say i ever did give his idea any credence.
[Well you stay strong man, you're right about a person of responsibility completely whacking out on you like that. Naht good.  Still as long as he respects your (sane\) views, then I'm sure you can still enjoy a decent relationship right? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jd1x?context=5)|Yea i mean he understands that he'll never get me to believe in it and he respects those beliefs. We talk very rarely but when we do its respectful and i still love him very much and want nothing more than to just have a normal father son relationship. 
[I am not trying to be a dick because I am a huge conspiracy theorist but did your dad have any sudden behavior changes or any signs of neurological problems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j1fl?context=5)|Valid question, no dickishness sensed. I cant say i noticed any neurological problems, but honestly he did seem happier. He suddenly went from a guy who was completely emotionally shut down to being very open.
[The dicksense is strong with this one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68kuu7?context=5)|Yea this one was hiding from me for a while. Well played sir, well played.
[So does your dad see the John Carpenter film ""They Live"" as a documentary instead of science fiction?  (Highly recommended movie BTW\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jlgg?context=5)|Never seen it but after doing some investigative research (wikipedia) it seems right up his alley. I'll definitely have to check it out though, it looks pretty cool. 
[How old is your dad?  We're his parents old fashion?  Does his family have any history with paranoia?  Along with getting spiritual guidance has he or is he on any medication or other ""drugs""?  Does he think Obama is a reptile?  Has he ever came face to face with one?  Also, I do not mean to offend you in any way. I am just trying to understand the whole situation. I have an open mind about most conspiracies.  Do you believe him?  How has the situation changed your life?  Are you upset about the whole thing?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j6af?context=5)|My dad is in his 50's. His parents were very old fashioned, my grandpa was the typical hard working american of the 50s and 60s who worked on telephone lines his whole life and my grandma was the typical stay at home mom. No history with paranoia as far as i know. As far as drugs go I always thought he at least smoked weed but as it turns out he is very much against drugs of any kind really. Hes never come out and blatantly said Obama is a reptile but i think he thinks so, he says that basically most presidents and politicians are. Do i believe him? if you mean do i believe he genuinely believes in this stuff, I do. The situation greatly changed my life. The whole thing started when we were really actually beginning to get close and hang out more. He was never around much when i was little because he always traveled for work. What upset me the most was when he decided to up and leave and move permanently to his other house with no explanation when i was 14 years old. 
[OP what would your dad think if you got a government job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jwwk?context=5)|He would either A. Shun me forever or B. Ask me to uncover some secret information. I wish i was joking about that answer hahah. 
[I would use it as an opportunity to troll him. I would start acting secretive and talk in a monotone voice around him. Especially if it was like a really low level govt. job.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jz1m?context=5)|Brilliant plan. Yea like even if i worked in some non exciting gov. job like Sanitation, i would wear one those ear buds and pretend to talk into it very quietly. Plus sanitation gets all the hot interns. 
[Where is the proof about the lizard beings?  What is your dad's ultimate goal? To expose the lizards? Does he have a plan of action?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68k906?context=5)|As far as I know , and anyone can correct me if im wrong, they really dont have proof aside from stupid youtube videos. Its basically a religion where its a belief and there defense is that you cant disprove it. As far as my dads ultimate goal, its basically to make as many people aware of it as possible and to expose the lizard people and i guess somehow that will give them less power. 
[How do you detect a lizard person? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jdkp?context=5)|Well, from my understanding you can tell by the eyes hahah. Apparently there are videos on youtube that prove that people like George H W Bush are reptilians but they way there eyes look. 
[What was it like inside the house?  What did your dad do while staying there?  Does he still do this currently?  Do you still talk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j3xc?context=5)|It was actually a really cool house, but i mean pretty normal. It was kind of weird being there because my dad would be like normal and we would just hang out and watch movies or play golf but then he would go into weirdo mode and start forcing these beliefs on me by showing me these insanely long and boring videos about all this. He is still a firm believer. We rarely talk anymore and if we do only by email, it really hurts because i love him to death but i just cant get on board with this. 
[My friend has recently leapt into this theory as well. Letting it consume, most of his entire day-to-day happenin's.  It also coincides with some pretty significant life changes, his sister had an injury ending her dancing career, his parents lost their home, and he's always had a good deal of paranoia.  Do you have any advice as to how I can approach this change? Or, if it's simply a lost cause.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jo8z?context=5)|Im very sorry to hear that, its always tough seeing someone close to you do something bizarre. My advice to you is to be there for him / her and try and get them to talk about those life changes. My feeling, atleast in this case is that your friend is closing himself off to the problems and it is manifesting in this belief. Your friend is basically burying their head in the sand to perhaps avoid these problems. So as hard as it may be to see your friend like this, stick with them and try and get them to talk it out. Hope that this helps in any way.
[That is certainly helpful.  That's for the most part what I've been doing. It just, becomes, a major point of contention when it seems to be all he wants to talk about.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68js4x?context=5)|Yea it really does consume their lives. But stick with it and i wish you the best. 
[Does your father have any plans for these reptilian humanoids? Is his group planning some kind of resistance against the creatures? Does he believe that average people can also be a reptile?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jwlz?context=5)|As far as i know there arent really any plans of a resistance or any such thing. He believes that being a reptile means you are going to be either famous or powerful, so no, its apparently very exclusive. 
[Is ""Reptile"" a euphamism for something else? Like the British monarchy? Or Jews? or is it actually that he believes in freaking REPTILES?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68kphc?context=5)|No the actual belief is the people are reptilian humanoids from another dimension. No bullshit, that is what they actually believe. 
[I'm presuming you mean the Annunaki when you say reptilians?  Does he also believe in Nibiru?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68k0ce?context=5)|Yes, Annunaki is what i speak of. As far as Nibiru yes he does believe that although he never got to much into detail about it so im not 100% sure exactly what thats all about. 
[Does it have a negative impact on his personal life?  Does he stay closed up in his house? does he work? does he socialize with friends?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jojb?context=5)|The thing about his situation is he doesn't fit the typical conspiracy theorist, hes not always holed up in house plastering thousands of pictures on a wall and connecting them with strings. He lives a fairly normal life i would say. Hes a business consultant and he travels alot still. That being said he does have a lot of down time when not traveling and does usually spend it at home with his SO (yea just realized i didnt explain this fully but he still lives with Maria the spiritual healer). 
[Reptiles... what a fruitcake! They are crab people.  Craaab people, craaab people, craaab people, craaab people, craaab people, craaab people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68jf5g?context=5)|There have an upvote, i literally laughed out loud at this. 
[Does he ever get angry with you if you disagree, or refuse to believe him ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j8h8?context=5)|He would get testy sometimes when I would say basically that hes in a cult and I couldnt be a part of it. I remember one time when he was trying to get me to watch some whacko video he had, i refused and he started yelling basically saying that if i choose not to watch then i would be making my life harder by becoming a slave to them. The few times he did get mad though it genuinely seemed like he wanted to help me and in his mind the way to help me was to get me to believe like he does. 
[Valid question, no dickishness sensed. I cant say i noticed any neurological problems, but honestly he did seem happier. He suddenly went from a guy who was completely emotionally shut down to being very open.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j43j?context=5)|Also I consider myself a bit of a conspiracy theorist as well but I simply could not even begin to wrap my mind around this theory. 
[I gather it's more believable because Icke can talk for three days solid on the topic. No facts mind you, but for three days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68llip?context=5)|Seriously, he travels to a lot of schools and such to put on presentations and they last upwards of ten hours in some cases. 
[Hey man, I have a brother who believes in that stuff too, last 8 years now actually, it's tearing my family apart too, just thanks for reminding me there's people out there who are going through this shit too. I hope you and your family work things out man. Love from Dublin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68kndw?context=5)|Thanks man, appreciate the kind words and I wish you and your family the best.
[Mid life crisis my friend.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zxdsl/iama_person_whos_dad_believes_in_the_conspiracy/c68j575?context=5)|Hahaha, funny you say that because this all started when my dad was having his mid life crisis. It started as the normal crisis where he bought a sports car and all that crap and then went to this. But i think hes beyond the crisis point and is still a firm believer in this conspiracy.

101rzv,1,2012-09-17,Can anybody help me keep my gap year from feeling like a trapped year?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/101rzv/can_anybody_help_me_keep_my_gap_year_from_feeling/,"This is gonna be long, but I'm really in need of advice.

I'm 18 and recently graduated. Rather than going on to college, I ended up taking a gap year. This was mainly because my parents were going through a divorce right around the time I should have been applying for college and scholarships, and that along with certain other consequent events hit me harder than I could have anticipated. By the time I was able to focus on moving my own life forward again, I had missed my chance for any kind of full ride scholarship and a lot of other financial aid. I scored the highest on the ACT out of my graduating class and had a  very good GPA, and I didn't want to be reliant on student loans to get to college. So I decided to take this year off and apply next year when I could hopefully take advantage of scholarships.

I wanted to find better ways to spend my year off than sitting around at home and working a minimum wage job. I wanted to use this time to explore my interests and decide for sure what I want to major in (I have a pretty good idea that I want to go into biochemistry or biotechnology or neuroscience). I also wanted to get a good job and start saving money, and to just start doing more things that I enjoy, which meant traveling a bit. I know how it sounds to say this, but there isn't much here at all in the small town where I grew up. One of my main goals was to find a research internship or volunteer lab position, but I haven't found anything that isn't aimed at undergraduate students or higher. I really have no one I know that can help. I have no mentor here, no one in my family and no one that I know, who has done anything remotely like this. The mindset here is to stay local, find any job or find a trade. 

My plan as it stands right now is to find professors and researchers who are working on things that I would be interested in, and email several of them to see if any would consider allowing me an internship or volunteer position. The research of Dr. Miguel Nicolelis at Duke on brain-computer interfacing is particularly interesting. He is at the top of my list. Anyway, if anyone would offer me an opportunity I would need to move to the area, which would mean finding out what the place was like, finding a job and apartment or other housing there, saving enough money to move... And then to apply to university with plenty of time to spare next year, since I'm not currently enrolled anywhere. 

So to be concise, I guess my questions are:
How do I find an internship or... travel... or something that would make this gap year worth while? How likely is my current 'plan' to work?
How do I find out about a city before I move, if I don't have very much money to visit it? 
How do I find a job and housing in a new city?

Any general advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated, and my plan is not set in stone. I would also be interested in hearing from anyone who maybe took a similar route. And maybe some forums that I could post this question on would be helpful, too.

100i8g,9,2012-09-17,"Responding to ""What did you do this summer?""",_mineral,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/100i8g/responding_to_what_did_you_do_this_summer/,"So I am about to go back to college. I can expect people to be asking each other how their summers went and stuff.

I am anxious as to how to respond. I couldn't find an internship or work, like most people at my school do.

What's more is that I took time off last school year. If I bring that up in conversations I know people will ask what I did.

I took time off because I was really stressed out and needed some time off. I squirm at the thought of saying I basically was at home and just researching cool computer science related things the entire time. It certainly was a very transformative time for me, but it's just so hard to have a conversation like that when people are expecting more simple mainstream things like ""I had an internship at company XYZ.""

I want to just say that I was at home enjoying my summer and working on some software projects/learning on my own. But I am anxious to say that because I don't want someone's first impression of me to be a lazy person.

So how do you guys deal with relating to someone how you spent an extended period of time doing something that's not mainstream, and is hard to talk about without getting embarrassed?"

1033pm,3,2012-09-18,How the hell do i find a job?,fappaf,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1033pm/how_the_hell_do_i_find_a_job/,"Reddit, i'm realizing something - i don't actually know how to job search.

I graduated with a BA in Computer Science and a BS in Psychology. I've had paid internships at two Fortune 200 companies as a QA/Automation engineer. I was supposed to land a real job after the second one (they told me at the beginning, throughout the whole internship, and right up until two weeks before my last day that i would), but the budget came in and there wasn't room for me.

Those two opportunities just fell into my lap, though. I don't know how to search for professional jobs. I've put my name in at a contracting firm at the suggestion of a coworker, but that's all i've done besides contacting the other place and updating my LinkedIn profile.

Where do i start? How do i find a real job?"
102w43,2,2012-09-18,wanted: health advice for chronic pain (47 days of constant pelvic pain now).,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/102w43/wanted_health_advice_for_chronic_pain_47_days_of/,"**So for all those that don't like to read long things: Should I wait another week to go to my obgyn or should I just go to the hospital today? Ive already been to my PCP twice and my OBGYN once. I also had a pelvic sonogram when the pain first started.**

More information for those that don't mind reading:
On July 31 I went to my PCP for pelvic pain (and another issue that they were able to figure out and it has since resolved itself--fibrocystic breasts). At that time, the pelvic pain was NOT constant, but sharp pain that felt like a pulled muscle when you move ""wrong."" I only had the doctor look at it because when poking around my hips it felt like there was a lump. The doctor said it might be an ovarian cyst and that we would wait and watch. I did not want to ""wait and see,"" so I was able to get an OBGYN appt for the next day. I went there, she did a pelvic exam, felt ""fullness,"" and sent me for a pelvic sonogram (This was on 8.1). 

On 8.3, the pelvic pain became constant and I guess dull and achy (but I don't like calling it dull because it definitely hurts and I feel like I am minimizing my pain when I call it such--it is not sharp stabbing pain like it had been). I received the sonogram on 8.7. The tech got over my left ovary and said is this where the pain is? (I said: Yes it is. Do you see something?) She said she saw a cyst and went on with the sonogram. Then told me I'd here something from the doctor soon. I heard from my OBGYN about 2 weeks later saying that the sonogram was clean. I brought up what happened with the tech. They said it was a follicle and that I was ovulating. I was on my period during the sonogram. If I was ovulating like they said, I would've been on my period two weeks after the sonogram (I was not-cycle lasted 28 days like usual). I waited for my period so that I could rule out ovulation (painful ovulation last hours to a max of a couple days). Nothing helps the pain. At some point between now and 8.7, the pain went from being localized to the left to being on both sides (Kind of like a mirror: Same place but other side too). This brings us to 9.13, my next dr appt. The appt was with my PCP because I was not able to get an appt with my OBGYN until Sept 24th. 

My symptoms (I do not know if they are all related): pelvic pain that is constant, dull and achy(ish). Low back pain (I have had back pain for ages, but it has been everyday for a couple weeks, and is much more painful than normal. Frequent urination. Fatigue (probably because the pain makes it hard to sleep, and just because being in pain everyday takes a lot out of you.)

What the PCP did: Had me leave a pee sample (they did a pregnancy test and it was negative), They called the imaging center to see the sonogram and said that yes, it did look normal. They felt my my abdominal area and listened to it with a stethoscope. After that she told me she had no idea what was causing my pain, but that she thinks it is gynecological and that I should still see my OBGYN on the 24th. They also drew blood, but I don't really know what they are looking for. She wants me to call her after I go to the OBGYN because she wants to make sure that someone is dealing with my pain. She didnt want to step on their toes, but if they do not seemed concerned, she will discuss what to do next.

This whole time, I contemplate going to the hospital. I think that maybe if I do, I will be able to find out what it wrong. I do not want any pain meds. I want it fixed. I'm sitting here in pain as I type this. Part of me thinks I should wait because I've already waited this long. It interferes with my job (I am a teaching internship, and standing all day leaves every inch of me aching and I want to burst into tears while I am teaching--which is very unprofessional). 

**SO the big question is: Should I keep waiting OR should I go to the hospital?**"
102npl,5,2012-09-18,I am considering killing myself and having myself cryogenically frozen.,ddds98,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/102npl/i_am_considering_killing_myself_and_having_myself/,"Hello, I am an 18 year old male. I am going to college in a week. I am considering committing suicide. It is not an urgent issue, but I have been seriously thinking about this for quite some time. I still have hope because I would like to wake up in the distant future.

There are a few reasons for this. First of all, my family life is complete shit. Everyone, and I mean everyone in my family has died save my father. My mom died when I was 2 and all of my grandparents are dead. My only living relative is my father.

Naturally, he is depressed too. He has no hobbies, no real friends, nor a girlfriend. So he constantly tries to get approval from me, constantly saying ""I love you"" (literally) every 15 minutes or so. There is no substance to our relationship other than the fact that I am his entire world to him. We don't talk about anything else. It is suffocating.

Secondly, I believe that I may be transgendered. Obviously, people would tell me the solution would be to go to therapy and try to transition, but it's not that simple. If I am indeed transgendered (I'm not even sure if I am, I just might have a fucked up fetish), I would not be a real woman. I would have to ""unlearn"" 18 years of being male, adapt to being female and have to cope with having a lot of masculine features (including a deep voice, masculine face, narrow hips, etc).  I would also not be able to get pregnant and have kids. I would also have to deal with all of the transgender phobia that is circulating around. You have no idea how many people lost their jobs, friends, and sometimes lives because of this.

Thirdly, the line of work I'm getting into is not what I want to do and it robbed me of my childhood. Computer science. Instead of learning how to play basketball or skateboard I learned computer programming in middle school and neglected social interaction. I continued to do so thoughout high school, I was proud of the fact that I would become a software engineer when I grew up. However, I ha an internship at a silicon valley startup this summer and I realized I absolutely hate programming now. I would never want to do it as a job. I'm already in an engineering school and I don't know how to get out of it. I am also trying to be more social, I realize the more social and gregarious I am, my skill in computer programming diminishes. I prefer socializing over programming. 

Now, the reason for killing myself and cryogenically freezing myself is mainly because of the transgender thing. I believe in the future people will be able to get sex changes much easier than you can today (because of stem cell technology). I can just take these stem cells that will allow my penis to turn into a REAL vagina without any surgery and I would be able to have those feminine features that I would not be able to have if I transitioned today. There would also be no transphobia or discrimination because people would learn that it is a condition similar to being homosexual. This would cure most of my depression. Also, my mom is currently cryogenically frozen right now and my dad is planning on doing it as well, so in this future I will also have the family I always wanted. The computer science problem will also be solved because I will have a lot of money saved in the bank that will have accrewed interest.

Now, I have been fantasizing about this for a while. I know this is very risky but I honestly don't care anymore. I either want to be happy or be dead (at least when I'm dead there are the infinite possibilities of the afterlife I have to look forward to).

I know I am not thinking rationally right now, so I would like a rational persons input. Thank you."

What do I do?",Numboman,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/102k13/reddit_im_18_years_old_my_grades_are_horrid_i_am/,"The grades I just received from my final examinations were abhorrent. I haven't been a good student, yet my parents are forcing me to go to college. I know I'm just going to be wasting my father's money. That's what I've been doing in school, wasting money. I keep trying to tell them to stop trying, I can't do any better in school, I wish I could, but I can't, but they won't listen. My dad's financial situation has gotten worse in this economy and I can't bear to burden him by having him drag my pathetic ass through college unwillingly. They think I'll never get a job unless I have a degree, and it looks like they're right. Everywhere I've looked, jobs ask for people with at least an undergraduate degree and years of experience. The one and only thing I've found myself good at is creative copywriting and every job I look for, even the most entry level of entry level positions, tell me to send in my résumé and I have 1 month of experience at a low grade ad agency where the dick Creative Director rejected everything I pitched in, because the office worked on a commission system (the less people on the credits, the bigger each person's cut) so I have no portfolio, and even when I applied for an internship at BBDO, they asked me to send in a portfolio. Nobody's going to hire an 18 year old dropout, that much is apparent.

I don't know what to do and where to go. There's no place in Chicago where I want to work and can work. If I work at McDonalds or something, I'll be paid minimum wage and I want to move out of my parents' swanky ass apartment, because I don't deserve to be there and I don't want to face my parents every day. I've disappointed them enough. However, again, nobody's going to let an 18 year old with a net worth of about 800 bucks and a few electronics sign a lease and there's no way I can expect to pay rent and utilities in Chicago at minimum wage, the taxes are nearly 10% now. To top it off, my older brother and sister are the very opposite of the spectrum for me; they've shaped my parents expectations. My brother graduated as a business major and is now working at a company and recently raked in about sixty thousand dollars in pure commission and bought himself a Saab on a whim. He's set and on his way to becoming exactly what my dad wanted for us. He also despises me for what I am, and rightfully so. My sister is in college, but she's well on her way to finishing her media and journalism double major and has already produced a major media event and moved out. There's no way I can live up to my parents' expectations and I've already contemplated suicide many times. I've never done it, because I know nobody's going to take care of my cat when I die and I really don't want to end the one shot I have at life and I know that there is a way to make it better. I just don't know it yet. Anybody know what course of action I can take from here on out?"

I'm a fourth year university student and will be applying to grad school in the next couple of months.  I have found a program that would be absolutely perfect for me and I want to be accepted so badly.  But I have an average transcript (that meets the basic requirements GPA wide, but is not great and has a few low marks), a ton of applicable volunteer work, three strong reference letters, a completed internship, and just above average GRE scores.  I am not sure if this is enough, and although I know it would be smart, I am trying to avoid completing a fifth year of undergrad at my current university.  So I have a couple of questions for you..


- How important are grades versus all the rest?  Have any of you been accepted while having a strong application but lacking outstanding grades?

- Do you have any advice when reaching out (through e-mail) to a professor who has research interests that line up with mine?  Just how important is this?


Lastly, any other words of wisdom?  I sort of feel like I don't know what I'm doing, I'm not sure if I'll ever be accepted anywhere, and I actually don't know a single peer who is applying for graduate school even though we are graduating this year.

We talked specifically about how if I was brought on board as an intern it would be in a troubleshooting position, and he asked what my experience with networks is. The only network I've ever worked with is my home network which is made up of a few computers, a printer, a router, and the modem. So aside from basic commands like ipconfig, ping, tracert, and turning stuff off and on again, I have no actual idea how to troubleshoot problems on a larger network. So can you help?

What are common problems you see with larger networks? What are some common commands I should know how to use? Are there any online resources to learn a few things quickly before the interview? Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

TL;DR I need to learn the basics of how to troubleshoot a network and fast.

I feel I do actually know this language well enough where I'd be confident to answer interview questions about it and program from memory in it.

While in college I have used a wide variety of other languages though, which I created a few small to medium academic projects in. These languages were C#, Python and Java. Now this was a few months to a year ago. So I have used these languages before, and could easily read their syntax. However, I would not feel comfortable writing code in them by memory or answering specific language interview questions. Is it wrong to list these languages as a skill? Should my resume only contain the languages I know strongly or all the ones I've technically worked with before?

As someone newer to the industry I guess I feel like with just C and a few other things listed in my skills section it would seem pretty empty. But on the other hand I would hate to list all the languages I've worked with but am not up to date with and get grilled in an interview. 

Ideally it would be nice to find a job in C, and I will be applying to these jobs. But, would I be perceived as having a narrow skill set with only C listed as a programming language skill?

104x37,1,2012-09-19,Is college worth it?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/104x37/is_college_worth_it/,"I am a freshmen who entered college not five weeks ago, declared in computer science.  My college experience so far has really disillusioned me towards an institution that, growing up was just assumed as the next logical step in any well-off teenager's life after high-school.  And I am well off.  My parents have always placed education highly, putting money into a state plan to allow me to enroll wherever I choose (in state, of course). On top of the other state-awarded scholarships, my decision to go to the college I'm currently at was heavily influenced by a full tuition paid scholarship, that came with a subsequent internship in my field.  The only point I'm trying to make here is money shouldn't really be an issue I'm worried about, in the sense of student loans or running my parents bankrupt.  But money is one of the primary reasons I'm considering quitting.

I think everyone agrees, to an extent, college is a bit of a rip-off.  We generally go along with it due to it being a pre-requisite to most higher paying jobs, etc, etc (you're all pretty smart, I don't need to tell you what you already know). But if I don't want those higher paying jobs, as my experience with my internship suggests, why bother? Throughout my entire high school career I did intern at the local university, developing software in a very relaxed environment, and enjoyed it greatly, but this cynical fast-paced ""enterprise""-ridden job I currently hold is ruining my love of computers. That's not how I want it to be. And to be clear, I understand not all companies are like that, but just by my nature I'd rather learn and grow in the subject on my own time, at my own pace.

So, barring you haven't stopped reading after deciding this is just ""another stuffy college student complaining about nothing"" (and I wouldn't blame you), this is the plan I see for myself:

* Probably call my parents today, and tell them that I am at least having some doubt about college.  I'll fill them in on any quick worries they might have, but mainly just so it's not a full shock when they come down in two weeks when we can discuss it more.  Such worries might include:
	* Will I finish the semester? Yes.
	* Depending on how much we've already put down on housing deposits on the next semester, will I stay for that one too if needed? Yes.
	* Am I depressed? No.
	* Is it because I'm having trouble with my classes? No.
	* Is it because I'm not meeting enough new people? No.
	* Is it because my dog just died? No.
	
* Continue to mull this over and give it a lot of thought. 
* Discuss it more with my parents at length when they come for parents weekend.  Most likely I'll suggest (to hopefully ease their worries) that I'll just take a semester off as a trial run, something to that effect, not to completely rule out returning.
* Move back home at the end of the semester, and quickly find a job.  I want to be independent, so I'll do lots of extra chores around the house until I can pay some form of rent, and slowly ween my self off their dependence (phone bill, car insurance, health insurance) and eventually find a place of my own.

Basically that's it. That's my plan.  And while I have a few other things to clarify, it's probably a good time to ask my actual questions: how much of this sounds like bullshit?  Does this seem like a bad idea? Should I just ""man up"" and deal with the stresses of collegiate life like everyone else? Also, as financial security is always a concern, should I just bite the bullet for that reason alone? Give me your wisdom, Reddit (anything else about the situation I've left out or you think would be helpful, just ask).

And finally some other things that could factor in to your answer(s):

* I generally have a good deal of anxiety over things, whether it be tests, work, or something else unless I have 100% confidence in myself I know what I am doing.  This is another reason I think ""college-level"" jobs my not be for me, at least for the time being.  I'd rather work at something I can do very very well (food services, for instance) and be happy.
* I'm a very frugal person, and already live very minimally (yes, I know this is easy to say as a college student, so feel free to call me on this if you think it's an important point to emphasize), so the wages of the jobs I'm looking for should suffice my lifestyle needs.
* Adding onto the last point, I've always saved half of of what I've earned (at my father's behest), so I have about $6000 in the bank.  While I may not be able to add a full half my salary at the wages I'd be making, I'd say that's a pretty strong security net for a nineteen year old.  

**TLDR:** Not happy with college, would rather be happy.

[If you had only primitive weapons, and had to fight a dinosaur to the death in a ""Dinosaur Death Match"", what is the biggest dinosaur you think you could defeat? You don't have to give a specific dinosaur, just give us a general size. Also you can't set traps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a4uxt?context=5)|I would find a way to blind the dinosaur first thing... i would construct primitive dust and sand bombs.  If all I have is primitive weapons after he is blind I can let him flop about until tired.  Once tired I would sling baseball sized rocks at its head from a distance until knocked out.  Then I would stick it with a sharp stick through its blinded eyes into its brain and win.
 |Edit: to Answer your question - general size wise - probably [this](http://sauropedia.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/human-gallimimus_size_comparison.png)
[Pocket Sand!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a73js?context=5)|Yes like the badguy does to vandamme in bloodsport.
[Have you ever worked with Kanye? How much of your work is influenced by his contributions to the art?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3k3r?context=5)|Never worked with Kanye. He is damn talented at what he does but Im not too fond of his personality. I can't say I am really influenced by what he does.  No denying he is extremely talented.  On a side note:  [i really enjoy this version of this song by him](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P3_8ifqZlM)
[Do the artists you've worked with act like they're better than everyone else?  Have you ever smoked with Rick Ross?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3gyf?context=5)|Yknow I never really had issues with artists and ego problems.  I'm not much of a toker so no I did not blaze with rick ross.
[In your professional opinion, is Tupac still alive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3z7l?context=5)|As a professional ill say that I KNOW 2pac is alive.  I saw him not long ago when I went to Coachella.
[Proof? Like a twitter update and a pic of you holding a piece of paper with your username. It's just so we know that it's you. Good luck. I'll be back soon :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3e67?context=5)|Sure thing. going to tweet about the ama now.

[How do you go about making your beats?  Specifically, do you have a specific technique that you use when you start out with a track to make you able to finish it? I usually have problems finishing a started project when I produce.    Was it hard breaking into the music industry? How did you go by making it to the top?    Any rapper you've worked with who was nothing like the person they try to portray themselves in their songs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3k6b?context=5)|Far as making the beats: i usually start off with melody, then do the drums, layout, hook, start a mix. and then leave it alone till the next day and work on the mix again, and minor tweaks untill im satisfied with it.  I was fortunate enough to be invited into the Anno Domini collective a while back.  Lots of super talented producers with varying styles that compliment each other.  From here I was able to help produce for many different artists.  Then I joined Shadowville and things really took off.  . Its not a piece of cake, but if you work hard, stay focused -  time just passes by, one thing happens after the next and all the sudden u look around and you're in there with the majors...  As far as artists who are not true to their rhymes... :)  theres many... but personality wise I found almost all the artists Ive worked with to be pretty grounded.
[Do you feel hip hop has changed drastically since the days of Tupac and Biggie. And if so, for the better or worse? I know many people who feel its gotten worse.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3i9b?context=5)|Great question.  I wont say that the current state of hiphop sucks.  Its evolving.  I do sometimes feel as though you have to dig slightly deeper to find the gems.  I miss Pac and Big a lot - On a sideways thought, I recently remixed a 2PAC song but because of copy-write laws here in Germany i cant seem to get it uploaded.  Bummin'
[What track did you produce that you feel the most prideful about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a49jp?context=5)|I have one unreleased track that I want to do a video for and am probably most proud of.  The track features Method Man and is amazing.  Hopefully I can get a video for in the next couple of months. As far as stuff that I have released I really like the new Choo Biggz stuff.  Ive given him some good beats and he has put that NY sound over them really well.  So probably ""Pay Homage"" by Choo.
[How much money did you make selling platinum on the streets?  And what prompted the career change into hiphop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5m56?context=5)|I c what u did there.
[How did you get started in producing? And how did you get noticed enough to do songs for the bigger names? A buddy of mine does phenomenal work, producing his own beats as well as for local hip hop and R&amp;B artists. But despite his talent nothing serious has materialized. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5nvv?context=5)|Started one day not giving a shit about failing. Kept trying to make moves, and trying to myself in THAT position. So many people quit after the first time they get shot down.  Its probably 20 to 30 rejections before the first bit of recognition or appreciation.  Thats not even a big bit.  Then snowballs slowly into something bigger.  Sure, things will happen on their own, but you have to set up the scenario for that shit to happen. if that makes sense?. Being good at what you do is important of course, but what you do with your talent is even more important.  Lots of unrefined talent in this world. Sure a slight bit of luck plays a role but you have to work to give yourself something to start with.  My big break was really getting hooked up with the guys at Anno Domini and we started building together.  Also Shadowville has helped lots of aspiring rappers discover my beats.  I didnt do it all myself.  Tell your friend who makes beats to keep doing that...  maybe someday he'll look down and see a lil golden nugget in his pan.  Thanks for the question.
[What hip-hop artists are you currently listening to, and what artists would you like to produce for? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a4j0v?context=5)|I still listen to a LOT of wu tang - redman.  Artists I would love to work with:  The legendary R.A The Rugged Man... 50cent... Brother Ali.
[Do you like Ali's new album? Favorite tracks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6j3l?context=5)|I haven't listened to Brother Ali's newest album but am aware it was released.  Ill be picking it up soon though for sure.  What are your favorite tracks on the album?
[I loved ""Letter to My Countrymen"" when he first played it at soundest two years ago. Such a great rhythm with the delivery. ""My Beloved"" is another one I love.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6mzv?context=5)|Right on.  Ill pay sure to listen close.  Brother Ali is an amazing combination of soul/talent.  Truly a wonderful person.
[*truly a wonderful person.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6pgm?context=5)|Sorry no.  Just by what I read about him and have watched of him through the many years that I have been a fan.  My bad.  I recently read a good article he wrote on Homophobia in Hiphop.  The guy is a clear thinker.  I respect him greatly.
[How do you feel about the multitude of fake gangstas like Rick Ross who are making music?Who are some good up and comers to watch for in your opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3tac?context=5)|Interesting question... I understand about C/O Rick Ross and that controversy - and the taking of the name of Freeway Ricky Ross etc. I dont think he was unoriginal as much as paying homage when he picked that name.   However, Rick Ross can still put out good music in my ears. His lyrics are ehhh quite often but his beats are bangin'.  I try to avoid being a hater.  Also a lot of the thug stuff you mention is rooted in the fact that music is an ENTERTAINMENT industry... A lot of stuff is fake. I dont know ross personaly, i dont know how real or fake he is. I enjoy working most with people that are real with their rhymes (hard to find though). i dont want to bash rick ross or anybody for that matter. Still i do prefer people who put truth into rhymes.  Thanks for the question.
 |Edit up and comers -  Choo Biggz, Cryptic Wisdom, Jokerr.  I just did the beat and edited the footage for [Choo's new video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Wb6vTXNfqs)  He has a rugged voice and raw NY sound that really like.
[What specifically have you worked on that went platinum? Also what do you do with your platinum records? Hang them on the wall, eat off them, cover them in drugs, or sell them on eBay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3m3e?context=5)|The platinum album was with a french group called Sexion D'assaut - they are one of the biggest [french hiphop groups](http://youtu.be/4MzYca2HbRs)
[Who was you favorite artist to work with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3eh6?context=5)|Shyheim... aka the rugged child... he is the youngest member of Wu-Tang.  The guy is like a brother to me.  Also a New York artist named Choo Biggz.  Both of those guys are like family to me.
[""Gunshots, they travel throught my projects quickly...""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6rfd?context=5)|Haha. one of the greatest in my eyes! :)
[When it comes to making music, how much of the creativity is from the artist, and how much is from you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3ia4?context=5)|My creativity really comes out when I am alone and working on the beat.  Its kind of something I build until I am happy with it.  From there it is up to the artist to continue to build.  Sometimes I have to accomidate X number of bars that an artist wants - or mix something up but usually when an artist gets a beat from me my work is 90% done.  
[When you send a beat to a producer is it structured for verses/choruses? Does the artist specify this? I'm interested in producing  and I've never thought of how this works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a4ag7?context=5)|Seems online the standard popular beat seems to be 2 or 3 verses of 16 bars with a chorus.  Artists request this to be mixed up sometimes if what they have written needs accommodating. So yah the artist can specify.  I suggest you give producing a try... it turned from a hobby into work for me.
[What are your thoughts on Lil Wayne and his whole posse (drake, that one annoying chick, etc\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5951?context=5)|I dont really like to diss people... Lil Wayne and his group of friends are successful at what they do. I dont have room to speak on him as I dont listen to his stuff if I can manage.  Still he found a demographic that pays his bills and covers his teeth in diamonds.  So its whatever. Still I could easily think of 10 other talented artists that deserve the money he is making.   
[Do you wipe your tears with hundreds because of piracy?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a87e5?context=5)|10s and 20s.
[Awesome. Great AMA btw. To be honest I kind of miss the 90s stuff. Who is the most exciting person you've worked with? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3mtc?context=5)|:)  I miss the 90s stuff too.  Shyheim... he had some of the best music back in the day also he belonged to my favorite hip hop group ever. Thanks for taking the time to ask. :)
[What is your opinion of Kreayshawn, V-Nasty and Lil' Debbie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6c00?context=5)|Hmmm... I actually like Kreayshawn.  That V-nasty/Gucci man album was...   - Lil Debbie is alright.  Kreayshawn is talented.
[When you create and write a beat/song/whateverthefuckyouwannacallit, can you take us through the process that goes on inside your head? What instruments and tools do you use? Thanks for this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a4jea?context=5)|Hey, I always take a different approach to things. But i just GO! I don't really think much about what I am doing. I just start creating something. I know this is probably a weird answer, but its the best I can give ya :) Thanks!
[How many blowjobs do you think you've received? Like 4000? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6ai2i7?context=5)|Over 9000.
[Could you tell us your daily schedule?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5qb3?context=5)|Try not to sleep in if I can help it - usually around 7... check emails/facebook stuff -  make a cup or two of coffee, make beats, workout, elaborate on beats - take an hour or 2 chill time, and work on the beats some more. Of course random meals in there.  Thats typically my life at home. When I am on the road its much much diffrerent.
[If you could work with any artist and/or producer, who would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3ycg?context=5)|Rza.
[What midi controller(s\) do you use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a559f?context=5)|Midi is a CME UF60 right now.
[Is sampling ""copyright infringement""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a559f?context=5)|Of course sampling is a part of hiphop.  It can be infringement though for sure.  Getting clearance for a sample can be expensive and difficult and I can see sampling something for a mixtape or something - but to just jack entire parts of tracks ie Vanilla Ice on David Bowie  - I think theres a line there thats actually pretty clear when you look at it.
[What about when it's fantastic, like Frank Ocean using the whole instrumental from Hotel California for his song American Wedding? I'd think more people would fight for Vanilla Ice if he was actually good like FO.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7lou?context=5)|You might be right.  I think Frank Ocean ripped almost the entire song though without the lyrics if Im not mistaken.  that's cool if you're not going to sell it on itunes or make any money on it.  If its for the love of the art then no problem but making money on others people work without them being compensated I think is where the problem was with FO.
[Whole song, no lyrics. On a mixtape (Nostalgia/Ultra\), no money made, yet The Eagles are trying to sue the shit out of FO. I can almost guarantee it was just for the love of the art, and it's ridiculous to sue over what could be considered an homage to a legendary band.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7qzl?context=5)|Yah we let people use our beats for mixtapes for free as long as they dont make money on it.  As soon as they are making money on it we would like to be compensated for our contribution just like any other business.  If its for the love of the art and not for sale on itunes I dont see the issue.
[What are your thoughts on rappers like Childish Gambino? and what do you think of the way he cooperates with the guy who makes his beats wirh him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6xw5?context=5)|Donald Glover is super talented.  Acts well, raps well... my only slight criticism would be his sometimes shallow content. Too many references to his dick I think it was that bothered me.  His videos are good too... he has a lot of resources to work with.  
[Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a3f78?context=5)|I watched the video.  It was decent.  Reminds me of Pitbull for some reason.
[Do you think rap is better or worse now compared to the '90s?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a4ybc?context=5)|There is something about the 90s hiphop that was real and raw... it was new.  Fresh off the shelf.  It was original.  There seems to be slightly more rehashed product out there.  I try not to hate... I try not to say ""hiphop these days.""  But yes I think maybe because a lot of what went on with hiphop in the 90s was happening for the first time and it felt really alive and sometimes I do feel current day music in general is flooded with redundant mediocre stuff.  There was lots of mediocre stuff in the 90s too.  :)  Its a toss up.
[I tend to stay away from mainstream rap because, its generally shit. Whats your favorite song of all time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5yix?context=5)|In The Mood by Glenn Miller.
[What tune has not yet been sampled that you really think *should* be sampled?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5377?context=5)|I have always really loved the song by Sam Cooke called A Change is Going to Come and Ive been waiting to hear a good track with a sample from it.
[Link to www.youtube.com Maybe the beat wasn't flipped the best but still a nice tune, good singing from D haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5nhj?context=5)|Damn lol.  Nice find!  Thanks for diggin' that up.  Back in 1998 i was listening to a ton of DMX.  SMH at his lyrics. ""Kind of like a bitch with an erection"" - def would have rather heard something similar to slippin' over that beat.
[Check out this Irish hip hop song let me know what you think.  Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5p6i?context=5)|That is not bad at all.  That beat is dope... reminds me of Guru's old beats that Premiere put together.  That rapper can spit too.
[Have you heard of Flosstradamus or baauer?  What do you think about the cross over of electronic music and trap? (personally, i think its awesome\)  With the explosion of electronic music in nearly every genre, would you ever try to incorporate electronic music into your own sound?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a88tu?context=5)|Nope just looked up Flosstradaumus.  Interesting stuff.  I love when people push boundaries and electronic music as a whole is doing just that.  A couple producers over here at Anno Domini have messed a little with the electronic vibe.  I personally have not... who knows in the future though :)  I might give it a try someday.
[Where can I find more of your personal work?  I really dig the ""swallow the razor"" beat.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aaliu?context=5)|Thanks a lot for the listen.  Check out some of the stuff Ive done as a side project.  [""The Unbeatables""](http://www.soundclick.com/bands/default.cfm?bandID=963114)
[Got a book recommendation? And, need an intern, I'm local?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5sho?context=5)|The Little Prince.  Im not looking for an intern right now :)  Thanks. Book recommendation for me?
[Hi, i have a freind named austin who wants to be a rapper, i was wondering if you could check out some of his stuff and i could pass on anything you have to say, here is his youtube link.  (Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6ai5zv?context=5)|Whattup.  I checked that stuff.  He's a youngster still and will grow.  He sounds like he trying to emulate wayne.  You should get him to listen to some Brother Ali or something with more emotion in it.  His rhymes are decent but lacking emotion.  Sometimes switchin up the content to something a little more heartfelt can bring that out.  Im not saying to rap like a pussy but Im saying suggest to him to think about widening his range.  The best part about this kid is he is decent and so young - so as he gets older his flow gunna tighten up and his experiences going to color his rhymes a little more.  I respect the effort it takes to do what hes doing.  Send him my regards.  Take care.
[Want to listen to a rap my roommate wrote? (He's white, but not bad\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a63nw?context=5)|Sure shoot me the link.
[What is your opinion of the work done by the Rhymesayers guys? Personally, I think they put out some of the best cuts ever made. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7hgq?context=5)|Damn I could go on.  First RIP Eyedea.  Saw him perform his song Now! live and he didnt miss a beat. That guy was so damn talented.  I literally cried the day he passed away.
 |Watching the Sayers grow has been amazing.  From back when slug was rapping on Dynospectrum to being a ceo of a multimillion dollar label.  Pretty damn impressive.  Plus they have stayed a family through it all as well.  Thats sick. My favorite Atmosphere track is Guarentees and that video is sick.  Brother Ali's track Forrest Whitiker is a classic already in my opinion.  They do good stuff.  RIP Eyedea.
[Lyric video (has better sound\)  One where you can see him.  This one is, in my opinion, his worst one.  But he hasn't uploaded most of them :/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a69e2?context=5)|""losing the sleep at night feeling the creep of fight"" - i like lyrics like that.  Talented writer for sure.  Send him my respect.
[Any MUST HAVE plug-ins? Also, PC or Mac? No hate on either, just curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7ejw?context=5)|PC - Im not good with Macs :)  As far as plug-ins everyone is different... theres not really must haves...  its what you best feel you can work with.
[Sweet, thanks! You're the first response I've gotten from an AMA with a famous person.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7kdc?context=5)|Im not famous but I appreciate you taking time from you day to inquire about mine for sure ;)  Later!
[Hey, you're a way better producer than me by a long shot, so you're famous in my book! Thanks again!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7m53?context=5)|Thanks UnknowingWall81 :)  Later.
[Do you have a discography? i'm having trouble finding one online ... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a4lde?context=5)|Here is a list of Anno producers - as well as som of the stuff that we have worked on.  Thanks for taking the time to look me up :)  [Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini_Beats)
[Thoughts on J Cole?  Great AMA, real down to earth guy. Keep grindin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aauez?context=5)|Sick, thanks bonersoup for the read.  J Cole writes incredibly well.  I mean next level expressing himself.  A+ lyricist.  Thanks again for the comment.
[Would you ever work with Shaquille O'neal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6qju?context=5)|On a song.  LoooL - I would try for sure...  Have to make a slow temp west coast beat for him.
[How was Ghostface Killah is he really a scary dude as everyone says he is? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aaqvg?context=5)|Yes!  Do Not Stare Ghostface Killah in the face.  It will not end well!
[I am freaking out MAN!! Which songs did you produce in particular for him and Method, also did you work with any one in Wu Tang?  Edit: Other than Method for the second question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aazxt?context=5)|Haha. yup, also, along side Meth and ghost, got Inspectah Deck, and prodigal sunn.
[Hey :D.  Firstly, which DAW do you use to make your beats? (I'd imagine FL Studio\). Also, do you have a favorite VST for sounds, or for effects? Finally, where do you get your drum samples?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a5t9t?context=5)|Much in FL - East West plugins are great! As far as drum samples no specific place. where ever i find them/come across them.
[Yo.. Did you buy fl when you started using it? Because its a great tool to learn on and I've recently started my own journey in producing, but I couldn't buy fl if I wished right now. I mean as soon as I ever think about selling a beat made with it I'll buy it, but until then, no dice. How about you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6abznx?context=5)|Yes, FL studio is great! One of the best programs out.
[I noticed you've worked with both Shyheim and other Wu-members/affiliates.  I won't ask specifics about them, but does beef between artists ever effect your business or who you can, will, or won't work with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a8xus?context=5)|It has not affected my business that much.  Its interesting though because a certain artist that will remain nameless used one of my beats to diss 50cent without my permission - and Im tight with a few of the NY guys and respect the hell out of 50.  So I can see where it can cause some problems.  It hasn't for me.  I try to keep things professional and not let personal suff bother production.  Thanks for the question.
[This is awesome I really enjoy the Anno Domini Beats. I am also a producer but having such a hard time finding people who wanna use my beats. I am interested how did you do it. When was your big break? Any tips for a young producer like myself.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a77wp?context=5)|Thanks for the support man... not just from me but from the rest of the Anno Domini family.  It is a big struggle at first man but persistence will pay its dividends. I would say my big defining moment or big break was when I got method man to record over one of my beats.  Really proud then.
[Ever work with Nas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a75ed?context=5)|Na never worked with Nas.  One Mic and all the stuff he did with Damien Marley is awesome stuff though.
[Are you upset with Kool Keith's exit from hip hop?  Also, are you friends with KutMasta Kurt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6e0m?context=5)|I think he said he was only considering retiring.  Still he has had massive influence so his contribution was apparent a long time ago.  I just looked it up - he performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos recently :) 
[Top 5 hip hop/rap artists? favorite RA track? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6xbb?context=5)|R.A's verse on Uncommon Valor is unparalleled. Also the track he did with vinnie paz ""Nosebleed"" is sick.
 |Top 5 so hard to say... 5 of my favorites besides already mentioned: 50, wu tang, dmx, redman, choo biggz 
[Who's your favourite rapper right now?  Ever produced for Curren$y?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a65yx?context=5)|Ive never produced for Curren$y and as far as I know no one else from the Anno Domini collective has either. Favorite rapper right now is a toss up.  I like a lot of the guys from New York:  Shyheim, Choo, 50 etc.
[I'm wise of you man, you produce on Shadowville as well if I'm right?  I've recorded a few tracks over your beats, you're a great producer, I am unable to afford your exclusives though, latest beats are so amazing. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6adx0b?context=5)|Hey, yea. thank you very much! Its ok to use the beats for non-profit as long as credit is given.
[No mention of illimatic???!!!,??!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7vj5?context=5)|Illmatic was revolutionary for sure. Beats/Rhymes - agreed deserve a mention.
[What are your thoughts on immortal technique and lowkey?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a750f?context=5)|Its hard with Tech because I love 84% of what he does and 100% of how he does it.  I think my issue with Tech is the same as my issue with Vinnie Paz.  They are saying some real shit and its easy to get into. Then sadly... bam... vinnies talking about skeletons on the moon and Im lost.  Still Immortal Technique is wonderfully talented and from what I have seen of Lowkey he is as well.  I haven't seen much of him though.  What is you favorite lowkey song that I should check out?
[The last song I recorded over one of your beats was 2 years back: Link to www.hotnewhiphop.com.  My latest: www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvJUnWaIcSA.  You're really talented man, love from the UK! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6adzbl?context=5)|Damn dude you are talented for sure.  Very talented.  Stay writing brother.  You are already good at what you do with room to grow.  You could be making some big moves with your rhymes.  I appreciate their honesty a lot.  Sick.  Respect.
[I'd say long live palestine, something wonderful, and just shine, to name a few. Very talented. Have you heard hopsin? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7tm8?context=5)|Thanks for the suggestions.  Yes I have heard of Hopsin'...  I think he has blown up almost as much as anyone over the last year.  His content is refreshing and his delivery is on point.  He's a talented guy.
[How much do you get paid to make beats? Also, if a song blows up, do you get more in return?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a78ev?context=5)|How much Im paid varies on the project.  Specifics Im contractually not allowed to disclose but yes... if the song is a hit that number skyrockets for sure.
[Have you heard of Jay Park?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a57yw?context=5)|I have actually.  He blew up on youtube a couple years ago.
[Who's handling your publishing/admin?  I hate to mix business with Reddit, but it sounds like you should be making some serious mechanical income.  Regardless, keep up the grind and the great placements!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a7czu?context=5)|Thanks for taking the time to ask a question.  Out here the royalty company is called the GEMA.  They handle the royalty stuff.
[How rich are you? Do you have porsche? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aca68?context=5)|Not rich... no porsche.  Older Benz :)
[Do you think Vinnie Paz should have used Anno Domini's version of ""Same Story"" for his album?  I LOVE the Scott Stallone version though (been trying to get that instrumental + Domini's for a while now!\). Was just wondering about your thoughts. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a9q0l?context=5)|Naw, I think Vinnie did whats best for his music.  The dude is a beast on the mic and he typically makes good decisions regarding beats.  I support his decision.  Its kind of a blessing anytime someone of his caliber is willing to even get on your beat.  He's does excellent work and he has long ago established himself as an underground legend.
[I'll have to check your stuff out, you come across as an intelligent reasonable person.  What are your thoughts on the electronic scene with artists like Deadmouse, Skrillix and Flying Lotus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a88s2?context=5)|Thanks a lot.  I have listened to some Skrillix.  There is some good stuff there but for the most part I am not really into electronic music for I think the same reason some people arent into hiphop.  the repetitive noises do get to me a bit more in electronic stuff not exactly sure why because I know the same exists in hiphop to some degree.
[Do you get paid at all by all the basketball highlight clips on YouTube that use your beats? see comments all the time saying, ""the beat's way better than the video!"" that's how i'd heard of you fwiw.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a62mw?context=5)|There is actually a contract in place for some of the baskeyball highlight videos and of course others are fan made.  I dont know much about contract specifics but yes our music was licensed for those videos.
[Sick beats you got there...  When you say platinum selling, what platinum hits have you provided beats for? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6ab6p0?context=5)|Thanks a lot man.  The only platinum track I was a part of was with the beat I made for a french group called Sexion D'assaut.  [Here is the song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MzYca2HbRs&amp;feature=youtu.be)
[Thanks man, I appreciate it. You're rockin' this AMA as well btw! My favorite beat artist is Dave Tipper. If you want to hear creative beats and sounds in a studio, he's a true pioneer with noise! This is one of his latest EP's. Peace!  Bubble Control.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6ab1x2?context=5)|Wow.  thats strange stuff.  the beginning was almost like theme music for a swimming level in a mario game   Enjoyed the share again.  thanks :)
[My friend said he's still recording it this week (He's in college\) would it be cool with you that I send you the link after he finishes the recording? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a91rp?context=5)|Of course man.  I login to reddit once a week or much more so just shoot me a link here when you get it.  Take care.
[How did you get with French rappers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6jnn?context=5)|Their manager contacted me after they had heard my beats.  That was the start of it.
[Do you speak French? How was the communication with foreign artists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6a6o57?context=5)|Nope. I dont speak french and it was nearly impossible to commuicate correctly with them.  Hahaha :)  But damn something clicked between us.
[Why are you selling Platinum?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6aa2cs?context=5)|Four and one eighth to the left.
[I think your beats are amazing and I've been writing a promo halloween track to one for a few weeks now. Cheers dude!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/103lyc/iama_platinum_selling_hiphop_producer_ama/c6ahrkq?context=5)|Thanks a lot man.  Hit me up on here when the track is finished so I can give it a listen.  Thanks for checking out my ama :)
[Anno Domini! Wow, I remember when I first started writing scouring through soundclick and the first pages I would check would be Anno Domini, actually until this day I still do, so major props to you. Was going to add a question for the fuck of it, but fuck it. Keep doing your thing.

Is it worth the money?  Considering you do get a TIGA Diploma and you can get an internship with legitimate development companies aswell as the involvement of video game royalty like Moloneux and Blazinski, I still have my doubts.

I originaly went and applied to just receive the training to be a games tester, but because I tinkered around with C++ and was making a pokemon rom hack and knew my shit, well, some of my shit, they suggested I go for development instead.

After digging around it bacame aparant that they were just polishing my marble as it were, making me feel a bit special, a bit more competant than I am at game development and programming

I'm having second thoughts, can someone tell me more about the course and what happened to them after they finished it?

During my time there, I realized I really disliked journalism.. but one of the courses I took taught me basic html and it opened the door for me.

Since then, I've been teaching myself programming. I really enjoy it and honestly, I dream about joining a team of programmers and working on projects.

I want to take the right steps to turn this into a career and not just another hobby. I have an insane amount of pressure from my successful family members and my future-in-laws to get a ""real job,"" and so I want to get the ball rolling.

I don't have any formal education aside from a 6 week workshop I lucked into and I'm currently enrolled in Coursera's Algorithms and Datastructures class (which is AWESOME).

&gt;got a pull request accepted on reddit's learn programming community github thing (it was adding a feature to an IRC Bot)

16? You added the search mod? Ok - yeah… gotta add the 4 there. 20! **

Before you stands a male with a history in graphic and web design along with writing, cooking, retail and production. A Bardic Knowledge bonus to the check reveals his comic writing got him a write up in Wizard Magazine as one of 5 writers to look for in the next 5 years. 

**You want to learn more - Gather Info. Nat 20? And a synergy with Knowledge local? Whoooooooo!**

Luke studied **Graphic Design** as a votech student during high school. In addition he was also a **Boy Scout**, was a star player on the Academic Quiz Team, brought his **Skills USA** Quiz Team to state for Bronze, was a member of the Skills USA Section Parliament and started on building connections to various people
.
When he went to college at the **Art Institute of Pittsburgh** he ended up changing his focus from Graphic Design to **Web Design and Interactive Media**, hoping to have a wider range of knowledge. While there he ended up assisting web musician superstar **Akira the Don** who commented **""For the past few years Luke Herr has been in regular contact with me, offering his ideas, many of them excellent. His insight, persistence, and unwavering enthusiasm would be a valuable asset to any organization.""**

He ended up working **McDonald's** for a while where he had customers thank the manager for his upbeat attitude, followed by a stint at a now closed comic shop which he enjoyed a lot more, before leaving to focus on his portfolio and internship and everywhere he went he brought the same positivity. 

The internship with **Let's Be Friends Again and Adam WarRock** was mutually beneficial one where Luke learned a lot about content management, concert booking, forum creation and problem solving.  Curt Franklin, writer of Let's Be Friends Again, commented **""Not to be too hyperbolic, but Luke was an excellent intern. He regularly updated us as to where he was on the various projects assigned to him, he was extremely proficient in the various software we asked him to use. If he wasn't familiar with something he took it upon himself to research and learn it as quickly as possible. He worked more hours than we asked him to and also showed lots of initiative when it came to working on our web forums and our site.""**

Two weeks before graduation, disaster struck when his computer and his backup were destroyed in a freak desk-with-a-swinging-arm accident but he didn't give up. Faced with 3 freelance projects, 5 finals, his own portfolio, the Small Press Expo and his own portfolio display he beat finished all of his projects. He finished the three websites before his own work, received A's on his finals, which included a presentation on Jack Kirby's The Eternals and another on Let's Be Friends Again Inc, had good enough sales at SPX all with time to spare. Unfortunately, the portfolio show was poorly attended due to random chance and a really crappy day to hold it so he didn't get a job then and there. Also he slay an orc.

So after that he returned home for free rent and board to work on freelance but now he desires something more steady, social, continuous and creative in between writing web comics, working on his graphic novel and operating [Nerdcenaries, a fake comic news site](nerdcenaries.com). After a very recent incident with factory labor to make some extra cash, he decided he might take to Reddit and approach the situation from another angle.
His site, which is currently being revamped [is located here](http://www.lukeherr.com/).

He is willing to move just about anywhere, take any job and he will work through the pain including that which might cause him lose his big toe nails. Also side bonus - he is totally willing to DM some campaigns and is familiar with rules.

At the time I was in a bad financial situation and I jumped on the opportunity. It's a ""good job"". Big company, benefits, whatever.

I've learned a lot in this job, but I plateaued about 2 years in. Now I'm in a rut. 

* I maintain the same systems I did when I started. 
* It is a bureaucracy heavy job with lots of unnecessary paperwork and little programming. 
* Management is from a different era and doesn't understand the Internet and don't value what I do. 
* The policies are draconian and prevent me from getting work done. No open source software, IE only (!!), can't use source control... and on and on. The people who set/enforce the rules don't understand them, and it's a letter-of-the-law rather than spirit-of-the-law kind of place. 
* Much of the little technical work I had to do is now being handed to offshore workers, which I am expected to hire, train and supervise.
* We are using severely outdated technology and my skills are slipping.

This makes me miserable day in and day out. I no longer do programming in my spare time because my spirit has been crushed. I think to myself ""I'll never be able to use this in my job, so why bother?""

I really, really want to leave but I'm too afraid to do anything. This is the only job I've ever had and I didn't finish school. If I leave, will anyone ever hire me again? Shouldn't I be happy to have a job at all? 

Another thing that worries me - if I go looking now I will need references and then people will find out I'm looking, and *nobody* I've seen has ever left this place."
106x8o,13,2012-09-20,I'm interviewing today for the first time.  (I'm the interviewer) Do you have any advice for me? What's your favorite interview question?,Bruck,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/106x8o/im_interviewing_today_for_the_first_time_im_the/,"So my IT business that I started 5 years ago has been growing pretty steadily.  Its time to hire my first technician.  Today I am interviewing my first candidate.  I've hired people part time and even interns for 40hrs/per week in the past, but this is different.  I'm actually going to interview a few candidates and choose between them. 

My goal is not to stump this guy, or intimidate him, I just want to find out as best I can if he's going to be a good match for the business and for us working together.  His technical background is actually very strong and its likely he'll fit that part of the spot without a problem.  

What questions have you faced in an interview that you felt really allowed you to demonstrate your personality or strengths, that you wish you were asked more often?

My most memorable is when the final interviewer of a large national bank asked me for 3 weaknesses that would be relevant and a challenge to the position I was applying for.  I gave a softball answer at first, something about organization and how I overcome it - his response was ""sounds like you already solved that one, now tell me about a few that exist that you'll need to solve after you begin this position.""  It was a tough question it was intimidating but I felt my answer and how I handled the second response was actually the reason I got that job. (this isn't really the type of question I'm going to ask because I left thinking that guy was a jerk.  I also never worked directly with him, but its my most memorable interview question)

Thanks for you help reddit!

What should I do?",Hitamu,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/106i8c/i_am_still_deeply_in_love_with_my_exgirlfriend/,"Hey reddit, so this is a long story but I will try to keep this as brief as possible. I met this girl, lets call her ""Lilly"", during high-school and soon after we started dating. This continued for 4 and a half years and I consider those 4 years as the best 4 years of my life. Once we moved up to college however things got harder to manage. The short version is that Lilly started to distance herself from me during the last 2 months of our relationship due to various reasons that would not be addressed until after the break up. She started spending all of her time with another guy, lets call him John, and began acting completely different than normal. So for 2 months she spent all her time with him, started to avoid me and even sent me a text one night saying that she and John were going to go to a town 5 hours away for a night.(This of course did not happen but the severity of the situation is not lost on me.) The thing is even after all of this I still could not leave her, in the end we broke up because I told a group of strangers what had been happening between us and I lied when she asked me if I had. Eventually John found out that I lied and told Lilly that I was doing so. We had a short fight and it was finally over. Fast forward a few months and I am a changed man now. The break up has made me completely different and it has also changed her. When she returned from her internship over the summer she admitted that she was cruel to me and has never stopped hating herself for what she did. She told me she loves me but she doesn't want this to happen again so she needs time to date other people. (It is important to note that I was her first boyfriend) She is now dating John, thankfully it is going terribly between them, but every time I see her it kills me. What should I do?

What can I do to stop this invasion of privacy?,JPannullo,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/109pjj/im_being_spied_on_by_my_parents_when_im_in_the/,"So 19m here and my dad is one of those paranoid guys that has to make sure if his houses are alright. So what he did was put cameras outside the house to make sure that no one tries to break in.

But recently it has gotten out of hand. Just last month I noticed a camera set up looking at the back door. This upset me, but since my family goes to Florida monthly and leaves me to house sit, I was fine with it. It unsettled me, but I decided to just hang out in the basement most of the time anyway.

Today I was in the basement which I have transformed into a mini ""man cave"" and I look up and see a camera pointed right at my favorite couch that I sit in most of the time I'm down there.

This was extremely unsettling to me. It just feels like it is really over stepping the line. I have thought of bringing it up to him but he is a violent man and gets excited really easy so it makes it difficult to have a peaceful debate about something he is doing that can be considered ""wrong"".

Right now I am staying at my grandpa's house and my family doesn't know why.

So, what should I do? Should I grow some balls and talk to them or just deal with it?

tl;Dr: my dad has a camera pointed strait at my spot I sit in most of the day. Should I tell him it is wrong?

Edit: my family is moving out in three years ( when my brother graduates high school) and said they would give me the house and all I would have to do is pay rent and utilitiesuntil I can by it from my dad.

I put a lot of work into that house, it just doesn't feel right to leave.

Also, I work minimum wage for two days and intern in I.T. for three, I don't have the money to move out"

There's been a thought burning in the back of my mind for quite some time now, and I thought I'd get some opinions from the community.

Is there more to CS? Obviously I know the answer is yes, as there are a huge number of problems that can be investigated and researched. But I have a nagging feeling that if I just settle for my Bachelor's, I'm relegating myself to a life as a software engineer. I currently work at a pretty good company as a co-op engineer, but the work isn't as fulfilling as I'd like.

I've started thinking that I should use my CS knowledge and thought processes to supplement my venture into another field. My dream job is to be an astronomer, and I feel like my CS background could do some good in that field, since it deals with such large quantities of data. As I thought about it more, it occurred to me that a CS background would be invaluable in almost any science related field.

In closing, what are your thoughts on how to get into a more research oriented position, rather than just writing corporate software? One drawback for me is that I'm 26 and I have a family to feed, so starting out as a research assistant or unpaid intern isn't really an option.

At the moment, I work part-time as a webdeveloper for a company in the Netherlands and I'm a CE student. For the last 2 years, I've been working with a lot of national and international big clients at my current job. Which still amazes me everyday, people are always shocked when we tell them the age of our programmers, 20 years old. I've been doing mainly webdevelopment and a bit of C, C++, C# and Java at school.

Now, through this job, I got to know to know someone, who now works for Google. Thinking 'what the heck, trying never hurts', I decided to email him, asking if he could set me up with an internship at Google next year September. I was shocked when I got told the ""big news"". He is willing to set me up with other contacts at Google. And another thing: we(the company where I work), got pretty exclusive access to one of the Google APIs(due to privacy, I don't think I can tell which API). With access to this API I've got a headstart on competition, and I basically have a year to use it to my full extinct. 

I'm still shocked and amazed at this opportunity and I really want to make this happen. Getting that internship is my dream, and I will do anything to get it.

I don't even have any questions -yet-, I am simply looking for advice, tips, wise words, anything really. Even though I've been working with big clients, I'm still a rookie in the business game and probably even the programming game as well. You might even say, I'm just very lucky.

So, wise ones, please share your wisdom, it is greatly appreciated!

I have also written a cover letter for a recruitment agency:

&gt;Dear Mr. X:
&gt;
&gt;If you have any client seeking a junior developer for any IT position, I would like to make a strong case for myself. 
&gt;
&gt;Although I'm a freshly graduated, I've been developing for years and learning things every day. Maybe it's not because of my professional experience that someone would hire me, but I'm very active and passionate about technology, I have initiative and I'm sure my potential will rapidly be noticed. On my internship at Y, I gained the confidence of my co-workers and manager in less than two months, when I was offered a job position. I'm also certified as a Java 6 Professional Programmer by Oracle with a score of 92%. 
&gt;
&gt;But it's not only technology what attracts me. I'm also interested in business and company culture: how relations works between people, how colaboration and implication benefits the whole group and in general how things can improve the work environment and the company itself. 
&gt;
&gt;Other thing I think I have on my side is my location. I live at less than 1 minute walking from Z. This would help making the relocation unnecessary, making my availability inmediate.

So, I am really leaning on a retail job (No managerial position just entry level), but I am worried about being too ""overqualified"" because of my Bachelor's Degree. 

Lol I know... I know... This sounds like a First World Problem but Redditors I would really love your advice: 

1. Should I lie about having a college degree?

2. What type of education should I put? High School? AA? (I transferred to my four year school from a community college)

3. I know this is a separate question but as far as background check goes: Does anyone know if it only checks for Criminal background? Or will it show that I graduated from a four year university?...

How to interviewers view this? I spoke with some people from several companies including Hulu and Yelp, and they all seemed interested in me and liked my experience.

10fgcs,22,2012-09-24,NewGrad (21yo) here; 3rd time failing the Amazon Interview...Need tips because I want to go to Seattle so much.,ButRickSaid,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10fgcs/newgrad_21yo_here_3rd_time_failing_the_amazon/,"To note: I have read and done most questions in: ""Programming Interviews Exposed"" and ""Cracking the Coding Interview"".

So I graduated this year from a pretty good public university and had been trying to interview with plenty of big name companies (Goog, Msft, Amzn, FB, Salesforce) currently and in the past (for internships) and I've always come up short on the last interview before they make a decision.

Granted that, I've improved a significant amount each year so I know that I've made some mistakes in the past during my interviews.

This year however, I focused intensely on doing all these interview questions, practicing to think recursively, thinking before I code. I spend hours at a time just thinking about **how to think about a problem correctly**.

So I figured I had learned from all my mistakes...in the past, I just jumped to a half-decent answer and started coding it; giving some leisurely explanation for my code and then missing some corner cases. But now I learned that's the wrong way to do it. I need to show them my thought process, my carefulness, my skills. THIS TIME IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT.

I came up with a method and I practiced this process in my head that seemed perfect to what the interviewers want (in this order):

1) Get clarity!! Don't solve the wrong problem and get rid of any ambiguity!!

2) Write test cases; positive scenarios, error scenarios, corner case scenarios.

3) Make the appropriate sanity checks; **N.E.S.S.** (nulls, erroneous input, same-ness, size/length check).

4) Will a data structure help? Try a: HashMap, HashSet, Stack, Queue, PriorityQueue, List, array[], Tree, Recursion.

5) Write out the pseudo-code in comments first and then code it. BUT make sure to tell them that you will write code after!!

I took an incredibly cautious and careful approach to my interview, I made sure to minimize bugs in the code and try for the most optimal-time solution. Amazon seems to love HashMaps so the first thought that came to mind in any question was to try to use it. Today I found out that I didn't get the offer yet again, only this time it was for full-time.

I've tried to just jump to AN answer and that didn't work. I've tried to take it step by step, very slowly because ""the thought process is what matters, not getting the right solution"". Yet neither has given me an offer. I want to go to Seattle and I'm interviewing with other big names in the area but I'm limited by the number of people who can refer me and posting my resume online to places has not yet helped me.

They werent generating revenue so i wasnt getting paid, it's now 5 months later and still no money.  So i think of this as a giant internship and resume builder.  However, the problem still stands, no money.

I feel as if the job market is hopeless, i get no replies from prospective employers, i'm 27 years old, living with my parents and i have $54.00 to my name.

Any advice?"

10ie6u,5,2012-09-26,There is a feeling of dread taking over me.,throwaway261985,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/10ie6u/there_is_a_feeling_of_dread_taking_over_me/,"Hi SW,

It has been a ground for me to not only vent but begin to confront my problems. But somehow I am not able to pick myself up and and carry on. I have tried to sort out a lot of the past problems but I am still unable to cope. I am not even able to just go up to my academic advisor and tell her that everyday I am dying a little inside.

About 2 months back I confided in a friend. She really helped me a lot and took me in. But I have to find somewhere to live next week. I have been sending out my CV and applying for internships but have not even had an email back. I received an mail from school asking me why I have not registered my internship with them. How do I tell them that I am a failure!!

I failed the 3 courses but my advisor said that I could repeat them next year as I still have potential. But I need to have a 4 month internship, and since it is already end september it is no longer possible. I need just a document saying that I have an internship with something in the domain of International Affairs (human rights).

The internships that are available are with UN agencies or other NGOs that offer unpaid positions. I am homeless, I have  no phone, how can I contribute 40 hrs a week to work and dress a certain way. 

I feel like such a failure and think that I am regressing to that place of comfort that an end could provide. I feel worthless and that years of studying are useless in my case. I feel truly at a loss. I hoped that doing an internship and working in an area of human rights would remind me of the gift of life. But the very path to finding that is pushing me closer to the cliff. 

I am too poor to even afford to go to the therapist who asks for 50 euros a session. Ah, it is difficult. I can feel all the motivation being sucked down and along with it my hopes and dreams for the future, down in the chasm of failure and fatigue.

Sorry for rambling on but I needed to tell someone."

10kv1w,42,2012-09-27,A short memory dump of my career thus far,sysadmin_,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/10kv1w/a_short_memory_dump_of_my_career_thus_far/,"I started my actual IT career as an intern. My title was IT Intern, however I was not a college student, had never attended any form of higher education after dropping out of high school - although I did get a GED. Prior to that I knew computers and such, I was always a tinkerer, built my own, fixed friends/family etc... Got an A+ cert before dropping out.

About 4 years of laziness go by where I played in a few bands, got kicked out, bounced between places to stay or slept in my car. Could never land a technical job anywhere, local repair shops, big retail chains, it was hard to find a place to get a real paying computer gig. I had a sales job in mom&amp;pop retail where they found out I was good with computers so they let me help with their issues. Some more time goes by, end up leaving there, hours were scarce. Ended up landing a 1099 gig doing in-home PC repair for a small local biz using the previous retail experience. There was a lot of travel with my own car, eventually I didn't make enough to cover my fuel expenses, my car was in disrepair and I couldn't afford it. I had to quit after a year. Soon after, I got lucky landing a gig at another place through a temp agency as a labor worker, temp to hire kind of thing. I put in my temp time, noticed all kinds of computer related things happening all around me (manufacturing). My number came up to be hired in, I worked hard and learned fast. Before the interview I beefed up my resume and brought that with, right off the bat I whipped that out and gave my self sales pitch and if they had any type of technical or mechanical position etc that I would be interested. Few days later I got a call that they had an entry level IT position for me. I about shit my pants, I was so excited. The guy that hired me was the coolest dude, he was about twice my age and played guitar in a metal band. I think he liked me right away because of that common interest. 

I threw myself into the deep end on this one. I had never even touched a real server, let alone racks upon racks full of them, or enterprise class networking gear, or anything we would expect to find in a large business environment. It was like nothing I had ever seen before. I was fortunate enough to spend a week with the guy I was replacing to get on track. They started me out doing just end user stuff, but also some junior sysadmin type stuff. I eventually worked my way into just about every facet of IT at that location. I worked with 1 other local IT guy and often worked with corporate IT on projects. They always wanted me on projects and not other dude, he was a bad team player, I think he felt threatened by ""corporate"". I learned a lot working with him though, super talented and knowledgeable dude, but a lot of times he was a dick to me because I didn't do things the exact way he wanted them done. Very often he was passive aggressive in his communication, the kind of dude that sat 5 feet away from me and would never say a word to me. He'd email me. From 5 feet away. That's not how you treat someone you're supposed to be mentoring. I think that deep down he just did not like me.   

Fast forward a few months, the cool guy IT manager left, we began reporting to someone in corporate IT. A year goes by, no local IT manager. My counterpart's attitude toward me worsened. My hours got cut. My access was then limited. Couldn't do my job. Couldn't get admin access to ANYTHING. Not even workstations. It was justified because I was an intern. I had been there 3 years doing everything a sysadmin would do. Had to go get other dude every time I needed an admin login to anything. One day poking around I found some login script where corporate thought it would be a good idea to store service account credentials in plaintext, account had domain admin rights. Password was set to never expire. I used that account to continue doing my job for the next few months without having to bow down to my counterpart every time I needed access to something tied to AD.  

One day I get email from cool guy IT manager that had left, says he has a position open, send my resume in. Got interviewed a few times. Got the job.  

Get this: the same day I got the new offer, I had a meeting with my corporate IT boss, he says that I will now report to other IT guy. I replied with my two week notice. It was fucking fantastic! The looks on their faces was priceless. I came to work two more days before my newly appointed boss told me to clear out my desk and hand in company property before going on a permanent lunch break. At least they paid me for the two weeks.

I've been at this new place for the last few years as a sole sysadmin developing all sorts of new skills with virtualization, storage, backup and DR, automating absolutely everything I can, documenting all the things... I work with some great people (in my department that is). Once again I dove right into the deep end on this one but it's been great. I love learning new things, I love to problem solve, and I can't wait for the next big challenge. 

Wow it took me forever to write this.

It's a great company, great position it is just that it is a contract role and depending on how I do here I can get a full time role later on. I'm familiar with the company and think I can do a great job here.

HOWEVER, I also applied to a different company. The problem is I THINK I'll get an interview but there is no guarantee. I went to a recruitment session and I had a great time there, I think I absolutely impressed many of the important people there. My friend who I applied to the same role, got rejected already and I have not heard back. My guess is that because the application deadline for this job is September 29, they are going to wait until they have all the applications before deciding when to interview everyone. While I am confident (but not sure) I will get an interview, there is no guarantee at all I will get the job. The job is very similar, except it is a full time role and is in the downtown area of my city a place in which I'd love to live one day. It really is the ideal role (my next ideal role would be a full time offer from the company I got the offer from).

What should I do Reddit, and how should I proceed?

**TL;DR** Have one job offer on the table that needs to be responded to by today; and waiting to even just interview(not even sure if I'll get that) for another role I REALLY want. What do I do?

[Hitbox team: Are you guys actually capable of SSing the insane ""difficult"" levels you build?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcdm?context=5)|Hahahahahaha.
[For those not in the know, have a look: Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcdm?context=5)|^^^no ^^^:(
[This is for everyone. If you could have any 5 indie games in a Humble Indie Bundle what would you pick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtaez?context=5)|Hey, I am a huge fan of your channel!  I subscribed ever since the Overgrowth video, which has made a huge difference for Wolfire, by the way.
 |It is hard to pick five games, without revealing Humble Indie Bundle 7. :)  
 |Cave Story.
 |Braid.
 |Dear Esther.
 |Minecraft.
 |Half-life 3.
[Wait, you guys have future bundles scheduled already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dvbpu?context=5)|Not exactly scheduled, but in the works.  It can take a long time to bring games to Linux.
[What are the profits of the Humble Bundle compared to actually selling the games individually at their regular prices? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtahy?context=5)|For Rochard, it's volume &amp; visibility. Our game is not very well known and those who know think it's PSN-only game. We had a bad start last year due to PSN breach and bad market timing. Also, bringing the game to the Linux platform has been very exciting.
 |It's a good boost of cash to game sales, though obviously the unit price is a lot lower than we might get via other channels.
 |Funnily enough, our Shatter sales are currently up on Steam too, so the increased fan base and visibility on the game is already starting to have a ""downstream"" effect.
[I've heard about Rochard for the first time with this bundle and I just can't stop playing! Thank you guys for an amazing game and a flawless Linux port!  If you ever release Rochard 2 (I saw the video, there are some nice new mechanics there\) you'll have my preorder from day one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dvgt6?context=5)|Thanks for the Linux port belong to the awesome Linux team from Unity!
[HIB games have linux ports and Steam codes. Steam is coming to Linux. Do any of you have plans to bring your Linux ports to Steam?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtann?context=5)|Yes indeed we do :)
 |We will also use the Steamplay option if available, so like with the Mac/PC version, one key to rule them all.
 |Definitely. With a Linux build and Steam on Linux, it would be insane not to do it :)
 |Yes, we are hassling Valve already.
[Are any of you worried about profit lost in HIB as far as those that pay &lt;$1?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcfq?context=5)|Those who pay $1 for the bundle probably wouldn't pay $1 (at 90% off) for a single game on Steam.  Well, at least something is still going to charity right.  The Bundle isn't all about profit.  Disappointing if people pay less than $1 but that is the nature of the beast, and we wouldn't have the high volume of sales and higher payers without the word of mouth the opportunity to pay what you want generates.
[Is there any significant impact, and what is the percentage of people who purchase just a dollar or less?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcfq?context=5)|Since adding the $1 minimum for Steam keys, penny purchases have stopped being a problem.  The real issue was people hoarding Steam keys for resale, just to give out for fun, or to use for getting extra coal, like in Valve's Christmas promotion.  At a $1 floor, that issue almost completely disappears.
[Would you rather fight 50 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dt8y5?context=5)|Would the 50 duck-sized horses attack me at the same time, or would they be queued like in some rogue-like?  Horses and ducks are both by nature herbivores and non aggressive to meat, which I am made of.  So either one should be ok because I don't think they would want to fight me, and I don't want to fight them.
[Would the 50 duck-sized horses attack me at the same time, or would they be queued like in some rogue-like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6du5iv?context=5)|The 50 duck-sized horses are taped together to form a horse-sized horse made of duck-sized horses.
[Is that even legal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dwfkd?context=5)|It's fine, the duck-sized horses are actually comprised of millions of ant-sized ducks, and the ant-sized ducks are just made of carbon.
[If I had a game I created and would like to put it for Humble Bundle, what should I do? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dt9ju?context=5)|We used Unity3D engine (which I have a strong love-hate relationship with), and they did all the dirty work for us. What we did is make the actual builds using the editor provided by Unity Linux team, test it out and report back to them.
[Thanks for your answer, another question for programmers. There is a lot of young game developers/graduates who are looking for experience. Would it be possible to get internship at Humble Bundle? Do you look for people like this? What type of skills are expected by developers like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dti6g?context=5)|You need experience and connections, but also burning desire to be in the business. Unfortunately I haven't heard any school that could actually provide you that.
 |Start small. Best thing you can do to yourself is actually finish a game. There's much more work in it that you might think of.
[How did you get your games involved with HIB?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dt9ij?context=5)|The founder of our company met with the Humble Bundle team at Game Connection Lyon some years ago, probably in 2009. They contacted us after PSN release in October 2011. We were supposed to be in the bundle earlier, but we didn't have proper Linux build until 22nd of September.
[Hey, they only gave me a coffee!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtx5a?context=5)|You should have held out.
[Any news about the Mac / Linux versions of Vessel ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dt9pg?context=5)|We currently have three Linux game developers working on the Mac and Linux builds, but it is still experiencing some pretty big issues and unfortunately is still not ready to go.  We were totally sure that it was going to be ready last week, but unexpected issues keep popping up, so it is really hard to get an updated ETA other than ""hopefully very soon"".
[With Steam for Linux imminent, will the Linux versions of current Humble Bundle games be available on Steam? Will future bundles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcju?context=5)|We plan to support Steam for Linux.  We've been hassling Valve about it.  Keen to be in the first wave.
[Do you think more indie developers will begin to focus on Linux because of Steam and these bundles? What about the larger developers? (I asked a similar question a few years ago, but I think it's worth revisiting.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcju?context=5)|Unity3D on Linux is going to be big. We'll definitely put the Linux version on Steam asap.
[When is the Mac version of Torchlight II coming out? Do do you see TLII being in a Humble Bundle anytime soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtckv?context=5)|That's next on the agenda, but it will take a couple months at least.
[Hi, thanks for doing this. My question is, to nobody in particular, What is the part of your game that you are most proud of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dt97e?context=5)|I made most of the physics based gameplay code in Rochard, and I have to say that's the part I'm most proud of. Originally we had quite little physics gameplay in the game, but it ended up being the most important aspect of the game in the end!
 |For me all the systems we made were cool for a limited time and them sort of just become part of the background, and I don't think about them much once they work.  This may be why we kept adding stuff to SPAZ.  We wanted to recapture that cool ""shiny new stuff"" feeling for a while.
 |In the end, for me when we get a piece of fan mail from someone who has sunk 50+ hours into SPAZ and then provides suggestions for SPAZ, desire for SPAZ2, that is really cool.  To know you touched another gamer with your crazy ideas.
 |The soundtrack of Shatter is obviously a great success and highlight.
 |But I like the fact we took the challenge of a ""broken"" genre head on, something that had known flaws, and were able to overcome them with thoughtful design and usability, bringing ""control"" to a genre that has none.  We purposely set out to do that and happy we succeeded.
 |I'm most proud that we actually managed to finish Dustforce and that people got to play it (and that some of them enjoyed it)!
 |Un-humble answer: I made the tech that let us throw about 11,000 (I think) high res sprites at the game (e.g, [here's dustwraith's generated sprite sheet](http://i.imgur.com/HH9yo.png) (scaled down)) and use any of them wherever we liked without having to budget x sprites per area, or compress them all ugly, or make them lower res.
 |Also you can make levels *REALLY* big, like hundreds of millions of pixels across, but we never used that tech.
 |^^^:(
 |I'm most proud that we were able to make a game that connected with the heritage of ARPGs, do it with a small, dedicated team, and basically provide a stable foundation for our company. Oh, and only charge $20 for it at release.
[I just wanted to say that the physics in Rochard are amazing! Did you come up with any of the puzzles or did you have to make the physics first so that puzzles could be created?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtdox?context=5)|Creating the levels for Rochard was quite liquid and organic process. Originally the character could not affect the world (he was just an observer in point of physics -- engine/PhysX restriction), and level designers were creating puzzle that did not require player interaction, like the fuses, lasers, forcefields and such.
 |Later on, when I was able to redo the whole character physics system, we we're able to do puzzles with player interacting with the elements in the world. So the designers would go back, tweak the levels and the puzzles and come up with something cool.
 |We don't have much traditional physics puzzles in the game (such as see-saws and such). There is a lot more that can be done!
[My only question at the moment is ""When will my Torchlight characters get faces?"" I love that you guys fixed the game crashing portal bug on Linux so fast. I can live with the missing heads, but it is quite disconcerting when viewing my character up close.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtemg?context=5)|That's a known issue that should hopefully be fixed soon. Sorry about that one!
[Dustforce is one of the most exhilaratingly fun games I have ever played. Although I kind of sometimes hate you guys for making a game that is so singularly, unbelievably frustrating that I sometimes want to launch my gamepad down the hallway :P.  On a technical note, though, I'll admit I'm really, really impressed with the tech (and I'm one of those snobby systems-programmer types\); it's pretty, fluid, and well-animated, and yet doesn't kill my system. How do you go about generating the sprites, and how do you manage to keep the game's framerate smooth with that much to render?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dus9z?context=5)|Thanks, that's very kind of you! I don't get many compliments on the tech, only complaints when it doesn't work! But that's just the nature of the work.  Finally sprites are drawn by using pages from the buffer texture. We don't use an indirection texture (though we did for a while), instead I just draw multiple quads for sprites that take up more than one page.
 |The sprites are packed in to groups (i.e the dustwraith ""sprite set"" above)[(another example\\)](http://snag.gy/B6MfO.jpg) using some basic binary tree bin packing, then those groups are packed in to a single ""Virtual Texture"" space. Each of those little pink(?) squares represents a page, which are stored compressed (losslessly) in ram. When a sprite needs to be drawn and it isn't already in video memory, its page/s are decompressed and loaded in to free slot/s in the page buffer texture.
[This right here is awesome. I'm a nerd for this kind of stuff and would LOVE to hear more of it. You should do another AMA some time, or some kind explanation of development (assuming it wouldn't give away any trade secrets you may have\). ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e32ex?context=5)|Thanks! I've been saying since Dustforce was released that I'd do a blog post about the tech, but I'm not really sure how to approach it so I never got around to it. Maybe one day...
 |Secrets bad!
[This is awesome, thank you for this comment.  I'm out of my element with graphics programming, is this the kind of thing you're referring to when you say ""virtual texture""? Or is Dustforce doing something different?  Amazing job, the game runs beautifully.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e2hmx?context=5)|Yep, very similar to that. The main difference is we're not using an indirection texture (which the pixel shader would use to look up the correct page according to the UV co-ordinates), instead I cut up the sprites in to multiple pages (if necessary) and draw from the page buffer directly.
[@maxschaefer: how did the Torchlight 2 launch go?? @Lifeformed: This isn't a question but I really love your music, your soundtrack has been on repeat since I got the bundle. :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtak5?context=5)|The launch went great! Of course there were some issues, there always are in a big multiplayer game launch, but I think overall it went really well, and people are loving it. Thanks for the compliment on the music! We are really lucky to have Matt Uelmen as a sound guy.
[Hello, apparently, porting games on Linux made ​​specifically for the humble bundle. Will you continue to offer your future games under Linux?  (I understand if Baddie22 not responding :\)\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtrif?context=5)|We've had a good response from Linux users, so we'd consider doing it again for future titles.  Once Steam for Linux is up and running that will make it an even better proposition.
[Never heard of Rochard when I bought the bundle, then played it, and loved it! Best game in the bundle, imho.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtt03?context=5)|Here's a Rochard 2 demo/preview we made last year (it uses mostly Rochard assets): [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7K8bUD_CSs)
[Please tell me you're working on a sequel!  Edit: also, thanks for the linux version \^_^](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtt03?context=5)|Unfortunately, we don't have the funding for the sequel. There's lot of debt to pay before we can continue work on it.
[Aw man, that looks awesome.  Very sorry to hear about the debt/lack of funding, I hope you guys figure something out eventually. Crowdfunding perhaps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dug7e?context=5)|Definitely, crowd funding is an option.
[Question to any, has having your game ported to Linux increased the chance of further ports to that platform in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6du0eg?context=5)|Probably. Rochard has been a test bench for Unity3D Linux team, who have done awesome job!
[If i've to ask one question, it would be : How did you get started?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtfch?context=5)|Started in 1997(eek!) by getting together with a couple of friends and ordering a Net Yaroze from Sony (the home programmable PlayStation).  Kind of grew from there.
[*This question is for everyone, feel free to answer it if you want. And yes i mean your beginning in creation of indie games.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtfch?context=5)|Messing around in Flash MX in high school, tried ActionScript, found it was fun to make stuff.
[What according to you is the future of distribution for indie developers? Steam or Humble Bundle type sales? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtnla?context=5)|Both. I think both are wonderful for indie developers - the Humble Bundle gets a lot of eyes on games people might never have heard about, and the unique pay model makes it accessible for almost anyone, and Steam provides the year-round sales platform and indie needs for stability.
 |While sales and bundles are great for cash boosts, I don't think developers can rely on them alone for profitability, and they are ""training"" consumers to expect higher and higher value for every dollar.
 |Digital distribution is key, but how games are monetized is going to have to continue to evolve.
 |Why not both? :)
[Will there ever be a visual novel or racing game in a Humble Bundle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtapi?context=5)|Hmmm not a racing game per se, but we'd be interested to port GripShift to PC/Mac/Linux and have in a bundle.
[To everyone: If you could only play one more game for the rest of your life, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtcj3?context=5)|Probably Civilization IV.. it's frustrating, but I boot it up at least once a year.
 |Deus Ex (the original)  7 times and counting.
 |Eyetoy Groove.  Seriously.
[This is for HIB. In most bundles, you add some games after a few days of sale. What's the reasoning behind this? Do you experience a surge in sales after doing this? Also, do those new games now get equal share from future sales or those developers don't get as much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtgo1?context=5)|I'm guessing it both adds more value and gives HIB a chance to reach out again midway through to keep the momentum going.  There definitely seems to be a surge, so whatever the reasoning, that is a positive outcome.
 |It's a way to help rekindle excitement about the promotion.  The games are typically from previous bundles that we have run, so it is a good way for people who missed bundle X to catch up.
 |The new games typically get an equal share going starting when they are added (you can always tweak or see the splits by clicking the triangle next to the developers slider).
[This is about the Linux version of Torchlight, I'm sorry, but I keep wondering about this. Please note that I'm eternally grateful for porting Torchlight to Linux, and I love the game and have played it in wine until now.  Did seriously nobody notice the missing heads (nobody even ran it once before release?\) or did you decide that nobody will play it on Linux anyways, and those who do are used to being treated bad? Would you make the same decision of releasing a broken game if it was Windows?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtjtg?context=5)|That was a pretty unfortunate bug.  It is known and should hopefully be fixed soon.
[I bought this Humble Bundle for one dollar so I can redeem the games on Steam. I'm flat broke this month, so that's why I couldn't spend more. I feel guilty for doing this. Do you get a lot of people paying a buck or less for great selections such as this one? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtrvy?context=5)|Sounds like it's a buck more than otherwise have gone to the Bundle so thank you!
 |Thanks! Send me a PM if you feel like your bundle is missing some Dustforce!
[Really enjoyed playing through Rochard.  I caught a really obscure Ghostbusters quote part way in; ""Listen..  you smell something?"" and was wondering what other little easter-eggs I might have missed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtfke?context=5)|I haven't noticed that one! There are a lot of references to popular culture in the game. It's not a secret, but I love the fact that the voice of John Rochard is mr. Jon St John, the voice of Duke Nukem. These characters are quite the opposite as protagonists.
 |I'm not sure where that was?... I can't remember that sentence :O.
[As an aspiring musician, at what point of development do you normally include musicians for score and specifically, at what point did they get involved with your game in HIB?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtl70?context=5)|For Shatter, we had Module involved from very early in development.  It was important to create the score as something that informed the visuals and gameplay and wasn't just bolted on.  You don't always have that luxury, but in this case it worked out great.
 |Tough to get a gig though.  With so many other musicians trying to break into games you have to be both good and persistent.  Give it a shot and see what happens. Good luck with your efforts! 
[How do you honestly feel about the people who only donates $0.1 ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dw11h?context=5)|I know the transaction costs, servers and bandwidth cost more, so it doesn't feel very good.
[Do you have any plans on adding your games to Desura? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dugjf?context=5)|Work in progress.
[Favourite game and favourite song in game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtedu?context=5)|[Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IOL4q5tDD) no competition here :)

[But what if you were harming their young (for sake of provoking the fight\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e0hqb?context=5)|That doesn't sound like me.  Never happen. 
[You're being chased by a gang out to kill you as long as you are in the town, in order to escape with your life you have to go down one of two alleys after being chased throughout the city (being cut off any other escape routes out of the city\).  You will be coming close to either the nesting area of 100 duck sized horses or 1 horse sized duck.  Being wary of threats to their young you know you will be attacked, but won't die \[if you fight back in defense\] unlike the intentions of gang following you. which do you choose?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e60fs?context=5)|Quick stop at corner store for a loaf of bread and a box of sugar cubes (it borders the alley entrance).  THEN befriend the giant duck with the bread and ride it into battle while leading the micro horses with a trail of cubes.  When we encounter the gang, I throw the remaining cubes and bread among the gang and let my minions tear them apart.
 |But to be fair a horse sized duck is 100X worse.   
[What does the future hold for Recoil Games after HIB and Rochard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e3tn9?context=5)|It really depends on Rochard sales and our forthcoming mobile game. A sequel is in the plans, but the project is on hold.
[Being a Finnish company, how much Rovio's and Remedy's success have helped your journey?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e3tn9?context=5)|Rovio's and Remedy's success has not directly affected us in any way. Phenomenal successes of Supercell and Rovio have made games industry more serious business in Finland.
[To the *Dustforce* crew (and anyone else who wants to chime in, really\): What tools do you use to develop with? I'm sure I'm not the only one that is curious about what the industry actually uses to produce awesome 2d games such as yours.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dxr0l?context=5)|The art in Dustforce was done in Flash, the programming was done in Visual Studio using C++ and [AngelScript](http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/). The game engine and editor we made ourselves.
[@snlehton What is your worst bug you have had to ever unearth and fix (in games\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e12kq?context=5)|That would have to be heap corruption, hands down. It's like cancer of software development. You never notice it until it's too late, and then it impossible to know what was the cause.
 |The worst one was having a pointer to an element inside dynamically allocated array, and the corruption happened in such situation that the array was reallocated (more elements pushed in with no room for them). Accessing  that pointer later on would have unexpected results, usually access violation or jump to unknown address due to invalid virtual table reference... evil stuff!
[My question is to snlehton. Is there any plan to bring any kind of editor to Rochard? I had a blast with this game but I wasn't ready to be done with it. I fell in love with the gameplay and want more! I'm sure you all are readying the 2nd chapter but man would I love to tweak things around and build some levels. Any plans at all to open up development to fans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e0g46?context=5)|We have thought of it, but I'm not sure if that is going to happen any time soon. It would need quite a bit of preparing, as the internal editor stuff is not necessarily most user-friendly stuff available :)
[What's a good entry point for programmers interested in learning to write games for Linux?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e1u8x?context=5)|Try Unity :) [Link to www.unity3d.com](http://www.unity3d.com)
[Are there ever many serious arguments involving certain aspects of the development of a game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e0vax?context=5)|Yes. I have seen it in more than one company/project. When making Rochard, some design decisions were not agreed which eventually led to disputes between individual developers. It's creative work that differs from ""regular"" software projects, where valid arguments and reasoning are more likely to prevent disputes.
[Do you feel bad that I donate all my contribution to child's play?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6e0r93?context=5)|Not at all!
 |Nope.
[It's a good boost of cash to game sales, though obviously the unit price is a lot lower than we might get via other channels.  Funnily enough, our Shatter sales are currently up on Steam too, so the increased fan base and visibility on the game is already starting to have a ""downstream"" effect.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtpwf?context=5)|You're not alone :) we're seeing it too. It's subtle, but it's there.

[I'm probably most proud of how we took what was already an unusual mechanic (liquid physics\) and did something completely new with it (creating creatures formed out of it\) and then made that the center of the game, growing the visuals, design, story, style, and music all from that unique core.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ir6n/were_humble_indie_bundle_6_creators_of_torchlight/c6dtf9q?context=5)|That reminds me that I really really need to get some time to check out the games in the bundle.

10jv8v,1,2012-09-27,How do I explain wanting to switch jobs so quick to future employers?,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/10jv8v/how_do_i_explain_wanting_to_switch_jobs_so_quick/,"Although I love my job I am really unhappy with the pay (very low for my area, pretty much still living paycheck to paycheck and student loans are about to kick in) and some broken promises about other types of benefits I would receive in lieu of working for nearly 30k below the average salary for my position.

I graduated this may and began working my first job in June as an intern then hired on full time in august due to excellent performance. I want to start looking for a better job and have already proven that I am a great engineer here by getting my hands in a lot of different, multi-disciplinary projects, and designing/creating a lot of various new products. Enough to where I think I have a very strong portfolio and resume to get a few interviews at bigger companies through my network (also as another random question, even though I signed an NDA at the place I work, am I allowed to use CAD models I created/worked on in my portfolio that I am showing future employers or no?).

I was just wondering when I start interviewing, what should I tell them the reason for wanting to switch jobs so early on. I dont want them to think that I would flake at the first chance of a better job because honestly I am looking for a stable career I can stay at for at least 5 years, I just expect to be compensated at the fair market value for it and it doesnt look like it is going to happen here so I just want to cut my losses and leave. I don't feel like this would be too professional to bring up at an interview though should the question arise, but I could be wrong?



Thanks for any advice.

10lu16,2,2012-09-28,21 &amp; forced to take a gap year. Having a hard time planning out my near future. Assistance?,Gooeybanana,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10lu16/21_forced_to_take_a_gap_year_having_a_hard_time/,"Okay, so I originally had planned to transfer to a university this year to continue my course in dietetics(junior). Unfortunately, I somehow was left oblivious to the loan world and what credit exactly was, coupled with my parents being bankrupt = no cosigner, so I could not take out a sizable loan to pay off the remaining amount of tuition needed for this year. Since finding this out, I've gotten a credit card and I'm beginning to make diligent payments to build up a satisfactory credit score. I'm left with some decisions to make over the course of this next year until I'm ready to get back into college again.

I went through a shit storm of a summer and came to the realization that I would be FAR better off in my studies if I was moved out during the time I was in school. I love my parents' house that I've been raised in all of my life, but the noise issue(little bro w/ a disability; loves having everything loud, among all the other loud noises echoing throughout the house) is becoming an unbearable distraction that ultimately ends up with me fuming out of the house without getting much done. Obviously, money becomes an issue though if I move out. It becomes even a bigger issue after I graduate if I want to move.

If I were to move out, working 40 hours a week would be required. When I informed my adviser that I'd be working this much and doing 12 credit hours a semester(doing 12 already makes it 3 more years instead of 2 to graduate), she almost literally shat bricks...which honestly confused me. Doesn't every student do this now? Regardless, I firmly believe that the convenience of silence &amp; less traveling(would be moving closer to work &amp; with a friend I commonly hang with) would make studying much more of a breeze.

What stumps me, though, is how I'll participate in extracurricular activities for my dietetics course. With all this time spent working and studying, I just don't see free time to do anything else that might help get my name out in the field, or on a comparable experience-level as my classmates. For anyone in this profession already, I'd greatly appreciate hearing your input if you had a comparably stressful schedule yet were still able to do extracurricular activities :)

I have a local hospital that has a dietary aide position available that only offers part time, weekend hours which would be awesome for experience...but my full time job has a rather strict schedule that wouldn't really allow me to take weekends off as I'm absolutely needed on those days. The only thing really keeping me at this job is the nice pay which would greatly help with rent and bills. The Carpal Tunnel Syndrome that's developing from it, however, is beginning to make me reconsider if I should change my current path and pursue this hospital position, and perhaps find another job to get back up to 40 hours.

Everything I've mentioned seems to have linked itself in some way with one another, and it's left me confused on what I should do next. I really need to succeed these next few years when I go to college as internship acceptance appears to be pretty competitive, but I also need to find a way to make it through it all while still having money to my name. It would help me immensely if others could provide advice on what to do based off of personal experience or what have you :D

tl;dr: Forced gap year. Building credit. Want to move out because it = calmer me and more productive studying. Moving out also = money problems. Trying to find the best solution to having peaceful study sessions in order to get good grades while still maintaining money to accommodate daily needs. Questioning current job &amp; wondering about extracurricular possibilities.

 |But seriously, I've never for a moment felt comfortable leaving the web series as we did. I didn't want to regret that for the rest of my life, which is the path I was on. The movie is an opportunity to once again do something new and different to keep our creative process fun and exciting, while leaving our characters and universe in a much nicer place should we decide this is the end.
[Oh man am I pumped you're doing this. -What was your favorite experience from PP?  Did you expect the Internet show to become as big as it did?  How do you type with boxing gloves on your hands??? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7yud?context=5)|The very first theatrical premiere we held at the Bloor Cinema in Toronto. We were eating at a restaurant down the street, discussing our expectations. I thought somewhere between 12 and 25 people would show up and it would be pretty awkward. Geoff left first to go to the theatre because no one would recognize him and I'll never forget the frantic phone call we received a few minutes later. The line-up was down and around the block. Nearly 800 people showed up. It's one thing to see numbers on a website and another entirely to see all those people in real life. We ended up having to run through the crowd with hoodies pulled down, panicking as we heard shouts of ""There they are!!"". Afterwards I tried to escape via the back door but it didn't work. We started getting swarmed from all around and my flight instinct kicked in and I just started running. I got stopped and swarmed in the middle of the street and luckily one of the larger fans recognized I was terrified and screamed at everyone to give me room. I spent three hours signing every last autograph and, for one moment in my life, felt like Brad Pitt. Afterwards we went to eat at an all-night diner and everything was back to normal; no one knew who the fuck I was. I didn't slept for two days. (also, man I wish I knew how to carriage-return on Reddit...)
[Why is Dave so pro at cooking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e85eq?context=5)|Because he's the pickiest eater I've ever met. Not picky in the sense that he only eats a specific variety of foods, but in the sense that quality is everything and almost nothing meets his standards, forcing him to cook for himself.
[Were you happy the way the TV series turned out? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7xvg?context=5)|Yes, I am happy with how it turned out, especially given the obstacles involved in making a real 'TV' show. Constant network revisions, writers/directors forced onto the project, 14 hour days with no downtime, etc. If you compare it to other TV comedies (and not our previous web series), I think it stands up. But then again, I think most modern TV comedies are pure crap, with rare exceptions like 'Louie' on FX or 'Limmy's Show' on BBC Scotland. I think a big problem for our existing fan base is that they had a strong expectation of what it would be, and when the structure and tone was changed...  well, people don't like changes to the things they love. In a perfect world, they'd have given us full creative control and I think we would have knocked it out of the park for old fans and new.
[Which episodes of PP (web series\) were the most fun or memorable to film?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7x3i?context=5)|Episode 2 was a blast to film because it involved drinking a few pitchers of beer and randomly interacting in-character with people on the street. Those were the days.
 |Episode 10 is my most memorable because I took the writing more seriously than the other episodes and felt that we really, really needed a solid episode (and return to our 'roots') after experimenting with 'micro balls' in episode 9. The opening scene is a personal favourite - sitting alone in my underwear and doing 57 takes until I felt I nailed it. That is actually me typing... 
[How many famous people do you know of that liked Pure Pwnage a lot, and how did you find out? (Like Artosis from the SC-scene\)  PP Teh Movie has been an idea you and Geoff have thrown around for many years now, but when was it decided ""Fuck it, let's crowdfund it!""? Was it a spontaneous decision just recently after you started being more public, or have it been in the works for quite some time already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7z5u?context=5)|Not sure how many in total, but I've been surprised how many big figures in eSports have reached out to me, especially after the IEM event and/or the movie announcement.  A lot of casters (Tasteless, Artosis, Day9 and more) and players (Sheth, Destiny, HuK and more), of which I will certainly forget some if I try to list them.  I've known dApollo since the days when EA would fly us out to balance-test the Alpha versions of new C&amp;C games. The actor Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom in the Harry Potter films) is a fan and in fact one of the first people to buy an 'i pwn n00bs' shirt from us back in the day. Apparently he used to wear it to set. I met him in Calgary and we mutually freaked out (I'm a big Harry Potter fan).  I love my family life. In all honesty, I was terrified I might be a bad dad, given my predisposition to obsess about work or games, but as it turns out I was born to be one. It's funny how our instincts work. I am completely obsessed with my son and it kills me to spend any time away (the IEM Germany trip was my first time away from him and quite an emotional trial, so sorry to those sharing beer with me on that last night, lol...) Of everything I've done in my life, I'm most proud of my family. We're all very healthy and happy. As cliche as it may be and incomprehensible to many - it's all that really matters in this short life.
[Will you ever feel too old to play Jeremy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7z5u?context=5)|I do both at the same time... from home ;)  Although I don't consider myself a star of any kind these days.  Just a dude who once did some stuff people dug and hopefully does some more stuff people dig in the future.  The IEM really liked it.  It was a great experience for me personally. I'd never done any real hosting before, so it was very experimental.  On the first day I went with a dry, sarcastic tone and learned a couple things: the lack of energy is not a good hosting technique, and people under a certain age have no idea what dry comedy is and mistake it for 'awkward'.  By day 3 I found a groove and was having so much fun. I really hope I get more opportunities in the future, I can only get better.
 |Nah. If I start getting too too old, we could always cast a 'padawan' and make jeremy the Yoda ;)
[Thanks for all the answers, but you missed the second one about Teh Movie. I understand if you want to avoid talking about if for now, I'm just curious. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6ec6qn?context=5)|Oh shit, that was an honest miss!
 |Real #2. I just recently decided to come back to work 'full time'.  I've been working on a few projects on and off the past couple years, but nothing that required my complete devotion like teh movie.  I guess I just wasn't prepared to stop being a full-time dad.  Recently my son started school and suddenly I felt it was time to go back to taking n00bs to school myself.  I wrote up a proposal and a little over a month later our campaign launched.
[Remember that time we met at comic-con and I made you pose for an awkward picture? No? Oh, good.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8bl9?context=5)|LOL.

(BBS Door Game)...  and seeing as you didn't specify *video* game: Tennis and Chess. I know I've probably forgotten another dozen and will regret later...
[You recently hosted IEM (which was amazing!\), any plans to get more involved with SC2 and which race do you play?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7zoa?context=5)|Oh, forgot 2-4...  #2 I answered already, #3: I really hope I have more opportunities to work in eSports in the future. It's been a childhood dream of mine. I play Protoss and regret every second of it :) #4: No, although I'm prepared to bust it out in case all else fails.

I think we're in the middle of a transition, I expect most games to move to a F2P or subscription model over the next decade. I haven't played Call of Duty since the fourth instalment and am generally not a fan of the franchise. Also, Bobby Kotick sucks balls.

That motherfucker would be scary. The little horses would be too cute and I wouldn't have the heart to hurt them.

[Why did you decide not to go with Kickstarter for your movie? It is more well known and better in the sense that the charge doesn't happen right away, so I can donate and be able to handle it when the charge goes through.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e83zw?context=5)|Kickstarter requires a US social security number, bank account and resident address, AKA it's only for Americans. As Canadians we didn't have much choice. Indiegogo also takes less fees than Kickstarter, which is a plus.
[Who's idea was it to have those horrible clips of teh masterer and the ninja powers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7x8w?context=5)|It was a mutual decision. We were watching a lot of Buffy the Vampire Slayer at the time (great series, check it out) and decided to have some action-combat fun in our own sandbox. A lot of Pure Pwnage was made that way - us simply wanting to experiment as writers/directors to keep the creative process fun. In hindsight, we know now why TV shows don't suddenly change their formula mid-series...  ;) 
[What are you goals for the Movie with all the extra money you've received on Indiegogo.com? FYI: I'm really psyched about the whole project.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7xbq?context=5)|I really just want to make the best movie we can.  We don't plan on paying ourselves a penny from the money we raise; everything is going into more locations, more and better actors, more opportunities for promotion, etc.
[If I remember correctly... Did someone actually buy some of your hair? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7y93?context=5)|Yeah, I think it ended up being over $3000. We spent the money on a trip to Holland to surprise some of our favourite fans. We even shot some of the show there. One of the best experiences of my life.
[Why didn't you just sell some more hair/ball hair to raise the movie money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7y2j?context=5)|In a perfect world...
[Can you comment on the performance of the TV series and what benchmarks the network wanted / expected you to hit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7yfz?context=5)|In terms of 'ratings', the TV show did well for the channel it was on. Much better than, say, the first seasons of Trailer Park Boys (same channel). I think the network might've had higher than usual expectations because of our huge web traffic, when in truth, most people watching TV shows on the web don't watch TV shows on television. I know I hadn't had cable for years prior to getting a TV show.
[What is your opinion of trailer park boys?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6egzb3?context=5)|I really enjoyed the first few seasons but it started to lose me after that.  Oddly, the opposite of what their ratings suggest most others thought.

When I moved in with my girlfriend 15 years ago we had a dog named Kemo. Both have since passed away and I'm not sure my heart can take losing another family member, so I'm dogless atm and make do by visiting the local park and being the creepy dog guy.
[Correct me if I am wrong, but Kemo was the dog you used in one episode, right? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8997?context=5)|Yes, we immortalized him as 'Dick'. Man I miss that little guy :(

Occasionally I'll get approached or notice someone noticing me (there's a certain look I can now spot a mile away...), but it mostly only happens at or around events with fellow nerds, like comic-cons.
[How do you feel about the feed me song ""headshot""?  Did he have to license the FPS Doug sound clips from you and did you know about the song pre-release?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8qnf?context=5)|They didn't have a license and we had no idea. We found out after the fact through Twitter thanks to fans. It was an honest error on their part, they had no idea about the show and thought the FPS Doug clip was a stand-alone one-time thing whose producer they couldn't find. I've since talked to them and they are super cool dudes and it's all good. I'm happy that people enjoy the tune, although I'm not into dubstep myself. Assuming that's what it is, I know people can get a little crazy sub-dividing techno music genres...

We now say an actor is ""Miranda'ing"" if they: always show up early, are always smiling and pleasant, and always give it their all. We're good friends off-screen.
[Hey Jarett! Long time fan, started watching PP back in the days when you guys started out, freaking love it man.   Did you expect the series to be such a big hit when you started?

If you told us then what was to become of Pure Pwnage, I would've thought you were legitimately crazy.  Being a competitive C&amp;C player, I was forced to interact with an uncountable number of douchebags.  They were amazing at playing the game, but completely failed at being decent human beings.  I just wanted their replays.  The original Pure Pwnage was a way for me to vent by taking the piss out of them.  Little did I know...

[Did you ever actually get addicted to WoW?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8eto?context=5)|I was never actually 'addicted' to WoW, although I did play a lot starting on launch day.  I was an Everquest *addict* for a year and a half during university (quad-boxing 10+ hours a day and almost failing out of school as a result), so I was familiar with the genre and its pitfalls.  Honestly, after EQ, WoW just felt like a children's game and I was immune to the addictive elements.  My power guild had moved from EQ to WoW, we were the first ones in Molten Core, I was one of the first priests to 50, blah blah blah, and after I got all the knowledge I needed to write the WoW content in Pure Pwnage I quit and never looked back. (well, except for an ill-fated attempt at a 'Pure Pwnage Guild')
 |I think MMOs are evil, frankly.  I have what can be described as an 'addictive personality type' and it's just not safe for me to play them.  I haven't played any more since WoW and the only game that even tempts me to go back is the upcoming Dragon Quest X, and *only* because I was a huge Dragon Quest fan growing up and it also looks childish enough that I couldn't possibly get addicted.  Always a risk, though...
[Was your power guild by chance the guild Zephyros? We had a similar history, though a lot of our older members from the EQ days have started disappearing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6edx4z?context=5)|Negative.  We played on Rallos Zek.  The best time of my EQ life was when Sullon Zek launched.  Everyone on an equal playing field, mostly carebears from the blue servers giving PvP a shot, and me and my roomies having so much PvP experience...  We just dominated.  Some of the most fun I've ever had actually, often brought to tears from laughing so hard.

[Pure Pwnage (web series\) will forever be one of the closest pieces of gaming culture to my heart, and I'm really excited for the movie.  I had trouble getting into the TV series, partly because of the changes and that I don't have cable or anything:P But I still would like to finish it.  How do you feel about the way people compare the web series and the TV series?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e86ih?context=5)|It bums me out a bit, but I totally expected it.  It's impossible to approach the TV show objectively if you've been a big fan of the web series beforehand.  Also, I share many of the criticisms myself, so it's easy reading them.  I do think that the TV show is better than most people give it credit for, though. C'est la vie.
[Which do you feel is your preferred medium: stand up or scripted comedy? Which did you prefer shooting: the web series or the television show? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e7yzc?context=5)|I have an insane amount of respect for stand-up comedy and hope to one day get back on stage myself. It's such a pure art-form, just you and a microphone and no second chances. By comparison, scripted comedy is much, much easier, and consequently not quite as rewarding personally (although far more rewarding financially unless you're in the top 0.01% of comics). I preferred the web series because we had the time and atmosphere to just let me go and do my thing, improvising a large portion of the show's dialogue. In TV, you're counting the minutes and have limited takes of each scene, and often times you know you could do better with another take, but you're moving on. It can be a bummer.
[Hey Jarrett! I was wondering if you would ever continue the web series? My friends and I have been waiting to see what would happen with Chris for years now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e87e9?context=5)|I would definitely consider doing something more on the web.  This is something we'll discuss after the movie is complete.  It's a different landscape now though, so a return to the original formula of one piece of ~25 min content every 3-4 months probably won't cut it.
[ off, if there are people in this world capable of making the ultimate Gamer movie i truly believe that You, Geoff and Joel are the ones.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8hvs?context=5)|I've known Geoff since grade 5, or about 10 years old.  I met Joel when I was about 18, in the basement of a mutual friends house, playing 007 on the N64.  I met Dave shortly after I moved to Toronto.  I was living in some shitty student housing (even though I was no longer a student) and he moved into the room across from me.  We hit it off instantly, probably a faster personal connection than I've ever made in my life.

All the unimportant shit just fades away and I'm left with this overwhelming desire to LIVE my dreams. Then I try to.

How many keyboards have suffered the same fate at the hands(feet\) of Doug?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8fsw?context=5)|Joel (Doug) has busted a number of keyboards (and headsets and speakers...) in his time, but I'd be lying if I said many keyboards haven't met a similar fate at my hands.  I used to keep around 3-4 extra in my closet, just in case of a losing streak in Clan Wars.  Of course, having those extras around just gave me even more excuses to Hulk Smash that shit...
[What/who was the influence behind Jeremy's mannerisms and how he spoke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8fsw?context=5)|I haven't broken a keyboard in years now.  It could be age, or it could be that I have an expensive mechanical keyboard I can't afford to replace :)
[Thanks for doing this, Can't wait for the movie!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8fsw?context=5)|I don't know where Jeremy's accent came from, it was an improvised stream of consciousness thing.  It's a big exaggeration of how I thought others perceived the Canadian accent.  The mannerisms are mostly just improvised, but the spanking was directly influenced by my good friend John during the days of our Big Buck Hunter addiction.

I'm anxious to read what William Goldman and Syd Field have to say on the topic :)
[You've now went from a web series, to a tv series, to now a movie. How does your approach differ for these different mediums? Obviously technologically it's a little different, but how much does it affect the way you approach the storytelling? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8e8w?context=5)|I have a scientific approach to most everything in life. So step one for me is research.  I've never written a movie before and it's a little intimidating.  Once I'm more educated on movie-writing and confident in structure, I need to just trust my comedic instincts and see what the result is.  Then reiterate.
[Huge fan, is there any way i can help on set if you get the movie off the ground (or even have a very small part in it\)?

[What games are you playing regularly these days?  LOVE the show, and I also loved the TV series to death. You guys are part of what makes the internet so great.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8hi7?context=5)|League of Legends, Mario Kart 7, Tiny Tower, and I've just recently started playing Starcraft 2 again thanks to the Heart of the Swarm expansion. Also trying to get into DotA 2.  One of those was a joke, I'll leave that up you to figure out.
[Will you play LoL in the pure pwnage movie? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e80ko?context=5)|I'm not sure who may or may not play it in teh movie, but I'd love to include it somehow and I hope Riot Games thinks it's a good idea too.  I'll ask them in person at the upcoming World Finals in L.A. ;)
[If the film does well commercially (I'm sure it will\), is there a chance of a continuation of the series from there? Be it another feature or a return to episodic web content?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8eaf?context=5)|Absolutely.
[Will I be seeing you presenting at future eSports events?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e80n4?context=5)|I sure hope so, man!  Either way, I hope we have a chance to grab some more beers together at the LoL World Finals in L.A.
[Since the Indiegogo announcement, I've been listening to a lot of the old music from the webseries - it's been great. Pure Pwnage composed a lot of my identity in high school and legitimised my gaming habits. Thank you for that.  How do you plan on promoting the movie? Will you rely on old fans or try to find a new audience as well?  I had the privilege of meeting you and Geoff when you came to Australia for Episode 15, so maybe some local screenings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e8k9r?context=5)|So far our plan is similar to that of the web series - rely on making a quality product that people *want* to talk about.  We won't have a budget to do traditional promotion.  We need word of mouth.  Once we have a finished movie, we'll submit it to festivals and hopefully the energetic throngs of fans that (hopefully) show up will speak loud and clear for us.  After that we can host our own tours, write the local and web 'presses' and hope it snowballs from there. At the end of the day, we're banking on the merit of the film, not the merit of a marketing campaign.
[Are you at all excited about the new Command and Conquer free to play game that's supposedly coming out in 2013 or will you be sticking with SC2/Heart Of the Swarm for all of your RTS needs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10kffd/hi_reddit_im_jarett_cale_aka_jeremy_from_pure/c6e89za?context=5)|It's free, so I'll give it shot.  That's the beauty of free-to-play.  If the game sucks, I'm gone...  so they have to make it good.  When EA has your money up front, you can almost bet you'll be feeling stolen from.
 |I do expect though that HotS will be my RTS until LotV is released.  My confidence in EA is immeasurably small.

10ljma,3,2012-09-27,Will the pain ever end? I'm getting tired of this...,kiwicupcake,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/10ljma/will_the_pain_ever_end_im_getting_tired_of_this/,"I don't know where to begin... 
I'm a relatively successful 25 year old female. I've dabbled with thoughts of suicide/self harm my whole life (overdose when I was 11, cutting at 12, suicide note at 13, in the ER with overdose at 15) with things getting way worse there past few years. But I'm not some brooding, sad person. I've always been a sweet, cheery, happy, loving, caring person- but who cries on the inside and in her room alone at night, tormented by voices in her head. 

My problems really got bad when I went to grad school. In undergrad I was so happy and successful. I devoted my life to trying to make the world a better place, inspire others. And I did. I was constantly organizing volunteering events, fundraisers. I inspired lots of people, not that I am trying to be vain, but it was the truth. I won the top award a student can at my school. As my mom says, 'People there thought you could walk on water"". All that and I graduated with a 3.8 GPA in the hardest major my school had. 

Fast forward to grad school. I moved to a new city, Atlanta. I was in a grueling program with people I really didn't fit in with. I've always been shy, but I just couldn't make friends no matter how hard I tried. And school was so hard. I really struggled just to pass. With all of my school demands, I had no time to pursue those things I once loved and it killed me. When I tried to make a difference again, I failed miserably. I lost my self esteem; my self identity. 
One bright spot of that time was my boyfriend- my first ever. He was so wonderful. He would always make me smile and laugh, believed in me. We had so much fun together. He moved for a job, but we talked for hours every night and saw each other every other weekend. It was magic. 
School got even harder, I would cry in class, had panic attacks. Only get out of bed for class, fall asleep there and then go home and sleep. I had a horrible internship with an abusive woman, and she failed me. Which meant I wouldn't graduate. When I found this out, well, I ended up in the ER thanks to a friend I told my plan to kill myself.

But I got on meds, got a good counselor and things looked up. Now that I was done with school (I had a make-up internship) I could finally move to be with my wonderful boyfriend in Austin, so I thought.

Once I moved to Austin, out relationship began to fall apart. He would make fun of my looks all the time, stopped being the person I fell in love with. He became a mean, cheap, heartless person. But I kept trying and trying so hard to please him, which probably just made it worse. We had no live outside of each other and work pretty much. I got a new job and really struggled. My depression came back bad, I would have trouble doing anything beside staying in bed on the internet. My work was piling up and I got so behind. Suicidal thoughts have been always there throughout my life, but they got to be constant. 

I've spent countless hours researching suicide methods. I chose to buy a gun. Multiple times I went to the store and looked at them. Thankfully I called a hotline, and well, ended up in a psychiatric hospital. That was about a month ago.

While there, I read a great book on depression, got on new meds and came out feeling like a new person. But then it was my 4 year anniversary with my boyfriend. I got feeling so depressed about us, he rejected my gifts I bought him and I threw him out, saying we were broken up.

The breakup was so hard, my progress from being in the hospital all went away. I begged God for help. I told my mom about everything and she flew down on a plane the same day. She came, helped me a lot, cleaned my place. We had a lot of fun together. I felt like I could do this, get over my depression. But it didn't last, when she left I was bad and didnt take my meds and nearly jumped off a highway overpass.

I got back on my meds and am really trying to go out and do things, pamper myself. And it helped. But now I just feel like its all a joke. Those thoughts of suicide just won't go away. I'll never be the person I want to be. I'm only getting older and like is getting worse. My boyfriend said the reason he started treating me so bad was because I gained weight, got dark circles under my eyes and he didn't want to deal with my depression.

Now, I'm just listening to all 126 songs on wikipedia about suicide. I don't want to die, but I just don't feel like my life is going to get better. I'll always have these demons tormenting me. Every time I try, I get brought back down. It's just too hard to fight. I just don't want to fight anymore..."

The successful applicant will be helping with research and providing support to the main 'consumer insight team'.  They state the following skills as necessary:

&gt;you will have strong research and analysis skills. You should also be highly numerate. Good organisational skills are essential as it the ability to work on your own initiative. Excellent written and oral communication skills are a must. You'll need to be able to get up to speed on new areas quickly but most of all, you'll need to be full of ideas, enthusiastic and genuinely passionate about consumer issues.

Here's a link to a google docs draft.  I'm going to add more about why I want to work for the group and what I can do for them, but just wanted to know if what I've done so far is OK?

Thank you for taking the time to look over it.

Hi /r/cscareerquestions, I'm a 20yo Peruvian 4th year (out of a 5-year-long career) Maths undergraduate, currently working at Wolfram  Research, who is interested in applied Maths, cognitive science, CompSci and AI, evolutionary biology, behavioral economics and tons of other stuff. Sadly, my school's Math department is very pure-oriented, to the point where some teachers will (maybe jokingly) be offended if one tells them they are doing applied stuff.

As such, I figured I need not (and want not) stay here forever doing pure stuff while my mind is elsewhere. I'm beginning to look for CompsSci/AI departments/groups/people that would be interested in corresponding or maybe even receiving a Maths undergrad for any kind of program or internship.

Does /r/cscareerquestions know or can point me to anyone interested? I'd be more than happy if you did. Thanks!"

10nwgd,2,2012-09-29,"Reddit, help me land my dream job by reviewing my cover letter so I can quickly submit my application!",LaunchRapidFire,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10nwgd/reddit_help_me_land_my_dream_job_by_reviewing_my/,"Here is the link to the description: http://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=ce1dd714ca3b5b09&amp;q=clerical&amp;l=Chicago,+IL&amp;tk=1788a5u7t06ag24g&amp;from=ja&amp;alid=931816749eb30c53&amp;utm_source=jobseeker_emails&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=job_alerts. 

Based on the tone of the job ad and the company website, I decided to take a chance and break out of the nice, but dull, tone that cover letters often acquire. Let me know if you find it a little too risky or if you find even the slightest error (my inner Grammar Nazi can only do so much at 6 am). Here is my cover letter pasted in all of its glory (and yes, it's only one page):

Dear Hiring Manager:

If you are like me, you must take these three steps (in this exact order) when a company such as ByteManages perfectly describes you in their job description for a Data Production Clerk: 

1.	You must squeal with delight in your heart (or brain, depending upon how technical you want to get).
2.	You must research this amazing company and discover how it has proud Data Geeks, a blog, and even a “datavangelist”.
3.	You must resist the urge to modify your resume so that it only talks about your dream to one day copy edit self-published e-books and online content (too many are heavy on ideas and short on editing), the extent to which you Google everything and use Google products, and how you never gave up on your hope of finding a place where a logic puzzle lover would be welcomed because of their hobby.

Once all of those steps have been completed, only then can you proceed to state the following:

•	Between years spent on logic puzzles and your experience as an Auditing Intern, you notice the tiniest details and believe in checking your work thoroughly.
•	Being a bookworm has given you superhuman focusing abilities, turned you into a silent Grammar Nazi (see #3), improved your written communication skills, and made you a great organizer (because once you organize your books, you might as well create an organizational system for the contents of your closet, computer, and refrigerator).
•	Your time as a Customer Service Representative Intern vouches for your verbal communication skills and gave you the chance to occasionally organize your co-workers’ records.
•	Due to your interest in tracking your jogging speed and endurance, you were motivated to learn Excel and became moderately proficient in it.
•	You love the Internet and while you have never considered how other people buy products online, you are interested in a company that has a role in making online shopping better for everyone (including you). 

If I could, I would go on talking forever about how the requirements for a Data Production Clerk are perfectly aligned with my skills and experiences but, in the interest of actually finishing this cover letter, I will stop. Instead, I will conclude by saying that if you are interested in learning more about what I have to offer ByteManagers, please contact me at LaunchRapidFire@gmail.com or (777) 777-777.  

Thank you,

LaunchRapidFire

Edit: I have been sick these past two days so I couldn't immediately respond to your awesome feedback, but thank you so much for responding and I am currently working to revise my cover letter.

[So, what WAS your offer for Dwight Howard?  And how pissed were you with David Stern blocking the original Chris Paul trade that would have landed Pau Gasol in Houston?  Of those two moves, which trade would you rather have had go through?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esk77?context=5)|We would have been thrilled for either of these moves to go through which should hopefully make sense in the context of my other answers that we want to obtain a top player. I guess this will have to be AMAA as I hope you can understand I would never reveal the private trade conversations we have had with other teams. We thought we made a very good offer in both circumstances and in both circumstances the team decided to do something else.
[I've heard Royce White, a current player of yours, has a major fear of flying. How have you handled this situation, and what will you do in the future when traveling far for away games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esjz5?context=5)|Royce White has an issue with anxiety that is more common than people talk about and he has done a good job to bring awareness. It did not affect his ability to fly for games last year and we don't expect it to this year. It certainly did not affect him last year where he was unquestionably one of the top players in the country and the best player on the floor in the Kentucky-Iowa State NCAA tournament game.
[What about the '04 Pistons as a counter example? You could argue Billups and Hamilton, but they would be on the very low end of top 10-20 players. Or Rasheed? Maybe, but that is an example that stands out clearly for me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6et6c1?context=5)|Billups and Ben Wallace clearly were playing at an all-star level in my opinion at that time. Also, 4(!) of them made the all-star team either that year or the next. For those wondering on Ben Wallace, they had the #1 defense in the league and Ben Wallace was for sure the primary reason for it. Omer Asik has the potential to play at an all-star level on defense. We will see if he does.
[Are Asik and Lin all-star superstars? or even trade-able assets to acquire one? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esws6?context=5)|Lin played at an all-star level last year. Even if he does not maintain that level (likely), both he and Asik increase our flexibility and get us closer to our goals. I also like that Lin has already played for a small yet not insignificant stretch at an all-star level. This increases his odds -- up and down the roster that is the primary thing we are trying to do -- increase our odds of developing or acquiring an all-star level player.
[I am 6ft 10 and only slightly uncoordinated with low mileage on my knees. what is your best offer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6estiu?context=5)|Can I just buy your knees?
[Thanks for doing to AMA. I have many questions, so feel free to skip any question that you are unable to discuss here, but please try to answer any that you can.   Can you tell us anything about psychological characteristics that you use to evaluate players?   Can you give us some insight as to how you choose Kevin McHale as head coach (e.g., any analytics that you can discuss\)? This article gives some hint about your desire to select a good ""leader"", but what about factors such as which lineups to run?   How much influence do you have on playing time and lineup decisions? Coach McHale sometimes puts out interesting lineups. (e.g., K-mart at the 4, or Camby and Dalembert playing 4 and 5 together\). Who comes up with these unique substitution patterns? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl68?context=5)|He is very talented. I think he may still have a productive career. Many factors for it not working but Chandler Parsons emerging was a big one.  there are some analytics you can use to analyze coaching but you primarily want a leader who can help you win games and is aligned with the organization. It is early in Kevin's coaching career but over time I believe people will see how good he is.
 |Coach McHale is in charge of playing time. If he asks for ideas/input then we give suggestions.
[Do you believe that our current roster has playoff potential? Are there any meaningful moves to be made before the start of the season?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl6c?context=5)|We definitely have a chance at the playoffs. It is a stretch goal but it is a realistic goal and would be great for the franchise as it would likely mean  that 1+ of our players have developed into all-star level players.
[How angry does it make you when big market teams (like the Lakers\) constantly have A+ talent falling into their laps with seemingly little effort on their part? What needs to happen for Houston to become a desirable destination for big names?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl6c?context=5)|Does not make me angry. just part of the landscape of competition.
[Can you dunk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl6c?context=5)|This is embarrassing to admit but I am 6'4"" and unlike reddit fave Woody Harrelson, I cannot dunk. In my youth I could get a tennis ball through.
[When can we expect Moneyball 2: Moreyball?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl6c?context=5)|This would be a terrible movie. that said, we did have a 22 game winning streak and apparently a long winning streak is all you need for a movie.
[I had no idea you were into eSports! What do you currently follow?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl6c?context=5)|I am a big fan of MLG and SC2. I like to think I can macro with the best of 'em. Micro skills not as good. I got into it because of my 10-year-old son and I was heavily into gaming when I was younger.
[When Dikembe Mutumbo would speak to you, would you sometimes just nod and say yes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esrc2?context=5)|Yes. And then I would ask him to follow up with a txt of what he wants on one of the 4 cell phones he always carried.
[(this might be too personal, if so, sorry\) It has been reported you have donated quite a bit of money to Mitt Romneys campaign. What are the a few of the reasons you support him over Obama or other candidates?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eskrz?context=5)|[I was asked about this recently\] (\[Link to www.tnr.com](http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/106489/nba-players-back-obama-one-smart-exec-romney))
 |Sorry reddit, I know my opinion on this will not be popular! Hopefully you can [check out\] (\[Link to www.tnr.com](http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/106489/nba-players-back-obama-one-smart-exec-romney) the article (it is short) if you care about politics vs reflexively being negative.
 |One thing left out of the article I told them is that many of Mitt Romney's partners are good friends and owners of the Boston Celtics (where I worked for 4 years) so I do have near first hand knowledge of my opinions in that article and my belief that Mitt would make a great leader for the country.
[How frequent of a visitor are you of /r/nba?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esm6x?context=5)|Yes.
[Would Bill Simmons actually make a good NBA GM?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eso74?context=5)|I think he would make a good GM. He really knows the game. He obviously is a friend so take my opinion for what you will but I have found his knowledge of the game to be very high over the many years we have known each other. The only time I think he would struggle is handling owner input as he is very independent minded (which has made him successful in everything he has done).
[When Lowry was traded away and Dragic signed with the Suns you guys went from two starting quality point guards to none. From an outside perspective it looked like fairly inept managing, what was going on internally during this time. Were you confident you could get Jeremy Lin? Were you rolling the dice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esjyl?context=5)|First, I would refer to my #2 answer [here\] (\[Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6espxl))  Each move makes sense under this lens. The guaranteed lottery pick we received from Toronto for Lowry is more valuable in acquiring an all-star level player. Dragic wanted a player option (that Phoenix gave him) which greatly harms a players value and will almost always lead us away from [#2\] (\[Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6espxl)) A player option essentially guarantees that a team ends up with either a free agent (not valuable) or a player who the league thinks is not valuable and blocks your salary cap flexibility.
 |We were rolling the dice on getting Jeremy Lin but taking smart risks is what we have to do up and down the roster on every move. As only 1 team out of 30 gets to win, you cannot play it safe. A fund manager who beats more than half his peers and beats the S+P 500 is considered pretty good. We have won more games than we lost the past few years (beaten our peers) despite losing our franchise player Yao Ming and it has been appropriately considered disappointing despite the fact that most teams win around one-third of their games after losing their franchise player. We need to keep taking on more smart risk.

[ off, thanks for taking the time to do this (and on my birthday too!\), I am a huge fan of you and the Rockets. My question is about the rise of analytics in the league. More and more teams are incorporating analytics into their front office, and as one of the pioneers of this in the NBA how do you feel about losing this 'advantage' and what kinds of things do you do to keep analytics moving forward while still holding a edge on the competition? Clearly events like the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference fosters sharing of information, but the nature of sports is to hold on to any advantage you can for as long as possible. How do you reconcile these two aspects of your position?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esjrb?context=5)|[I wrote an article for HBR on this\] (\[Link to blogs.hbr.org](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/08/success_comes_from_better_data.html))
[If Jeremy Lin asked to sleep on your couch, would you let him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6espej?context=5)|Yes. Unfortunately I have to run, thank you for all the questions! I will check in and try to answer a few more when I have time. Best, Daryl.
[I was wondering what your view is on the actual returns to analytics in the NBA. It seems to me that because of the way player movement is regulated and because the league is so superstar driven, analytics can be rendered fairly useless if the only goal of the organization is to win a championship. You can collect an amazing group of undervalued players, but unless you have lucked into a superstar or two, your ceiling is likely a Conference Finals appearance.  Is analytics something that really only becomes valuable once you have found a franchise player (i.e. surrounding him with the right talent to win\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esldy?context=5)|I think analytics can help improve the quality of nearly all decisions to some extent but as you mention the potential efficacy will vary. The utility of analytics on a decision will also vary but I will just discuss efficacy since you brought it up.  Yes, I agree, what I am stating about acquiring an all-star level player every NBA GM in 1965 could have also stated with confidence. It is just a fact that the structure of our sport requires this. No other major professional team sport comes remotely close to having a player like Lebron James who can single handedly shift a team from winning 3 out of 4 games (09-10 Cavs) to 1 out of 4 games (10-11 Cavs).  The reason for this is numerous with two off the top of my head being fewer players on the court and a near asymptotic distribution function of high end talent. One way I describe it is imagine in baseball when Barry Bonds was at the height of his powers he could have kept calling himself to the plate over and over, ignoring the lineup card. This is essentially what the top players in basketball can do each time down the floor -- they can ""call their own number"" and make sure the team gets a great possession each time.  I do think analytics can improve the process to getting a top player but as you state, it has not created a new path to winning like has opened up in baseball with analytics where numerous small smart decisions and great roster management on player 2-25 can lead to a championship. No amount of work and good decisions on our players 2-15 could overcome not having an all-star level player. 
[What do you think of the trend of ""small ball""? There's a handful of teams that have moved their 3's down to the 4 (Durant, Carmelo, LeBron\), and speed and athleticism seem to be favored more so than a big man that can slow the game down and beat a team with his size. Do you think this trend will continue, and is there still a place in the league for the traditional dominant big man?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esxec?context=5)|For sure in the regular season, the general rule of thumb to help you win is put your 5 best players on the floor as much as possible. Because of scarcity, the smalls are generally better than the bigs and also more numerous. This is why ""small ball"" works. 
[This is awesome that you're here. In my opinion you are one of the greatest modern basketball minds and the Rockets have always overachieved given their roster/limitations/injuries.  Lot of questions I'd like to ask, but here's one that I thought of on the way to class.  Of all the trades, signings, draft picks, which one has been your favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl5l?context=5)|[private message] your money is in account CYMN271828182846.
[What do you feel has been the biggest hindrance to signing a star to Houston?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esjoh?context=5)|Nothing. Houston is a huge asset in helping us in free agency (weather, income tax, large city, etc...). We are not the top destination city in the NBA but we are near the top. The reality is only a extremely small number of the top 10-20 players change each off-season (sometimes zero) and they also rarely change via free agency (vs trade) so the number of chances is extremely small and when those chances come up the number of potential destinations is very numerous. Long way of saying that the odds are stacked against every team and we just have not overcome those long odds. Has nothing to do with Houston.
[Hey Mr. Morey, thanks for the AMA! Actually a rivalrous Spurs fan here, but I've got some questions for you...  I know this one will be difficult to answer, but here it goes. You've stock-piled a lot of awesome, young talent the past few years, but were you disappointed to not get Pau or Dwight this summer?  Are there any other GMs/Owners you look up to, look to for advice, or just admire in the league?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eskxd?context=5)|No shock but I think RC Buford might be the best in the business. Pat Riley has done an amazing job and only league jealousy prevented him from winning GM of the year recently in my opinion (I obviously voted for him).
[ finally, what do you feel has been your best decision as Rockets GM?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eskxd?context=5)|Best decision as GM was likely Rafer Alston for Kyle Lowry as it was a hard one to pull off -- we traded our starter in the middle of a playoff race for a Kyle who was barely playing. I think Kyle will do amazing in Toronto.
[Mr. Morey.  1\) Do you give any input to the coaches on minute allocation based on the analyis you do? (ala billy beane\) Do you have any thoughts regarding the folks at The Wages of Wins?  Link: Link to wagesofwins.com.  2\) I own 3 of  your players in a dynasty fantasy basketball league. Can you PLEASE play Asik, Motie, and Chandler more? Thanks.  3\) I've worked in finance my entire career. Is there a transitional role for me into the front office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eslic?context=5)|The Wages of Wins folks have contributed important new ideas to NBA analysis. I expect they will do more in the future. 2) that is up to coach McHale 3) there is but it is very tough to obtain.
[How much will you utilize omer asik in the upcoming season? How do you think he will benefit your team? I love him as a player, i hope he starts every game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esmkr?context=5)|We don't spend $8 million per year on someone we don't plan to help us! He will anchor our defense and we think his offense will improve through his hard work with Kevin McHale and Carroll Dawson.
[Please settle a Twitter argument.  Better nickname for Donatas Motiejunas, ""Donuts"" or ""The Don""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esltr?context=5)|We have settled on DMo just for simplicity.
[What position do you see Terrence Jones and Royce White playing? Both the 3 and the 4?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esogz?context=5)|Terrence can play 3-5. Royce 4-5 although he is like a PG offensively. He is hard to pigeon hole.
[How difficult is it to deal with other GMs who are keen on using advanced metrics to evaluate players? Do you ever get the impression that any of the other GMs are reluctant to work with you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esiuh?context=5)|Every team pretty much deals well with every team in the league. It is a small group so relationship are generally very positive all around. No one is reluctant to work with us.
[With the benefit of hindsight, are there any trades you would not have made? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esiuh?context=5)|If we knew Yao Ming was never going to really recover from his injury in the Lakers series in 2009 then we could have shifted into our current strategic mode faster and there are many transactions we would not have done.
[Conditional only on information available at the time, who would you have drafted first overall in 2001? What about 1996? 1984? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esiuh?context=5)|2001 draft : that was a hard draft to get right, I have empathy for the GMs. I am not sure who we would have taken. I was not in the league at the time so hard for me to answer. 1996 draft: I think we would have taken Iverson. 1984 draft: that is easy. Olajuwon.
[What is your clutchfans user name?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esm8w?context=5)|I don't have one but I do read the site.
[Why did the Rockets decide to let go of Lee for nothing?  A lot of Bulls fans had predicted over the past season that Lee would end up in Chicago in a deal for Asik. Was there any possibility of this happening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6eswcr?context=5)|We obtained a pick in the 31-35 range for Courtney Lee. This is as valuable or more valuable than a first round pick which directly squares with our [goals\] (\[Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6espxl))
[I think you mean more valuable than a late (20-30\) first round pick. Certainly not a lottery pick, correct?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6euhqj?context=5)|Right, 31-35 is arguably as valuable as a late 1st round pick.
[What kind of role do you see Chandler Parsons playing this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esn8b?context=5)|Likely starter and if he improves on his rookie year then he has as real chance to surprise the league. He has the mind and physical tools to be very good.
[Also, as a basketball stat junkie, I would love to go to the MIT Sloan conference. Is the conference open to the public?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esm9z?context=5)|Yes. jump on the mailing list on the [home page\] (\[Link to www.sloansportsconference.com](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/))
[What do you think is the best publicly available defensive metric? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esn3l?context=5)|None really.
[How good is your basketball game?  Could I take you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6etgiu?context=5)|I am pretty decent. I would win but it might be just because I would insist on having control of the venue and rules so it is to my advantage.
[Were you the team to hire Haralabos as a consultant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esmhk?context=5)|No, but he has an incredibly good basketball mind.
[Do you have a favorite memory in your time with the Rockets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esohm?context=5)|22 game winning streak. Tougher to do than win the title. That is what I tell myself when I get depressed at all the work we still have to do to get back to being championship contenders.
[How do you justify a basketball player making more than someone who actually gives a service to the community (surgeon, doctor, an honest cop\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6etg1t?context=5)|Supply and demand has no morality. sort of like evolution.
[If you had to pick a starting five of all retired players in their prime, who would you pick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6essiv?context=5)|I am going to include current players. My five would be CP3, Jordan, Lebron, Duncan, and Olajuwon.
[Where do you rank Hakeem Olajuwon in the greatest centers of all-time conversation?  Why do you rank him in the said position?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6etfwt?context=5)|Best center.
[If Mark Cuban and Jeff Van Gundy got in a fight.  Who would win?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6et1dl?context=5)|Jeff. He would [get hold of his leg\] (\[Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoTTCeLhLDA) and take him down.
[Where would you rank Mitch Kupchak as a GM? Were you shocked/surprised when he pulled off the Dwight Howard trade?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esjqa?context=5)|I was not surprised Mitch pulled this off. Not only is he a great GM, I was in contact with them throughout the process and I knew they were trying to obtain him.
[Who was better in their prime, Tracy McGrady or Kobe Bryant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6et2qj?context=5)|McGrady.
[Hey Daryl! Can we get new uniforms, please? Ketchup and Mustard or go home. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6espyb?context=5)|Not my area. I don't know of any plans for new uniforms. I like our current uniforms and the classic uniforms that we still sometimes wear.
[Can i get an internship with you guys? Im a junior majoring in stats at duke.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6etmyx?context=5)|[Yes you can!\] (\[Link to www.houstontoyotacenter.com](http://www.houstontoyotacenter.com/jobs/job_529.php))
[Hows yao ming in person ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esiei?context=5)|A great person which people always say but actually true in this case. I think the quality he has as a person that many don't know about is that he is extremely funny. He was by far the funniest person in the locker room. Most jokes I cannot print there is one time I remember I can talk about. During the pre-season required drug testing, all the players were lined up to pee in a cup and Yao Ming looking to all of them and said, ""why am I the only one not nervous""?
[SEA/OKC was dreadful for three years which allowed them to acquire Durant, Westbrook, and Harden in the Lottery.  How will Houston compete with this by consistently being just ...OK.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10mrkx/iam_the_houston_rockets_gm_ama/c6esl1g?context=5)|Being an extremely crappy team is definitely a well worn path to success in the NBA. Each year, the NBA hands the most valuable asset in the game (a scale wage top 5 pick) and hands it to the most mismanaged teams.
 |We could go with this approach (in fact the Rockets invented it long ago) but we think our approach can succeed as well and can succeed faster even though it is more difficult.

[What is the wildest thing you have come across working in the park? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6enjc8?context=5)|Wildest thing? I'd have to say that it was this one time that I was giving a boat tour. we were stopped in one of the canals, and a log bumped into the side of the boat.[ or so I thought] I went to push it away with the boat pole, and it rooled over, and it turned out to be a dead body.

[So, I'm curious as to how you handled this. Did you stop the tour and say there is a dead body? Obvously you must have called in, but how did you handle the potentially freaked out tourists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6eszkn?context=5)|I just told the people in the boat that it stalled [i had killed the engine, so it was beleivible.] We called ""200 Protection"" on the radio and tell them that ""we stalled on [canal name] and we need a ride. bring the divers, I think we lost something"" then they callsed back, ""What'd you drop?"" and I said ""The front page of the paper"" [the story was on the front page, they understood. we transferred the tourists to another boat witout them noticing, and they got the rest of their tour, wth another ranger.

Ever found yourself in a dangerous situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10m7qa/iama_park_park_ranger_ama/c6ep5c6?context=5)|Pretty slow.

 |I've never rally been in a dangerous situation, but I have found a dead body in a canal.

I feel like I get more connected to history every time i talk about it. there atre about 30 questions that every ranger has memorized due to being asked so many times, but most of us [me included] don't mind. it's kind of fun, actually, because sometimes a little kid will ask a question, then 5 minutes later his mom or dad will ask it, and I say, ""ask your son! he can tell you all about it!"" it's quite cute, and i love getting kisds involved in history.

",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10pp79/hey_reddit_what_was_the_most_stressful_week_or/,"I am currently going through my most stressful week of my academic career so far and just seeing other people's stories and advice would be a huge help.

For me, this week has consisted of an exam on Wednesday, an exam Thursday, it was parents weekend so I had to spend time with my dad all day yesterday,  an exam Monday, an exam Tuesday, a homework assignment due Tuesday (it will probably take 10+ hours and was only given on Friday), an exam on Wednesday, a homework assignment due on Wednesday, an interview for an internship on Thursday, and yet another homework assignment due on Friday.  Mixed in between those are two club activities that I cannot miss.

So Reddit, what are your stories and how did you power through?"
10pbsu,0,2012-09-30,How do I explain wanting to switch jobs so quick to future employers?,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/10pbsu/how_do_i_explain_wanting_to_switch_jobs_so_quick/,"Although I love my job I am really unhappy with the pay (very low for my area, pretty much still living paycheck to paycheck and student loans are about to kick in) and some broken promises about other types of benefits I would receive in lieu of working for nearly 30k below the average salary for my position.

I graduated this may and began working my first job in June as an intern then hired on full time in august due to excellent performance. I want to start looking for a better job and have already proven that I am a great engineer here by getting my hands in a lot of different, multi-disciplinary projects, and designing/creating a lot of various new products. Enough to where I think I have a very strong portfolio and resume to get a few interviews at bigger companies through my network (also as another random question, even though I signed an NDA at the place I work, am I allowed to use CAD models I created/worked on in my portfolio that I am showing future employers or no?).

I was just wondering when I start interviewing, what should I tell them the reason for wanting to switch jobs so early on. I dont want them to think that I would flake at the first chance of a better job because honestly I am looking for a stable career I can stay at for at least 5 years, I just expect to be compensated at the fair market value for it and it doesnt look like it is going to happen here so I just want to cut my losses and leave. I don't feel like this would be too professional to bring up at an interview though should the question arise, but I could be wrong?

Thanks for any advice.

10p9db,3,2012-09-30,I feel like its not gonna change,Kjanzen,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/10p9db/i_feel_like_its_not_gonna_change/,"I am a 16 year old guy.

my whole story starts years ago when i was brought to my friends youth group, it was awesome i met a few really cool people and i decided to keep going there. a few years go by and i still attend this youth group. i became really close with who i consider the biggest role model of my whole life, the intern speaker. 

before i was 15 my life was great. me and all my friends were super close and it was great. then i made the stupidest decision of my life i changed schools. i became really anti social not having a familiar face in my school, i even skipped some of my classes which i have never done.

the intern speaker who i looked up to so much was getting married which was amazing news, then he said he got a full time job as a youth speaker... 6 hours away. 

thats when i realized all my friends and everyone i knew was moving forward in their lives and im still me from 2 years before. not even changed, i got in a fistfight with my bestfriend of 12 years cause i need to grow up.

i also saw that all my friends had a girl in there lives and i still had no one.

lets fastforward to now, ive had the best weekend me and my friends went up to the old intern speakers house and we all agree it was the bes tweekend of our lives. then i got home and now everything has hit me at once, everyone is moving forward with their lives and im still 14. everything in m life has changed but me, my dog has died and i still go about my day as if she were still here.

i cant even get my point across to you through words im just confused."
10p02w,1,2012-09-29,"I'm so tired. I just can't take any of this anymore, it's never going to get better.",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/10p02w/im_so_tired_i_just_cant_take_any_of_this_anymore/,"I don't know why I'm posting here. Everyone I've talked to about this has said that my reasons for wanting to kill myself are legitimate and that they would understand if I did. I've been sick for 10+ years now. For the first 5 years I had an undiagnosed lung disease which left me bedridden all through high school. When it was finally diagnosed I was tortured by an unsupervised neurological intern for an hour while she botched a spinal tap so horribly that it left me with permanent nerve damage, and fibromyalgia developed as a result of that neurological trauma, and major PTSD from that incident. I was literally screaming and sobbing on the table begging that bitch to stop as she stabbed me over and over in the spine while blood gushed everywhere and I while I was under zero anesthesia. It was the most traumatic and painful experience of my life and as a result I have horrifically violent dreams and night sweats. I can't sleep without a high dose of sleep meds, which I have been taking every night for the last several years. I'm also on narcotics for my pain, and it's becoming a problem. I've been told by pain management specialists and physical therapists that my pain will never get better. I have been classified as ""severely disabled,"" and I am just 23 years old. I have almost daily migraines since that incident. The medication I have to take for that is also very harsh on my stomach, so I have to drink this other shit to coat my stomach to protect the lining because I will otherwise have horrific stomach pain. In the last year I also had an inexplicably swollen gallbladder, and inflamed intestinal lymphnodes which got so big and painful that I had to go to the emergency room a few times. Long term effects of my lung disease include chronic costochondritis, which feels like I'm having a heart attack all the time, and there's also a good chance I will go blind. My vision is already deteriorating. I'm also losing my memory and my ability to focus. Sometimes when I'm driving my vision will shutter for a good 30 seconds and I just have to hope I'm on a road that I know. I hope sometimes that it will just go black so I have an excuse to drive straight into a barrier.

I can't tolerate anti-depressants. I have literally tried everyone on the market and each time after 1-2 doses I have a violent vomiting session lasting for about 12 hours. I felt like I was dying every time that happened, and I hoped that would be the case. I welcome death. I have tried to overdose while on ambien on a few times, especially when I'm drinking with ambien. I always wake up eventually, feeling sick as hell, and disappointed.  

All I want to do is buy a gun, and drive to that doctor's house four states over. I want to shoot her family while she watches. Then I want to get a knife and stab her in the back repeatedly until she dies. Better yet, find some way to torture her like she did to me and leave her alive. While I'm at it, there are a lot of people I wouldn't mind killing. People have been nothing but horrible to me. Every single friend I've ever had has abandoned me because no one actually gives a shit about other people. If you aren't fun 24/7 you're no good to them. I don't even have a supportive family. My parents have told me that I should kill myself. That it'd be great if they didn't have to pay my medical bills anymore. They don't love me. No one does. I can't do this anymore. I am so sick of waking up, unable to move until my painkillers kick in, then forcing myself to go about my day as if I don't want to murder everyone in sight for bitching about their ""problems,"" start to feel sick to my stomach, take more pain killers, start to get a migraine, take migraine meds, get bitched out by some housewife for parking in a disabled spot with my disabled permit because I ""don't look disabled,"" having to hold back tears when my pain flares up even more but I'm out of pain killers, drive to the pharmacist - get there without remembering the drive at all, act pleasant to the pharmacist so they will keep giving me drugs, drive home, sit around with heating pads all over my body, take more pain killers, wait and wait until it's late enough to take ambien, I love ambien, it makes me unconscious. That's the best part of my day."
10oyvn,3,2012-09-29,University career fair advice?,deuteros,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/10oyvn/university_career_fair_advice/,"A little background on myself:

I received my undergrad in Accounting in 2006. It took me about a year and a half to realize that my choice of a career was a huge mistake. The thought of being an accountant for the rest of my life made me miserable. Fortunately in 2009 I got a job that was low stress and flexible enough to allow me to go back to school for a Computer Science degree.

So I've been taking classes since 2009 and now I'm in my last semester before I graduate. I actually wasn't planning on graduating until next spring but I unexpectedly discovered that I could get exempt from the course I was planning to take. 

Anyway I feel totally unprepared. My only coding experience is what I've learned in school. I never did an internship because I'm 31 and I have a wife and two kids and I work full time. My university's career fair is next week and I plan on going but to be honest I really don't know what to expect or how to present myself. When you're an Accounting major everyone is expected to go into public accounting after graduation but there's not really a rigid career progression like that for Computer Science. The only thing I know I want is a job where I can write code. But beyond that I really have no clue.

Any advice? What sort of stuff should I put on my resume?"
