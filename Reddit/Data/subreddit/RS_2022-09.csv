I am a second year Information Technology and Systems graduate and I was wondering how to land an internship. I haven't done anything really and its all a bit overwhelming, considering my friends are all applying. I live in the Dallas, TX area so it shouldn't be that hard to find an internship, but apparently my friends are struggling a lot for those data analyst/developer internships.  I am always open to advice, so please let me know if there's anything that I can do to land me an internship by summer."

So I started an internship for the fall semester, which I am now a week into. I don’t want to get too ahead of myself but I’d like to have a plan as I have had with my MA program.

So…the internship is set to end at the beginning of December and I’m curious when it’s appropriate and smart to look for my next opportunity. This is my first internship and I currently manage social media accounts and engage. I also write blogs and track analytics. 

I’m very proud that I finally have something to put on my resume as experience and will start to update my resume probably mid way through so maybe October? 

I would like to keep this momentum going and the Spring 2023 semester is my final semester in my MA program and I’d love to have at least one more internship before I’m done. 

I hope this helps and any questions, don’t hesitate to ask. I appreciate any help/advice!!"
x2w1n2,19,2022-08-31,Fall '22 MS CS applicant: recap &amp; thoughts,redasroses,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/x2w1n2/fall_22_ms_cs_applicant_recap_thoughts/,"Hey all. This community was very helpful to me when I was applying to MS in CS programs last year.  I was always interested in reading what previous applicants had to say, so I figured I'd come back and give you guys my recap &amp; thoughts. 

**Application Quick Facts:**  
GRE: 333 (164V/169Q, 5.0)  
GPA: 4.0  
Undergrad major: Math (had a CS minor)  
5 semesters of TAing Intro CS courses, including teaching recitations  
4 software engineering internships  
2 years volunteering at STEM outreach events at my school  
0 research experience to speak of.   
Applied to: Georgia Tech, UNC Chapel Hill, NC State, Univ. of South Carolina  
Accepted everywhere, and 2 tried to recruit me to their PhD programs. One of them was successful &amp; I entered their PhD program this year.   
  
  

**SOP:**   
I struggled a lot with the SOP, as many do. I heard over and over again that it should focus primarily on what you plan to do in and after graduate school. And as it turned out, I could express what I planned to do in and after grad school in about 3 sentences (At the time, it was just “to spend two years learning cool theory &amp; cryptography stuff and then go into industry”). Lol. So focusing on that wasn’t going to work for me. 

I ended up talking mostly about my background without worrying too much that I was restating my resume. I also rounded it out with more “human” elements (i.e. discussing how I struggled with confidence during my first internship, etc). Furthermore, I discussed how important the friendships I’d made within the CS department were to me (primarily formed with coworkers &amp; students while TAing) &amp; professed a desire to build &amp; encourage that same community at my new school.  I also just generally love going to school so I mentioned that, too. Finally, for every school, I also included a paragraph wherein I stated my aforementioned 3-sentence plan and then mentioned two professors whose work and/or classes I was interested in.       


**Things that I believe made me successful:**  
- Having a relatively unusual (read: mathematical) background &amp; interest. In a world where everyone wants to do AI, being interested in theory is very attractive. Both surprise PhD offers were because theory-focused professors saw my application &amp; attempted to recruit me, since they struggle getting grad students.   
- Mentioning professors in my SOP. Since one of them is now my PI, I know for a fact that he read his name in my application &amp; then went to bat for me in the committee meeting.   
- I don’t have any evidence to back this up, but I assume that if my GRE score helped at all, it was because of the 164 verbal score &amp; 5.0 essay score, since those tend to be rarer among STEM applicants.   

**Things that didn’t affect my application:**  
- My alma mater. I went to an okay-at-best school &amp; literally no one cared.   
- Lack of undergrad research experience. I was worried a lot about this &amp; it didn’t end up affecting me at all. Lots of people here didn’t do research in undergrad.   

I always appreciated when previous applicants did this last year, so I’m definitely willing to share my admittedly limited experience to the extent that it’s helpful to current applicants. Cheers all, and I hope this app season goes well for everyone."

I honestly didn't expect it and was not ready since I had another CS related job and was focusing on personal web projects too. I grinded for a week and did the assessment and I believe I was successful at it. The question now is when should I expect an invitation for a final interview and how to prepare for it? I have some experience working at the university and also working on team projects there, but I am yet to finish my first personal project let alone a full team project (outside of uni). Can I mention the projects outside cs, like an engineering one or a chemical lab project? How do I prepare for the technical interview? I am comfortable with easy hackerrank questions and can do the medium ones most of the time, and as for leetcode I find it harder than hackerrank for some reason. Should I prepare for OOD or system design questions? Should I prioritise working on personal projects for now or should I grind leetcode? I can't do both since I am still working full time and have a deadline to meet. The application is for 2023 winter."

Just as the Enoweians had regrouped, so were the humans sauntering back to their own ship. They’d almost reached the halfway point when they suddenly heard a loud bear-like screech.  

“Hey, did you guys hear that too?” Marshal asked.

It had come from around the corner and was accompanied by the pitter-patter of what sounded like roughly two dozen anxious muppets.

The four of them slowed down and looked back only to see a crowd of determinant Teddy-Ruxspins rushing towards them. They were covered in some sort of dark blue liquid while wildly flailing flash-lights. Or at least they assumed those things were flashlight right up until one of them aimed it at Jeremiah’s posterior and burned a hole right through his suit.  

“Ouch, oh heavens.” He yammered as the photon riffle left him with a rather nasty looking second degree burn. At which point the humans turned around and began to run as hard as they could. “Don’t worry kid.” Marshal said. “I can easily fix that once we get back to the oh sh-” the doctor ducked right as a beam was about to hit the back of his head. “So with that in mind, be sure to shield my body with your own.”

With the Enoweians hot on their trail the humans continued to run through the bowels of the ship. Due to the lights being off and the fact that bolts of colored light kept flashing past their heads the situation almost reminded them of a rave. Or at least it did right up until someone got hit and the smell conjured up the mental images of a barbecue. Clark was pretty sure he saw Stella lick her lips last time Jeremiah got hit and hoped to god she was just hu-… scratch that, both scenarios had him pray internally for Jer’s immortal soul.

Luckily for the humans it appears that while desperation and fear are great motivators, those can only get you so far when your adversary has a body much more proficient in regards to endurance running, and that’s already discounting the fact that human on average have somewhat longer legs.

“Oh gods, how are they still going.” One of the exhausted Enoweians tried to say while coughing and wheezing heavily. “It’s like they’re um” … “magical?” another one added.

“Of course,” Captain Ekilos remarked. “They’re near their cradle world. Their goddess is obviously empowering them with her vile soul magic. But don’t worry, we’ll catch up with them eventually, all we have to do is bless these hallways,” he said while smearing some of the blood staining his fur onto the walls. “And sooner or later there will be nowhere left for them to run.”

----------------------------------

“I can’t believe I’m actually about to do this.” Raeqa murmured to herself. The flood of her own kinsmen had swept her up and she’d been carried of to the aforementioned ‘supply closet blanket-fort’ AKA the ‘cuddle-hut’. Luckily for her she’d managed to pretend she had been with them all along so as to not attract any suspicion. Afterwards when they’d decided to go out and attempt “suicide by Gaian” she’d volunteered to stay back and take care of “... um what was your name again?”

Pained grunts and groans emanated from the weakened, frail heap of Enoweian that was laying in front of her.   

”I think I’ll just refer to you as my patient then, if that’s alright with you.

Raeqa hadn’t been the only one to volunteer but luckily as soon as she’d reminded them about him possibly turning into a Gaian or that perhaps he was contagious, everyone else suddenly seemed pretty okay with letting her handle this one all by herself.

“Now then I hope you’re in the mood for a small adventure cause my conscience won’t allow me to just let you die here like this. I doubt killing one of them; if that’s even possible, will do much good. So with that in mind I’ve thought of an equally desperate yet slightly less suicidal plan. Believe it or not but I’m actually on somewhat good terms with one of the Gaians and from what I can tell, I don’t think they’re all that bad.  

So what if I just brought you to them? Maybe they’ll know how to fix this. Of course if all else fails and you begin to transform you’ll at least be with your own kind..., or get a quick death.” That last part she whispered softly under her breath.

Wouldn’t that be better than just wasting away and dying a slow and agonizing death?

Gallyth let out another pained groan.  

“Great, it’s settled then.” She said before letting out a loud strenuous huff and lifting him on the stretcher she’d grabbed while everyone else was gathering blood bags. “Just hold on tight and everything will be alright before you know it, I promise!”

She pushed the floating slab of metal onto the hallway in what she assumed was the right direction.

‘Gods I hope I’m right about this.’ She thought to herself.  

Within the church(es) of the Great Alliance there’s a wide variety of (conflicting) theories in regards to the afterlife. For example some believe in reincarnation, others think there’s some kind of heavenly golden meadow and a small minority believes that death is something that only happens to other people, right up until fate decides otherwise of course.

Keeping all of this in mind, Raeqa was pretty sure that what she was doing now might get her disbarred from any and all post-mortal events, occasions and celebrations. Not that she ever particularly cared what the gods might think of her of course, although that being said perhaps it would be more accurate to say that she’d never considered herself noteworthy of their attention (and therefore scrutiny) in the first place. That is of course, disqualifying this precise moment wherein she was sure that they were all watching her, wearing matching jersey’s and loudly screaming at her like enraged sports fan might when one of their home team’s athlete is about to score a point for the opposing team.

She could almost imagine some of them waving flags, holding up banners and blowing air horns while yelling profanities at her. At the very least it’d match how she was feeling right about now. She felt guilty, traitorous and most of all, evil.  
“No,” she shook her head and tried to collect her thoughts. “I won’t let my fears control me and override my sense of reason, gods be dammed! I was blessed with sapience so now watch me use it!

With her spirit revitalized and renewed conviction the young Enoweian bravely ran down the hall in search for help, in search for the Gaians.

------------------------------

Clark and his fellow humans were walking through the darkened halls of the ship in search for the exit. Well technically in a spaceship anything can be an exit as long as you’ve got a sufficiently powerful weapon and a head as empty as space itself. Therefor it’d be more accurate to state that they were looking for their very specific “circumstantial visitation and emergency assistance hole.” The legal suits had vigorously insisted that they carefully refer to such  … diplomatically sensitive scenarios using jargon pulled from a very limited and predefined list of words. Or that they at the very least mind their volume when nearby anyone donning a tie as opposed to the company mandated scowl, especially if they suspect said person has a law degree and an aversion to garlic.

If it hadn't been for the army of moldy Monchhichis they’d been back already. Navigating through a darkened ship is already hard enough without getting shot at by alien-bear creatures drenched in their own blood. Granted, non-lethally of course but no one felt particularly inspired to stop and investigate whether said assumption was 100% correct. And thus, in their haste our humans managed to take a couple wrong rights when they left the Enoweians in the dust.

“Ar- are they still behind us?” Stella asked in between loud gasps, too tired to even look behind her.  

“We lost them about 5 minutes ago I think.” Clark responded.

“Wait, what do you mean 5 minutes ago!? Then why the fuck are we still running!? I feel like I’m about to drop dead any second.”

“Well,” began Marshal. “No one wants to get left behind. That and, adrenaline is one hell of a drug. I should know, I always bring extra. Oh and Jeremiah’s still running because he’s an intern and no one has ordered him not to yet.”  

“Not true, I just figured that we’d b-OOOH SHIT!!” Jeremiah yelled while weaving to the side. He just barely managed to avoid colliding with two Enoweians coming from an adjacent hallway.  

Followed by Marshal dryly remarking: “Alright you can stop now.”

The humans who’d already begun to trail behind the muscled ex-farmhand all slowed down before stopping in front of the Enoweians, one of the two aliens stared at the humans like a deer caught in headlights while the other looked a lot less … “fresh”.  

‘Wait a minute…’ Clark thought to himself as he appeared to recognize the Enoweian pushing the futuristic looking stretcher. It didn’t take long for his suspicion to be confirmed as the Enoweian's expression seemed to turn from sudden fright to nervous relief.  
She frantically began to point at the four of them and then at the poor sickly looking alien. More specifically at a tiny cut on his arm.

“Um .. I think it wants us to help its friend.” Clark pondered aloud. “Maybe we should …, ”

Stella gasped. “Oh nyoo my widdle baby has an ouchy!!”

“And now my bwain has an anyuwisem.” Marshal huffed sarcastically.

“Hold on,” Clark perked up and turned to Stella who was fidgeting guiltily. ”Did you do this? Did you touch something again? You know what happens when you do that!”

“I’m not sure, I guess I may have felt one of them accidentally brush against my finger when you and Jeremiah were trying to stop me from adopting one!” She muttered dejectedly.

“Gosh darn it! If only we’d been faster. We should have expected her to try and grab one.” Jeremiah added. ”This is the petting zoo incident all over again! Only difference is that Clark hasn't dropkicked anyone yet.”

“Whatever lets just drop it.“ Clark remarked. ”Whatever ancient curse is affecting Stella can wait. Now we gotta…”

Marshal stared at him with an expression of mock-annoyance before interrupting,”… as usual force our oh so benevolent and respectable doctor to take care of this poor creature? Why of course, after all it’s my duty as a vet...-eran of medical school to save as many lives as I can.” Marshal laughed nervously while the others were sarcastically staring at him as if to say: ‘Yeah, sure buddy.’  

On top of that, Marshal was pretty sure he saw Jeremiah sneakily slip Clark 20 bucks.

“Now then, I’d hate to be the bearer of bad news but aren’t we forgetting something?” Stella remarked. “Because doctor or not, I doubt there’s a whole lot we’ll be able to do unless we find our way back to our ship quickly.”

“I take it we can’t rely on Stella’s womanly intuition or Jeremiah’s powerful sense of smell either, can we?” Marshal asked.

“Wait guys look, I think our new friend here might know the way.” Clark yelled excitedly while pointing at the Enoweian who was now briskly jogging down the hallway before quickly stopping and beckoning them to hurry up already.

“Lets just hope we don’t come to regret this.” Marshal muttered.

I'm a high school senior doing some self reflection to help decide what careers I should think about and what I should study in college. I have more than one interest as you'll see so thought I'd ask what others think.

I’m looking to combine interests in public policy, law, and computer science for social impact. Areas of social impact I am interested in are income inequality, health care accessibility, and STEM inclusion for minority groups and females. I’ve developed an interest in policies impacting marginalized groups through AP Government, TV shows and movies involving legal cases, and reading about past cases. I think it’s important to have a career linked to technology because it will impact our future. I’m familiar with basic computer science but am also interested in non-coding tech-related roles with one example being product management. I enjoy math and computer science because it helps improve my logical thinking skills which I believe are important for preparing for a career in tech or law. To the extent possible, I’d like the type of work I do to be challenging, fast-paced, structured, and enable diverse experiences. I work best under pressure and think it would be fun to start my career in NYC.

A separate interest is organizing and planning events that help others, whether fundraising for a charity or organizing mentors and resources to educate and mentor fellow students or empower females. I’m also passionate about lifestyle design, personal productivity, and understanding myself to plan for my future and learn about career options. This occurred when I was reaching out to the local community to find partners for internships and mentors for events and school clubs I was helping run where I was exposed to a variety of career types and advice. I’m neither extremely outgoing or an introvert. I’m more reserved around new people I meet but don’t mind forming new relationships if it can lead to a positive outcome for others or help me learn new perspectives. I’m still interested in understanding people and how to influence relationships, for instance I’m currently reading the book by Daniel Carnegie “How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People.”"

I realized I went to engineering for the wrong reasons; good confidence in mathematics and physics, a stable career plus as a person diagnosed with autism, you often hear that STEM is a good career choice for you. However, I never was that kid who was coding or building stuff, social sciences was my area of interest. For some reason, I managed to lie to myself for years until, during the pandemic, I got a reality check. 

I have not had any internships, not doing any personal projects, I have almost a non-existent social network, I have not done any activities outside of my studies. Unfortunatly, I have severe social anxiety, depression and imposter syndrome that have prevented me from doing any progress. 

I can't find any area in STEM that looks interesting to work in. Computer science perhaps but I'm not really passionate enough to pursue a masters degree in that area. I can do some coding but I'm not a computer wizard so I don't fit in with that kind of people. 

I can't even go to campus anymore, I just feel out of place. I don't fit in socially with my peers and I never did at any time. This whole isolation with Covid really was the last thing I needed, My self-esteem and social skills are at a rock bottom.

I see no future in this field but I don't know what I could do instead. I can't work with my hands and I'm not good with people right now.  I just want to sit at home and play video games. Right now it feels like studying engineering was the biggest mistake of my life. My mental health has been declining over the years and it no longer feels worth it. I understand now why so many drop out of engineering, it's not for everyone. I have passed all the exams at least, so clearly I have the ability to learn stuff. 

Has anyone left STEM and what are you doing now? How did you get out of this field? Thank you in advance for advice!"

Toefl yet to give assume 90 ish

Internships :

Project intern at a mid size local company for 4 months (worked on data acquisition) and another at a start up for 2 months as a data engineer. 

Worked on a research problem for about 6 months under a prof from our uni. But led to no demonstrable work/publications.

Hence, no publications. 

LORs from managers from the two companies where I interned and one from a prof. 

I'll be fresh out of college, which means I'll finish my UG in '23. 

Kindly suggest any programs for masters, preferably MSCS Or MSDS. Although I would love to go for a research based program, I understand the limitations of my profile given that I don't have too much of research experience. Hence, aiming for non-thesis based programs. 

Ambitious: 

NEU MSDS, 

University of Minnesota, twin cities MSDS, 

UC, Santa Barbara MSCS, 

UC, Irvine MSCS, 

Moderate: 

Rutgers MSCS

Safe: 

NCSU MSCS

Honestly, all of the above are dream colleges for me. Would be happy to get into any. Are there any other programs that's achievable with my profile? Do I have a good chance to get into any of these? 

Thanks in advance!"

I have a job offer for an IT business management type position at a hospital and the pay is pretty good for a first job (70k). The problem is I want to be a software/web developer and I’m worried I’d be wasting my time in that position while not improving my skills. I would be learning their software for around 6 months so I already know I wouldn’t want to study programming when I get home. I also know I don’t enjoy IT.

On the other hand I have pretty severe imposter syndrome and two internships where both were in IT and not programming. I’m about to graduate with my Bs in comp sci but all I read is how impossible it is to get a first job and when I look at my peers I feel inadequate. I have a 3.9/4 gpa but I feel my projects are lacking and my overall dev skills aren’t the best. Every job listing wants me to know all these different things and it really freaks me out.

I haven’t been told my work is subpar or anything and as far as I’m aware the company is happy with me. The problem however is that I am heavily procrastinating almost every day. There are days where I do nothing and then complete my task near the end of a sprint, or sometimes it takes me longer than a sprint to complete it even though it’s something that should be simple if I ask for help right away. This has constantly been going on and I’m afraid when I get more responsibility that I will end up drowning in it without being able to complete work on time. 

Everyone at the company is very nice and understanding, my mentor likes me and helps me a lot and has not given me any complaints or told me I am underperforming at all. 

But I believe I am, and that I am taking way longer than necessary to do things. I am terrified about working full time at a company that would require more from me as I don’t see myself being able to work with deadlines effectively. 

Has anyone ever been like this near the beginning of their career or at any point in their career? And if so what have you done to overcome this obstacle?"

I might be low expert level right now. I did LeetCode as well (400+ questions). I can clear good amount of OA's.

I have also done development using MERN stack. I also know Linux (probably the most skilled in my college).

I can clearly see I know more than many of my friends. I clear their doubts regarding various topics which I know, but they are getting placed left and right, while I'm here applying to random positions and waiting for emails. I even tried applying for foreign interns but have no success yet. I help everyone in my surrounding so much that I feel used.

On top of that I am an introvert who is bad at socializing or asking for support. I feel I'm getting drained day by day. Applying for random positions and then getting no email for them, or just waiting and forgetting about them is taking a huge toll on me.

I work best with a clear goal and deadline in mind, but the only thing that would provide me this is a job or an intern. I would love to work at an startup or an open source organization as I have interest in them.

I have applied to Google with a referral, that's probably the only OA I can see myself giving in next few months.

What should I do next? What is the course of action. Please help me if you can. I will be really thankful for any support or help."

I am a recent college grad and just received my BS in geography. I am really into GIS and wish to pursue a career in the field. Right now I am doing an internship with my local county gov. However I am seeking employment elsewhere to gain more advanced experience and to better build up my resume/skillset. Therefore I have been applying for and interviewing for numerous GIS Tech positions throughout the tristate area. 

&amp;#x200B;

A recent issue I ran into with some locations/jobs is that the salary that they are offering is extremely low to say the very least. To me personally it seems very unfair to expect young professionals to have to scrap by to earn these essential entry-level positions. It bums me out that I may have to turn down decent looking entry level jobs(skill growth wise) due to the pay being so low it would unrealistic to move to the area due to the high cost of living and housing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am just curious if any of you GIS professional have any personal experience and stories to share of taking these low paying and how it all worked out for you in the end. Sorry that this post is just me rambling on about my problems but I feel this may be a shared issue with recent grads seeking employment. I'm hoping to hear some insight/stories from professionals within the field that might help out myself and other young professionals. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.- I understand entry-level equals lower pay, I am just saying this is an issue I have noticed with job listing in some larger metropolitan areas. Some jobs I have applied for in larger areas have offered more than fair salaries and benefits to boot."

I may be getting an offer soon for an entry-level IT job at a patient services company(Pharmaceutical Industry) in Kentucky and I'm confused about what I should say if asked about my salary expectations. I've looked at salary guides for the industry standards, including the Robert Half guide, so I have some ideas about it. However, the job I would be doing doesn't quite fit the titles that I see. I originally told the company that I was interested in cybersecurity, but the CIO and I both agreed that I didn't have the requisite experience for such a role as a recent graduate. Instead, the role would be more of an entry-level IT role that would do a lot of different things including cybersecurity so I could be trained in multiple areas. So it seems like it would be more responsibility than a normal desktop support position.

I don't want to ask for too much and seem delusional, especially since they would really be helping me out in terms of giving me a position where I can get a lot of good experience for the future, but I also don't want to lowball myself. For context, I just earned my Bachelor's in a tech-related degree, I have earned the CompTIA A+, Net+ certifications, and have some internship experience in IT.

Once I got here, my job duties changd drastically from the posted job description. Somehow as a service tech I was now required to do sales also (which I never would have applied for).

My first 2 months here I did not have any of the things I was promised (company phone, vehicle, credit card, laptop, TOOLS, and even complete PPE). I was required (because my manager didn't feel like doing it) to chase down or requisition all of those things.  

Our intern went back to school 2 weeks ago, and his duties (~35 hours worrh) got dropped onto me.  When I asked how they expected me to do my job, plus his, I was told to ""figure it out"" &amp; that ""we all have to make sacrifices for the customer"". Fuck that noise.

The straw that broke the camel's back was when a co-worker told me to throw another worker under the bus to my boss.  When I told him that I don't do that, he pulled out his phone, called the boss, and did it anyway from ""both of us"". I was so pissed I had to walk away so I wouldn't punch him in his smug face. 

I started looking that same day, and accepted a new position yesterday. A bit of a pay cut, but right down the street from me, and a lot less bullshit.  Gonna email my resignation over the weekend.  Fuck this place. (Referenced other folk's letters from this sub, thanks to them!)

Please accept this email as notice of my resignation as the Field Service Rep for ******. My resignation is effective immediately.

Hi Reddit, I am planning to apply for Round 2. I am lamenting what schools would be realistic and suitable for me and my goal. My stats are as follows:

**Demo:** 27 yo male Indonesian 

**Stats:**

1. Medical Doctor GPA 3.65/4.0 top 10% (15 of +160) graduate. Cum laude from Universitas Indonesia (one of the best and the oldest medical school in Indonesia)
2. Bachelor of Medicine from Universitas Indonesia GPA 3.3/4.0
3. Official score: 2nd attempt GMAT 710 (Q47 V41) 1st attempt 680 (Q50 V32), a significant drop in quant due to focusing on studying verbal only (should I re-attempt or submit both scores?)
4. Toefl IBT 110
5. extra: HBS Online CORe (Credential on Readiness) Pass with High Honors

**Work experience:**

1. I have been personally scouted by the CEO of a boutique private equity focusing on health technology that has invested in my current employer and will be moved to the private equity role as an associate within the next month 
2. Team lead of business analyst and implementation consultant at a newly established Indonesia branch of a multinational hospital information system company operating across the IMEA region (India, Middle East, Africa). The role is pretty similar with a product manager with responsibility for determining sprint priority, product requirements to engineer, and doing product support. I have received the top 2 yearly performance reviews twice in a row and received one promotion and two raises. I have volunteered to lead the initiative to address users' complaints that were causing hospitals-roll-out moratoriums from one of the biggest clients resulting in the moratorium being lifted and a potential revenue increase of +-500%.

**Notable Life Wins:** Overcoming a subset of social anxiety disorder through months of sessions with a therapist related to experiences of being bullied during adolescence.

**Post-MBA goals:** 

*Short-term goal:* 

Transition to an international career in strategy or product role in an organization that is tackling public health issues using business and or technology such as multi-laterals, health-tech startups, or management consulting with a proven record for health industries

*Long-term goal :* 

Starting my own public health startup (currently moving as a pro bono entity) to make public health initiatives self-sustaining 

**Why MBA:** There are 1.3 million community health workers in Indonesia, mostly housewives, who are the frontliners of public health program execution, yet they are only paid 1 to 2 dollars per month. I believe their closeness to the community (to the point of being allowed to survey for mosquito larvae in their neighbors' bathrooms as per government program dictate) is an untapped potential that can be utilized to better public health status and their economy if provided with the right tools. We wanted to establish a startup that can make public health initiatives involving them profitable and self-sustaining rather than continuously depending on NGO and government funding. We realize that our network, skillset, and credential are not enough and decided to pursue self-development first. With my technical co-founders having been accepted at Chicago Health Informatics and my other co-founder wanting to pursue public health degree, I tried to cover the business sides required to move toward our goals.

**Currently preparing to apply for the following schools for this January:**

GSB, HBS, MIT Sloan, Haas, Yale

Feeling a little anxious and not so prepared especially after having a look at their demo practice problems that involves debugging or completing programs with whatever given constraint limits(which gives me less solutions to build up or find) that I oftentimes have trouble fully comprehending.

I am very grateful that a company like Amazon took interest in me as an undergrad Software Engineering student with not much of an extra curricular background, basically an underacheiver. I am a little nervous about it as I am rusty on my coding and problem-solving skills. Hell, even after I took and passed a Data Structures &amp; Algorithm course last year at my university, I still could never for the life of me, completely understand constraints in programming(the meanings behind the math). I barely even understand Big O Notations. 

Right now I'm wondering if there are any great websites or YouTube channels I can find that gives a great and more in-depth explanations of how constraints and Big-O's exactly work in programs/codes."

I am an EU national going into my 3rd and final year in a UK Aerospace Engineering bachelor (Russell Group, top 5 in UK aerospace). I am set to finish with an average above 80%, and thus with the highest grade – First Class (&gt; 70%). I have come to acquire some CS knowledge and skills on my own (Python, MATLAB, Git, basic SQL, basic C), and just had a summer internship in ""technology"" at a FTSE 100 financial services company, which was actually extremely light on the tech.

I'm looking to do an MSc in CS in order to robustly steer my career in that direction. There are a lot of programmes available to me in the UK, but: **(a)** they are really expensive for EU nationals (above 30k GBP for big name unis); **(b)** most of them take in people from any bachelor subject, and only last 1 year, which I think would result in a not-so-productive programme for myself by the end.

Thus, I've been looking for CS MSc programmes in the EU instead. The issue here, however, is that practically all programmes I've found only accept CS bachelors, which would instantly disqualify me. The best I've been able to find is a programme like *MSc Computational Science* from UvA and VU in Amsterdam – it seems to offer quite a lot of flexibility for picking up CS-heavy courses, as well as a track with financial computation applications, which I'm quite interested in. I've also found a programme with many of the same merits at KTH, the *MSc Applied and Computational Mathematics*. 

**Within this context, my question to you all is this**: do you know of any good MSc programmes in CS (or a closely-related field), which can accept students from STEM backgrounds *other* than CS, in the EU?

Thanks!"

During my interview, they told me they could do my MSW internship and I would be paid. I was excited but things keep happening and I can't tell if it's normal or if I should look somewhere else for employment.

Here's what they have done...

1. Push my start another three weeks, and pending more
2. State they cannot locate my professional license when I've sent them my license multiple times (5) and can see my name in the database
3. State I need to provide new references since mine didn't answer when ALL three of mine told me that they talked to someone
4. The day I was supposed to do fingerprints and drove an hour to see them they forgot to inform me they forgot they didn't have the device and had to come back the next day
5. When I asked about the internship info, the person had no idea what I was talking about and told me that they could see what they could do, even tho I was told I would get a paid internship during my interview.
6. Now the internship is a maybe and they told me that they already have other interns and are not 100% sure they can do it, but my school is needed a yes or no in two weeks or we will look elsewhere.

I am feeling frustrated because they said they will push back my start date until I provide more references but I only have a few since I have mostly been a student. I've been waiting for 6 weeks to start working and I need to start making money, I really wanted the paid internship but they are seeming really disorganized. Is this normal or should I look elsewhere?"

So, I've been working for a pharmaceutical company for about 1,5 years now. It's a young company, the culture is great and my direct colleagues are really nice. Lately, I've not been super excited about my day to day tasks as they became more repetitive and it got harder to keep my interest. My salary was about 3000 euro per month.

Now, recently I moved to Amsterdam which is about 40 minutes drive from the company, which starts to annoy me a bit. On top of that I found that in the current market I could potentially earn much more money at a new job much closer to home. 

So, i went on a few interviews, 1 of them being at the company I once did my internship for. They have a position open that seems to suit my qualities and experience very well, and it also is a company that is in the field I actually studied for (fashion).  I felt very excited after the 2 interviews. On top of that it's only 10 minutes from my house and I already know the culture. 

While I was still waiting for them to make an offer; my current employer offers me a promotion including a 750 euro raise and more responsibilities that would make my job a lot more diverse. The company has been really vocal about their appreciaton of me and now the promotion and raise is there to support it. They even allowed me to mold the role to my liking and will hire a new person for the things i dont want to keep doing.

Now, i also got a job offer from the company I did my internship for, they are matching the new salary of 3750 and on top of it being 10 minutes from my house, it also has other benefits for healthcare insurance, a gym in the building, lunch is arranged etc which my current job all doesnt have.

Honestly I am completely lost at this point on what is the best option here. Any advice is welcome!!"

No internships, no personal projects, bad GPA. I didn’t learn much. I pretty much threw $30k away for nothing. I went to classes sometimes and did the bare minimum. 

I’ve been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety in high school and have sought treatment for it for a while. I don’t want to go in more detail but it’s pretty much caused me to be a living zombie mentally and physically. I’m now in a better headspace, but the consequences are catching up to me. I realize that I’ve messed up my life but there’s nothing to do now except to move forward. I’m looking into how I should proceed from here. 

I can code in Java and C confidently but I do not know shit about anything else. I am fairly weak in DSA. I am so lost and I don’t know where to start. I don’t fucking know why or how I have a computer science degree. 

I would greatly appreciate CONCRETE steps I need to take to be employable. I am just lost. I know that I need to work on personal projects and leetcode. What are good projects to build for someone who has to learn almost everything from scratch? What fundamentals do I need to know before starting the leetcode grind? I am interested in web dev, QA, and UI/UX but I do not know any of the languages or technologies that are used. What skills are expected for new graduate/entry level positions?

I just want to get my life together, any career or personal advice would be appreciated. Thank you.

Edit a month later: thank you everyone for taking the time to respond and share your stories and advice. I was so afraid that it was going to be even more discouraging but everyone has been nothing but supportive. I truly appreciate it. I guess the great thing about hitting rock bottom is that there is no place to go but up. Working on relearning DSA and solving Leetcode.

Chose psychology because it was interesting, but it wasn't until 2 years into my undergrad degree that anyone told me that a psychology degree is kind of useless...

Dropped out of school and got a job waiting and found myself working in the restaurant industry for about a decade. Moved up from waiting tables to bartending to management because that's what you do, and after about 10 years of that, I realized I wanted something different and went back to school and amazed myself at my ability to actually do well in school if I approach it like an adult is supposed to. Finished my last 50 or so credits in one calendar year of my psych degree and graduated summa cum laude but knew I wanted to continue my education because psychology wasn't a field I wanted to get into professionally. At first, I wanted to do law school but decided against it after hearing too many horror stories about fresh JD grads making horrible money right out of law school.

I'll be the first to admit that I didn't do much research into what an MBA is really all about when I decided to pursue it. I made the decision on a bit of a whim. I still think I would have made the same decision if I had actually looked more into it before applying and whatnot, but I find myself now having to figure out how to best use this degree I should be getting sometime next year.

I took a couple of ""covid"" jobs after I left my last restaurant job, and once I got a couple of semesters into my MBA program I guess I was worthy to be hired to be a finance and accounting recruiter. I didn't know what to expect from that job, and once I realized it is basically another job where I'm working for tips (commission), I knew it wasn't what I wanted. So now I'm not working and trying to fit together more pieces of the puzzle that is my future career. I like financial modeling and I like data analysis but I'm not yet very technically skilled in those areas. My interest in psych and all of my years working in restaurants has made me a bit of an expert when it comes to dealing with people and relationships, and I'm good at managing people and teams.

My undergrad degree is from a so-so university. My MBA is a more exciting situation. The University it is a part of is one of the most prestigious on the planet with global name recognition in a number of very esteemed fields..but business isn't (yet) one of them... unless you are pretty tuned into the whats-goings-ons of business schools in America and academia in general, you likely wouldn't realize that this business school is only about 15 years old or so, and is only ranked around 30 or so in the nation. The average first-year salary stats are actually solid, but the business school hasn't gotten the chance to catch up to some of the other world-renowned arms of the university. The name itself, though, holds a ton of value, especially to a normie.

It wasn't until recently that I've kind of realized that aiming for an MBA internship is probably my best course of action if I want to be working in a role at a company I am proud of. I'm studying Finance because I wanted to challenge myself, but I am really open to any kind of career at this point."

Maybe someone had a better implementation? 

I can provide my resume if you feel generous enough to review mine (PM me); but as a general reference I have on there 4 internships (one being an embedded systems swe, one doing full stack work at a Fortune 100 company) and 1 project, as well as my extracurriculars + school info.

x3us3f,3,2022-09-02,"it still hurts - 8 days, nonstop pain. gosh...",Ahrett,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/x3us3f/it_still_hurts_8_days_nonstop_pain_gosh/,"There's nothing to explain anymore it's been eight days, three ER visits, useless medication - even the 'strong stuff' doesn't dent it. Only more of the same. Pain, pain, pain. I've tried everything I can.

I'm shaking as I breathe. Biting into the couch cushion. 8 days like this EIGHT DAYS, IT DOESN'T STOP, WHY DOESN'T IT STOP!?! I don't know how much longer this pain will last. I can't sleep, I can't walk, I can't even focus for too long. I just writhe in pain. Trying to study as best as I can for my college classes and I'll just collapse in the middle of skimming through a page.

I told my mother a few days ago how bad it was and I regret it now cuz she's scared too and I don't want her to be scared. So I lied and said it was going away and that I was feeling better. She was so happy, I don't have the heart to tell her I lied to her. It's more painful than before but I know the ER is not going to do anything, they didn't the last three times, there's no point in telling anyone anymore. She has so much stuff on her plate, my father too - I don't want them to have to worry about me when I know they can't do anything. I'll just scare them even more.

So I'm just going to sit and pain tonight and force myself to go to class tomorrow and hope I don't break down crying from the pain like I've been doing at home.

Doctors couldn't do anything I tried to help myself. I took two enemas to clear my bowels, tiny relief not much and some bleeding in my stools. I tried heating pads, ice packs - nothing. I wonder if this is related to the tumor they found or if it's just a coincidence that they found the tumor in the first place and that's just something else for me to worry about. And even if it is the tumor (they think it's benign but maybe pushing against my bowels and causing pain) they're not going to do anything about that for at least a month by the looks of it, so I'll have to live with this for a month.

But who knows what's causing it, I don't have a clue - no one does.

If I'm meant to die now why can't the world just take me out quickly instead of making me ride through this for so long? Why can't I have a fast death? If I'm not meant to die am I just going to have to live with this for months? 

I had to give up my internship I have to give up my classes and drop them I had to lose so much. Doesn't help that every ER visit costs money (I have insurance but it's more the principle of the thing that bothers me, I go there to get a needle stuck in my arm and for them to say that it might just be the tumor and they physically can't do anything without further approval which could take months) 

I don't want to scare my family anymore than I already have. I'm mad at myself for being so frustrated considering it could be so much worse. My dad had to suffer through a brain aneurysm and was in the hospital for months and I'm frustrated because of a week of back pain? Hah.

Gosh, I wish I was a stronger person."

I am a final-year student. I got this hiring opportunity from **Amazon ML Summer School**, which I attended. I applied for the job position of **Amazon Applied Scientist I**. And then cleared the technical test of it both the programming questions were fairly simple and easy. I have also cleared the resume shortlisting round. My technical interview is now planned for the following week. There will be two to five rounds of virtual interviews, first round of interview will focus on Coding, Data Structures and Algorithms and subsequent rounds of interviews will focus on Machine Learning.

To be very honest, I don't know Data Structures and Algorithms. I never practiced them. I can do basic programming and solve easy-level questions, but not above that. During my bachelor's study, I tried to work on Machine learning and stuff, so I have basic to decent knowledge of it.

I am willing to put my heart and soul into preparing for the interview since I don't want to miss this chance to intern at Amazon. Please advise me on how to plan for my interviews. You can scold me all you want; I suppose it's too late for me to start studying it right now. But I want to try my best and be completely honest. Any preparation tips or pieces of advice? I am hearing to all suggestions.

Thank you.

Preferred qualifications for the job:

* Experience in building speech recognition, machine translation and natural language processing systems (e.g., commercial speech products or government speech projects)
* Solid Machine Learning background and familiar with standard speech and machine learning techniques.
* Scientific thinking and the ability to invent, a track record of thought leadership and contributions that have advanced the field.
* Solid software development experience.
* Good written and spoken communication skills."

You got the job! We are thrilled to extend you an offer to join Amazon as a Software Development Engineer Internship in the Greater Los Angeles Area. Congratulations!

We know that juggling school commitments and job interviews is a lot to manage, and we appreciate the time and effort you have dedicated to the process.""

&amp;#x200B;

# Timeline

* 7/7 - Applied with referral
* 8/1 - Received OA 1
* 8/6 - Completed OA 1 (2 tech questions + LP survey)
* 8/8 - Received interview invitation &amp; confirmed interview time availability
* 8/18 - Received interview confirmation email, scheduled at 8/26
* 8/26 - Finished interview
* 8/31 - Portal changed to Greater Los Angeles location
* 9/1 - Received official offer &amp; accepted offer for Summer 2023

# Process

1. OA - I struggled a lot on these 2 tech questions and I was not able to solve either of them completely, and I got extremely demotivated when I was doing the LP survey at a point that I was about to just fill random answers but I still tried my best in the end.
2. Interview - The interviewer was really chill, although I could not understand what he was speaking sometimes due to a bit of accent on his end and the fact that English is not my native language. I asked him to repeat the question for few times and he did not get mad or anything. The coding portion, I swear, was at least 420x easier than the OA one and I could solve both completely very easily and I gave correct time complexity &amp; space complexity. The behavioral portion was also interesting, I reacted really quickly and came up with my own stories and he seemed to like it. He also asked me for the information and context about one of my side projects which I gave him an answer as well.
   1. I asked him an interesting question and he liked that question.
3. Offer - I was watching anime and the portal changed.
   1. After one day, I received the offer email while I was watching anime.

# Q &amp; A / Tips

* Do you need a fancy resume to get through the resume review stage?
   * Uh not really, I only put some side projects that I did throughout high school.
* Does referral matter?
   * Not for interns, I think.
      * If anything else, because of the referral system Amazon delayed my application processing for almost a month because their platform broke specifically for my entry and I had to ask the person who referred me to create a ticket to fix it.
* Do you need to get a high score on the OA in order to move forward?
   * I think you don't need a high score on technical questions, leadership principles section matters A LOT more. I did poorly in the tech section and still got selected forward.
   * There are also some counterexamples such as someone I knew who got perfect scores in the tech portion but did not get selected for an interview. (We're referred by the same person so there's no referral advantage whatsoever)
      * Hence, I think LP section weighs A LOT: You can fail their tech OA but at least study the LPs, it's just reading comprehension all over again.
* How did you study LeetCode?
   * Let me be honest, I barely did LeetCode. The only questions I did to prepare for Amazon throughout the process were probably ""Container with Most Water"" and ""Valid Sudoku""
   * You don't need to farm LeetCode 24x7 just to prepare for the interview, the behavior portion matters a lot more.
* How did you prepare for the behavioral portion of the interview?
   * I pre-wrote some stories that I thought would be universally applicable to multiple sections but in the actual interview I literally threw these stories away and came up with others..
   * Hence, I think it might be better if you can just think stuff on the fly, I personally think the interviewer would also not like to see you telling them something that's heavily rehearsed.
* Are you at a disadvantage/advange by applying to Amazon as a high school graduate?
   * Nope, I was treated the same as everyone else.
* Do you need to go to a fancy university / be a CS major to be able to get selected?
   * Nope, I'm going to a state school and I am not even a CS major. I was rejected from the CS major, unfortunately.

# Profile

* A mid-tier public high school, class of 2022
   * A mid-tier public state school, class of 2026 majoring in something that does not have the word ""Computer"" or ""Engineering"" in it.

x3wivi,1,2022-09-02,Direction for an undergrad,deathreaper_samu,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/x3wivi/direction_for_an_undergrad/,"So I'm an undergrad in my second year towards a computer science major. I've been spending a lot of time trying to understand what will be required of me to get a good job. 
Currently now now I still haven't decided on which part of computer science I want to study fully. Would it be better to go 65% across the board or a 100% for only one course.
Also I've seen a lot of posts on how important it is to get experience and build networks if you want a job, I'm going to be doing internships in my 3rd year so I thought that would be enough but now I'm not so sure. Would it be better to maybe look for some odd computer related jobs to build my porfolio(I mainly avoided those cause I felt I wasn't competent enough).
And networking looks like it'll be a big issue for me cause I'm extremely introverted but I would like to think that I could just build my network during my internship.
So if you've got any tips or advice on how I could better plan ahead that would be helpful."

x3zigi,0,2022-09-02,Stanford REA vs RD,Ronak010,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/x3zigi/stanford_rea_vs_rd/," Hi everyone. I am an international student, what I am confused about is if I should Rea or RD to Stanford, I have very good ecas throughout my high school along with a coding portfolio having full-stack apps, good design apps, some Insta/twitter clones, and some very cool code-generated art projects. Some of the work is my personal projects and some are of the freelance coding gigs I have done. I believe I have strong ecas with my digital marketing startup, part of the National debate team for an international tournament, the Student government for 4 years, sports captain, founding a club, internships, organized Muns and college festivals, and some coding tournaments. But I have a 3.6 and a 3.57 in grades 11 and 12 which is not much considering Stanford. So will Stanford take me with my coding, startup, and other ecas if I apply for REA or I should go for RD, saving my ED and Ea for some other school?"

Did Masters in business analytics (top business school in UK) and have pursued computer science engineering before that (Dubai).

I also have an online diploma in data science and business analytics from a T25 business school in USA.


I have an offer from one of the largest fintech firms in UK and a very small Venture Capital firm.

I have done internships before( Dubai and India) and this would be my first job.

The role at the fintech firm is understanding the clients requirements and implementation of the derivatives product for clients.

I plan to do an MBA down the line ( possibly HSW/MIT).
Have my GMAT Score as well (770).
I tried for deferred but was not that great.

I have done a lot of volunteer stuff and was involved in sports, clubs and student bodies in a leadership position.

My issue is I have not seen a lot of people go to M7 from my firm and I would say my firm is not a feeder firm.
Further, shifting to a feeder firm is really tough as again there are only a few people 10-20% who have got in the more reputable firms.
The VC firm is very small and look really confused, but the founders are experienced people and I doubt that would lead me anywhere.

What would you suggest, should I choose the fintech firm and try to break in some bulge bracket banks or consulting firms? 

I can have personal chats for more detailed conversation."
x40beo,7,2022-09-02,Graduate with minimal experience,randomguy575799,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/x40beo/graduate_with_minimal_experience/,"Hi all,

I have graduated in economics from the University of Warwick, which is a target university from what I have been told. Looking to break into investment banking, consultancy or corporate banking. Ideally just trying to get my foot in a big finance company. Looking for a job in London.

The only problem is I didn't manage to land any internships so my experience is lacking for these graduate roles. Most graduate roles ask for the candidate to still be in education, graduating in 2023. But I am done with education now so I am stuck on how I can gain experience and land a job. I also can not really apply for internships as they mainly require candidates to still be in education too. What do I do in this position? 

The main thing going for me is my strong academics and graduating with a 2:1 from a prestigious university. I know my experience is what is letting me down, but how do I gain my first finance experience as a graduate? I have tried to be resilient and apply for roles but to not hear back and get rejected for months is starting to take its toll, especially as I know the longer I remain without a job, the harder it is to find one. Any help would be massively appreciated.

x41srt,1,2022-09-02,"Remembering disappointment as I prepare to start my PhD in a week: would love to hear thoughts from students and professors alike (UK PhD, medical field)!",Razkolnik_ova,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/x41srt/remembering_disappointment_as_i_prepare_to_start/,"Okay, I've posted here a few times already and on another related subreddit as well, so at this point I myself should be sick and tired of myself and my own doubts and concerns.

In a nutshell, my PhD start is now a week away. Earlier in the year, I had a bumpy PhD application process because I realized finding a funded PhD program in the UK as a EU student without settled status can almost literally be equated with mission impossible.

I was accepted into Oxford (my field of work is clinical neuroscience/neurology), however, the program there was not fully funded and I could not secure the extra funding. At the same time, I was awarded a full MRC scholarship from the University of Glasgow (which is where I did my undergrad actually, before moving to another country for my Master's) to pursue a PhD on a topic that I really like as part of a broader doctoral training program. I accepted the offer, after a lot of inner turmoil and overthinking, because I naturally got disappointed that I could not secure funding for the Oxford program. Still, I did not reject the offer either, as it would have felt like a missed opportunity, plus I love the project and the supervisors seem very nice. My third co-supervisor is also a very big name in the field, although I won't get to work much with them, or even see them much for that matter.

My last internship was at UCL where I did lots of work - I am still in touch with my supervisors there who also know my supervisor in Glasgow, we might also work on a paper together, etc.

Now, after having worked at UCL and made it into Oxford, I keep having these doubts about eventually graduating with a PhD from Glasgow uni - am I then still going to be in a position to end up working at one of the more prestigious UK universities, am I 'silly' for going to a less good university for my PhD after having worked at a better institution, how good would my career prospects be after I graduate, have I made a good choice, etc.... I also know that Glasgow is not where I'd want to settle down a few years from now and that's probably a bit of a demotivating factor as well.

Any thoughts? Anyone whose journey has been similar?

Many thanks in advance for sharing, would love to hear opinions. :)"

BTW - the user is C-level, so I don't have a lot of wiggle room on this.

Update: Thanks for all the advice. I ended up using a licensed copy of Glary Utilities and TeraCopy to get the original chunk of data down to something more manageable. 

The folder structure is useless “New Folder,” “New Folder 1,” etc… So I’m going to write an xcopy bat file drop everything into folders by file type. 

Then the intern can start reviewing files and adding structure.

My new question, why isn’t there an AI app that could automatically read, tag, and file documents for users?"

The Father that Leads: The Father that Waited (Part 1)

(T)(F)(T)(L)

Alan circled around Darius and stalked towards Henry Wu. To Alan, Wu was the personification of the hubris and self aggrandizing mentality that had made him.  Wu stayed still, a dour expression was on his face and Alan felt nothing but stillness from his mind.

""Mr. Quain I presume?"" Henry Wu asked. ""Darius has told me a lot about you. I know you must see me as a monster and you would be justified in that view.""

Alan circled him, his own anger building like a wave and crashing against the stones of his better judgement.  This man had made ""dinosaurs"" for Jurassic Park and Jurassic World.  He had weaponized them at multiple points and all Alan could do when he had the man at his mercy was glare with hatred at him.

Alan stormed out of the building they were in and passed a group of children in bright clothes.  He walked out to what was a cold morning, he took a moment as the cold knocked some of his rage down a peg.  He figured he was either in the North Western United States or Western Canada.  He took a moment and centered himself.  Then he heard the call.

It was a long low bellow.  Several more bellows called out.  A voice was laughing with the bellows.  Alan moved towards the sounds and saw a pale young man sitting atop an ankylosaurus with a green pattern and misshapen horn.

""Well you two look as close as ever."" Alan said with a slight smile.

""Alan?"" Ben shot up and looked at him.  ""Holy f..."" He scrambled and toppled off of the ankylosaurus named Bumpy.  Then he stood up and ran towards Alan. ""You're alive!""

""Yeah."" Alan nodded. ""And things have changed it seems.""

Oh you have no idea."" Ben said as he turned to Bumpy and waved.  ""All right Bumps, I gotta get Alan introduced once more!"" He paused. ""Oh, you probably already met Dr. Wu, huh?""

Alan grunted with a nod.

""Hey, I know Darius said you would have a good reason to be mad, but whatever he did is in the past.  Even leaving us on the island, we let it go and he is doing great work here."" Ben said as he led Alan to the front gate of the compound.

Alan stared up at the gaudy recreation of Jurassic Park's original gate.  He took off his glasses and sighed.  

""You remade Camp Cretaceous?"" Alan laughed as he put his palm over his face.

""Well the foundation Maisey Lockwood started did.  We just work here and educate the kids."" Ben smiled. ""Darius and I have this camp, Yaz and Sammie handle the southern camp.""

""Brooklynn and Kenji?"" Alan asked.

""They visit.  The whole thing left them wary of dino themed parks."" Ben laughed.  ""Technically we all were for a tiny bit.  Except Darius.  He plowed through AP placements and got an early graduation and placement with Dr. Turner as an intern.  She runs the southern camp by the way.""

Alan nodded. ""Then he came up here?""

""I'm doing my dissertation on the differences between pure dino strains and constructed strains."" Darius said as he joined them. ""It's been like eight years, Alan. Three since Wu started to see what he'd done.""

Alan glared at Darius.

""He's trying Alan. He makes the care and health of all the dinosaurs we get, his top priority."" Darius' voice was stern and solid in its stance. 

Alan gave a deep huff.  He noticed Wu walking towards them and he could only stare.

""It's alright Darius."" Wu said, a worn and aged smile spread over his face.  ""Like I said he has every right to hate me.""

Alan glared at the man.  Then walked off in what even he had to call a tantrum.  He trudged through the shallow snow and soon found himself near a contained paddock.  Inside he sensed anger and rage.  Animals that were hungry and fierce.  Made to kill.

He read the paddock name. ""Atrociraptor Rehabilitation"". Alan stared and read it again, his brain refusing to accept the simple truth.

""Change is a difficult thing, my man."" The voice of Perfection, the Scion of Chaos said as he appeared leaning against the electric fence. ""So isn't it a kind thing to acknowledge it?"" He nodded towards the direction of Wu and the campers.

""He's a monster."" Alan said through gritted teeth.  ""The only times that isn't true is when. He gets eaten by his own creations.""

""You know you got over that you were made in a tube."" Perfection sighed, ""But you've never confronted the makers.  Never sought them out.""

Alan remained silent.

""But Wu didn't make you.  Wu has learned.  He's grown and he's changing."" Perfection smiled. ""Grow alongside him.""

Alan glared at the Scion.

""We never stop changing."" The chaotic being grinned as he turned and urinated on the electric fence. Nothing happened.  ""Huh, Mythbusters victory here."" He said as he zipped up and vanished.

""Of course he does that."" Alan grumbled. ""Gets in my head and makes a piss joke...""

Alan stood and collected himself.  Wu was always an enemy in his mind. A selfish geneticist who couldn't see the ramifications of his own ""art"".  He needed to know that man had been vanquished by humility.

Alan then returned to the main building.  Darius and Ben were working with other counselors to contain the many erratic and energetic children. Some older teen campers were also helping.  He then saw Wu in his office.  He went straight for it.  He didn't knock or announce himself, he just entered and stared.

""You know if you have a question, I'm willing to hear it."" Wu said as he looked up. ""Oh I'm sorry, I thought you were a camper.""

Alan stared at him before slowly approaching a chair and sitting in it.  Wu just stared back, a look of concern, but not for himself was on his face.

""Mr. Quain, are you okay?"" Wu asked.

""I'm debating whether I should just leave peacefully and find a cave to live in.  Wrench your neck one hundred and eighty degrees or hear you out."" Alan glowered at him. ""So no I'm not okay.""

Wu nodded. ""I don't expect you to believe me, but I would ask you not to traumatize the children at the very least.""

Alan glared at the man, more enraged at his own selfish desires and the fact that Wu's concern for the children was genuine when his was absent.  Alan took a breath. 

""What did Darius tell you; besides the obvious reality hopping."" Alann hissed.

Henry Wu put his pen down and nodded. ""He told me of your powers.  I must admit I didn't believe anything about it until you appeared.  Direct evidence then suggests you are telepathic and telekinetic.  And you were made in a laboratory as a psychic soldier."" Wu said. ""He also said you're waiting to reunite with your daughter.""

Alan stared at the man and nodded.

""If it will help put you at ease, you can read my mind."" Wu said. ""I have no more secrets.  Only open wounds and shame.""

Alan glared even harder before he took a breath and dove into the man's mind.  He let a small gateway into his own mind exist.  He didn't want to overwhelm the man but he at least owed him some accurate answers.

Alan walked forward in the very ordered mind of Henry Wu. Doors were ripped off hinges, red was painted in stripes down the halls. Alan couldn't tell if it was paint or blood.  The open doors were filled withoments of pride and shame.  Young versions of Wu smiling with glee and amazement.  Older versions holding their head in shame.  Alan walked by as many doors as he saw.  Each one repeated itself.  Save for the newest ones.

A large Cretaceous locust being released with others of its kind.  It would stop their breeding within three generations.  The Wu there was relieved and thankful.  The next few doors were Wu meeting with Maisey Lockwood and her adoptive parents.  She wanted him to oversee dinosaur care for one of her camps.  Then he met his initial campers and counselors and quickly found joy in teaching the kids about his science and the ethics needed to guide it.  Ethics he learned the hard way.

Alan watched as the memories rolled by and Darius joined the camp.  Darius brought his love of dinosaurs and joy of helping them and studying them as well as a thirst for knowledge on how to treat and understand their genetics.  Then he saw the scope of the camp.  It was a safe haven for dinosaurs that weren't safe in what used to be a sanctuary run by BioSyn.  He saw a few headlines of Dodgson's death and that made him happy.  Dodgson more than deserved what he got.  The thought turned him back to Wu.

He pulled from the man's mind and watched him.  He couldn't hate the man Wu had become.  It was a journey he respected, one forged in pain and error and the unbending will to make things right even if he was still hated for it.  It was a true journey of conscience.  He leaned forward and sighed.

""An interesting life."" Wu said. ""And now you need to lay low.  What extent can you use your powers to?""

""Telepathy has no real issue. Telekinesis though I gotta keep it small which in this case, is enough room to lift a T-Rex or two. Maybe a diplodocus once in a while."" Alan chuckled. ""Those are some heavy boys and girls.""

""They are, but I think I may have a position for you."" Wu winced, expecting a violent reaction, instead Alan was calm and clearly thinking about it, so Wu continued.  ""I need a year round counselor and animal behaviorist.""

""No Owen Grady to save the day?"" Alan snickered.  

""He's busy being a dad and rehabilitating in the main facility."" Wu explained. 

Alan nodded. ""You want me to help the atrociraptors?"" 

Wu smiled. ""They were programmed to kill on command. The methods used were..."" He paused and took a deep concentrated breath, Alan felt him fighting off memories, but he continued. ""I developed them, but they are barbaric.""

""Trying to atone."" Alan nodded. ""I'll help, but if you backslide..."" Alan made a spinning motion with his finger.

""Believe me, I don't want to."" Wu said, ""But life is imperfect, I'd at least ask you to try to sway me back first.""

""One chance."" Alan said with a sly grin. ""Maybe a dive into your brain just to make sure you're not being remotely piloted.""

""That is terrifyingly possible these days."" Wu nodded.

Alan blinked, he thought he had been joking.  Now he had to be extra wary.

""I'll have a few friends draw up the needed paperwork."" Wu said. ""Explaining your education could be problematic otherwise.""

Alan laughed. ""Make sure to have stuff for an 'Annalise Stephanie Quain'.  Maybe in her twenties, red hair. Maybe four foot ten by the time she gets here ""

""I'll have it done."" Wu gave a warm smile. ""Thank you Mr. Quain.""

Alan shook his head. ""Alan.  I hope Henry is okay.""

Henry Wu smiled. ""It is. However we also have another Alan on staff..."" Henry nodded to a window where a counselor in a cowboy hat stood.

Alan Quain recognized Alan Grant immediately.  ""There's a joke here but I'm not making it."" Alan sighed as he looked at Henry.

""Believe me he will if he sees it.  Mr. Grant is the head counselor for the kids.  We both run the camp.  His wife is our educational specialist.""

""Wife?"" Alan smiled, ""Please tell me it's Sattler.""

Wu nodded.

""Fucking finally!"" Alan roared and noticed all the kids froze.  ""That window's not soundproof is it?"" 

Henry smiled and shook his head as he stood up and lowered the shades.

""So, good news.  The kids already labeled me cool."" Alan laughed. ""Grant has nailed it down that I'm loud and he will discover the annoying part later.""

""Oh boy."" Henry smiled as he opened the door and let Alan Grant in.

""Dr. Grant, meet Alan Quain..."" Henry started.

""Oh?"" Grant smiled and extended a hand. ""Always nice to meet another Alan.""

""I get that alot."" Quain smiled.

""Mr. Quain is going to be our new behaviorist. He'll be starting with our trouble batch."" Henry nodded to the atrociraptor pen.

""How many layers thick is that pen by the way?"" Quain asked.

""Four external, two internal."" Grant said. ""They are significantly violent. There was another batch that was released three years ago in a city. Those ones had to be put down, they had killed and eaten multiple humans and pets.""

Quain nodded in understanding, cloned dinosaurs were hard enough to teach.  Deprogramming was probably thought to be impossible.

""We have one female in our current group who shows some potential for reduced aggressive behavior."" Grant explained. ""At least that's what the other behaviorists say before they quit.""

""Yeah, dromaeosaur behavior would be something out of left field. Thankfully I got it covered."" Quain smirked as he tapped his head and pulsed his story to Grant.

Grant stared in shock for a moment.

""Give him a minute."" Quain said to Wu. ""He just got the one way info dump.""

Grant just nodded.

""Dr. Grant?"" Henry asked carefully.

Grant held up a finger. ""What's your opinion on making a promise to a dinosaur?""

""Well I'm telepathic so, yeah. Doable. Probably not smart if the dino in question is upset though."" Quain shrugged. ""Why?"" 

Grant nodded. ""Apparently I'm the only one who finds it odd."" 

""Oh no it's odd."" Quain laughed. ""Wait who made a promise to a dinosaur.""

""Dr. Grant."" Henry sighed.

""Owen Grady promised his raptor friend to find her child three years ago."" Grant explained

""Owen Grady is insane."" Quain laughed, ""But Blue isn't your average dinosaur clone.""

""I keep telling him that."" Henry sighed. ""She's currently in one of our largest sanctuaries with her daughters. She's safe and as free as we can manage.""

""That's good.  Malcolm?"" Quain asked.

""Ethics board."" Henry said. ""For the Lockwood Foundation.""

Quain shook his head. ""Don't feed his ego just because he's right."" 

Grant laughed. ""So am I and Ellie.""

Henry nodded. 

""Full time superheroes."" Quain laughed.

""Nah, just keeping things balanced."" Grant said with a shake of his head. 

""I will show you to your bunk."" Henry said as he stood up.  ""We can do paperwork tomorrow."" 

Quain nodded and followed.  The bunk he was given was small, but had a bedroom, kitchen, and small living room. It was the perfect spot to lie low.

""If you change your mind, just let me know."" Henry said. ""I'd understand given everything involved.""

Alan Quain smirked. ""Nah, I'm good.  Low end power usage, some decent people and animals I can talk to.  What's not to love?"" 

Henry Wu nodded and closed the door as he left.

Alan sat on his new bed. It was lumpy and uneven so he forced the mattress into a stiffer feeling.  It held pretty well once he finished and he laid back and stared at the ceiling, wondering when he would even hear from his baby girl. He wondered how long it had been for her so far?  How many worlds they had nearly missed each other at.  How many times she stopped her mission to do the right thing.  How large her legend had grown, how much she had grown.

He drifted off to sleep, a contented father to wait for his daughter. He only hoped it wouldn't be boring.

It’s for a software engineering internship.

By the end of June I will have finished my MSc in Bioinformatics and then I will have to become a job hunter as I am interested in joining a Pharma-related company or similar.  I have been checking out the most important job sites (indeed, glassdoor, linkedin...) and most of the jobs require experience which I don't have ,or in other words, most of the jobs are targeted to Senior Bioinformaticians and there's a scarcity of internships in industry. 

In the MSc I have been taught Python (good level) and R (the basics), the Linux Command Line (good level) and some SQL (elementary stuff). However, my level is not high enough to apply for these positions which come with a great responsibility, so it would be ideal to join a company where I could be taught how to work properly so as to improve while making the money necessary to pay the bills.

Any recommendations to find this sort of opportunities in the UK?"
x4b828,3,2022-09-02,I finally booked an appointment with my doctor..,7653324TA,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/x4b828/i_finally_booked_an_appointment_with_my_doctor/,"I'm nervous about seeing my doctor about my symptoms.

tldr; Should I tell my doctor my story/symptoms and say I'd like to get tested? Or just tell him I want to get tested as soon as I get in there? I know im overthinking, but I really want to be taken seriously and get the help I need. Any tips are welcome!

 I never even considered ADHD might be my issue until someone in my life suggested it. Now that I've finally taken the time to research it, it feels like everything makes sense. I'm forgetful, messy, disorganized, and my mind is **constantly** thinking about mostly irrelevant things. 

After dropping out of 3 different highschools 4 times I finally got my GED. Now Im in college and I don't have much hope that I will graduate. Being in class is so overwhelming, so I regularly take walks during the lectures. I also doodle a lot, and it helps with concentration a little bit. When I have to do homework, I have trouble starting it and when I do start it's so frustrating. I get so upset that I can't focus and I just break down in tears. It has been really hard. 

Somehow I made it through my first 2 semesters and decided to do an internship during the summer. I thought it would be good for me and open doors since the company is quickly expanding. I worked in an office for 3 months and it went terribly. I couldn't make myself focus on important tasks, I'd forget important things, and it took me forever to complete anything. I'm really disappointed in myself. How am I supposed to get a good job after school if I can't even function for a 3-month internship?

Anyways, its been really tough and I think there's a huge possibility I have ADHD. I'd appreciate some guidance on how I should bring it up to my doctor. Should I tell him my story/symptoms and say I'd like to get tested? Or just tell him I want to get tested as soon as I get in there? I know im overthinking but I really want to be taken seriously and get the help I need. Any other tips would be great. Thanks!"

x4dfat,65,2022-09-02,My experience at a KIPP Texas High School,EconomyConnection635,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/x4dfat/my_experience_at_a_kipp_texas_high_school/,"I(M26) am a former KIPP Texas teacher who taught in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Houston, TX, and I would like to share my experience to those who are considering working at KIPP.

As a computer science teacher with four years experience under my belt, I determined that KIPP is not an ideal school for high school STEM teachers to work at. If you are an English, Social Studies, or Math teacher or any middle school or elementary school teacher, then KIPP can be a solid school for you to teach at. But if you happen to teach a technology-integrated curriculum, such as computer science, digital media, or information tech, then KIPP will give you the least amount of support and care in the world. They have a strong ""low tech, high engagement"" policy for all classes.

**The interview:**

A little background on me: I was laid off from another charter school due to the organization cutting staff and funds to build a new high school in May of 2022. During the summer I was looking into computer science teaching positions and came across an opening at KIPP Texas for an AP Computer Science teaching position. I only applied because I had no other option at the time and I always loved teaching AP Computer Science. A few days after I applied, I received an invitation to interview, and that's where I met the principal and grade-level chair. They discussed what they were looking for and what they were willing to offer me as a computer science teacher. I asked two necessary questions at the end of the interview: Will students have access to computers? How reliable is the IT department? The answer they gave me to the first question was that ""each students will have their own Chromebook"" which I was a bit skeptical about, but their answer to the second question was ""We have a great IT department that can provide you with anything you need."" I felt like these are satisfying answers and felt like it could be a good opportunity for me. After the interview, I got an offer the next day for the position of AP Computer Science Teacher.

**The first visit to the school campus**:

Two months later when I came to pick up my keys and laptops to check out my new classroom, I get to see what the school looks like for the first time. At first I was impressed with the structure and interior, but then one of the receptionists told me ""this is the middle school. The high school is out there"" and points towards a series of T-Buildings. When I stepped foot into the first T-Building which consists of the principals office and 9th grade classrooms, I was shocked at what I saw: ceilings falling apart, halls and classrooms with hollow floors, uneven walls, and door-less bathrooms. There was a horrible smell coming from the sinks as well and I saw several cockroaches throughout the buildings. I met the principal in person for the first time and asked a few questions about my classroom. At first they gave me an empty classroom with desks and chairs. It was slightly cleaner than other classrooms and I had no complaints about it. When I picked up my laptop, he gave me a very old broken laptop with a torn charger cable. It had my name on it as well. I was concerned with what they provided me, but I didn't question it until orientation. When I asked about computers, they said I just have to submit a request to IT.

**The KIPP New Teacher Orientation for all KIPP Houston Teachers**:

This was one of the largest teacher orientation I ever attended. When I first arrived at the campus where orientation was held at, I saw a line of teachers that went around the corner of the school. The gym was humongous and there was about 300-400 new teachers attending. Seeing this many teachers, I felt enthusiastic and excited at first as I met my new peers and cohorts, but I noticed one major red flag while I was at this orientation: There were no high school STEM teachers at the orientation. It was hard for me to talk with other teachers about what we taught and our experiences because I was hired to teach high school computer science, but I still decided to pay full attention and participate in the orientation for that entire week. When I went to individual content workshops, they had no idea where to put me since I taught a high school elective STEM course, so they placed me in a middle school mathematics workshop, which had no relevance to what I taught. I asked around to see if any of the KIPP schools had computer science or STEM teachers, and sadly there were only 3 at the orientation. One who taught bio-medical engineering, another taught chemistry, and a physics teacher.

**The Second Week Orientation**

During this week, all teachers at KIPP are required to attend workshops across the city based on the content they teach. I attended the Science content workshop, which was virtual so I had the privilege to WFH that week, but this PD did not benefit me as most of what the content they discuss about was middle school science. I tried to ask questions relevant to teaching computer science but most of what I got was ""you figure that out yourself."" To summarize it, the second week orientation was pointless. I messaged IT about the computer issue and they said ""we will get you computers. Our IT staff will be coming on Thursday."" They never came.

**The First Two Weeks of PD at the Main Campus**:

This is the time frame when I first met my cohorts. The vibe was great and my colleagues were amazing people. The PDs were useful until the second day where we learned about KIPP's teaching methods and rules which I thought were somewhat impractical and unnecessary. Many of what they preach did not align with my teaching ideologies and my educational focus but I just complied with them. Every morning during PD teachers have to recite a pledge and the school leader does shout-outs to the same three teachers every day, so there is strong evidence of favoritism. Later that week, they moved my classroom. Instead of my larger, more brightly lit classroom, I got a poorly lit, tiny chemistry lab with broken tables and chairs, and a prep room that is so messy there was no room for me to walk around in. They dumped all the old computer science teacher's stuff in the front of my classroom and told me to ""make do with any of them."" I was absolutely aghast cause I had to sort out a meter-high pile of parts, broken computer pieces, old papers, and chemistry textbooks. I got injured while trying to clean it all up, and the next day the school leader came in to the classroom then proceed to berate me for not decorating the classroom according to their protocols. I lost all respect for him, because he could have respectfully told me how I should have decorated the classroom, but instead tried to intimidate me and patronize me into getting the classroom filled with borders, college posters, and KIPP logos. I spent the entire day writing my syllabus and making requests to IT about computers, new tables, chairs, private networks, etc, but they never responded to any of my requests. I had a pile of junk sitting in front of my classroom which I was moved to a day ago, and we did not have any personal prep time since 95% of the work this time period was sitting in the cafeteria and attending PD.

**The Student Orientation**

My class had the largest amount of parents coming to my classroom. I had a QR code ready which contains the syllabus, extra-curriculars, and curriculum overview of the school year, and a lot of the parents were impressed with that. I even made a website for students and parents to check out, but one of the APs pulled me out of a conference with a parent and said ""you need to give them paper syllabuses."" Clearly every parents had a phone and no one complained about the QR code syllabus, so I didn't really see a problem. A lot of the parents were happy with what I was willing to offer students, such as participation in academic competitions, internship opportunities for students, and exciting after-school clubs that focuses on different aspects of technology, such as a hacking club and video game club. One of the biggest challenges I had during orientation was explaining to parents about not having computers. I reassured them that students will get Chromebooks and I plan on establishing a computer lab within the first three weeks of school.

**The First Week of School:**

The first week went by pretty well. I got to met the students and we did a lot of team-building activities, which they enjoyed. By this time, my classroom junk was sorted out and I finished decorating the classroom, but we did not have computers or Chromebooks yet. The classroom was very small so some students had to sit on the ground, but I managed to make it work for every student. I tried to get the students excited by telling them ""starting next week we will begin to practice coding once everyone get Chromebooks."" During this week my grade level chair held a meeting with me to discuss what was going on in my lesson plan, and he just straight up keep asking ""what's going on here"" ""what's going on here"" like he has no clue what I am teaching. He begins to give me extremely useless suggestions which I won't even mention. I just let it slide and taught these classes the way I've always taught them. I asked about the computer problem, and he told me that they will come next week Wednesday so I prepared a set of lesson plans based on what resources we have.

**The Second Week of School:**

The second week was exhausting. I printed out at least 2000 pages of worksheets and study guides for the entire week, which took about 5-6 hours total. My lessons were going great and the students were very engaged. However, since I had around 223 students, I was still trying to learn all their names. My principal came in and reprimanded me for not knowing my students' names (on the 5th school day). Apparently we were expected to know all student's names by the third day of school, but I never actually worked with a class this big in my life, so I took full responsibility for this. I had about 5-6 observations this week with no problem except on Tuesday, I attended a meeting with my grade-level chair about my lesson plans, and I asked about the computer issue. He informed me that there was an issue with shipment so I have to plan two months of lesson plans **WITHOUT** computers. I spent a good amount of time arguing with him as to how unrealistic that is, and discussed the potential consequences of not giving kids access to computers in an AP Computer Science class, but he ended up telling me ""You don't need computers to teach computer science. I can teach computer science better than you without computers and I have no computer science experience."" At this point I felt extremely offended by what he said and started looking for a new job. I could not stand the administrators at this school, but I felt like the kids deserve to have a decent computer science education, so I kept doing my job. I worked roughly 70 hours this week and it was strenuous. I ended up messaging my professor to ask for an extension on my assignment for grad school. I requested the day off on Monday to focus on finishing that, and it got approved, then on Friday night, the school leader emailed me. I didn't bother looking at it because it was already the weekends and I just wanted to relax.

**The Third Week of School**

This week is when things got ridiculous. When I came back on Tuesday, the school leader wrote me up for not responding to his email over the weekend and told me to ""follow absence protocols."" The absence protocol requires me to message ALL administrators about my absence, and I really thought it was absurd. I told him ""You should have told me that before you approved my absence."" He accused me of being disrespectful towards him, and later during the day he came to my 6th period to interrogate me in front of my classroom in the middle of my lessons. He sent me home that day and told me to meet him in his office the next morning. I felt humiliated and embarrassed when I walked back into my classroom to grab my laptop and charger while three other admins stood in the classroom watching the students.

**My Last Day at KIPP**

The next day I told them I decided this place was not a good fit for me. He gave me ANOTHER write up for ""failing to internalize lesson plans"" which I assume was out of spite towards me because my lesson plans were fine. At this point I got two write ups for 1. Not replying to emails over the weekend and 2. Not internalizing lesson plans. The reason I got written up for that was because my lesson plans were ""difficult to understand"" but I have been using the [Code.org](https://Code.org) lesson plans which contains everything they are asking for. I made sure I carefully titled each lesson plan and slides so my grade level chair knows which lesson plans are for which days. He said he wanted to see ""annotations"" and ""ways you incorporate social values into your lessons."" I never had to annotate or incorporate social values in my lessons before so this was the first time they told me this. I told the school leader how I felt about the school with full-blown honesty. He shrugged off everything I said and asked me ""then what do you think you should do?""

I ended up quitting. I feel like KIPP does not care about their students or teachers. They just care about test scores and making sure all teachers and students follow something called ""total compliance"". More emphasis is put on Math and English because these areas are what students struggle with the most. If you are a STEM teacher, you will be gaslighted, verbally abused, and humiliated if you challenge their system. If you are a Math or English teacher, you would get more support, but for STEM teachers, **KIPP DOES NOT CARE FOR YOU**.

Disclaimer: This experience does not represent all KIPP schools. This is just my experience at one of the KIPP high schools in Houston.

TLDR: Worked one month at KIPP. Experienced a lot of toxicity from the admins and quit right after. Lack of support towards STEM education here."

x4kk4h,2,2022-09-02,I (27f) am starting my first real job soon. How do I get over the anxiety? Is it warranted?,nthLetter,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/x4kk4h/i_27f_am_starting_my_first_real_job_soon_how_do_i/,"I should be sleeping right now but I woke up in the middle of the night and I can’t fall back asleep because I’m too anxious to.

I’m 27f and next month I’m going to start my first real job. It’s going to be an office job, mon-fri, 9-18, plus the travelling time. It’s a job I like, and my boss seems like a very okay guy. I start the training course on Monday, which I’m going to be required to follow from home, or from the office if I want. I know it’s due time I started working, and I feel privileged not having had to really work much until now. 

However, and here is the source of my anxiety, I am terribly scared. My fear is that I’m going to lose my free time and have no time for anything that I want to do. I have long distance friends that I’m scared I won’t be able to see much of anymore and a boyfriend whom I’ve been with for ~4 months and I don’t want to just see him on weekends. I’m scared that this way of thinking might lead me to hate the job and workplace before I even start.

How do people live like that? Am I simply overreacting to an unknown experience? Is there something I can do to make the transition easier for myself?

Last year I attended an internship and before I started I was scared, but also excited. The workday was half as long, however, and I was very motivated to go there because it was mostly a learning experience. Now, because I know how much time that took out of my life, I’m scared this job will make me a robot with only enough energy for it and nothing else.

I guess I sound entitled but maybe I am? I need something to live for, is all"

Is this really true for SysAdmin positions? We've had a junior SysAdmin position posted for months with very little interest locally (1yr contract position). Last week we had one of the help desk interns apply for the position and when interviewing they are a good fit personality, people skills, and existing org knowledge but have almost zero sysadmin skills. They've done some very limited O365 admin  work (user mfa support only) but have never logged into nor setup any linux or windows servers ever. 

I've hired in the past for the person, but on the sysadmin side its only been those who've done a fair amount of more advanced desktop support previously and while those have worked out well. I've never tried from almost ground zero. Has anyone tried this approach? How well has it worked out for you?"

Got a job within my bachelors field of SCM but experienced SE work and want to pivot. How would you recommend pivoting? Do I need to pursue another bachelors? Diploma? Have any of you made a transition like this? How did you do it? What barriers to entry did you experience? 


Long story: 

Over the past 8 months I’ve been at an internship that was initially for my current degree ( 5 classes left til graduation) which is Supply Chain Management. Over the internship I ended up in more of a data driven role, assisting a software engineer with the data collection, consolidation, and visualizations for the reporting of a value capture program. I made a data model to simplify my job and cut back on the capacity restraints on my main project. As such I requested to pursue automation of this reporting process by working with my software engineer and pitching my idea. It was going great but he fell very I’ll and I ended up taking over the project on my own. Throughout the last 8 months I’ve worked with company resources to self teach and have mentorship to advance the software I’m making and it’s really been eye opening. I want to pursue software engineering. Problem is, idk how I could pivot from SCMT to a career in SE. i worry without the proper education credentials I won’t be taken seriously and my irrelevant bachelors won’t be worth anything to me. Have any of you made a transition like this? How did you do it? What barriers to entry did you experience?"

A Fall 2023 MS in Computer Science (CS) applicant here. I plan to study in the US and have shortlisted a bunch of CS schools (ambitious, moderate, safe) based on my interests and profile. I'd really appreciate it if you could check out my profile down below and see if I'm on the right track w.r.t. my university shortlists. Thanks a ton!

Also wishing everyone the best of luck with their applications! I believe you'll all get into your dream schools ✨

**Profile**:

***University and coursework:***

One of the top 5 old IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology) --

B. Tech + M. Tech (dual degree) in Engineering Product Design and Manufacturing, Electronics specialization (about 60% of my courses have been identical to what electrical/electronics engineering students study). *CGPA: 8.8+ on a scale of 10*

Minor in Computer Science, *CGPA: 9.64 on a scale of 10*

Specialization in Artificial Intelligence, *CGPA: 9.69 on a scale of 10*

***Research experiences:*** One paper published at a AAAI workshop. Two more in the works-- submissions made to AAAI 2023 and EMNLP 2022, pending decisions (high chances of them not being accepted, based on reviews received). Currently working on research for my master's thesis project (MTP), with a different CS prof here

***Internships:***

* Computer Vision internship at a small startup based at another old IIT
* NLP internship at a small UK-based startup
* Data Science intern at a mid-sized startup, based in the US
* An internship at one of (Visa, Mastercard, AmEx), in an Analyst role
* Longstanding (1 year+) research collaboration under a CS professor at my IIT (led to the AAAI 2023 submission)
* In-person, 3-month research internship at a top-15 CS school in the US, under a professor there (led to the EMNLP 2022 submission)

***LORs:*** One decent letter from my foreign research internship professor (co-author on paper submission), a good one from my IIT CS prof (co-author on paper submission), and another decent one (hopefully) from my master's thesis advisor prof

***GRE:*** Got 330/340 on a mock test (170Q, 160V). Expect similar scores in the actual test, to be taken in early October

***TOEFL:*** Expect 110+/120

I see two major drawbacks to my profile, one being my non-CS undergrad degree and the other being that I'm already getting a master's degree at my university here (will be tricky to explain why I'm looking for another MS in my SOP?). I also don't have the best research profile there could be (just have one published paper, and that's at a workshop)

Here are my ***shortlists*** (have omitted the university where I interned, as I'll have an advantage applying there):

|*Ambitious*|*Moderate*|*Safe*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Georgia Tech|UNC, Chapel Hill|UCSB|
|UMich, Ann Arbor|NYU Tandon|Northeastern|
|Columbia|UMass Amherst|Uni. of Rochester|
|Princeton|USC|(suggestions?)|

Other universities I'm considering: Brown, UT Dallas

x4qcin,22,2022-09-03,My boss worked a dangerous job as a speleologist and forgot the most important rule of his job,nothatguywhodidthat,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x4qcin/my_boss_worked_a_dangerous_job_as_a_speleologist/,"I worked with him as an intern for my masters in mineral studies and I watched him do lots of usually unsettling work. As a speleologist he was required to go “cave diving” where one is to fit into incredibly tight spaces inside of tunnels and shafts in order to map and finish exploration of different caves – there was lots of precautions and whatnot but they were all usually followed through using a large or small team of skilled individuals. 

My boss was the type of guy to always go alone in a task he was assigned to do, to the point where it was a major inconvenience – like his own task team would usually be in the dark before he would finish the work he assigned his own team to do in the first place, or deny help with any assignments he was told to do with a team from his higher ups – don’t get me wrong, he has two pHDs and was usually an employee working to the highest standard, it was just his prejudices with having a team that stopped him. 

I was with him the longest out of all his colleagues and staff because as an intern I was handling his calls and papers, I managed his schedule and at times even sat in his office and handled his files for all things related to mapping, rescue missions and even letters from the general public. It was quite a well paying job and I enjoyed it a little until something came up that caused me to quit days after.But before this incident happened, we were dealing with a more recent struggle we’ve been battling. 

Back in 2019 is a large, unmapped cave system under a volcano, it has remained unexplored since 2004 when it was found – it wasn’t really a problem until the volcano became active and the internal cave structure began to rupture causing small level 1 – 3 earthquakes around the island we were on, it’s inhabitants consisted of maybe about a 100,000 people all experiencing the effects of the cave’s collapse so me and my boss were called in immediately and we flew over there hours later. 

When we reached the docking bay of the camp our team was at, I overheard one of the members of the board talking to my boss saying something about going into caves without something forbidden and stated in a book as a rule and I couldn’t make out what he was implying as a rule but soon after that, my boss then nodded and the board member handed him a book of some kind – I look a bit closer and I find out it’s a manual of some sort and a few minutes later he comes back and shoves the book into my chest expecting me to grab it, which I did and told me to put it into my emergency bag because some of the work that I did required me to do things fast and without question, which I did.


For the first time, my boss asks me to take a helmet and some gear to go inside with him, I was in shock and also honored but before I could think too much he also stated “I’ll do all the heavy lifting kid, if I tell you to sit tight you swear you won’t move an inch” I nodded and walked with him to the lockers as well as the tents to run some errands before we went inside and soon enough we stepped foot inside the gaping hole and crouched down.

 I followed him in a sort of spiral stair pattern, I had to carefully bend down into the tunnel as every corner begged to scratch against my plastic armored padding for about an hour until we reached a small tunnel with a fork going two different ways, one with lights and equipment boxes scattered in the distance of the cave and the other tunnel dimly lit with one or two glowsticks in there desperately trying to illuminate the spot they were in in the first place.

The tunnel was nearly big enough to be the size of an air vent and I had chills just looking into the dark abyss that lied ahead, meanwhile my boss nonchalantly tells me “In there, lets go” I strike back explaining that I don’t want to go inside the tunnel and then out of his bag, he pulls out a camera which he snaps onto the holder on his helmet and a tablet which he hands to me and tells me to “Observe the cave with me” I reluctantly agreed to doing because I knew I couldn’t go back up either way due to the fact I wouldn’t get the signal for the tablet to sync with the camera and it would take about an hour to go up there anyway, it was too risky anyway. 

About 30 minutes go by and I am watching my boss pull himself inch by inch further into the tunnel as it started to become narrower and tighter but I pulled myself together and continued to watch him, he seemed like he was okay as I saw the front and back of my bosses view with the 360° camera on his helmet, he continued further into the abyss. 

I decided to pull the book that he gave out of the bag and took a look at it’s contents page and went onto the first content and read what it implied. What I saw was the sentence chiseled into the sub-heading ‘Never Enter Alone’ and just seconds later I heard static from the tablet implying that the camera was disconnected, so I quickly rushed into the menu of the app on the tablet, it was old and non responsive most of the time due to mass usage by the team but eventually checked what was recorded on the camera and held the circle on the timeline and pushed it near the end until I found out what had happened..


My boss had accidentally chipped the camera on his head right off, not because the tunnel got tighter



But because he found a dead end."

x4z4kt,0,2022-09-03,Is this a reasonable negotiation for a new grad?,MetroRBN,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/x4z4kt/is_this_a_reasonable_negotiation_for_a_new_grad/,"Right now I have zero competing offers, but I have roughly two months to accept my return offer to my previous company.


In a high CoL area:

Base: $130k, Stock: $40k/4 years, Bonus: ~10%/year, Signing: $5k


I've been thinking of either doing two things: Grinding for other offers in the next to months to use as leverage to get at least $10k extra in stock or signing (since it seems fairly low), or using using my intern experience + market knowledge as leverage, i.e. using the fact that my manager/mentors passed on a lot of high praise to my recruiter and have said that they would definitely want me back, and that I know that at, at least, $5k for a signing bonus is pretty low compared to other similarly sized companies (the latter I won't necessarily mention outright). I know salary is often non-negotiable especially for new grads so I'm looking to do the latter.


I would love to work at this company given it's great WLB and culture, as well as WFH options without relocation, but for the area it's lower than other tech companies. I'm looking for at least that amount extra personally so I can move out earlier ($10k is essentially like 3-4 months rent here so that's 3-4 months earlier I can move out). 


But yeah my rationale is basically ""based on market research + familiarity with company internals, tools, culture, and the positive feedback I've received during my internship, I'd have a quicker onboarding experience with lower ramp-up time, so I was looking for around $10k extra in either bonus or RSUs.""

I am a 26 year old male in the United States Midwest. I need help on deciding a career path once I graduate from college. I'm majoring in Computer Information Systems - Programming. So far I have 2  IT internships as Level 1 &amp; 2 helpdesk - mostly imaging computers, configuration, Google Admin, Active Directory and hardware support and troubleshooting. I hated helpdesk and declined a $17/hr offer at a county health department, I found interactions with end users very frustrating, I know how to placate people but just don't want to anymore.

Anyways, after doing some research and watching loads of tutorials: I've narrowed it down to 3 Job Titles.

1. Business Analyst /Systems Analyst
2. RPA Developer 
3. DevOps

**Business Analyst**

* Boring
* Most Qualified for, easiest for me to do
* Office Politics and Budget Constraints

**RPA Developer**

* Most interesting, I like the idea of building robots
* Requires knowledge of RPA tools such as UiPath, Automate Anywhere and BluePrism
* Okay Pay

**DevOps**

* Most Complex: requires knowledge of Containers, CI/CD, Linux, Git, Elasticsearch, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.
* Most Unlikely to obtain: most companies want YEARS of experience and knowledge of development and IT operations
* Most Pay, can easily get six figures

Want I want to know is if I can land a basic IT help desk job with no experience so I can get some experience in the field. I would still try and get an Internship later on through my college as well. Would I need to work on some certifications first or what basic knowledge would I need for a help desk job/Internship?

x5391e,31,2022-09-03,2.5 weeks of college have passed and I feel like I blundered in the social scene,StrickerPK,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/x5391e/25_weeks_of_college_have_passed_and_i_feel_like_i/," 

As the title says, I just started college and I think I blundered the social scene. People are making tight friend groups so quickly and I feel like I didn't make use of the ""meeting new people"" phase the best that I could. Part of it stems from the fact that I have a hard time meeting new people in general. Just going up to random people and saying ""hi"" seems so difficult. This is hard when I see someone in a group vs when they are alone, because I think that they have already established friends, so it would be weird if I asked them now. Even during orientation week, when I saw groups of people together going everywhere I already felt left out and that people won't talk to me.

Another reason for it might just be my ego complex. I feel that I shouldn't have to initiate every conversation or interaction I have with new people. When I see someone and I want to talk to them, I think to myself ""Hey, I'm going out to initiate with someone, but think of how many people have initiated with you first"" I know this isn't good, but I can't help but keep a mental count of how many people I started the conversation with, and how many people started with me. And when, someone does initiate, I feel an ego boost and think ""YES, someone ACTUALLY wanted to talk to ME!!!!!"" ""I am IMPORTANT!"" I can feel weak when I am going around having to start with everyone.

I think it might be due to high school experiences of one-sided friendships. I want to spend time with people and have to initiate hangout times, but I don't see the other people reciprocating the friendship or wanting to do things with me. When I see yet another new person, I think ""Considering how fewer people have initiated with me, it is not worth talking with them because they will think I am weird and not want to talk with me.""

Also, in high school, I have the baggage of being the socially awkward (and somewhat annoying) nerd. I tried my best to reinvent myself in college, and have the mentality of ""know one knows you are a nerd"". But my true self, can slip out at times. I also find it very hard to be a ""fake person"" and being genuine has always been a priority, making this task harder. I can't help but be the talkative nerd who is still receiving the same labelling that I got in high school.

I am struggling to think if my social life is over for me in college. I didn't attend any of the block parties on the first orientation week due to me sleepy at the end of the day. And with friend groups all closing in and settling, I am feeling left out.

I mean I have made a couple close friends in college already, and I feel very grateful for that. But another flaw in my mentality is that I see making friends as some sort of competition where you have to know more people than others. This is probably one of my other high school distortions as well as the most successful kids in high school, and the ones at the top of the class going to top10/ivy colleges had loads and loads of connections and friends. They would start companies with them, get internships and fluff up their college applications. I was also in the top of my class, but i feel like the rug is being pulled from beneath me where I will fall behind compared to my peers who are zooming ahead. People are always saying ""it is who you know and being able to communicate what you know that gets you success""

I don't know if it is over for me in college. Is walking up to random strangers and saying hi still acceptable now that some weeks have passed? Can I still reinvent myself and portray a better image? Or how can I seem more appealing, so strangers are willing to approach me? I feel all is lost and I didn't use this opportunity the best I could and there is no way to recover for the next 4 years."

It's too much stuff. And I know that I should just go out there and learn it, press forward. But I feel like I'm about to burst and that I am nothing but an impostor. It's been really difficult.

x5a1k2,11,2022-09-03,Is this burnout or do I just need to toughen up?,Mcmeowmer,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/x5a1k2/is_this_burnout_or_do_i_just_need_to_toughen_up/,"

For a little background, I’m a pretty new teacher. 4 years in Texas education thus far. Two as a teaching aide and two as a classroom teacher. I’m currently on my second year of teaching. My first year was my internship with my Alternative Certification program but now I’m fully certified and not having to attend classes on the side. Also, I teach middle school 6-8 theatre. 

So now for the purpose of the post. I was a teaching aide at the same middle school for two years until I got hired at the other one as the classroom teacher. This is where I completed my internship. Both of these schools were rough. Like. Rough. Im sure most of you get it. Cussed out, rude students, vandalism, huge accommodations, insane amounts of 504 students, and too many times having students just taking a 0. God it was draining. It was common (and more so once I was the actually teacher at the other middle school) that I would have to have a break to cry. Or cry on the way to work. Or cry on the way back home. For the first three days of my internship (this past school year) I didn’t eat at all and I was sleeping maybe 4 hours a night due to extreme amounts of anxiety and panic that I had daily that did not go away even when I was home. By the third day I had decided I was going to write my resignation over the weekend and quit. However, I ended up not doing that. That is not to say the year got easier. It was maybe one week (maybe two if I was lucky) that I would have a good week each month. But I made some great relationships, did make some great memories, and really continued to build the theatre program. But I wanted out of this school and district. As did many teachers. 

I applied for another middle school that seemed promising. It was much closer to me, I get to work with another theatre teacher, and I hear good things about not only the district but the school itself… since the first day of summer PD I have had an unstoppable amount of anxiety. I’m overwhelmed, I’m depressed, I’m tired, and I’m not as fun as I felt I was in my previous school. The year has just started (finished week 2) and I’m extremely unhappy. It’s middle school so of course there are difficult kids but honestly in comparison to my previous school it’s nothing. But yet I’m still going home way more drained, way more unhappy, and I’m arguably waking up more anxious and it’s not going away once the day starts. 

I’m really feeling hopeless. I feel like I’ve lost my passion. And it’s only year two? Am I just being a baby? Is this just how year two is? I know it’s a “joke” or common thing to “hate your job” but this feels different. And yet, if I could have anyone here time travel and compare this year to my last I would bet there would be a consensus that this school is better for me. But why am I hating work? I’m HATING waking up and driving to work now. I’m HATING these lessons I’m teaching. It’s not flowing as well and I feel worse. I’m worried I made the wrong career path but I genuinely have no backup plans… I didn’t plan to be a teacher but here I am. I don’t have a job lined up ready to cover the bills and help me survive like this is. Do I just need to toughen up and push through? Or… is this it for me? I’m sorry if this is everywhere and so long and detailed but I’m truly at a loss at how to proceed. I have to grade papers this weekend and I just want to give up…. I’m looking at these warehouse workers or Amazon drivers and wondering if I should just abandon these kids. I’m so tired… I would love any advice…

Edit: For additional context, I have been speaking with a therapist for two sessions now and am planning on many more. Thank you so much for the concern and support."

**Coursework**

1. **GPA-** 3.8 W, 4.1 UW

   2. 5 on AP Gov, 4 on APUSH
2. **SAT-** *1400\**
   1. *720 reading/writing*
   2. *680 math*
3. I'm also a part of two special programs at school you need to apply to:
   1. **STEM Academy-** Science themed program, wherein students take a minimum of 10 science/math credits, attend science themed workshops and lectures.  They also complete a 40 hour STEM internship, and do a science related capstone project.
   2. **Global Affairs Academy-** Programed themed around foreign cultures and issues.  Students need to take a minimum of 1.5 international affairs credits, and 3 language credits.  Students also can help plan and attend lectures from those in related fields.

**Extracurriculars**

1. **Boy's State (Summer 2022)-** Simulation of both local and state politics.  Served as town clerk and prepared an end of year report for a mock town, and elected Auditor of Accounts.
2. **Governor's Institute on the Arts (Summer 2020, 2021, 2022)-** Two week arts intensive.  Took classes in writing, acting, and photography, as well as participating in art related workshops.
3. **Student Government (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grade)-**  Helped plan school events and community service events, as well as dealing with school issues.  Served as a committee chair 10th and 12th grade, as well as class whip 11th grade.
4. **Scholar's Bowl (11th, 12th grade)-**  Competed in quiz bowl contests against other high schools.  Ranked #1 in the state in 12th grade.
5. **Speech and Debate Team (9th, 10th, 12th grade)-** Competed in several areas of public speaking, including extemporaneous, debate, and original oratory.
6. **National Honor Society (12th grade)**
7. **French Honor Society (12th grade)**
8. **Piano Study (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grade)-** Studied with private lessons for 11 years, accepted into National Guild 9 years in a row.
9. **Theater (12th grade)-** Did tech for 2 productions
10. **Trumpet (9th, 10th, 11th grade)-** Took private lessons and played in the school's band, as well as in a local youth orchestra during 10th and 11th grade.

In addition to this, I think my LOCs will be pretty good, although I haven't officially set up anything yet.  Obviously this might change, but right now I plan on asking:

1. My guidance counselor.  She knows me a little but I'll probably get one of those generic ""hardworking student"" ones
2. My AP Gov teacher from last year.  I did really well in his class, and he often remarked about my big knowledge of government and politics.  Whenever he couldn't think of a term/event, etc he would point to me.
3. My AP Econ teacher this year.  Runs student government and scholar's bowl so he knows me pretty well, I'm doing well in his class so far.

Anyways here's a list of schools I plan to apply to.  Also if anybody has any suggestions for schools/ways to classify each school that would be welcome.  I'm a little lost as to how to classify as a school as a reach vs match vs safety lol

I'm assuming the program director is also on the admissions committee so I don't want to ask any questions that in any way could hurt my chances.

""1. When will the application for Fall 2023 admission be open?

2. Given that it's rolling admissions, how long after submitting do applicants typically hear back?

3. I know the GRE is not required, but is it recommended?

4. Where can I find a list of the approved electives for the program?

5. Where can I find more information about the &lt;redacted school&gt;'s participation with the &lt;redacted private research center&gt;?

6. What are some examples of where program graduates have placed in industry, as well as PhD programs grads have enrolled in? Do they place especially well in &lt;redacted state&gt; / the &lt;redacted region&gt;?

7. Does &lt;redacted school&gt; provide resources for helping master's students find internships and is this a common route?

8. Should I reach out to potential advisors for a thesis project before applying, or is it best to do so after being admitted?""

Would also appreciate any suggestions on other questions I should ask! TIA"

For years now i have just been trying to learn,work, and just somehow progress in life. my mother, father and me moved to US from Moldova around 10 ish years ago i would say. 

Growing up i really didnt have much, just the necessities of food, some toys and love haha. when we moved to the us, my mother had my sister and in 2018 they had my brother. I used to be a diplomat, but since the terms expired, we had to move back to moldova, instead my parents insisted and tried very hard so i can stay here in the states, and it had worked out! Although i still dont have my citizenship or green card, im very happy and blessed to live in America. Growing up, my mom was usually the stay at home parent, but every now and then the roles swapped. But for years now i have just witnessed my dad fall deeper and deeper into a depressed state, since all he does is work and break his back at construction/ Sprinter van hotshots. 

Ive tried to so damn hard to help, i got jobs, ive researched for them to help them with job situations, but yet we seem to make no progress unfortunately. All the money just comes and goes. Just recently (As of yesterday) my mom graduated her QA class and is now looking for a QA job to help and at least get some money for the family, since we can barely afford to pay bills, pay to live in a home or even eat sometimes. I plan to follow in the same kind of direction and i have been learning how to code for maybe a few months now, i started on python and want to fully grasp on how it works. I love my parents so fucking much, it really hurt to see my dad work stupidly all these years, i barely got to see him and missed out on alot of time with him :/ I plan on continuing to learn and at least somehow progress and help them financially, but given my age, it upsets me how i am always shutdown since im not 18. Ive tried internships, (i know that you need experience for them) making tik tok videos, stocks, youtube videos and all sorts of things to at least somehow make some damn money.  The problem is, i always feel like i dont have enough time anymore and that time is running out. I know im young but in my mind, i dont have time anymore, my parents are getting older, i have not seen any family from my country, and it pisses me off that i cant do anything about it right now. 

i cant stand to see my dad break his back any longer, thats all hes been doing all his life. I just want to free my parents from all these bills and troubles so i can at least have time to see them and spend time with them. Im ready to learn anything and everything for them, but i just dont know what to do anymore. i feel like im stuck in a hole haha. sorry for being dramatic guys. Any advice is greatly appreciated. it genuinely is."

I (20yo m) consider myself average looking, but got no game at all. I’m still trying to figure out why that is, my guess is it’s my nonexistent self confidence and lack of experience for my age.

So anyways, a friend of mine from school and I started talking again, both single yadda yadda and we end up talking about fwb. She said she thinks I am hot and I think it would help me to get some experience.
So when I visit my hometown for an internship I got there we meet up a couple of times and kind of move our way up from just cuddling, touching etc to dry-humping and, last weekend, naked humping without penetration. She told me to just go for it already, but I am reluctant. I am not sure if I want to loose my virginity to A, someone I am not romantically interested in, and B, someone I don’t find attractive (i was able to get an erection in the moment but she really isn’t my type).

Anyways today is the last time we will meet before I go back home, and I am having a hard time deciding wether to just „go for it already“ and get some experience in (which might help me with girls in the long run because lack of experience may or may not be holding me back), or save this „special moment“ for someone I actually have romantic interest in. 
I feel like my virginity is a burden out of fear that me fucking up my first time might cost me a possible relationship, but I wouldn’t care about a bad first time with said friend (cuz no romantic interest).

I fear I will regret my decision either way. Any advice for me? Would be very thankful for someone telling me what to do right now…"
x5njxe,2,2022-09-04,How would you [wager/invest] $100k ?,Regular_Ad3700,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/x5njxe/how_would_you_wagerinvest_100k/,"Hi, I've finished grad school in Europe majoring in quant finance. I'm accepted in a one year program in the US, still in quant finance starting in a few months. The estimated total cost of this program would be a bit more than $100k financed by savings but mostly by loan. I started the admission process two years ago (GRE/GMAT, TOEFL as a non-native english speaker, etc.). During these 2 years, I completed a 6 months internship at the HQ of a European bank as a support for front office people (working around 9h a day which is not much in these position but was a struggle for me - bearable thanks to WFH) and a 1y part-time internship as a 'quant risk analyst' (SQL, Excel, R all day). First experience was terrible, I was doing the job but as I wasn't fully into it, I wasn't delivering quality and made a lot of mistakes. Even at home I was stressing when boss was calling. One day, while we were in the second lockdown, I was so upset by eveything that I punched my laptop screen (lended by the company) and I had to complete the remaining weeks plugged on a small TV.  The second experience though was more easy going thanks to the great people I've worked with. However, I was still feeling trapped in an endless rountine despite the variety of project to work on and uncomfortable when my boss was calling. 

I started these experiences by default, fearing being left without internship after so many interviews failed. Conclusion: I feel employee life is dull and/or stressful. Most people of my age whom I talk with are perfectly comfortable with the idea of working 40y like that, I can't understand it. I know career shift is doable at any time but I'd rather save some years. I know you can enjoy life at any age, but i feel the 20's are so valuable, it's a shame to give them to a corporation. I'd rather invest the energy in a personal project.

The issue is I have no other option. No passion except practicing sport on my own, no instrument, no particular art skills or knowledge... I'm almost 24 and feel I've been tricked. I remember myself when I was in high school chasing only high paying jobs (hence finance) refusing to realize what comes with it. I like a lot of things in life but can't try everything to see if going all in it will fulfill me.  

(I feel it's shameful to hesitate to choose a high paying career while so many people are struggling to find a job...) 

Thoughts? What would you do?

Many thanks!"
x5ok5p,5,2022-09-04,"As a soon-to-be BS of Mathematics holder, with mainly informal experience in programming, what necessary skills do I need to learn to make myself hirable in the software development field?",TheGreatCornlord,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/x5ok5p/as_a_soontobe_bs_of_mathematics_holder_with/,"I taught myself Java a few years ago using the old MOOC U. of Helsinki course, and also took the Intro to Computer Science course (featuring Java) at my university last year. I also took a Computing Mathematics class at school which featured a crash course on Python, which I picked up quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I understand how these languages work, and in particular  I have a very strong ability to write code to achieve a desired result, which that is efficient with the use of logic &amp; accounts for all possibilities. There is a strong overlap here with my proof-based math training that requires airtight argumentation and plenty of quirks of math and logic. Yet I lack experience working with outside libraries, making GUI's, using databases, git/github, or much that is relevant commercially.

&amp;#x200B;

To give a better account of my ability level, I think I could basically write any text-output based and/or math related program that was put to me. Besides my code-writing strengths, I'm pretty good at using an object-oriented model to my advantage, and I can use a little numpy and matplotlib . py. I've made a fully-functional text version of Backgammon that is playable and features artificial opponents with 3 different temperaments, renders of the Mandelbrot set with coloration based on iteration of points escaping, Julia sets, and Newton fractals (which can take a custom complex polynomial object of arbitrary degree as an input to easily generate fractals based on many different complex roots). I've also done the first couple dozen Project Euler tasks and  think I've made some pretty clever solutions to many of them that run in just a couple seconds. I'm happy to share the Google Doc links to all of these.

&amp;#x200B;

But I doubt this will be enough to function in an industry job or an internship. It's too late for me to change my major or take more CS classes (besides independent online courses). I would like to get into software development, because despite my math background, I'm not particularly interested in number crunching in a finance field or something, though I'm open to taking whatever path through whatever fields I have to to end up in software development. So what are the necessary skills or languages or libraries I would need to learn?"

That’s the main issue with me: I’ve felt no motivation to continue studying past the norm of what’d get me an easy A/A- in classes. I don’t push myself or studying outside of classes. I hate that I have this mindset but that’s how I’ve been. But now I want to change that, issue being how do I find the right resources and time to practice and study more about what I’ve learned and get ahead of what my current and future classes. 

I aspire to grow into more software engineering and I’ve primarily been used to C++ though I have taken a Intro to Java class before.

Basically my school is different from the norm. If you wanted to do something like cyber security (what I wanted) or networking you have to do computer science and take the difficult math courses and some programming courses. For example I took Java, Computer organization, and an algorithims course I barely passed, Discrete, linear algebra, calculus.

I was stupid and got no internships in school. I wanted to do Cyber Security. I didn't realize that I can't jump into a field like that without an internship or experience.. So for the past year I've been working in IT. I want to get into dev work since the job outlook is better and pay is more cause I can't stay in my current living situation.

I've been programming often, but I do only know Java because it was my schools language and I like it better. How to make my resume more attractive since I have no software dev experience.

Will they look at my resume and be like oh why were you working in IT and just dismiss me even though i took a lot of the CS cirriculum? I've been making stuff I can put in my github.

yes I know this would be a better question for cscareerquestions but I don't have enough karma."
x614st,1,2022-09-04,[Help] Need advice regarding a big decision regarding to my college career.,A-_-ok,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/x614st/help_need_advice_regarding_a_big_decision/,"Greetings,

Hope whomever is reading this is having a great day!

I need advice on a life changing decision, and thought seeking advice here could maybe help me with making that decision.

I am an international student studying in the USA. Since I was a kid I have always wanted to become an Engineer, that was my goal. But I could not get a good offer from a US university with an Engineering school. So, I choose my second option, which does not have an Engineering school. I came to that school last year majoring in Computer Science, though was not too happy with it, but it was still in the tech industry, which was my career path.

Throughout the last Spring semester, I applied to transfer to schools who have an Engineering school. Eventually, I got admitted into one the issue is, I got a bad amount of scholarship money, as it is a small tech school, but prestigious. This all happened during the summer, when I had a summer job. I have Arab parents, so as soon they heard “Engineering” they were happy and said we would help pay for the college, though they would be paying double the amount of money…. It was a hard decision to transfer as during the year I spent at my old university, I have met a great roommate, made a lot of friends, networked with the faculty, planned to study abroad, and was involved on campus. It was very hard for me to let all of that go, but my parents kept telling me to transfer as it is better “career” wise. Through their pressure and work pressure, I was basically working on the transfer form / process “blindly”, I was doing all the work but hesitant on the inside.

Now, I finally transferred and spent a week and took a few classes at my new school. Each day I was there I was in strong discomfort and not belonging. Some of the people here a bit weird and not social. They just like to go to class and come back and sit on their phone or PC. I have noticed that with my roommates, I barley know them because they do not talk…  

After all of this, I want to transfer back to my old school. I feel like this school is amazing, but expensive for my family. They said they can do it, but it is a risk. And I don’t want my family to struggle if a financial burden comes up, as they are putting a lot of money into this, and my home country is not a stable place in anyway, so those funds could be used in case of an emergency.

This is a story version of my long story. My parents were against the idea of me staying at my old school because, they think friends won’t go anywhere and I can meet new people. And I can leave study abroad and travel later, and most importantly, the new school is better academically. They told me not to think emotionally and think in the long terms (That Engineering is better than IT career wise). But after the one week I had at my new school, I feel unhappy and in discomfort. I feel like if I was to come back, I will still do study abroad with my best friends, enjoy that, pay 2 times less and study for a good degree, which is Information Technology. But I am stuck on that decision…

Is going back to my old school and studying IT for 2 times less the money (25K / Year) a good investment? Or shall I stay at my new Engineering school pay double the amount (60K / Year), and basically putting all my money in one place? (That Engineering school has great internship connections and a great return on investment rate.)

Lastly, I feel me and my family could use this money to maybe help me get an MA degree if I want, or help with my brother’s studies, or simply save it for anything. I feel like it is a big risk that my parents are putting most of that money into my education.

Could I be wrong and simply missing my friends and my old school? Or am I thinking logically / sustainably in terms of the costs?

I will be graduating soon in November. Last month, I decided to join a company as a project and quality engineer (basically something along the lines of software tester/project manager). My probation period is 3 months.

For the past month, I had a difficult time trying to find the rhythm of this new company that I joined. I can deal with software testing and analyzing bugs with developers, however I believe the project manager role is not the right fit for me. I blame myself for that, but to make it worse, the company is severely understaffed.

We have quite a number of clients to handle, but since we are understaffed, we were given workload with ridiculous deadlines. I was working on weekends and even public holidays, with no overtime compensation. A month in and I'm already burned out.

Should I send out my notice to my superior? I gave it a chance and thought that it would get better with time.. but it didn't, and mentally, I'm in a miserable place. Would appreciate any advice, thanks!"

I've tried to apply my studying to Leetcode questions, but even the easiest questions seem to trip me up and I end up having to look up the solutions. I don't know if it's a mental block or if I'm not thinking through the questions enough, but I was wondering if anyone who went through a similar thing has any advice on overcoming this. Is it just a matter of practice, or is there perhaps a level of understanding that I'm missing? When learning the data structures and algorithms in theory, everything makes sense to me (eg why certain data structures are preferred in certain scenarios and whatnot), but the step from understanding to implementing/applying them on my own seems immense.

For context, I'm a rising sophomore and I haven't completed a formal DSA course yet (taking it this semester). Ig I feel behind when compared to my peers since a lot of them come from backgrounds where they were exposed to CS in high school and I want to make sure that I'm able to successfully prepare for interviews. any advice is appreciated!"

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me. But, again at this point I'm not sure what I actually want to do in life. So, yeah maybe I'm the only one but it would be of great great help if I could find a detailed article about this.
* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?

* 40	humanities courses in delhi university? Their scope? Course over college? How to maximize the experience?
* 41	CAT and general MBA advice. Like is MBA right for you, when is the right time to pursue it, what should be the expectations, what are the pros and cons.
* 42	Using various digital platforms and softwares to aid learning by visualization, active learning,using other blended learning techniques etc , especially for science students.For ex- There's desmos a graphing calculator and similarly geogebra for 3D calculator, geometry etc, these softwares can enhance student's math learning experience.Similarly there's molview for chemical compounds and bonding visualization which can enhance chemistry learning experience.Likewise there would be many such services/softwares and we should also make a list of them to help students learn better!

I got my associate's at a local community college taking a majority business course as I intended to pursue that once I transferred. Even had an internship from the Goldman Sachs 10KSB Foundation ( if you don't know, it's a program from Goldman Sachs where they take students from partner colleges and put them to work with a small-ish business in their area. I didn't even know It existed until the day before the application deadline.) But after the internship business didn't feel like the fit for me so I switched to Comp Sci when I transferred. 

I'm taking all freshman-level CS classes and honestly enjoy programming and everything in it. It all looks like a big puzzle I can spend as much time as I want on and I love it.

x668k8,12,2022-09-04,Should I include this EC on my applications?,throwawayappl2coll,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/x668k8/should_i_include_this_ec_on_my_applications/,"Over the summer I did an internship with a certain website that publishes sexually explicit content. Although it was remote, I was able to do more than grunt work; I collaborated directly with several of the developers to optimize the website layout to increase user engagement. I also have metrics that I directly helped achieve which I can use in the EC description (I heard that admissions committees like to see numbers to quantify impact). In addition, I'm planning on majoring in marketing/computer science, so I'm guessing this would demonstrate fit for my major.

There are a few drawbacks, however. I'm not sure if AO's would look favorably on this extracurricular due to the nature of the website. I was considering omitting the name of company in the description, but would that look too suspicious? What if I were to describe the organization as a website that publishes videos without describing the content of these videos?

Also, I obtained the job through slightly unethical means - I had to lie about my age and state that I was 18 at the time of application (they did know I was in high school, though). I didn't think they'd hire a minor, and I was pretty desperate for the money, so I altered the scan of my passport for the I9 verification and lied about my birthdate. I'm worried if there's an audit for my application or something to that effect, I might get into a lot of trouble for lying about this. 

One last question - my mentor for the internship offered to write me a recommendation letter when I apply to colleges. I think she could write a really good one considered we worked together for a few months, and I feel that she can attest to my technical capabilities, soft skills, and future aspirations better than the teachers I asked. So, should I ask her for one, and if so, should I ask if she can not mention the company name?"

might be a dumb qn but currently in year 2 CDE and came across an internship advertisement by A*STAR Research Internship Award Programme and very interested in applying for it and it is also quite useful for my major also but the internship is credit-bearing and can be done either as 12-week summer vacation internship or the 6 month industrial attachment so, i’m thinking about doing it for the summer vacation internship (so that i can leave the 6 month industrial attachment for an internship more related to my major )

my question is - can we even do 2 credit-bearing internships i.e 1 vacation internship and 1 six month long internship or only one?

I have about a 9-months of internship at my college for IT tech and I have 2 years of retail work. The IT job  mostly focused on hardware stuff. So I get interviews pretty often.  Every 15-20 jobs that I apply, I get about 1-2 interviews. However the interviews is the thing that i am struggling with. Pretty much in every interview that i had, they ask me questions about office 365, and exchange and SCCM.  Unfortunately college never thought us this material and I haven't had experience with it personally. I was thinking may be I should get the MD-100, MD-101 certification. I am currently studying for CCNA, and unfortunately a lot of the companies don't really care about that when they interview me. What would be your advice.

x695cv,7,2022-09-05,Sophomore in CE with some questions on careers and looking for some guidance.,ajuba,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/x695cv/sophomore_in_ce_with_some_questions_on_careers/,"Hello, I am a fall semester sophomore in CE and I'm feeling a little lost on whether or not I should stick with CE. When applying for schools I honestly was just putting majors that seemed interesting to me and happened to have picked CE for the school that gave me the biggest scholarship. I do have an interest in CE and enjoy working with electronics but not so much with programming. I understand my programming classes and have found enjoyment in them, but I'm much more interested in the hands-on work and would love to work in microprocessor design eventually.

This is where my questions arise; through talking to some family-friends in the industry I feel that knowing software-dev and having a background in it is really important which has somewhat dissuaded me from switching into EE, but should I really worry about something like that if I want to work more in hardware or is programming knowledge that important?

Through reading in this subreddit I've come to understand that working in microprocessor design is a very experience needy field and many jobs require master's degrees or PhD, how necessary is this? Are there any jobs (even if they're not entry level) for someone with just a bachelors in CE?

Besides this, if I just finish out a degree in CE what kind of jobs should I look into, and what jobs should I be looking at for a summer internship?"

So initially I wanted to do my Btech abroad like most of my friends, but then covid happened and my school for some reason decided to fxck up my 12th board result. I could no longer apply to GT/NTU like I had planned even if I aced my SATs. I decided to take a drop and prep for JEE and managed to score somewhat decent.

Im preferring CS related branches because its my interest area and I have done internships in ML(tensorflow), DL etc plus Im pretty good at basic coding (Python, C).

So these are the current options Im considering (feel free to comment if there is a good one that I missed)

-DTU Cse 
Im from delhi so its pretty comfortable and well connected, plus I can continue my internships with more ease. But Ive heard its overcrowded and the HS cutoff goes above 10k. Placements are decent. Ive heard its better than NSUT Cse overall

-NIT Surathkal IT vs NIT Warangal CSE
Pretty good options, NITk is a really beautiful place (beach tho).  I researched online and NITk cse and IT don't seem to have much difference. From what I figured IT seems to be more versatile plus Ive done internships in ML (tensorflow, dnn etc) so it seems more comfortable. What do you think? 
Surathkal also ranks above Warangal so I don't see any point in chasing the 'CSE' tag. Are there any benefits of it?  The problem is Ive heard someone say that they are very remote and companies 'don't go there?¿?' . Also I am used to the delhi kid life, so it will take some time to adjust but I do fit in eventually. How true is the placement part?

-IIIT Hyd Ece
This is a option that I wasn't considering earlier but I am really somewhat starting to now. The only problem is it will be too hectic. IIIT hyd cs on its own has a pretty hectic curriculum but taking Ece in it might just be a deathwish. My dad asked me to seriously consider it tho because its very specialised, has less crowd and is/will be a pretty big name moving forward. Also the placements, but I doubt I will benefit from that considering I wanna study further. Plus I wanna do extra curriculars in college and not study 10 hours a day like I did for JEE. Any more pros Im not considering? Money is not a factor for me.

What seems like the best option here? Are there some things I am missing? Any alumnis of these colleges who can maybe give me some insight?
Is there any other option I should consider?"

When you’re not doing that, you’re filling in repetitive webpages of personal information in internship job postings.

I’m pretty bad at LC Mediums and I don’t see myself getting adequate in time for interviews because of school, idk."

However, it was never my strong suit and I made sure not to overload my schedule with STEM classes all at once.

During my first semester at my program we are taking 6 courses (17 credits), and 3 of them are math heavy, they are a variation of: Accounting, Data Analysis/Statistics, and Microeconomics w/ Calculus.

&amp;#x200B;

Its taking me way too long to keep up with all 3 at once (plus my 3 other non-math courses, which are actually enjoyable). All the professors also have thick accents and go very quickly making it hard to grasp the concepts quickly during lecture. I am spending 5-6 hours every night just trying to catch up after class. I don't even know when I'm supposed to have time to apply to summer internships with all this work.

I'm also a little concerned that to keep my scholarship and graduate I have to keep above a 3.0. Most professors are curving the classes to a B or B+ because of our business schools guidelines.

Am I just not cut out for an MBA program? I really enjoy my more strategic focused classes - is it going to be so math intensive every semester?"

I just started as an IT Help Desk Technician at my school. I’m an Information Science major, so far I’ve been exposed to basic IT work (imaging, ticketing, remote technologies).

I want to get an internship this summer, but so far the only ones that seem to contact me back are Software Engineer positions and my Python isn’t nearly good enough to pass the coding tests (I’m currently through only 1/3 classes I have to take on Python.)

What IT internships for the summer would I actually have a shot at? I applied to lots of security internships even though my knowledge there as well is very surface level. I’m unsure of how to gain internships for experience without already having higher level experience. Any advice?"

In my environment it seems that the most common issues are misconfigurations which then cause packets to be loss, and it seems that it's always an issue with third party vendors, loss of power which results in a site being completely down, and slow internet which may just be a duplex miss match or bad cables

Low undergrad GPA with failed courses,hillywho,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/x6qs3q/need_help_low_undergrad_gpa_with_failed_courses/," Long story short, I screwed up my undergrad. I failed calc, and intro to CS twice because of severe mental health problems. 

After getting a reality check, I took calc at another university (got a B-), took multi variate calc at my current uni and got an A. Took some advanced stats courses (B to A- range). Finished my degree (major in philosophy with a double minor in math + stats) with a cumulative GPA of 2.44 with my GPA in the final 2 years of uni being 3.2.

I'm gonna take DSA, OOP, Algos and retake Lin alg. 

I know no one can predict whether I can get in or not, but has anyone been in a similar position? I am at a tier 2 ecommerce giant working as a software engineer, with 3 internships and over 23 hackathon projects. I finished my degree in June and I'm working to get into either UIUC or GT. I can't even focus on my current courses because I feel like it's a lost cause... I mean failing first year CS is pretty bad let's be honest. I just want another shot at learning CS concepts.

Any help would be great!"

Out of my options for UCs, I decided that UCSD was the best option and I wanted to understand my chances a bit better as the acceptance rate to the major is very high as a transfer (74%).   
I will be fulfilling all the requirements by the end of my spring quarter in this order (translated to UCSD courses when possible) :   
APs: Physic 1, Enviornmental Sci, Stats, USH   
Spring 2022: Humanities, Photo Honors  
Summer 2022: Math 20A, Econ 1, Econ 3  
Fall 2022: Math 20B, CSE 8A, a C++ course, English Honors, Piano   
Winter 2023: Math 20C, CSE 8B, CSE 30, English Honors, Piano   
Spring 2023: Math 20D, Math 18, CSE 12, Piano, another class cs maybe  


Agreement: [https://assist.org/transfer/report/25506844](https://assist.org/transfer/report/25506844)  


(Math 20E and CSE 15L is not offered so in theory I finish all possible requirements)

(So far a 4.0 GPA probably will be within the 3.7-4 range at end of the year)  


My questions are the following:  
1) What are the best colleges for Math-CS Majors that finished IGETC

2) What experience did you have when transferring to UCSD as Math-CS? What was your GPA? Did you finish all requirements?

3) Am I in a good enough position to get into UCSD?

4) Because I finish most of the GEs how many units does a Math-CS major take per quarter to graduate within 2 years?

5) Is it possible to get an internship in ML/AI or Data Science for the junior summer?"

Consider an employee working with a larger team on an internal project (such as risk detection/product categorization). This project was delegated to them by the company and they prepared an algorithm by using and modifying 3rd party code from Github, StackExchange, medium, etc. Since it was clearly understood that the project was intended for non-commercial, internal use, the understanding was that no formal licensing/in-code citations were required when preparing the algorithm.

If the company gets sued for IP violations for using external copyrighted code, can they later go and sue the employee, who was just doing their job and had the code repeatedly evaluated and approved by seniors during code reviews? What's the law around this and should the employee worry about needing to pay up for just doing their job, as advised by the seniors?"

I was a foreign language teacher in the public school system for 12+ years and decided I needed a switch.  I got into a state school to study my lifelong interest: Computer Science.

My resume was originally full of school jobs, teacher stuffs and human languages, but now I am trying to demonstrate technical competency for internships.

My first career fair (I'm 36) is in 3 weeks at my university. I'm in my 3rd semester (having already taken both fundamental programming courses and I am now enrolled in Data Structures and Algorithms).

Any and all critiques are welcome!  Thanks in advanced."

I got an admission in a university in Ireland. I came here all by myself on 30th of August to do Masters. My father is funding everything for me. This is my first time being away from my family.   


Today was my first class and I realized that the course is very similar to what I studied during my undergrad and I feel like the university scammed me and my father and made him waste so much money. The class today was ""Programming 1"", basically learning to code using Java.   


I have done Computer Engineering during my undergrad, therefore I am familiar with coding. I also have 10 months of experience as a Software Intern, 4 months in Istanbul and 6 months in India.   


Not only the course is easy, Ireland is kind of a nightmare to live in, I don't mean to shit on Ireland, it is a beautiful country, but most students here are struggling to find accommodation and living in expensive hostels.   


I feel lost and confused. I don't know what to do. I messaged the program director of my university and asked if I could change my major. I can't just give up and go back home can I. I already feel terrible / guilty for disappointing my father like that, if I go back that would just be the worst.   


TL;DR: My father spent 56k to send me to Ireland for Masters. I find the course too easy and similar to my undergrad. I also struggle to find accommodation."

I'm a 26-year old working professional with a degree in Computer Science.  Over the past 4 years, I've worked as a financial product support person, a hardware infrastructure specialist (I set up kubernetes, openshift, and docker containers on IBM servers with a lot of handholding), and now I’m a Technology **ANALYST**(!!) in consulting.  I'll explain more of my background and more of how I'm struggling to learn anything:

I took computer science as a major because I didn't put any effort into figuring out what I wanted to do with my life.  Growing up in an Indian household as a born-and-raised US citizen, I could either go into engineering, CS, business, science, or med.  I was more interested in mindless trivia, music, eating meat, and socializing with others well into my teenage years, since I was deprived of a lot of that at home.  I had time on a computer to myself, but misused that quickly.  I had tried doing basic Java coding in high school, but I wasn't very good or committed to it.  I wanted to do business, but ultimately didn't because CS would make me more money in NYC.  In college, since I never had a social life, I only focused on socializing/partying and never on my coding assignments.  I always had this perception that engineers and coders never got girls or got laid, so I didn't focus on my education.  I personally believed people don't go to college for education, but only to get drunk, laid, and hopefully find a job.  I took undergrad classes in Python (failed once), C++ (which I failed twice), Data Structures, Algorithms, Computer Arch, OS, and Senior Design (where I did no work).  In all these classes, I didn't pay much attention in lectures, didn't try to solve problems myself because I knew that I couldn't devote my mind into solving simple CS problems, didn't go to class, and usually copied other people's HW assignments just to get them out of the way.  I ended up with a subpar GPA with no internships at banks or tech firms, and a job offer not in coding that offered me a mere pittance of an annual salary.

Fast forward to now, I am stuck in a consulting job, where I had a previous project doing DevOps, but now I want to be a part of the creation of applications as opposed to a support person who just pushes prod-ready code into an environment via pipelines.  I don't have passion for technology or hard work, but instead, I have passion for other things like watching YouTube videos on sports/culture/music, spending hours on the internet researching sports, fantasy, drinking, lifting, and creating sports team spreadsheets.  Now to the point of why I'm even posting here.  **I have no idea where to start in terms of programming in a language.  I keep paying for Udemy trainings in Java, where the syntax fundamentals are taught (Classes, Arrays, LinkedLists, fibonacci, threads), but I'm not learning anything since I STILL fall into the pattern of copying and pasting another person's solution and trying to make it my own.  My short-term career aspirations are to be an architect with great communication skills.  WHY AM I LEARNING THESE FUNDAMENTALS WHEN I NEED TO BE LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO DESIGN WEB APPLICATIONS, WEBSITES, AND BUSINESS APPLICATIONS WITH PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES.  I was told that I need to have a foundational language first before I could move into Software Design, Design Patterns, and Microservices.  My coding level is not efficient, and I have no idea why people even do software development.  Someone on this sub PLEASE HELP ME figure out what I need to learn and how can I get up to speed in a month with coding so that I can get work as an architect???  I'm struggling to get work right now, and I want to know if this sub has ANY learning paths or recommendations for me as to how can I learn Java, JavaScript, Python,  and designing applications?**"

&amp;#x200B;

During 2020, I(f22) began a pharmacy technician program. I was very excited because I felt I was already skilled in some aspects of the job and have the temperament for it. The first semester was online classes and I did very well, I brought my gpa up enough for a full scholarship for my second semester.  I know that may sound like it came easy because it was all online, but I worked very hard and stay determined. 

We had off during the Summer seasons then came back in the fall. We were on campus this year. On the first day of classes, I saw that there were only five people left in the whole program; all women as well. I was very happy about this because I have ADHD and a smaller class helps me stay focused. Having only female students and teachers made me more comfortable. I sat in the first desk, ready. 

Things didn't get weird until the third week, when I noticed my peers always stayed behind in class and were not walking with me out to the parking lot. Okay! I thought, they like to chat and get to know each other after class. I'll start staying behind as well to bond with my classmates and professor. 

At the end of my next class, I packed my things while happily chatting with my peers like usual. But when they went to stand by her desk and I joined, they all started at me like I spit on them or something. I caught the hint quickly and was only there for about a minute. When I left, I stood outside the doorway for a moment and they began chatting. They didn't even bring me up! Just started gossiping about their relationships and their weekends. This hit me really hard, I'm tearing up now. I'd almost rather they talk about me cause then I'd understand. I stood there for five minutes.

I came to class and that was it. I just wanted to focus on getting my career started. But the assignments felt harder and I was getting angry just thinking about school. I'd get ready for school angry. I'd drive to class holding back tears. In class, I'd sit there staring at the board just seething with anger. I did not understand why they left me out and couldn't understand why it bothered me so much. In high school I was horribly bulled; in-my-face bullying and I kept my head held high and stayed calm on the inside. 

Then internships began. I was ready to get into the actual job. We needed a certain amount of hours in 8 weeks to graduate, along with good grades. The last class we had before internships, our professor told us all our grades were well. By the time internship started, we had no more assignments except for acquiring our target hours. 

I was sent with one of my peers to a pharmacy separate than my professor and other peers. This is a pharmacy inside a store chain. We walk in the first day and the pharmacist there, we will call him JD, asks for my registration log in. I gave gim my school log in and he was offended and said, no, your pharmacy technician registration. I had no clue what he was talking about. In the beginning of the year, our professor asked us to send her our registrations to make sure we got them. I sent her my registration for school and she said it was fine! I was knew to pharmacy stuff, so I just was so ignorant I had no idea we had to do the registration on our own, I thought we automatically got one when being accepted into the program. 

She had sent me to work in the Pharmacy without proper registration. The girl I was with showed me hers and was lost on how I wasn't registered. That I should've had this done the first day of the first semester. That I shouldn't even be in the pharmacy right now. I was sent home and couldn't work for three days, but then they said I could come back but my professor never apologized and even blamed me for losing hours. She wouldn't answer my question about why she approved when I sent the wrong registration. I dropped it because I just wanted to catch up on hours.

Now, JD was a tough and particular pharmacist, which we were warned about. I did my best and made few mistakes. They were mistakes we were expected to make and the peer there with me made them just as much. 

But she was being moved up, taught new things like working the register or filing prescriptions. I was becoming fustrated, but I was at a steady pace and doing well, he was correcting me less, but JD wouldn't teach me anything else. 

Then this was where I began to feel I was being excluded. I had been there for about three weeks when it was time for our lunch break. This peer and I became friends due to us sharing the same shift schedule and would walk in and out together everytime. But this time a senior ph. tech there grabbed her to stay behind. I figured it was quick so I stood nearby and looked at the aisle near the pharmacy. All I heard was my peer say, ""but what about \_\_\_\_"" when the senior ph. tech whispered something back and they went back inside the pharmacy. I didn;t want to wait for her longer because lunch breaks were the only break we got so I left. When I came back from lunch, there was def tension but I didn't think it was towards me! Later, when it was time to go, the front door was crowded so I left through the break room. When I walked into the break room, I saw red. They all clearly had catering for lunch. I snooped and found a receipt taped to one of the bags. It had the pharmacist's last name on it. So this guy, who had been busting my balls for three weeks while I worked my mental health away, brought in catering for the pharmacy techs and excluded me. And I guess that other senior tech just supported this? I called my professor that night and demanded a transfer. 

At the next pharmacy, things went more smooth. I was with my professor and sometimes was scheduled with a peer. Everyone working in the pharmacy was lovely to meet. The pharmacist there was an angel, she really motivated me and we will call her A. A would teach me while literally being on the phone with a patient. She paid attention to the tasks I enjoyed and would make sure I got to do them(ex; stocking, breaking down boxes). Mostly I was counting pills, of course.

But when she wasn't there and it was the other pharmacy tech, I was being picked on. And I didn't realize til I got out. The other pharmacist would flirt with me constantly and my 'coworkers' would joke about it with me. We all became friends and I was comfortable there. The weeks flew by and I was looking forward to graduation. I was really excited to get my degree because I had failed out of (community) college before. We had three weeks left in the program and I already had an amazing tech job lined up. 

Well. 

My professor pulls me into the middle of the pharmacy aisles in the middle of my shift. She tells me I failed three of the classes I told her that's not possible because before we left for internship she had everything was fine. She gave a half-assed apology then said I need to finish my internship. I tried to continue, thinking about what I'll do. I stayed until the end of my shift.

When I got to my car, I had no thoughts in my head. I couldn't of put together a sentence if I tried. The feelings of anger and panic came back. I literally had no idea what to do. I felt so worthless, but I went to my next shift. I didn't tell anyone about my failure, I just went back to work. Everyone treated me differently. I'd say hi and get a cold-shoulder. Even the pharmacist that had been flirting with me treated me like I was a weird little girl with an obsession for him. My 'coworkers' would listen to me talk to them then just walk away with no response. Only A would treat me with respect. No one specifally called me out for failing, but I knew they knew. 

I want to add, during this time my professor took my lunch break hours away. In the beginning she said we could count those hours on internship then came to me one day and said she took them out and she shouldn't of said I could do that, so I lost 10+ hours just because of that. 

I worked with A mostly, so I was mostly by her side during my last few weeks. Then I came one day and we wasn't there, which was fine it happens it was just going to be a shitty day. One of the ph. techs I felt close with finally talked to me again, telling me she would teach me how to file prescriptions. Like literally the orders from the doctors about what medicine to give, how much of, and who to. This also involved insurance. She showed me and I believed I had it down. I worked on these all of my shift. She told me I did a great job. At this point, I was going to retake the semester next fall because I was still in denial of what was going on. 

My next shift, this was it. A was furious at me. I had entered all the files wrong. Do you know how fucked up that is? How much fucking work that is to fix? I tried to explain but she wouldn't listen and the tech who ""taught"" we grinned behind her. I just left.

I was shut down for months. Ever since I stood outside that doorway, school became my only thought. My whole personality was gone. I didn't tell my parents or friends. only one person knows. I was so mad at myself. It wasn't until summer when it hit me that my whole experience with that program was odd. Like I was set up to fail or be pushed out? I really can't understand why I was treated like such an outsider. My peers in that classroom were in the same spot as me. My professor was supposed to have my back and encourage my career. My pharmacists and senior pharmacy techs were supposed to teach me. 

I cannot think of any reason why they'd leave me out. I genuinely think there's something I did in the very beginning to ask for this, because there's no way all this shit happened because someone was bored. Majority of the time, I think I'm looking into it too deep.

Professors aren't just going to single out one student. That professor worked as a ph. tech as well, wouldn't she want more techs? The pharmacists not teaching me, did I show up and he decided she isn't worth it or am I actually a fucking airhead and don't realize? The catering, there is no excuse for that. Unless I was making way more mistakes and they weren't telling me, but I swear it seemed I was making the same amount and same ones as my peer. The second pharmacy has me confused the most. Was their behavior always to mess with me or did they actually like me? Why didn't my professor tell me sooner I failed? And finally, why did that tech set me up like that?

For context, I am a masters student, majoring in Economics with a WAM of 89 at the end of my second term and have previous done internships with KPMG and Deloitte abroad. I was previously the VP for an important society at UNSW, am a cultural mentor, have managed more than $50,000 as a treasure for an international conference as a volunteer and have also volunteered for ARC and the Red Cross. I’m an international student and have a solid up-to date resume that has been approved by recruiters from Goldman Sachs, BCG, Bain, Deloitte, BDO and other firms in Australia. I have networked with more than 100’s of people ever since I’ve moved to Sydney this January and honestly, have genuine connections with more than 50% of these networks. I have taken other things such coding in Python, STATA, MATLAB and R seriously and have developed those skills as well. Even after all this hard work I am not able to land internships. Every person I meet and show my profile to is impressed and is shocked to see that I am not able to land any internships in Australia. 

I am growing tired of this because I get almost 1 or 2 rejections every week and it’s starting to really affect my confidence. I honestly can’t see what I’m doing wrong and why I keep getting rejected. After all, I have decent grades, good previous internship experience, an up to date and tailored resume with a ton of transferable skills and some genuine networks!! All this at a time when the labour market is so tight?? I mean if I can’t break in now I might as well kill myself because I’ll never land a job otherwise. 

I really didn’t want to go internship-less this summer but I guess that’s what is written for me ahead. Life can be real tough sometimes guys! If any of you are going through the same then feel free to DM me; trust me I know what you’re going through!"

It is a Remote internship.
I'm a fresher and this is my first real internship/job working at any company. 
The timings are 10am to 6pm and it was getting hard to keep up with working all the time throughout so I used to get bored or burnt out quickly and spend time watching YouTube and browse social media. 

In college due to Covid we had online classes and I've gotten pretty lazy since then and the ability to focus for longer periods of time has decreased. I used to waste a lot of time scrolling on Social media and watching YouTube for hours lying on my bed.
Since the job started it's been a shift in routine and lifestyle but old habits die hard. I still find myself being bored and wanting to just lie down and do nothing.

Also recently they have hooked me up on the Employee Tracking software so our activity gets tracked and the employer will know if I'm wasting time or actually working.

I have to get used to this new work lifestyle and some pointers would be really helpful on how to manage myself being productive and working for a long time sitting at a place. I want to improve and work on myself.

Thank you."

I have minimal coding skills right now, just some basic python and java. I've taken a bioinformatics research course before, but that was more focused on using basic online bioinformatics tools for genome annotations and didn't get into anything advanced. 

I was wondering what kind of experience/education I would need have a successful career. Would I be able to keep up in a bioinformatics or computational biology graduate program with minimal coding experience? Would applying for internships be advisable, and when would I want to do this? Do most people go for their PhD's in this field? What do salaries look like right now? Any help would be much appreciated."

From 9th to 12th, I had to take 19 classes yearly.
Yes, 19....
We are obligated to take all of them
The passing grade is 60% . Only 1 or 2 students get a grade of 80% in most exams, and 2 to 5 five students get a 70% over 50 students in the class. 
If you can get 70% most of the times, u are considered as one of the best students in the class - that is my case.

Here are the courses: 
Languages:
French, English, Spanish, Haitian Creole

STEM courses:
Maths (Algebra, Calculus, Geometry, Trigonometry, Statistics, Probability, Linear Algebra) 
Biology, Geology, Chemistry, Physic, Computer Science

Social courses:
Economics, World History, Haitian History, Philosophy, Religion, Law

+ Sportive and Physical education,
Plastic Arts, Music theory


Now, I want to study anything related to Entrepreneurship/Economics/Business/Finances. I also like technology and I can create websites with HTML and CSS, code Raspberry Pi and Arduino with Python. 

ECs: 
-President of my high school entrepreneurship club for 2 years. I was its marketing director for one year before that. 
During my time there, I help about 5+ teams won national entrepreneurship competition and international competition (4th place in materials science at the ISEF). I invited alumni from Harvards, people from the Ministry of Education in my country, successful entrepreneurs to do workshops, conferences  for the students. I raised over $250 (it's a lot in my home country currency) to organize the first ever entrepreneurship competition at my high school. 
-Being accepted to the Student Advisory Board of the Diamond Challenge, which is a global entrepreneurship competition for high school students. Because of that I was featured in a Top National Magazine (I was the first in my country to be in it).
-Create  a non profit that connect people from my country with opportunities such as, scholarships, internships, works,  free courses, competitions... Reached more than 10k people on social media and our website without any aid Ads.
- create a printing company to help students within my city print their homeworks (we are living in a third world country and having a printer at your home is not common. Even tho u had it, we barely have electricity, so u won't be able to use it at any time). I had a System where the students send me the homework online, I print it for them and then deliver it tomorrow in the morning. I made like $ 5k, which is almost a million in my country currency. I even hired a student in my class to help with logistics.
- Did an internship as the Head of the project management team of the most selective and famous summer program in my country (there were AOs from MIT, Princeton as panelists) They double my salary because of my performance. I was selected one of the two interns they chose among 25+ applicants. The program was created by two students from MIT and Princeton. 
- I received an invitation to coach  a team at the second most selective summer program in my country. I was Coaching them about pitching ideas. The team I mentored won a competition they organized in the summer program. 
- Played piano at the church that I regularly go and other churches in the country since primary school. 
- Act in an international audio show. 
- Play Tennis Table (won the 2nd at a school competition and trained primary students at my school)


Awards: 
- Diamond Challenge Global Semifinalist (before being a semifinalist, I had to won in my country among 25+ finalists) it's an Entrepreneurship competition
- Leadership and Dynamism prize (Because of my work in the club) I received it from the biggest entrepreneurship firm in my country (over 10 years of experience) in front of high school counselors, ambassador of Taiwan in Haiti, Ministry of Education in Haiti and among 2000 students from 5 states. 
- National Robot Challenge winner (created a robotic solution for COVID-19) this is the only robotic challenge in my country
-  2nd Athena's Challenge Winner (it was a pitching competition organized by the biggest Insurance Company in Haiti - we had to bring a solution to an environmental problem, so we transformed plastic wastes into strong bricks designed for construction) 
- Pitch Biznis Lakay winner (it was an international competition on Club House) I donated all the money to the Entrepreneurship club of my high school.

I don't need to out the others because I have space to only list five of them.... :)

Ethnicity: Black 
Demographic: Caribbean - Haiti (Poorest country in the American continent and one of the poorest in the world) 

One of my problem is my grades
9th: 62% and top 15% - transcript given by my school
10th: 69% and top 10%- transcript given by my school
11th: 76% and top 5% - transcript given by my school
And 
12th: 1358/1900  - transcript given by the Head of Education in my country. Which is a grade of 71%

From 9th to 11th, I had to take tests from all of the 19 courses. However, in my senior year, Even tho I take all the 19 courses I only had to take official exams for some of them. 
Link to my senior year transcript: https://postimg.cc/sB5pk98g


The courses are a lot in my transcripts. Now, will AOs just look at courses related to my major or almost all of my  grades? 
These 60%+ are like D in the US, How will they affect me? 

Moreover, there are always kidnapping, homicide, gangs blocking roads and burning people in their own outside almost everyday. Sometimes I can't go to school because of these obstacles. 

By the way: I got a 120 on the Duolingo
I will take the SAT this October and I hope to get at least 1300; I had a poor 1140 the last time I took it :(. It's hard for me to answer the question quickly with no errors bc English is my third language. 

Reminder: Now, I want to study anything related to Entrepreneurship/Economics/Business/Finances. I also like technology and I can create websites with HTML and CSS, code Raspberry Pi and Arduino with Python. 

Oops: I need almost a full ride bc my EFc is 3k-5k :(



Any recommendations for schools regarding my stats  ? 


Any general ADVICES?

3. Selected to a selective local govt paid internship
4. Selected to a Top-10 univ sponsored summer research program (free)
5. State level awards in Science Olympiad and TSA
6. Member of NHS, MuThetaAlpha, Science Honor Society.

English teacher don't know me well but hoping it would be at least 7.5/10 (because I am one of the few who got a A in her difficult class)
2. CA Essay: common app essay is still in the works - difficult for me to judge - may not be very unique (my years of vocal music training is the backdrop). I am a good writer when it comes to academic papers but kinda struggling to write about myself (turned out, I am pretty boring haha) - I am just being sincere and true to self but it may sound all too familiar to AO's. My realistic estimate is 7/10 (if I get lucky with a sympathetic AO and/or with a sudden spurt of creative writing, can be 8/10).
3. Supplements: Why this college supplements for Cornell and Dartmouth are done and feedback for both is very positive (each read by a respective alumni/current-student). Why this major supplement is in the works - I am really into Health informatics and/or public health and so am confidant this will come out good.

**Schools:**

1. Possible ED: Cornell (CALS or CHE) OR Dartmouth
2. Other reaches/targets: Rice, Emory, Tufts, BU, Northeastern, Case Western, Lehigh, UIUC, UMd
3. I do have couple safeties (not revealing for identity reasons, but they are a state flagship and a local private that have both historically gave admits with merit aid for all most all top-20 rankers from our school).

Please suggest the best option for me to ED (if the suggestion is Cornell - please suggest the college as well; Biology/Health majors are available in multiple colleges including CALS, CHE, CAS). Any other targets that I should add?"

I'll cut to the chase, this is not a ""roast my resume"" type of post, it's a ""what do I do?"" type of post. Basically I'm an Italian student, 21yo, I'll graduate from a BA next July, specifically BA in Digital Management, and I'm concerned about the next steps that I need to take. 

I've been always interested in numbers, but I've been aware of it since I first took the introductory course in Data Analytics at my Uni, so I have excellent grades in Probability and Statistics &amp; Mathematics only at the University. Rn I'm working as a fullstack Flutter developer, and as much as I love coding, I feel that this is not what I want to do with my life. As explained I'm fascinated by numbers, done Python courses, R courses, developed scripts to analyze historical data with whatever condition I had in mind when coding, I've also done ML courses, so also a bit of modeling and TS analysis... The thing is that I feel I want to become a Quant. The thing is that here in Italy the role of the Quant isn't known a lot, so I'm struggling to find what I need to do in order to become one. 

I literally spend my free time applying for internships at every single bank, fund, hedge fund, private equity... without success. I feel like I need to know someone in order to follow through with my dreams because right now I'm swimming in a big pool of confusion. Thanks in advance to have taken the time to read this!"

She first started dating my dad back in 1991.  My parents divorced in 1987.  I am now 43.  She always called me ""a member of the family,"" and I pretty much always felt that way.  I was invited to so many of her family events throughout the years, got to know everyone in her family really well, and it always felt fine.  My father always appreciated that I tagged along.  It should be noted that Lynne's financial situation improved greatly by marrying my father.

Then I went to law school in my late 20's, and her family gave me advice about where to attend.  Lynne has a family full of successful lawyers, including both her sister and her daughter, but none of them offered help in obtaining an internship for over the summer.  I suffered greatly from this, and I began to question whether I was really a member of the family.  I cannot help but feel resentment towards Lynne.  I have discussed it with her and also with her daughter and sister, but they did not want to help.  All throughout the years, I have been a model student-- if I say so myself-- and there really is not any reason for them to say no.  I really just needed some extra help with the connection.

It has basically become clear to me at this point, that I am actually not considered a member of Lynne's family, but instead just an extra warm body to invite to all her events.  She loves her immediate family greatly.  They get to play on the team, but, at most, I am a cheerleader or someone in the stands watching the game.  In the past several years I have set boundaries in my dealings with Lynne.  I will not do her any favors anymore because she has taken a strong stance against doing favors for me.  I am not rude about it, but I just see no benefit for me to go out of my way to attend parties she throws for her immediate family when she would not help me out.

My father could have stood up to her, as well.  I do not think he realizes the lifechanging damage it has caused my career, although I have discussed it with him at length.  But after the divorce from my mother, he does not want to rock the boat with her, and he just goes along with what she wants.  Otherwise I am consider myself very close with him and lucky to have him around.

How do I maintain a positive relationship with my father still, while maintaining a healthy boundary with Lynne?  There are times when my dad will insist I come to even more of Lynne's family events, but I continue to remain justifiable upset with their lack of treating me like family.  It causes trouble for my dad when I do not go, and I do not want him to be upset with me."

Due to heavy internship commitments, I was not able to leetcode (mostly able to do Easy qns and a few popular Medium atp)/ do projects as much as I would have liked during the summer and don't feel prepared enough to apply now that many companies are recruiting from Aug to Oct.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on the following:

1. What is the market for new grad SWEs like after the recruitment cycle from Aug to Dec usually? What are some of the companies that are usually hiring new grads after that period?
2. I am thinking if I should still go through with the recruitment cycle now while I'm at like 50% or if I should focus on brushing up my fundamentals for the rest of the year and start applying in Jan - which option would be better?

I prepared custom CVs, wrote cover letters, and researched every company - no results. I found a local manager was teaching a course in my college about a thing I already knew, so I signed up and excelled there, which was enough to get me an interview for an internship with his referral. He even told me what to prepare for. There were some questions about inner workings of a technology and some programming task. I got the job! It was paying **$5.5k per year** (in Russia that's about minimum wage). I worked my ass off for 2 years, sacrificing all my time, putting my college on pause for a year, and basically burning out. It was a terrible work environment but I got my skills developed to a decent level. Then they lowballed me offering **$6k**, so I looked for a different job. HR noticed my active resume and snitched on me, which resulted in a very awkward meeting with my manager. I wrote a custom cover letter and a custom CV to a big bank and they actually responded! My skills were enough to get the entry-level position and my salary tripled to about **$17k per year**!

However, I may have relaxed too much, so, I didn't pass the probationary period, and they fired me. I decided to try and move to EU, so, for 3 months all day every day I've been applying everywhere gradually lowering my expectations but eventually, I got a reply from a startup in a small country Estonia! The interview was very easy, just a multi-choice questionnaire and a couple of behaviorals, doubled my salary to about **$32k**. Got the visa, worked there for 2 years, and it was awesome, traveled the EU a bunch even sometimes on the company budget. At the end of my work there my salary was **$48k**. Then COVID happened and I was fired due to company financial issues, so I started to apply anywhere in Estonia to save my visa.

After a [ridiculously over-complicated logic puzzle task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle), I got a job at another big bank with a pay cut because of the task to **$42k**! It was ok but I decided to start applying to US jobs as I really wanted to move there all along, it was unreachable before but now I got 4 years of experience.

After working at the bank for 3 months, I got a job at a super small US consultancy with a branch in Estonia for **$60k**. That was extremely lucky, my wife and I both sent out my CV to more than 1.5k jobs and only got this single reply. The interview was very chill with the owner where I simply showed some code I had already written for some other interview. I worked remotely for a year from Estonia, got to travel to the US a couple of times, and eventually got my visa. The consultancy had issues with clients for the last half a year so I basically waited for my visa without any income from them, so I had to hustle a bit on the side but it worked out.

Within 2 months when I got to the US, I interviewed with Amazon and passed through all their hoops like 1.5h assessment (2 leetcode tasks), personality/""what would you do"" test, HR screening call (behavioral), developer interview (leetcode + behavioral), and then a multi-interview 4-hour day (a bunch of leetcode + behavioral). I then transferred my visa to them and moved to Texas, and also I left my last paycheck behind for the small consultancy as a token of appreciation though. Even though I had 5 years of experience at this point they only gave me their ""entry-level"" offer but it's for a whopping **$170k**! So, after taxes, I now take home 10k every month. I've been working there for half a year, it's been great!

Thanks for reading, I'd be happy to take or give some advice! :)"

I wanted to apply for internships during the summer 2023, before my last semester.Currently, I am not sure how to even begin applying for internships for the coming summer.

So far Ive started trying to find projects to do and have started leetcoding - as I take it these are two important things.

Ive only done around 30 questions on LC and 2 projects on my Github. Any advice would be appreciated as I try to navigate this crazy field. Guess I am just confused as how to start applying and where to apply."

thanks

x7ikw2,3,2022-09-06,what do y'all think?,Laou-,IntltoUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/x7ikw2/what_do_yall_think/,"Sorry for the long post, but it's tremendously important for me!

 
From 9th to 12th, I had to take 19 classes yearly.
Yes, 19....
We are obligated to take all of them
The passing grade is 60% . Only 1 or 2 students get a grade of 80% in most exams, and 2 to 5 five students get a 70% over 50 students in the class. 
If you can get 70% most of the times, u are considered as one of the best students in the class - that is my case.

Here are the courses: 
Languages:
French, English, Spanish, Haitian Creole

STEM courses:
Maths (Algebra, Calculus, Geometry, Trigonometry, Statistics, Probability, Linear Algebra) 
Biology, Geology, Chemistry, Physic, Computer Science

Social courses:
Economics, World History, Haitian History, Philosophy, Religion, Law

+ Sportive and Physical education,
Plastic Arts, Music theory


Now, I want to study anything related to Entrepreneurship/Economics/Business/Finances. I also like technology and I can create websites with HTML and CSS, code Raspberry Pi and Arduino with Python. 

ECs: 
-President of my high school entrepreneurship club for 2 years. I was its marketing director for one year before that. 
During my time there, I help about 5+ teams won national entrepreneurship competition and international competition (4th place in materials science at the ISEF). I invited alumni from Harvards, people from the Ministry of Education in my country, successful entrepreneurs to do workshops, conferences  for the students. I raised over $250 (it's a lot in my home country currency) to organize the first ever entrepreneurship competition at my high school. 
-Being accepted to the Student Advisory Board of the Diamond Challenge, which is a global entrepreneurship competition for high school students. Because of that I was featured in a Top National Magazine (I was the first in my country to be in it).
-Create  a non profit that connect people from my country with opportunities such as, scholarships, internships, works,  free courses, competitions... Reached more than 10k people on social media and our website without any aid Ads.
- create a printing company to help students within my city print their homeworks (we are living in a third world country and having a printer at your home is not common. Even tho u had it, we barely have electricity, so u won't be able to use it at any time). I had a System where the students send me the homework online, I print it for them and then deliver it tomorrow in the morning. I made like $ 5k, which is almost a million in my country currency. I even hired a student in my class to help with logistics.
- Did an internship as the Head of the project management team of the most selective and famous summer program in my country (there were AOs from MIT, Princeton as panelists) They double my salary because of my performance. I was selected one of the two interns they chose among 25+ applicants. The program was created by two students from MIT and Princeton. 
- I received an invitation to coach  a team at the second most selective summer program in my country. I was Coaching them about pitching ideas. The team I mentored won a competition they organized in the summer program. 
- Played piano at the church that I regularly go and other churches in the country since primary school. 
- Act in an international audio show. 
- Play Tennis Table (won the 2nd at a school competition and trained primary students at my school)


Awards: 
- Diamond Challenge Global Semifinalist (before being a semifinalist, I had to won in my country among 25+ finalists) it's an Entrepreneurship competition
- Leadership and Dynamism prize (Because of my work in the club) I received it from the biggest entrepreneurship firm in my country (over 10 years of experience) in front of high school counselors, ambassador of Taiwan in Haiti, Ministry of Education in Haiti and among 2000 students from 5 states. 
- National Robot Challenge winner (created a robotic solution for COVID-19) this is the only robotic challenge in my country
-  2nd Athena's Challenge Winner (it was a pitching competition organized by the biggest Insurance Company in Haiti - we had to bring a solution to an environmental problem, so we transformed plastic wastes into strong bricks designed for construction) 
- Pitch Biznis Lakay winner (it was an international competition on Club House) I donated all the money to the Entrepreneurship club of my high school.

I don't need to out the others because I have space to only list five of them.... :)

Ethnicity: Black 
Demographic: Caribbean - Haiti (Poorest country in the American continent and one of the poorest in the world) 

One of my problem is my grades
9th: 62% and top 15% - transcript given by my school
10th: 69% and top 10%- transcript given by my school
11th: 76% and top 5% - transcript given by my school
And 
12th: 1358/1900  - transcript given by the Head of Education in my country. Which is a grade of 71%

From 9th to 11th, I had to take tests from all of the 19 courses. However, in my senior year, Even tho I take all the 19 courses I only had to take official exams for some of them. 
Link to my senior year transcript: https://postimg.cc/sB5pk98g


The courses are a lot in my transcripts. Now, will AOs just look at courses related to my major or almost all of my  grades? 
These 60%+ are like D in the US, How will they affect me? 

Moreover, there are always kidnapping, homicide, gangs blocking roads and burning people in their own outside almost everyday. Sometimes I can't go to school because of these obstacles. 

By the way: I got a 120 on the Duolingo
I will take the SAT this October and I hope to get at least 1300; I had a poor 1140 the last time I took it :(. It's hard for me to answer the question quickly with no errors bc English is my third language. 

Reminder: Now, I want to study anything related to Entrepreneurship/Economics/Business/Finances. I also like technology and I can create websites with HTML and CSS, code Raspberry Pi and Arduino with Python. 

Oops: I need almost a full ride bc my EFc is 3k-5k :(



Any recommendations for schools regarding my stats  ? 


Any general ADVICES?

What are some important things to know?",bdhd656,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/x7j4zc/as_a_computer_engineering_student_unsure_of_the/,"I am 2 years away from graduating, but I'm unsure of what I want to do or specialize in. I've always liked programming and coding things. I am currently taking C++ and was into game development for a while, but I don't enjoy it like before, which made me wonder, what do I actually enjoy? It is a terrifying thought because not only do I not know, but I'm not sure how I'll start working and find a job with no training or end goal. 

I made the decision to try out software development in general, mobile application development, and web development, but I'm still unsure if I can do it while still in college, if it's a wise move, or if they are related together in any way to be listed on my resume. I applied for an internship but was unsuccessful, and I feel like I'm running out of time.

I always want to make something but either rush through it like a bull or just stay still and stress about it for some reason. I will be taking ""internet programming"" next year, however I was considering starting the process now to find a goal and build a strong portfolio rather than waiting and relying solely on the offered modules. 

I apologize if the post was going left and right, but I'm honestly unsure of my future and with my attitude of overthinking and laziness, I may regret everything later, which is why I thought this would be the perfect place for people with life experience and knowledge would maybe slap me back to reality or advise me in some way."

I really want to stay in the CS field and have SWE internship experience and have been applying actively for SWE intern roles for the summer. How much will this hurt me career wise. Can I make up for it by getting an MS in CS? Am I still a competitive candidate for SWE jobs? Since I am no longer CS+Math, I could also graduate a semester early if I wanted to unless I add a new major/minor.

Im going to talk with my advisor as well but student feedback would also help."

As a CE major, I hated all the CS classes I took as well as the ECE classes. I knew for sure that I don't want to be an engineer, but I didn't give up because CE is truly a rewarding major. Even though I absolutely hate it, and my GPA and graduation are really negatively affected by my mindset, with CE on my resume, I have had my dream companies reaching out to me and got very good internship. Despite hating my major, CE does give me nice jobs and a sense of direction in life. But still, its affecting my mental health, and I feel like I am too cheap to walk away from what I do not enjoy doing."

I have 2 options:
•Anime Club
•Business Club

Business seemed to be the right answer, but with as much as I'm doing in the business field rn (internships, working, full classes, the homework, discussions, meetings, networking assignments etc etc...) I'm drained... (I still love the field ♡ I just come home and do it, then leave and do it, then talk about it and I'm worn out)

Anime club has one of my favorite activities and when I unwind I go home and watch it. On the drive to school I listen to some music from some shows or even some plays..
I really just worry that seeing it on my rèsumè might turn some people away...? (This was advice from another business major friend) now I'm just not sure. 


My friend says It would look MUCH better if I did the business club, but I'm really afraid I'll get burnt out. 

Any advice is appreciated advice ♡"

I came into university wanting to learn more about hardware design and verification, low-level development, and to formally learn key CS concepts that I'm only familiar with through exposure and intuition.

I've realized I don't enjoy almost any of the classes I've taken, and I'm being held back from doing anything interesting by a wall of difficult prerequisites that, due to life circumstances for the past year, I've attempted and failed several times, and would be painful to complete again. I've lost most of my interest in this field, and now approach progressing in my degree as only a prerequisite for a job.

I've also discovered, through talking to other students and learning on my own, that I'm really, really interested in abstract math and its intersection with computation. I'd be really interested in many of the classes I watch my friends take on these topics, and I have a genuine, strong interest in this field.

However, I'm concerned for my job prospects if I transfer into a mathematics major. Do employers tend to hire people with degrees in math? I have around four years of internship experience and a good portfolio. I would also end up taking much more time to finish my degree, since almost none of my credits overlap with the new major. Would it be worth the tens of thousands of dollars in tuition to study what I'm interested in, or should I keep going on a path I dislike to increase job prospects?"

x7qgzs,1,2022-09-06,I feel like my family is really hard on me for my age,natamemer,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/x7qgzs/i_feel_like_my_family_is_really_hard_on_me_for_my/,"   I (19/f) am a sophomore in College and I am struggling to adjust to the way they are treating me. Last year, I lived on campus and my scholarships covered all of my housing fees, so I never had to worry about rent or anything like that. I have worked a part time job since I turned 16 and have never had any recurring bills other than a monthly car payment since August of last year. I wasn't struggling financially last year because my parents gave me $50 a week for groceries and I was able to work a lot more due to not having as many classes. 

In between my freshman and sophomore year, I had some issue with my family. I decided to make some medical decisions that my mom did not agree with. They were important to me but she considered them ""unnecessary"" so she wouldn't pay for them. Up until this point, she has paid for all of my medical things, so I was very shocked to hear this. I ended up racking about $1000 worth of debt on my credit card from those medical bills and some stupid decisions. I was working hard to chip away at that debt when I got into a bad fight with my mom and didn't talk to her for a month. At this point, she was no longer supporting me at all and I was paying for everything out of my own pocket. I worked full time over the summer and still wasn't able to get rid of the debt or save anything. I went into the new academic year with a lot of financial anxiety. 

Right now I am taking 4 high-level classes, an internship, a part-time job, and a relationship to balance, so I have a lot on my plate. This year rent is not entirely covered by my scholarships, so I was planning on splitting the scholarship money evenly and paying for the overage with my part time job, as well as my car payment. This was causing me a lot of anxiety, so I asked my parents if they would hypothetically be able to help me out at all if there was a month where I wasn't able to work as much. I didn't get much sympathy and all they told me was ""This is what being an adult is like""

   All of this is taking a toll on my mental health. They took a vacation without me because they decided they wanted me to start having some ""skin in the game"" when it came to vacations. They already knew I was having financial issue when they told me this, so obviously I couldn't go. My biggest issue I have with them right now is that it's not like they don't have money. They go on several cruises a year and spend more money on vacations than the average family. It feels like they don't care about me anymore because there was never any warning that they were going to cut me off financially until recently. If I knew ahead of time, I would have given myself a lighter schedule and saved up money over the summer, but I was under the impression they would be able to help me. I'm finding myself having a hard time not getting jealous of my friends who's parents are more lenient with money. They don't pay for everything for them, but they aren't afraid to chip in every once in a while to take some stress off of their college students back. Mine are not like this and I honestly feel like they are treating me like I'm a 25 year old who has had plenty of time to adjust to adult life. I have only had one year of being an adult and that wasn't even to the extent that I am doing now. 

TL;DR I am struggling with balancing my finances with my education, and my parents suddenly decided to not support me at all"

2. Not expecting to get a return offer from Meta until December. Other offer deadlines are way before that.

I’ve taken most gen Ed’s but I still have a lot of other requirements needed for me to graduate with a degree pushing back my original graduation year. I could probably have this not happen to me if I do summer school. With that said the problem I have is that I worry about after college. I heard a lot of CS major graduates have a hard time finding a job after college due to lack of work experience which is why unemployment is pretty high amongst cs major graduates. So the best way to avoid this and actually set yourself up for success is by having done projects and or internships. I talked with advisors and they said that I’m probably going to have to pick one or the other because both require a lot  if not all of your attention. Internships expect around 40 hours a week and summer school crams lots of information given in a regular semester timeframe down to within a short schedule. I’m honestly not sure what’s the better option. Do summer school and graduate on time with no work experience? Or graduate late but with work experience?"

* Pursuing an integrated course of Btech Computer Engineering - MBA (major business intelligence and analytics, minor finance)  from a tier 2 college (I think it's tier 2 not really sure). The BTech has an Honors associated - specialised in AI/ML in collaboration with IBM
* CGPA: 3.89/4, within the top 1-2% of the course.
* Research experience primarily in the intersection of deep learning and oncology. But open to diversifying to any healthcare or non-healthcare domain. Publications -
   * I have and continue to submit papers to IEEE Conferences hosted in colleges with a better NIRF ranking than mine  (not IIT/NIT though, didn't find any) or in my own college. I should receive a minimum of 1 and maximum of 3 acceptances in this September - November time period if everything goes well (fingers crossed, have had a lot of trouble wrt journals in the past though I had papers ready)
* GRE 319 (168Q, 151V) - The verbal here is low and creating an impediment I suppose
* Internships:
   * About 2 months at IBM in deep learning and a little but of front end design+databases
   * About 2 months in the RnD wing of Tech Mahindra, again AI-centric, mix of robotics and deep learning
   * About 2 months as an analyst at a British Multinational Bank (work involved excel, proper coding using VBA- pretty logic heavy too given that VBA isn't that robust itself, and analysis of financial trends)
   * About 3 months at a startup - mix of digital marketing and project management. (May also include some analyst work- trying to see if I can get the chance)
* Projects: I do have a bunch of small mini projects and 1/2 major ones but they would need solidification.
* Extracurriculars during the degree:
   * Was in the student chapter of a social entrepreneurship-based global non-profit for about 4 years. Held leadership positions for about 2.5/4 years.
   * Was also a board of director of entrepreneurship at a Rotaract club

I was really keen on MS CS in places like CMU (too ambitious I know), Columbia,UIUC, UMich Ann Arbor etc amongst the top ones. Any advice on safe, moderates of armbitious? In addition any advice on how I should play to my strengths in my SOP


Edit: I'm not applying to MSBA anymore"
x7toev,2,2022-09-06,Math major--to self-teach or not to self-teach?,Grammarnazi_bot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/x7toev/math_majorto_selfteach_or_not_to_selfteach/,"Hey best coding friends. Long story short, I am studying math and will graduate in 2 years. My goal is to... big shock! Work at a FAANG company as a SWE because the job is cozy and pays *very* well.

I'm at an impasse. I don't know if I should go the path of the MS CS for job opps or just teach myself.

I know you guys talk a lot about how self-teaching is all you need, and that yes, although I'm not a CS major, I'm a math major, which is the second best thing. Full stop, I'm terrible at networking (it's why I switched from business), and I'm pretty sure that's the crux of getting a good job as a self-taught programmer. Moreover, I've never had an internship because I just switched to math and I dogged my business interviews (plus I don't think I could teach myself enough on OSSU over the next year to get myself an internship), so my resume isn't exactly competitive to begin with.

Now with the job market being the way it is in SWE, is it really still advisable to go the route of self-teaching? I'm aware upper-level CS programs are extremely theoretical and will teach you more theory than anything, but I'd be doing it for the job opportunities and network I'd get moreso than the subject matter of the program, hence why I'd be targeting top MS CS programs. The issue with that though is that I'm delaying my education by 2 years and I'd likely have to take out lots in loans. 

I know the old adage--grind leetcode until your eyes bleed. But isn't there more to this? Is it worth being able to solve every leetcode problem with your eyes closed if the bot that scans apps at GoogMetAppleFlix won't even look at you?

If your advice is to switch my major to CS / add a CS major, I cannot do that because my school is extremely stringent with who they allow to major in CS. Trust me, I tried."

I was an intern at a very large tech company doing work in electrical engineering. I need 3 letters of rec for grad school: 1 will come from my PI, another will come from a professor, and 1 *should* come from my manager who has a 30+ year career in industry. 

My manager absolutely loved me. He always said how I was the ""best intern"" and I always received nothing but praise from him and other managers at the company.

He sent me the letter he wrote, and it was very positive. However, it was terrible. It was only 170 words, had some grammar mistakes, and was overall quite vague and unhelpful. There were no particular examples of why I was a good intern or why I would succeed in graduate school. 

He obviously wrote it very quickly and I don't think it was his intention to write it in such a way. Should I ask him to re-write it? What kinds of things should I include? Here is what I have so far (not verbatim what I will say, but just bullet points):

- Tell the reader who you are, why you are qualified to write this letter, and a bit about your background
- How did I specifically make a positive impact on the team?
- What is an example of me having ""curiosity and drive to seek and acquire new skills"" (specific words from the original letter)
- What specifically makes me stand out compared to other employees you've had?
- Why do you think I would be successful in a graduate program?

How should I go about asking him for a re-write? I don't want to be disrespectful to his original work. 

Thanks!"

I’m also stuck in tutorial hell because I don’t feel like my skills are good enough to start applying for internships or entry level jobs.

x7zju4,14,2022-09-07,Looking for advice on my first data pipeline,Ambitious-Survey3340,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/x7zju4/looking_for_advice_on_my_first_data_pipeline/,"Hello everyone! I have recently started my first data engineering internship, and I have been tasked with creating a data pipeline. Essentially I have made a web scraper that will be pulling unstructured (JSON) data from a site in batches, and I would ideally like to clean, partition and transform the data into a SQL Table for analysis. The data consists of nested JSON objects which each represent a different category, some of those categories can be easily converted into structured data, while others would have to remain unstructured (due to their inconsistent schema from source). To solve for this I have decided to create an ingestion pipeline that would transform data over three stages and ultimately partition them based on their categories and store in an S3 bucket. From there I will have one more Lambda function that will insert the structured categories into a relational cloud database. I have created a visual pipeline for reference. My problem that I am facing is that each data point being extracted from the source comes with a unique ID that I would like to immediately store, and represent in a database so that my web scraper can check if it has already been gathered and transformed for use. My current solution to this problem is have my lambda function iterate through each json object and store the id into the relationship database, but I am really not sure if this is the most appropriate course of action. I understand this is a lot of information but any advice would be appreciate. PS: Please do not hesitate to comment on other aspects as I would like as much feedback as possible. Thank you very much :).

Is it even possible for me to get there?,Zestyclose_Excuse785,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/x806ri/can_i_get_into_medicalmolecular_research_with/,"(I know this is a very long post, sorry\~ For those of you who will read the whole thing, thank you very much!) 

Hey! I am incredibly fascinated by molecular biology, especially when applied to medical research. This year I'm graduating from my bachelors degree in life science. My bachelor was very much oriented towards medical research and I chose to specialize in biomolecular research specifically. I have been doing an internship at a university where I worked in plant sciences. I chose this internship because I am interested in plants as well and I thought it would be something I would enjoy doing as a career. But I also chose this internship because it was hard to get one during that time due to COVID, which is why I took this opportunity before it would be too late. It turned out that my internship contained very little molecular work and mostly tissue culture / microscopy. 

Halfway through the internship I began to feel very discontent. I miss molecular research immensely. The kind of work that I do now is definitely interesting, but it doesn't give me this spark of enthusiasm and it just feels as if I'm slowly becoming less and less energetic. It's very draining, it has been going on for a while, and it feels like I've reached some kind of low point in my optimism. 

Some of my friends were interns at super cool cancer institutes, and I visited them a few times. Everytime I was there I felt a great affinity towards the kind of work that they do (to the point where some envy got to me). They were also working with all kinds of super cool equipment and techniques and the overal work they did got me very excited; I had major sparks of enthusiasm\~ So that's a plus, because I really know what I want to do now!

My worries are that it will be very hard to return to medical / molecular research, since I gained a  years' worth of experience in something that I don't really want to do anymore which isn't really compatible with what I actually want to do (aside from the research aspect). I'm reasoning that, because of my lack of experience in the medical field, it'll be next to impossible to do what I'm passionate about. I mean, I have enjoyed a bachelors degree in biomolecular sciences, and it looks like I'll be graduating cum laude, but without experience it feels as if my chances are slim. 

Luckily, I've already found a job where I can start after I graduate, which is no longer in plant sciences but back into the medical field. Thing is, it isn't research; I would be sequencing DNA from patients with cancer to identify the type of tumor cells which can then be used to figure out what treatment might work best. I'm happy that I've been able to come back to biomolecular work, but I'm not quite there yet. I still want to do research, whilst the job I found now would be mostly diagnostics. 

Basically, I'm trying to slowly but surely wriggle my way back to medical research and I was wondering if anyone can give me some advice on how to achieve this. There are a couple of ideas I have myself:

*  In my free time I now spend a lot of time to learn about molecular biology and I make little assignments to practise experimental design / cloning strategies. These are projects I write in an online labjournal called Benchling. Making a fusion protein from scratch, designing a construct for a gene knockout using CRISPR/Cas9, golden gate cloning and lentiviral transduction (among other transfection methods) are examples of projects I'm currently doing. I then work out the entire proces that will be done on the lab, so I'm basically ""preparing"" as if I'll actually be doing them. I actually really like doing this, so it doesn't feel like a ""I have to do this""- kind of thing. I hope that little projects like these are adequate enough to sort of proof both my enthusiasm and ability to still do molecular work (even though these projects will never be able to give me practical ""wet"" lab experience).
* There are these science events held by research fascilities that I'm interested in and I think that attending them might be a nice way to show that I exist. Kind of a networking thing I like to try. 
* If it turns out that I just can't become a research technician with what I have now, I can always resort to doing another voluntary internship at an institute that does match my interests. Or I can even get a masters degree where I have 2 more years to orient myself to medical research in a learning environment. This way, I can gain more experience in practise, which is my main issue I think. But I prefer to first try to get into molecular research without an additional internship ir a masters degree. It's kind of like a last resort to me, but I'm very much open for it if it's the only option

I'm really set on getting back to molecular/medical research, so I'm really open to any sugggestions you guys have! And if it isn't possible, at least I know that I've tried everything I could. I think, in the end, I just wanna know that I actually tried my best. 

Again, those of you who read the whole thing, thank you very much!"
x81n46,2,2022-09-07,How does work experience factor in grad admissions?,Zestyclose_Site7105,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/x81n46/how_does_work_experience_factor_in_grad_admissions/,"As someone who graduated from a CS program with a low gpa (7/10), I've been wondering if my work experience can help increase my chances to get into grad school. 

During my undergrad, the only thing I was focused on was getting a job after college. Parental pressure and financial stress may have contributed significantly to this goal and I pretty much spent all my time doing online courses (20+), building personal projects ( recommendation systems, natural language processing chatbots, visualising path finding algorithms in Unity3D, a web based IDE that helps build, deploy and monitor machine learning/data processing pipelines) and leetcode. Lots and lots of leetcode.

While these helped me land decent internships ( academic internship at a global top 15 University, an internship at one of the largest aircraft manufacturing companies) and jobs ( TA at the university I interned at, a year at a travel tech firm as a software engineer and am currently working at a well known investment bank as a software engineer), I don't really know how much this experience can help me offset my low gpa.

While I don't regret any of the time and effort I put into all these projects, internships and jobs because they helped my family and I become more financially secure (enough to now afford to go to grad school), I understand that I should also have prioritised my GPA.

My undergrad GPA is now set in stone and there's not much I can do to change it. I've since been working on writing research papers in my own time after work ( one's been accepted already and is due to be published this month and am about to finish writing another one).

Will these factors help increase my admission chances or at the very least help make a good case for why my gpa is abysmally low?"

GRE: 335/340, 4.5 in AWA

TOEFL: Yet to take  

Internships: 2 months in a renowned investment bank, 6 months in another company (to begin coming spring i.e. after most application deadlines)  

LOR: 2 from professors, 1 from a VP of said investment bank  

Publications: No publications yet, but one paper expected to be submitted at a conference by Dec '22  

Projects: One major ML project, many minor projects related to webdev and data analytics  

Others:   
Completed 3 Coursera Webdev courses from Goldsmith University, London  
TA for webdev for one semester  
Will get a specialization certificate from college in ""Data science and machine learning""  

I have been looking for terminal MS CS/ML/DS programs at the following colleges, which I think are ambitious:  
Georgia Tech (ambitious)  
UCSD (ambitious)  
UCLA (ambitious)  
Purdue (ambitious)  
UC Berkeley (ambitious)  
UCIC (ambitious)  
NCSU (maybe medium)  
Northeastern University (maybe medium)  

I would love to get some advice about whether any college mentioned here is not well suited or too ambitious or whether there is any other ambitious college I should look into, since I will only be applying to 3-4 ambitious colleges. Any advice on medium and safe colleges is much appreciated, as I am hoping for 3 medium and 3 safe colleges as well, but I'm afraid I seem to constantly underestimate or overestimate my profile.

x85jd2,172,2022-09-07,Adopted By Humans II C11,endersgame69,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/x85jd2/adopted_by_humans_ii_c11/,"[Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/x7urau/adopted_by_humans_ii_c10/) || [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/x9xlrd/adopted_by_humans_ii_c12/)

It would be fair to say, with a long time looking back on that night, that I covered myself completely with the covers not because I didn’t want to chance Fauve coming down and realizing I was awake, thus forcing me to talk.  That was very unlikely, since the failed human’s incarceration and the string of legal actions against his flying monkeys she’d returned to much of her online world.

She was herself again, and I was glad about that, but of course as a consequence her night owl habit returned and she would likely only inform her parents on her way to her room.

Which meant the true reason I was hidden beneath the covers was that I didn’t want to face what was outside of them, even if that consequence was lightyears away on world so far distant that the light of it’s star would not kiss the ground of Earth until even the youngest of the Walker family had died of old age or nearly.  *‘Here they used to call it ‘the loneliest planet’ and I never really knew what they meant by that until I had to fear leaving this one.’*

That was my thinking when I woke up in the morning, I moved like a ghost out human stories, going through the motions of preparing for my day while I mentally prepared myself for everything I would have to cope with.  The ambassador hadn’t told me when the freighter would arrive, but if dlamisa are anything, we’re efficient, and our ships are somewhat faster than those of humans.  It wouldn’t be long.  Days, maybe weeks depending on how far away they were.  I knew that the pulpultion technology combined with our gate technology would have widespread applications… much as the scientists at University howled about the need for urgent implementation, how could I not know that?

But it also hadn’t yet been combined.  Which meant with only the gate tech if the freighter was far away then they would be faced with as much as two months travel if they both followed the usual trade lines, which they would, and were a fair distance from us.

That bought me time to come up with what I needed, a study, some kind of study that would convince the academic boards on the planet humans referred to as ‘Tomass’, that I was an asset here despite the indiscretions.

But I was in no shape for that at just that moment.  I was leaning up against the shower wall while hot water pounded through my fur to wash away something of the smell… and because I’d heard that humans sometimes use hot showers to treat hangovers.  I touched my right hand to my head, it felt like I was being smacked there by Zenti cannon fire.

“I’ll never drink again.”  I muttered under my breath and stuck my face into the many little jetstreams of water. I was briefly blinded by the spray, but even if it didn’t help my hangover, it did make me feel a little more awake.

Drying myself off took the expected amount of time, multiplied by the number of shots that I had.  Suffice it to say it took some time to get ready to join everybody upstairs.  As I expected I would be very busy today, I chose to use one of the clothing sets the Walkers provided to me with my room, a pair of simple jean shorts and a button down shirt embroidered with the University of Louisville name and logo.

The only thing that really caused me to move any faster than a trudge up the stairs was that I could smell bacon and coffee.  While the diets of each Earth region differed considerably, perhaps because it was my first impression, or perhaps it was attached to the people themselves, I loved their breakfasts best.

The bacon was crispy, my nose told me that much, and I could hear Rebecca talking while she opened the oven.  I could hear Michael babbling nonsense in his chair as he tried to master human words.

I noticed that he smiled a lot at me, and as I settled into life with the Walkers, I regularly sat beside him, he seemed to like the black and orangish fur a great deal.  His head was a little oversized relative to the rest of his body, leaving him unbalanced, and on occasion I’d taken to watching over him.  It was for this reason that Rebecca said, “Could you mind Michael for a little, just let him play with you for a few minutes while I get the biscuits done and everything plated?”

Rebecca was clearly where Fauve got her sense of order, everything had to be *just so* for her, and in this case that meant that breakfast was not a free for all, she would plate out the first serving, providing a practical measure to each person.  After that, she ignored all second helpings.

Strangely, she’d never asked me to do this during breakfast before.  I wanted to take a look, but as soon as I got up and tried to look at what she was doing, she put her back to the food and motioned away with her hands.

“Shoo, shoo.  Out of the kitchen, go play for a bit, you’ll see what I’ve made, soon enough.”  She insisted.

“Alright, if you like.”  I answered and picked Michael up.  This was a task I had to handle with care as human infants are shockingly delicate creatures.  William once explained to me that for the first few years of their life, your job as a parent can be summed up as, ‘Just keep them alive.’  I found it difficult to disagree with his assessment.

Carrying Michael in one arm was as easy as it was hard.  It was ‘easy’ in the sense that he weighed very little, but it was ‘hard’ in that he was a wiggly little creature who was also prone to tugging at my fur when being carried.

Wrangling him properly to the point where he would let go… well I can sum that up by saying that he left me with a few little bald spots on my fur on more than one occasion.

I spread out a small blanket over the hardwood floor, it was only three or four paces across for me in either direction, but it was enough room for him to play on.

I had to be grateful to my Teacher for his advice, it made me look at the tiny wiggling specimen with a more critical eye instead of just amusing myself, and it made me more conscious about my own responses as well.  Studying ‘how’ other races respond to this particularly dangerous predatory species at all stages of life was, in my mind, absolutely vital.

Given the affection I have when I speak of them, it is jarring I’m sure to also hear me speak of their dangerous nature, but this is part of what sets them apart from so many others.

This difference begins in infancy.  Michael was at an age when he was mobile, but still needed intensive care. He couldn’t say much, but I could see in his eyes the way he absorbed everything around him.  Perhaps it was that which made our little game possible.

I began circling the outside of the blanket while he toddled around on it, coming after me, only for me to dodge by jumping from one side or the other, or even jumping over him.

His little hands flailed and little pudgy fingers grasped, but keeping just out of reach was still not at all difficult.  However I must add that this ‘active play’ in species around the known galaxy is exceptionally rare.  It is found only in apex predators or in prey that specializes in survival via retreat.

Equally noteworthy, he just didn’t stop.  Young Michael continued to chase me around the blanket, giggling all the while… and going after my tail.  The way he giggled and stared was almost enchanting, he reminded me of that Maxili species who also create large headed young.  Incidentally, as of the time of this writing, the survival rate of their young has gone from ten percent to closer to ninety percent in areas where human pioneers have settled.  It seems the pioneer women have turned gaxa serpent hunting into rite of passage.  No woman may guard or bear children until she has proven her ability to protect them by exterminating a gaxa nest.  It seems the timid race took Professor Sxlith’s words to heart and human females have become the most treasured allies of that once unfortunate world.  Yes, I do keep an eye on my professor’s research… I suppose in human terms I could sometimes be called a ‘teacher’s pet’.  But I genuinely revered his research and contributions to our collective future.

As for Michael, his tireless motion led me to study human bodies more, and I learned that from his age through toddlerhood he could be expected to move a minimum of roughly three hours per *day*.  Astonishingly, it was conceivable for him to move much, much more when spread out into sessions.

It was no wonder that he eventually caught my tail… and gave it a good yank.  I jumped a meter into the air and whirled around to see him giggling and holding some of my fur in his hands, sitting down with a thud and waving his tiny fist around in triumph.

“Bailey!  Fauve!  William!  Byron!  Boatswain!  George!  Cullan!  Breakfast!”  Rebecca was not a very large woman, if anything she could be described as rather petite by human norms, but she had a powerful set of lungs and was not afraid to use them.  You may have noticed two additional names, ‘George’ and ‘Cullan’ on the list of those called out.  George was Byron’s human comrade, one of the two Earth guards set to mind the house, while ‘Cullan’ was the dlamisa counterpart.  I barely knew either of them, though both were giants of their respective kinds.  Not unlike Byron and Boatswain, and both were quiet sorts and rotated shifts regularly with their colleagues.

However at breakfast, all four were sure to be present as it was when the shifts would change over.  Of course I had to wonder about my professor and my colleagues, but as the door opened and the stampede of behemoths rushed in, I was not going to miss out on the plating.  So I scooped up Michael and raced to my spot at the table just in time for Fauve to descend and to see her go straight for the coffee pot.

I felt William’s eyes on me, and then as Rebecca began to set plates down at spot after spot, I felt hers bore into me in turn.  The question didn’t need to be spoken.

I darted my eyes away from husband and wife and toward their daughter, Fauve was already chattering away while she added creamer to her steaming cup.  “...So the internship pays twenty-percent above market rate, plus when I turn sixteen Teresa says that if I’m still there I’ll get to travel with her as her personal assistant!  If I stay till eighteen I’ll get a full time job *and* college credit!”

Her enthusiasm was so high that she was bouncing up and down on the balls of her feet. A tiny bit of hot coffee spilled out and landed on the counter, but either she didn’t see it, or she ignored it.  “I can’t wait to start!”

With her beaming bright smile, flushed red cheeks and bouncy demeanor, I couldn’t bring up something like that.  I didn’t meet the eyes of either the patriarch or matriarch of the Walker household.  It was answer enough for them, I wouldn’t be telling anyone anything today.

Instead I said, “Great, I got a job too!  I don’t know what I look forward to it!”  I covered my own sense of dread with a wagging tail that wasn’t entirely faked, and I was at least sure that even if I hadn’t fooled *myself* with some of that enthusiasm, I had entirely fooled Fauve.

The trouble would have to wait.

For now, I just wanted her to be happy.  Now, just as then, I hope I made the right choice.

The title is a bit dramatic maybe but, I just got yelled at (and hung up on) for the second time about a scheduled vacation I took for Labor Day. They’re upset that they couldn’t reach me and I wouldn’t do any work during that time. 

There’s a deadline today and nothing’s done. I feel a bit bad but I won’t apologize for not working on a holiday. 

I’m probably going to get fired since this is a nonunion job in a right-to-work state. I’m basically an Intern and people would still “kill for my job” so I’m replaceable. 

It’s a bummer since I’m working closely with high ranking people in my industry. I feel like I’m throwing away my chance if I lose this job. But, tbh, these are some of the worst people I’ve ever worked for. They make my position extremely difficult. 

I don’t know what to do from here…. do I quit before they fire me? Your name is everything in my industry so, in a way, quitting looks better than getting fired. On the other hand, I’m not a wealthy person, I can’t afford to be out of work for very long. Should I wait until they fire me?

x88m5y,4,2022-09-07,Why does it take me so long to adapt to a new environment?,TheHealerWriter,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/x88m5y/why_does_it_take_me_so_long_to_adapt_to_a_new/,"Hi everyone, 

So I've noticed something about myself, and it's that I tend to take at least a year to adapt to any major change in my life. For example, in my first year of high school I underachieved and joined no clubs, was a sullen mess whose parents were disappointed in. But I buckled up in the summer and joined a bunch of clubs and extracurriculars next year. Joined band, got a solo, ran for track, did volunteer work, got my G1 license. And when high school ended, I felt as though I succeeded because I got a bunch of offers from most of my universities of choice. 

But then the pandemic hit and at the same time i also started university. I was flustered by the changes and for the first two years completely let myself go. Gained 80 pounds, literally ended up in the hospital for suicidal thoughts, had anger issues, was too afraid of rejection to apply for a job or any position on campus. Spent most of my time escaping into video games for the first two years. Luckily, I still gained some volunteer experience, and had part time job working for my parents. However, I always wanted to face my fears and actually earn a job by acing the application, yet I was too afraid. 

Fast forward to now when I'm at the end of the summer going into my junior year at university, and I'm in a much better place. I took the step to acclimate my fear of job rejections by first applying for a volunteer position at a hospital, which was easier to get in. It was daunting, there were so many checks, interviews, references, and i had to submit a resume --- but i took the leap and actually got accepted. That acceptance helped me to practice overcoming my fear of rejection in a less daunting setting. And now, I'm ready to take the next leap and apply for paid jobs --- bracing myself to be unflinching in the face of rejections, no matter how many. I also began taking my future seriously and have plans to study for a certain profession which I prefer to keep private. Started doing fun physical activites to get fit again. Hobby wise things have improved too --- I picked up writing which was my rock in a hard place. I try to sharpen my skill in it and use it to make a difference. 

The point is that there is a pattern in how I adapt to change. I ALWAYS adapt, and I always overcome anything life throws at me. Problem is, it takes 1-2 years for me to adapt to anything, even normal life changes like high school / college, and in those years I literally completely spiral and are either depressed or suicidal and feeling completely defeated. I take longer than literally every one of my friends to acclimate to change and excel ---&gt; they excel right away --&gt; get internships in their freshman year or stellar extracurriculars in their first year of high school. Why does it take me so long to adapt, even though I always adapt eventually? And am I resilient for being able to overcome everything, or am I weak for taking too long to do so?"
x88m6l,2,2022-09-07,Internship or MS degree in CS,Nerfsquad501,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/x88m6l/internship_or_ms_degree_in_cs/," Here's a little backstory:

I am a second-year CS student at a pretty average state school (UCF). I currently have a 5-year scholarship that covers 100% of my tuition and fees, and my university offers an accelerated BS-to-MS program that I intended on doing since I was able to complete my AA degree in high school, which basically cut my degree in half. However, I was super lucky to land an internship at a company I really wanted to work with, and I start next week. The only problem is that my internship is basically a part-time job till I graduate, and is full-time in the summers. Again, I really love the company and the environment. The company has told me multiple times that they like to have their interns work with them and train them for that long, so they can bring them on full time once they graduate (I checked, and almost all their previous interns either now work for the company, or have moved on to work at much larger tech companies).

Now the problem is, that if I wanted to complete my Master's, I would need to take a full course load every single semester till I graduate (Including 3-4 classes in the summer). This doesn't leave me with much time for internships, and I would not be able to balance a full-time internship in the summer and complete the courses needed to graduate with it. If I do drop all my classes in the summer, do the internship, and just graduate with my BS, I will basically be adding another 1 or 2 semesters to my graduation. Which isn't that big of a deal since I was graduating a year early anyway. So basically, I am wondering if the MS would be worth it, or if I should just stick with the internship and the experience.

Thanks in advance!"

x89e6s,51,2022-09-07,Suggestions for 30yo Senior GIS Analyst towards Computer Science,hoser_below,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/x89e6s/suggestions_for_30yo_senior_gis_analyst_towards/,"After years of professional work, I would recommend any undergrad with an interest in GIS to major in computer science and minor or certify in GIS. 

I can't go back, but I would still like to make CS a driving aspect of my career. I haven't used ARC in years and need more than the knowledge to write ArcPy scripts for specific tasks. I know this question probably comes up everyday here. 

Some people recommended a course from MIT that I will look into. It's impossible to justify an undergrad style CS education, though that's essentially what I'm looking for, just with a Master's tag. Self-paced online courses haven't worked for me, the more accountability, the more immersive the environment the better. Most of what I am finding in programs is buzzwords; Data Analytics, Data Visualization, Full Stack, Web Development, and most GIS masters I have seen or had peers take are 80% fluff. Any suggestions or similar experience will be really appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

More info beyond the question:

I graduated from CU Boulder in Geography in '17, knowing only and all things ARC. Found a job a few months out of school with a company outside the ESRI ecosystem. We used a variety of software to compensate, MapInfo, Global Mapper, and some proprietary programs. 

Python for ARC was far and away my favorite course in undergrad. I excelled and went right into an internship for a PHD I had worked with. Having that alone on my resume helped me land my job. The education paid off in a way, and in two years I was a senior analyst. Out of interest, I managed to learn MapBasic (the ArcPy of MapInfo, though limited), and develop some in house tools that sped up workflow or replaced third party methods. Coding and development like that is my favorite kind of work, the issue is it's not my job. When it comes to, I am responsible for managing others and getting projects out the door. I can allow myself time here and there to play with code, but in reality my proficiency is rotting away. 

And just a word to anyone starting their career. Software is easy, it can be learned on the job. Don't find yourself sucked into anything like the ESRI ecosystem with the inability to adapt. Understand the fundamental concepts, not the step by step of any lab work. Learn how to create test datasets, run experiments, see what happens, develop methods. A little knowledge and the will to innovate, put that on your resume."

I am really confused about where to study for my undergraduate degree. I want to pursue computer science and probably a specialization in artificial intelligence. I can pay full tuition but it is still a huge expense for me, that is why I want to be sure.

My doubt exists between 2 countries, the US and Australia. For Australia, I have heard that UNSW is the best choice despite its trimester system. And for the United States is common to apply to many colleges so I probably end up in a mid-tier college, but decent in cs.

I have some doubts that I wanted to ask about university experience and job prospects considering I'm international with no relatives in Australia.

1. Internships are an important factor when applying for first jobs in cs, I have heard that getting internships as an international student at UNSW is really difficult for residency issues. Is that bad?
2. Similar to internships I read that getting jobs as an international student is difficult for residency status. How hard is to get citizenship, considering I will study for 4 years at UNSW? I thought that was a plus for Australia against USA.
3. About the UNSW academics, What do you think about the material, professors, and workload? Compared to US universities.
4. Unlike American colleges, I'm aware that UNSW is a commuter school and I will probably live in UNSW dorms. How does that affect social life?

I know that the most important reason should be where I want to end up living. Australia is probably a better country, but I want to make sure I would succeed compared to the US's better tech industry."

I've posted here once before and was welcomed with wonderful and thoughtful advice. I posted at the lowest point in my life during my Mech Eng Degree and reading the replies helped a lot.

My first 3 years was a mess. I couldn't figure out how to properly adapt and create and environment that would help me study. The hardest part was figuring out how to do so.  I believe everyone can pass and even excel at the courses. It's mostly about how you go about learning. So make sure that you always try to make learning easier. It could be something as simple as studying in a library instead of on your desk at home or buying tools like an Ipad to help take better notes.

After realizing what kind of environment I can strive in, the final year became much simpler. I even passed 7 papers in a semester with B's and A's. It was tough but I knew I could do it after learning from my past mistakes. 

As for my Internship, most of the knowledge in the degree helps to give context to your work. I'm interning as an Maintenance engineer in Samsung SDI. Most of the knowledge needed revolves around understanding mechanical parts and knowing how to design and fix the machines. But the most important part again is how you adapt and judge the environment. You might not do well in your first job but you also might do great somewhere else. Failure is a part of it. Don't be afraid or be let down by your failures. Work is mostly about critical thinking and problem solving. Sell yourself in interviews by telling them how you approach to solve a problem. Expertise comes from experience so as a fresh grad, don't be too intimidated.

I wanna state that I'm sharing my experiences for the past 4 years to let people know that what you're going through is just a part of the process. Grieving about your degree is a part of the process and all the negative feelings are all valid as long as you try your best to overcome it. To everyone still learning engineering, keep it up and don't lose hope.

I know that my GRE score isn't that great but I neither have the time nor money to retake it. There are a few colleges above that I am going to apply to without GRE so I think I will be fine. I'm not too sure tho.

I also want to know how useful it would be to write about your extracurriculars in your Graduate SOP. I've heard it counts a great deal for undergraduate programs but I'm not sure about graduate college. I play an instrument and have learnt music for many years. None of my extracurriculars is directly related to the field I am applying to. Any advice on this would be welcome as well.

Thank you for taking the time to read this long post.

Any help would be appreciated."
x8vw67,2,2022-09-08,Should I go to a trip in a foreign country with my new boss?,belgianskeleton,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/x8vw67/should_i_go_to_a_trip_in_a_foreign_country_with/,"TLDR ; My boss is looking for another person to come with him on a business trip in a foreign country. It would be a great opportunity for me and the other female employees seem not to be wary of him but i’m scared to go with an older man alone in a foreign country.


Okay guys hear me out. I’m a 22 yo F and I just started this new job as a paid intern in a non profit organisation. I won’t be too specific about what this organisation works on but let’s say it wants to raise awareness on diseases affecting a specific organ. It is recognised by my country, it has partnerships with other associations and research groups, so it is normally not shady. I got the internship there thanks to my roommate, a good friend of mine, that also works there.

My boss has a pretty important place in this organisation. He is a retired university teacher, and seems to be well liked by the staff who is in majority women. He seems nice and playful. 
Yesterday I had my first work meeting with them, and the subject switched to the travels they do for the organisation, basically they travel to different countries to expand their network and to go to conferences. The thing is, this year they are planning to go to this european country in a very beautiful location.My boss is going there and is looking for a second person to come with him because apparently we would lose funds that we receive from some governmental institution if he goes alones (i have absolutely no idea how my country works guys but this is a thing in a lot of workplaces i know). So basically we have to spend a certain amount of money to receive funds.

We are a very small team, and it so happens that all the other people can’t go because it’s during one of the busiest time of the year. I could go if i took the necessary arrangements. The thing is : i’m scared guys. It would be my first time traveling with like an almost complete stranger, who happens to be an older man. I have traveled alone before and it was fine but traveling with my boss in a foreign country is scary to me i guess. 

I talked to the previous intern (who is currently still working in the organisation, also a young woman) and she encouraged me to go, since she went with him last year on a similar trip to the same country and she had fun and had to opportunity to expand her network.

I guess this kind of opportunity would be amazing for me too for my future career, i’m just a bit weirded out but the prospect of traveling with my boss haha. 

What do you guys think? Should i go? Or do you think there is something shady i’m not seeing?

EDIT : Little update : I told my boss that I’m coming with him! We had more occasions to talk since then and he reminds me so much of my grandpa, a bit goofy but so wise! It was some silly anxiety that I had but you never know in the world we live today! I’m always on my guard because I’m always paranoid about kidnappings, sex trafficking, especially in a country i’m not familiar with. Thanks to the kind people who took the time to read and to comment my post:)"

The problem is I feel like I know absolutely nothing and would be *useless* in an internship. 

Most of my first year was filled with compulsory general engineering (mechanics, electricity, engineering business) and general education courses. Only 2 out of the 12 courses I took were to do with computer science.

My CV is absolutely bare. I have no projects, work experience, and didn't do anything remarkable in high school. 

I have no knowledge of finance/trading either.

Should I even be applying for internships? I feel like I wont be able to land anything relevant, so I am better off self studying topics in statistics and data science on Coursera than looking for one, but would like a 2nd opinion."

I'm looking to get some advice on how best to go from my current situation (zero experience and skills in data engineering) to getting a junior position as a data engineer. I've been doing my best to understand the industry/job, and would like to take the leap as it seems that data engineering is 1. in high demand, 2. growing quickly, 3. sounds like a challenging and interesting job and 4. is better paid than almost every other computer science field.

I have a computer science degree and a modest amount of professional experience in front end web development and game development, but zero experience/skills in backend and data engineering. I'm not entirely hopeless with backend and data engineering as i learnt a bit during my degree, but i figure i should just start from scratch. So where to start? Are there any good Udemy or online courses i should do? Are there any certificates or extra qualifications i should get?

I'm currently working full time as web developer and have 2 children to feed, so internships and unpaid work is probably not possible for me. I think i can manage to dedicate 10-15 hours a week to purpose of getting skilled up for a data engineering role.

What would you guys do in my position?"

Hi there,

i'm a Computer Science student and i'm going to graduate in November and i still have no relevant experience in the working as a developer aside university projects and two months of internship. I live in Italy and i recived an offer from two companys , both as a backand developer and i cant make my mind on which i should accept. For Italy standards, those offers are both very good as a -almost- new grad.

Company A is a big german IT company that works mainly in the bank and insurance field. They give me 24.5k gross per year, plus some bonus and ticket restaurant. It has the possibility to do remote working almost all the week. I think this should be the better quality of life experience.

Company B is a small sized IT consulting company but the company where i will work be one of the Fortune 500. They should give me more than the Company A (they didn't tell me exactly how much more) but the company is based in Milan so the city is very expensive and i dont know if it's worth it. I also have to possibility to do some days in remote working.

Do you have some advice to give me? Is it worth to work for a Fortune 500 even tough i would be hired from a consulting company?"

I graduated a year ago with an IT degree and have been looking for employment within the field. But I’ve had a tough time of it. I got a temp job at a place with the intention of promoting, but I’ve not seen any on my level and starting to worry that they may not come. There’s not a whole lot of entry-level opportunities where I’m at, mostly high-level stuff, and what I find usually gets snatched up by someone else. I hardly ever get an opportunity to find out why I was passed over. I’d look into remote work, but I live in an area with no internet providers aside from my mobile network, and I anticipate that I’d need a dedicated hotspot for any full-time job I’d be doing, setting me back quite a bit in funds which aren’t too plentiful right now.

And my qualifications aren’t half bad. I was summa cum laude, was awarded and worked an internship through the college. My current job isn’t exactly IT, but technically involves data input and database management, so I suppose it’s useful in some contexts. Even followed steps like using LinkedIn to establish a portfolio. My resume and cover letter-writing skills aren’t fantastic, for sure, but they definitely aren’t abysmal.

So what I’m trying to get at here is… what should I do? Prime option right now seems to be “bite the bullet, get a hotspot and work from home,” but I genuinely don’t know at this point. Any advice is greatly, greatly appreciated."

This made me very confused since the requirement does not say I must have verification experience. Perhaps, I misunderstood the requirements.

In my resume, I listed out coursework I have taken in digital system design and that class projects which is the only class my university offer for sophomore. I then asked him some questions about his team, his role, and daily task a verification intern will do, then he gave me very short answers. I guessed that he was not interested in me, and I understand that I am not good enough, so I just moved on. 

I am wondering how I can learn hardware verification on my own, how can I build my resume for the job, and how to find that job. If possible, would you mind sharing your experience find verification internship and your background when you applied.

Well, how does one get experience in this field if you won't actually hire? The answer most people seem to share are things like internships or work studies. The problem is that is only a valid option if you are still a student. Once you have adult bills taking some unpaid, or extremely low paid, internship to build experience isn't valid anymore. Can't pay rent with job experience sadly.

I am 33 years old with 8 years of IT experience under my belt. I have grown so tired of working in IT and been trying to branch out into another field but every time I start looking at jobs to see what things I would need to learn to qualify it's always the same thing: 2-3 years experience + certs + degree in that field. It seriously seems that these days you have to pick a career from college and stick with it or you are fucked. What exactly are we expected to do? Just stick with the same shit jobs we got out of college until we die? Live in a cardboard box while working some unpaid internship just to get the experience needed to start getting paid? It's just ridiculous...  


EDIT: Appreciate all the comments. Seems to be a bit of a consensus that the requirements on these job posts might not be as strict as they come across on paper. Here's hoping that online courses/certs will be enough in the future! "

I have worked and had internships at hospitals before but this is my last one before I can get my diploma. So it's my 3rd day at my new internship and I am standing in the hallway typing on my computer searching up some information about my patients etcetera. My male coworker walks by (he's at the very least 20-30 years older then me I think he's around the ages of 40-50 but I'm not sure) and he puts his hand on my shoulder while he walks past. I didn't say anything cause I didn't think it was that strange.

The same day he walks by again while I am in the hallway on my computer and he presses his finger in my side (like the spot between your ribs and hipbone) to try to tickle me or something I don't even know bro and keeps walking.

The same day again, he's taking out medicine from the medicine cabinet in the hallway and the door of the medicine cabinet accidentally touches the table of my computer so he turns to me to apologise. My hand was on the computer because I was typing something. He puts his hand on my hand while apologising and then pulls away and continues with what he was doing.

I literally don't know what to think of this situation. He's a nice person but that's it. I don't like being touched randomly especially not by someone years older then me and I've known him for a day. It makes me uncomfortable to the point where I was scared he was going to try something again when he kept walking past me. It's already a scary and new environment. Anyone thoughts?

Long story short I landed an internship at the company I wanted and then everything went downhill. I don't think I clicked with any of the team members and generally everyone seemed disinterested in helping me improve. Now I am realistic I do not expect to be held by the hand like a toddler and I don't expect everyone to yell ""good job"" all the time, I realize I made mistakes, as any intern should, but the last month I thought I was doing amazing, everyone I worked with had nothing but positive things to say about me and then they asked me am I excited for the team building? Of course I got no email about it and yet now when Im looking at social media I see all the other interns there. It is important to note that the project everyone had a positive experience with me was with a different department and we were mostly away from the office but still I would have expected some of that to play a role no? Anyways I got my end of internship feedback and they said that right now I don't meet the qualifications for the job which would have been fine if I were told about some of the mistakes I made but I wasn't I was lead to believe everything was ok and that my work was ok and then I come to find out that some of the staff called my work unproductive and that because I have shown a lot of ambition and effort I should extend my internship and try to prove myself again. Again, I am not saying I haven't made mistakes but my improvement and contribution on the latest project (which would show that I learned from my mistakes) wasn't even mentioned, plus the team building and me being completely left out definitely hurt and I honestly feel like I shouldn't come back and just move on but, a part of me wants to come back and show them up. I just feel really disappointed in myself, I'm losing confidence in my abilities and overall have no guidence or idea about what to do. Did anyone have a similar situation and how did you recover mentally and professionally?"

Hello Reddit,

Appreciate you all for taking the time to take a look at this post. If anyone has some insight, both positive and negative, providing feedback would be greatly appreciated. I am currently employed full-time in a role where I get placed on contracts with clients doing basic staff account duties. I am in my late 20’s, and now looking for a career change. I have an accounting degree and have worked several different staff accountant jobs over the past 5 years since completing my undergraduate degree. To say the least, it has been a sub-par experience, seriously affecting both my physical and mental health. I have decided on a career change, most likely a different position in a similar field, and think that hearing other people's opinions on moving forward would be very helpful and appreciated. 

I cannot handle the traditional accounting path anymore. I will give you a bit of background. Did a public accounting internship while still a student, did not like the experience, and decided to pursue industry post-grad. I was never an A+ student (didn’t struggle, but did by no means excel) and did not see pursuing the CPA exam as the best use of my time. Accounting was proposed to me as a path with decent pay, relatively low stress (depending on the industry), with excellent job security. A reasonable work-life balance is what I wanted, why I did not pursue the CPA license or convince myself that I would climb to the top of the corporate ladder. 

In each company, I have worked for between 6 months to a year. I have never felt comfortable at any of the companies I have worked for, always in a training phase of sorts, and never seemed to get the hang of things. Socially, there are no issues. I get along with and enjoy socializing with coworkers. I have little confidence about what I have learned in any of my positions over the years. While I understand accounting concepts, it has taken me a few run-throughs to grasp each company's way of doing things. All I know is as of now I need to make some life changes and do something different. I can go into more specifics about the jobs if you would like.

From talking with others, it sounds like I have not received the best training in the past. Never trained from someone that held the position prior to me, always “hitting the ground running”, jumping between different employees piecing together how to do the job. In interviews, I make it clear I value training and am able to learn if shown how things are done. I did not learn what an SOP was until recently or that most companies have actual training programs in place. I know I made my own mistakes along the way, but can’t help but think I made mistakes by accepting some of the jobs I did. At this point, I am so defeated from never being able to fully adjust to a company or feel fully confident in my work that I could use some other thoughts. 

Mental health and substance abuse has had a severe impact on my life. The mental health issues, bipolar, were there well before work stress came into the picture, but (prescribed) substances came in after and started to have a negative impact on my life. After quitting my last job of a year, the most adjusted/ stable positive I've had to prioritize mental health, I was able to take the time to detox (still had the classic benzo withdrawal seizures) and stayed sober. A few weeks after starting my new position, I am back on prescribed benzos for unbearable anxiety and heart palpitations among other things. I refuse to live like this and know the cause is work. I’m caught in a negative feedback loop and could use someone to smack some reality into me. 

Being able to WFH, 100% remote would be strongly preferred. I got a dog a few months ago and both of us are happier with me here. I am much more productive and relaxed with my own setup. I would be happy to take lower pay for a job where I don’t have to experience this level of stress.

I can’t keep up with this amount of anxiety, stress, and overall failure. I am overwhelmed. Just need to get over the bad attitude and keep searching. I know there are decent options out there that could work for me, just need to keep grinding and will eventually find something that works. 

My current thoughts are on bookkeeping. I already have my own small LLC for a hobby business and imagine that with an accounting background, I could adjust fairly quickly to a bookkeeping role. The pay would not be as good and I do not see many options for advancement but it seems like the most logical option at this time. 

Since I am currently employed and coming off medical leave shortly, I want to figure out what to say to my manager on how to proceed. I doubt they would want to fire me as it would probably be easier to assign me to lower-level jobs. I can not accept another client with the expectations of the last. I am unable to watch someone perform a month-end close once and then have the expectation of doing it myself without assistance the next month without any questions. Even when the person training me told me it took them about a year to get comfortable with the month-end close, for some reason the expectation is that I could do it after a month. Is this standard? When speaking with my manager I will express my concerns about the previous client but do not know how to move forward from there. How do I express that I essentially want lower responsibility and less stress? Of course, this would come with an adjustment to my contract to decrease my pay. Just keep hitting mental roadblocks on how to relay my concerns about my ability to do my job to my manager. 

Any thoughts are appreciated. Thanks Reddit

I am graduated now before for two years, I went to a university that’s extremely anti-social.it was like this before the pandemic, so this was not unusual. Only my senior year was in person. Because the school is anti-social, a lot of students attempt to connect on Instagram. It’s pretty common to follow someone just because they have the school in their bio. This must have been February or possibly earlier in winter term where my school posted a countdown to graduation online and I put it on my story. I got a response from the Nice Guy, J. 

We went back and forth for a bit talking about grad and he asked if I remembered him. I said no but not to take offense because we have had to wear masks in classes and I didn’t know most of my classmates.He wasn’t offended and let me know that he was in a class of mine in the fall. I didn’t question it because we had established that we had the same major and that class was a top requirement for the major . We talked in dms and he asked for my number. I didn’t think it was a big deal. We switched to texting and that’s when everything shifted.

It turned sexual really fast and he established that he was drinking heavily, and “don’t be surprised if I try to flirt with you”. He let me know that he was bi and usually went for men, but that he thought I was super hot.He was asking beyond personal questions and was trying to make plans to hang out that weekend. I made up an excuse and stopped replying to his weirdness. J tried to pick it up the next day but I said I was busy and would not be able to talk. And the thing was, he seemed very normal besides the personal questions, but the thought of hanging with him with how he acted during our first interaction made me nervous.

From then until Graduation, J would text me now and then, maybe once every few weeks or once a month. It was very one sided and I tried to do that on purpose, even though I battled the guilt that I was being rude for no reason and was misreading the situation.I tried to be distant, because it just seemed like he was trying to make friends like everyone else. On top of that, he would comment on my ig story about how I looked.  He would hint at hanging out, but I would just ignore it. I didn't notice any obvious Nice Guy behavior until Graduation day. Since we had the same major, we had the same gradation.He texted me after, asking why I didn't make effort to meet up with him or even sit with him. I said I had plans with other people and that he could have approached me first if he wanted plans. J drunk texted me later at night about how lonely he was and how he never got laid even though he did everything 'right'. 

Throughout this summer, he would text me first always and comment about how beautiful I was and how I must be dodging guys right and left. I had established multiple times before that I really had no interest in dating due to my location and career but he would try to play the 'but you're beautiful and so many options' card or attempt something I could only deem as at the 'gay best friend' role, where he thought he could say pretty out there things about me sexually but in a 'friend' way and would jump into how he doesn't prefer women so its ok that he thinks this way. 

 My primary job is an intern is a pretty big life style website and one of my current assignments is to take part in a self conducted social experiment and I write about my experience. I decided that I would start posting more of myself on my social media, something more geared towards the stereotypical male gaze (but not too obvious, keeping true to my usual posting) and write about what got more responses, what guys said to me, and overall what it made me learn about attending to the male gaze on a personal social media. Because of me showing my face and self more instead of my usual music recommendations and pop culture memes, he started to come much stronger to me, but also letting me know he was not interested. Any time I posted my face in any form, he would text me within minutes, telling me how lonely he is and how he doesn't know how I stay single on purpose. A week ago , while he was pushing me to talk about things I didn't want to, I told him how I'm extremely depressed at this point in my life and the over sexual conversations is making me uncomfortable and hes making me feel bad about myself, like im just a sexual object. J tried to laugh it off, and said that with that attitude I must be dominant in bed. He also out of the blue offered to hook ip with me if we are ever near by again but that would help me get over my depression.

From then, I ignored him. No matter how times a day he was texting me, no matter how many times he tried to make nonsexual conversation, no matter how much he tried to get a rise out of me, I stopped. He thought a few nights ago it would be appropriate to text me ""Hey Hottie (I'm flirting with you)"" and then dropped on me he'll be in my city for a concert and that he cant wait to hang out. Creeped out and grossed out. 

I know anyone would block and move on, but based on him talking about his loneliness and how he struggles besides being 'nice', I feel like he would hurt himself or do something drastic. I use every excuse in the book on why I cant hang and why I dont flirt, and I just don't think hes very socially literate. What should I do?"

This year, I really, *really*, want to get into a CS major at my school. That involves doing *exceptionally* well in one very specific, very hard, course. In order to maximize my chances at doing so well, I'll likely have to move ""job-finding"" time, be it internships, co-ops, etc, into ""studying"" time. As a second year (who's only just started his second year), I wanna be sure that maybe not taking any internships this year/summer isn't career suicide. If I get in, maybe I'll start thinking about it *then*, as my CS diploma is confirmed. Otherwise, I'll likely transfer to a school where it'll be more likely that I can get a CS degree, but then that might be a *third* year of not looking for internships.

I started at the clinic as an intern for 2 months before getting officially hired. In total I have 6 months experience.

Today I overheard the Pediatrician and office manager talking about firing someone, and being the newest (everyone else has 15+ years of working there) its obvious they’re talking about me. Im freaking out big time. I suspect its due to 2 errors I did today- I left potentially important information out when doing triage for a 6 month old today when I forgot to mention that the baby had begun teething. This was important considering the baby was exhibiting symptoms of excessive crying and fever. The second mistake I made was with another patient. I thought Rhabdomyolysis was a chronic condition so I wrote it down as such when it wasnt.

Besides that, I have yet to commit any vaccine mistakes, inaccurate vitals, wrong medicine to the pharmacy, or errors when writing X-ray / ultrasound forms. Im so stressed out because i’ve never had work experience at all before this. Its my first job ever and I enjoy it so much.

I really hate AP CSA because there is little hands-on programming (despite Java being a pretty easy language). Why is it hard? Tests every class purely based on memorization. I am doing internships and other classes, so this class is stressing me out A LOT. 

If I drop this class, I can focus more on advancing in math. I already have good programming skills (all of my ec’s are programming related LMAO—you can check out my ec’s here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/wul112/chance_me_for_ivys_and_t20_or_higher_schools/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/wul112/chance_me_for_ivys_and_t20_or_higher_schools/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

x9rl6d,1,2022-09-09,Should I quit?,troublemakerX999,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/x9rl6d/should_i_quit/,"Quick background:

I (f33) started a new job in June as a customer success manager. This is a new role and industry for me. However i do have over 13 years professional experience in similar roles  (they were all client-facing). When i started this role I was very excited and thought i finally found something I am going to stick to and build a career in. Back then i had a different manager who I thought was the best I every had. 

Long story short: we now have a new boss who has joined less than a month ago and nothing is the same anymore. She is a micro manager (i am not the only one who feels this way) and is telling me to come to the office after my holidays. Basically when I started, my old boss and CTO told me there is no issue at all if I work from home (abroad) as I usually go for a month to see my family etc. Our team has also no obligation whatsoever to come to the office even if we are in town. So not sure why she thinks she can change the companies policy. 

She immediately started to chase us for things, telling us how to do our jobs, she created these evaluations points she wants me to ‘rank’ myself. Honestly I feel like she is killing our motivation and she makes me feel like im an intern that just came out of school. 

I am seriously considering to quit, but i dont know what else i could do. 

Please can someone advise me how i can handle this situation?:(("

I have been working as a software developer intern for a web dev company about 5 months or so (I had some experience with side projects before) and Im graduating with masters in CS this month. 

During our initial interview they asked me which programming fields interest me the most. I explained that, for web dev, Im mostly interested in backend, databases, devops. I also told I am okay with frontend if its needed, because I have some experience with both react and angular and Im open to learning them further. I was asked about my interestes two more times during my internship and my answers were always the same.

On student projects I mostly worked with documentation, backend and devops side of project. My mentor was really happy with my work...or so it seemed like that. I also think I really did a good job with every task and I also showed ambition to learn different things.

As Im graduating soon, the company offered me a position, but they offered me the position of QA. While I think QA make really important part of the team, that is the position I definately dont see myself in now. Im afraid, since Im still new to programming world, if I stop the ""developer"" side of work I would forget things and that would stop my career from growing as a developer which I want to be.

I expressed my concern to my mentor, but he covinces me that QA is not that bad, especially beacuse company really needs them right now and other positions are ""filled"". He also said just give it a try for a few months maybe I will like it and decide to stay, but if I dont like it I could transfer to another team (which I really dont belive its easy as he makes it to be). I said I will give it another tought, but my mentor started to provoke me with passive aggressive comments during our meetings (e.g. ""sometimes, QA is all you get"") which I find quite rude.

Im thinking of accepting a job and (just so I dont have any blank space without paycheck) starting to look for another job immediately. 

What does this sound to you? Any reccomendations welcome."

I want to transfer into the CLAS college for CS. Last Spring, I completed an internship for Web Development, in which I was hired full time from. Now I am a Frontend Web Developer for a digital marketing company. With the AS degree, I took classes relevant to the CS courses such as data structures, and learned languages such as Python, C#, C++, Java, etc. I use CSS/SASS, Html, JavaScript &amp; PHP day-to-day with my job. 

I was wondering how much this would help with my application, or if admissions even looks at my job. I figured it would help prove that I have a genuine interest in my field.

My current overall GPA is a 3.6 (it could be better).

Should I stick it out?,blueline7677,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/x9yslq/does_two_back_to_back_short_term_jobs_look_bad/,"Short story: I am currently with my 3rd company of my professional career. Company 1 I interned with and worked at for a 1.5 years + internship. Company 2 i was at for 4 months (although it was because company 2 ended the contract with company 1 and hired me to do my job internally) now at Company 3 for 5+ months and I hate my job.

Long story

I previously worked for a 3rd party logistics company but was looking for a new job to relocate. During the time when I was looking company 1 lost the contract for them to bring the work in internally and they hired me on to work for company 2. 

I was already looking for a new job before I started at company 2 and about 3 months into my role there company 3 reached out to me for an interview and I ultimately got the job and wrapped up at company 2 at just around 4 months although I did love my time at company 2 I wanted to relocate.

Fast forward 5 months working at company 3 as a buyer and I hate my job. I don’t feel like I am any good at it and I think it’s starting to effect my mental well-being. I hate every day that I sign into work and going back into the office didn’t help much (I prefer going into the office than wfh). I also have a slight fear that I am going to get fired like I said I’m not great at the job and am still struggling a lot after 5 months in the job. I also really dislike my manager and the material manager that I work closely with. The job was not quite what I was expecting either but I think that might be my fault. The stress of this job is hard to not carry with me when I am not working.

I’ve talked to my parents and they think leaving would look bad and I should wait it out but at the same time they’re in their 60’s and grew up in a different time. I also have a vacation planned for February.

I guess my question is should i start applying for new jobs now? If not when should I start?"

I’m looking forward to applying for experience in my first year. (I have had no in-person internships, only a 5 hour long virtual internship which I believe isn’t counted).

A few skills I know that are needed include excel, PowerPoint, intro python, sql, kindly let me know of other skills I should learn.

I feel very uneducated about the corporate finance world and what pathway I would like to go down. However I am actively in the process of learning about different pathways e.g. risk management, investment banking m&amp;a etc. 

Kindly recommend me any books, podcasts, blogs or resources that you have used so I can work on strengthening my foundation. 

I will be beyond thankful for any advice or messages at all."

I’ve been applying to sales jobs but every time I get an interview they point out no experience as an issue. They all say that what they’re looking for are people who have gained previous experience through internships. My resume shows that I have a bachelors degree as of 6 years ago and have been working as a manager in retail since. This isn’t because retail is where I’ve been wanting to be, it’s because my partner has been finishing their degree and so I have been stuck taking whatever job I could in our current city, and unfortunately there just hasn’t been any better opportunities. My partner is now finished with schooling and we can move around, so I’ve been applying for outside sales rep and b2b sales all over literally the whole country and they all say the same thing “no prior experience from an internship”. I was late to finish collage for a variety of reason (I got sick for a long time as well as financial issues and things like that), so now I’m damn near 40, I have no career and no internship experience and I don’t know what to do. After rejection, after rejection, I am getting super depressed with my life, I feel stagnate and unfulfilled, I have always put other people before myself and I’m over it and ready to do something for me, but now I think it’s too late and that I’ve wasted my life. I’ve always been a hard worker who isn’t afraid to put the time and effort into the job regardless of hours, but now I’m starting to think hard work is pointless if it’s not going to get me anywhere.

My goal is very simple, get a job at a high paying company when I graduate. I don’t have particular interest in any of the CS field but I’m willing to invest a lot of time on achieving my goal. However, my focus on the second year is not clear. 
Below is my current situation: I have 1 web dev internship. Other than that, I have a basic level of web dev skills where I used MERN stack to build a bunch of projects. For interview preparation, I consistently practice LC and right now I have already finished 170 questions. 
What I think: Since I already have 5 projects on my resume, it is pointless to built any more projects and invest time on some Udemy coursework. My main focus should be LC and do as many questions as possible.
My confusion: is LC really enough for me to get a job at top-tier companies? Do most of the companies really jump straight into LC and hire someone who knows nothing other than DSA? Do I need to study some industry-related knowledge (Data science, web, ML/AI)?

I am in the process of applying for some internships, and I currently only have one past (and current) internship experience with a small startup.

I was not able to accomplish much at my internship, however. I was really underqualified, and I didn't have a lot of the foundational knowledge necessary to be productive (only had an intro course related to the internship ). I tried my best to self-learn, but the application the company produced was really complicated, so it was difficult to understand what was going on most of the time. My manager served as my mentor, and he was helpful in helping me adjust, but he became absent a few months ago due to personal reasons.  I asked a few engineers on my team, but they're also busy with full-time jobs outside of the startup, so they couldn't find the time to talk to me most of the time. Also, I took a few breaks throughout the internship to focus on school (started in April/May and my grades were slipping) and a family trip.

I wrote about a few tasks I did at the internship on my resume, but I'm not sure if it would be bad since it seemed like I did very little. This is the only work experience I have related to CS, so I felt like I should keep it. Should I keep it, or should I leave it off?

Help and advice would be really appreciated : ')

So I'm currently living in Brazil, looking to move to Canada in the near-ish future. Ive recently graduated university in comp sci, and through a selection test(its sort of like a university test to get a job), ive landed my first job at a large local bank.

Thing is, during university I only had a 2ish month internship to my name, and even that involved nothing besides watching training videos for marketing. Getting a job through a selection process like this was pretty much my best chance of breaking into the industry, as my resume simply didn't have what employers would be looking for by the time I graduated.

Thankfully though, I got this job now, but I'm trying to assess my position, especially against my goals. I've been assigned to the bank's database admin sector, where I'm going to help maintain and expand all the different databases used here. My concern is whether I'm realistically going to be able to leverage this experience when I go looking for a job in Canada. 

My current plan was to work here for 1-3 years, doing a postgrad course or two, then take a special kind of leave, where you go without pay but can come back to your spot in up to a years time. Then, go to Canada(I'm thinking Ottawa specifically btw), sign up for a master's and look for a job to sustain myself, while I live off of money saved now and family help if it comes to that. Then, use the job offer to apply for a permanent visa.

TLDR: Wanna move to Canada, currently work as a DBA at a Brazilian bank. Am I gonna have a bad time? What can I do now?"

Part of the reason why it took me so long is because I got uninterested and I started exploring other fields like computer science, more specifically ML. I got a few internships in this area and was certain this is what I’d want to do for my masters, so I applied to a DS masters.

I was told that, while I was coachable and demonstrated strong growth throughout the internship, my coding skills don’t meet their standards. When I asked, they were unable to provide specific examples for me to view.

I was confused and fairly hurt by this, as all my code was cleared by code reviews, I finished my project, and was told by several people inside and outside my team that I had a great presentation. Throughout the internship, I was given almost entirely positive feedback, felt as if I clicked very well with my team, and was told by multiple engineers working with me they hoped we’d have the chance to work together. 

So, I’ve updated my resume and started applying again, but honestly, I’m terrified that this will happen again.

Appreciate y'all for reading this and if you could give me some opinions to reflect upon it'd be great. 

To keep it short: I am 29F, pursuing my phd in statistics at in Quebec, Canada. I foresee myself optimistically done in 2 years. Average case in 3 years. Extreme worst case: 4 years (unlikely). My work experience so far has been 8 month internship as a research analyst and 2 years as a data scientist in a very small start up.  

prior to my job as a data scientist, I didn't program much. It was a steep learning curve, but also i felt that data science roles are very ill-defined in some companies. The role seemed less visible than a software dev (eg. hard to talk about your contributions when your work is not put into production). I also realized to be successful in such a role is also not about technical capabilities, but also having the business acumen which I lacked. 

I reflected hard about the kind of careers I could have given my skills: 

I worked closely with software devs which sparked my interest in furthering my CS education. Since then i did some easy hackerrank's for fun, OOP courses on Coursera and also completed data structures/operating systems class through a university during pandemic. I was thinking of pivoting to **software dev/engineer career** but given my education up till now in statistics, it seems i will lose out in terms of experience. I don't think i would mind the leetcode grind but also not sure if this is the best choice to maximize my income. 

**Go back to being a data scientist** but be careful where i work at (just because many companies don't actually need a data scientist). My research is also not in a hot area like ML so chances of becoming an applied scientist at MANGA is non-existent even though I can pick it up quickly. In any case, continuing to build my technical competencies like the above would still help. 

**Becoming an actuary/ research position in insurance company**: I have cleared 3 exams and on my way to the 4th. I consider this because where i am at, we have many insurance companies with headquarters in Quebec (plenty of opportunities). Pros: Its usually a defined role with good work life balance, consistent salary progression. The only cons are 1) the number of hours spent studying to clear the exams 2) the compensation ceiling is lower than working in tech company as software engineer/data scientist.  Is there a better payoff in terms of the hours I put into studying for these exams vs grinding leetcode/taking more CS classes to educate myself? 

Sorry for the long wall of text. I realize **there's only 24 hours a day**, and so much time (other than my phd) that i can dedicate to self-improvement. Having grown up poor (and being a bit behind at my age), I'd like to  put the odds on my side to maximize my salary. Please attack my blindspots and give me suggestions!

Thank you!"

However, I'm trying to prepare for them by LeetCoding my brain away but I feel like I'm not studying efficiently because almost every problem I'm looking up the solution only to feel dumb for when I cannot get the answer. I'm struggling.

Little background about myself , I’m a bootcamp graduate . Mainly learnt your basic web dev stuff with JavaScript /typescript  (  Node on the backend and react on the front end etc ). I’ve got a few interviews for internship roles(mainly with the same stack that I learnt ) however I’m abit nervous that I’ll run into some ds and algorithm questions ( been kinda neglecting them and working more on projects). I’ve heard that in NZ these are not as common in interviews besides like xero?

Just wanted to reach out and ask the Nz peeps what their technicals looked like so I can somewhat better prepare . ( guess it’s different for every company but I’m completely in the dark here ). The roles I’ve got an interview are for  small-med sized companies if that helps, specifically through summer of tech .


Thanks ! Much appreciated"

xalm3i,3,2022-09-10,I finally got my dream internship at a big company and it's making me super anxious,im_kinda_bored,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/xalm3i/i_finally_got_my_dream_internship_at_a_big/,"I'm writing this mostly as a rant/celebration/way to process everything currently happening in my life.

This year has been super bizarre for me. I'm in my last year of community college before I graduate and transfer next year. I'm (somehow) a top student who has several honors awards, someone with a lot of extracurriculars, a club president, etc. stuff I never would have been in high school. My counselors are encouraging me to apply to schools I didn't think I was good enough for 2-3 years ago. I've also had some personal successes too, like finding a guy that I like and think I'm gonna date. And recently, perhaps the biggest ""success"" of my last few years here, I got rewarded an internship with a company I've been dreaming about since I was a kid. It happened earlier this week and I literally didn't believe it when I saw the notification. My friends, family, and professors are all congratulating me. I'm happy about it too. I've spent nearly 2 years getting rejected from literally every internship I applied to. To finally get an internship, and nonetheless with such a huge company, is amazing. I feel extremely lucky and happy. I'm the perfect little community college success story.

But at the same time, I feel so unbelievably stressed. My mood is constantly swinging back and forth these past couple of days from elated to anxious and slightly depressed. At first I wasn't really exactly sure why. After all, I should be happy, and to an extent I am. But after some self reflection, I think I realized why -- because a chapter of my life is officially starting to close. I graduated high school in the pandemic, and I always believed it kinda mentally stunted me a bit. For the last couple of years I still kinda felt like I was mentally a high schooler. It doesn't help that I still live at home with my family. But that has officially ended now. Even though I've technically been over 18 for a couple years now, I'm finally starting to feel like a ""real"" adult. And I think this internship, along with my application process for transfer, is finally cementing that. It's exciting, but also feels scary.

Another thing I haven't mentioned but is definitely affecting me is that during all this craziness, my grandfather died a couple weeks ago. I didn't really feel the grief at first, part because I've known he's been dying for a while and part because I had to emotionally support my family. But I think now it's definitely starting to hit me. It really adds to the sensation that an era of my life is coming to an end. I will never again be a kid, hanging out in the basketball court after school waiting for my grandfather to pick me up. I can never again watch old vhs tapes of looney tunes with him at his house. He will never know how far I'm making it in life. And I knew that this was going to happen. I knew a couple months ago when he went into hospice that he wasn't going to see me graduate. But an unexpected experience in this journey is now not only am I mourning his death, I am mourning the fact that the way I have lived life up until now is changing and I can never go back.

So I guess this post was originally about my internship, and it still kind of is. I've been going back and forth from doing happy dances to panic attacks the last couple of days. I've had anxiety all my life, but I gotta admit there's not many times where I've experienced emotional whiplash quite on this level. This is academically my most difficult semester yet (and probably will be overall) and I have more to balance than ever before. It's weird -- I've handled a lot on my plate in previous semesters, but I think this is the closest I've ever come to burn out. And it all started when I received what should be good news.

I've seen people talk before about how success and getting things you want doesn't always equate to happiness, and I think now I'm finally starting to get it. It feels weird to get something you want after spending years trying to get it, while also getting the life's metaphorical rug pulled from beneath your feet. Life is good, but life is different now.

So yeah, that's my post. It definitely helped make me feel better writing it all down. But reading back, I think I'm probably gonna get a therapist now. It also doesn't help that I got like 2 hours of sleep last night from writing a research proposal and I drank an over-caffeinated drink from Panera bc they ran out of the tea I liked. Caffeine is like my #1 panic attack trigger so I never drink it... but of course I did yesterday. I miss my prickly pear hibiscus smh bring it back.

tl;dr Overall I'm really looking forward to my internship. But I definitely gotta care more for my mental health. I'm gonna work on that.

Peace out"
xamqyf,3,2022-09-10,Need some much needed advice on how to cope with my extreme anxiety,SilentPromotion7815,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/xamqyf/need_some_much_needed_advice_on_how_to_cope_with/,"Hi I am 22M... this is going to be a bit of a long read so pls be patient. I've been struggling from anxiety and depression for almost half my life. The country I am from strongly frowns upon mental health so it is difficult for me to be upfront about it with my family. Although I have 2 older sibling's both of them are married and live 2 separate cities. I am much younger to both of them and have neve r really been able to build a close relationship with either of them. P.S. I am not blaming them I am partly to blame cuz we were all living in our own bubble I suppose (different friend groups, interests, etc.) . That being said whenever I needed them to be there for me they've never said ""no"" which is really nice feeling as I look back into the past. Ever since they moved out they have become more and more distant partly due to their children and hectic work schedules. So because of this I am not confident enough to confide in them about how I am feeling and is also not sure if they would share my issues with their partners. (I have a complicated relationship with each of my siblings partners as well)

I was the only one of the 3 children who attended a private school. Yes you guessed it right folks I did have a fancy suit with a crest. lol its a stereotype I know... My experience at school was not perfect as it is to most people but the overall experience was great. I got along with almost everyone except for the occasional egoistical dickheads here and there. I have continued to being touch with my close friends from school to this day. However the last 2 years of school I started getting sudden panic attacks and they started getting more and more frequent. It was such dreadful experience everyday waking up to go to school because of the fear of having a panic attack in front of everyone. At the time i didn't know why it was happening to me or what was happening to me so I wasn't able to explain it to my parents.  Eventually I fought really hard with my parents and they agreed to let me be home schooled for the final 2 years of school. They were adamant that I continued to attend school because of how prestigious the school was and also because how hard it was to get me enrolled in the first place. 

Fast forward 2 years completed home schooling and now it was time for college. I never really had a passion for any particular path. No guidance from siblings or parents. They didn't force me to choose a major but was adamant I went to college and graduated. My elder brother is a Software Engineer so my mom suggested to follow the same path after much skeptical contemplation I enrolled in a bachelors program in IT. I went to college without a hitch made some friends and finished my freshman year with above average grades. However, all this time I am thinking to myself this is not the path for me, this is not who I am supposed to be, but it is too late now since my parents have invested heavily for college. After many sleepless nights I finally build up my courage and told both my parents. They were so damn understanding on the matter which took me by surprise. In order to save money I decided to change my major to marketing in the same college. After having to start from scratch again it was a battle to finish my bachelors through covid19 interruptions but it did it with 3.6GPA. in the fall of 2021. 

Now this is where shits starts to get messed up... ""finding a job"" !!! After covid19 and economic crisis affecting almost every country in the world finding a job for fresh graduates have never been tougher. I sent resumes almost everyday but only heard back a couple of times. Finally landed a marketing internship in a IT conglomerate but only lasted 2 days before I resigned. This is where my anxiety started to go into overdrive I couldn't eat, sleep or work properly. Everyday when I wake up I feel like there is a massive weight on top of my chest on top of the fact that my heart is racing. The reason for my anxiety is the fact that my dad is the only person in the family who has a steady paycheck. I have a feeling with the strained relationship my siblings have with me and my parents they wouldn't support us financially if we are ever in need in the future. My dad is slowing coming to a age where he needs to rest and retire, don't get me wrong he still has a couple of good years left in him. My biggest challenge is making enough money to support my parents and pay the bills before my dad reaches his retirement age. Through all of this I still don't really know what my career path is... there is also much more to my story I just cant seem to find the words....

looking for some advice!"

xanjj6,0,2022-09-10,Advice for interning at elementary school?,Wonderlandess,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/xanjj6/advice_for_interning_at_elementary_school/,"So essentially I am not an education or child development major but am adjacent in which while my major doesn't have to be dedicated to children, this is my career path and choice of use for my degree. My university requires internships to graduate and to gain experience, I obviously applied to child care facilities and schools in hopes of experiencing practically what it is like to interact with kids. Originally I wanted to work with teenagers, but a short term job at my county's fair, I was a lost child attendant and looked forward each day to what child I may get to interact with next. 

So in less than a week I essentially have been approved for a k-6 that seemingly has experience with internships as volunteers, which I thought was great! 

But, now that I'm starting this week, I'm a little concerned I may have gotten in over my head. I haven't really been given any idea of how I'll be serving in the classrooms. All I know is that it would only be during school hours (not even after school help or anything, she phrased it as I'll be done once the bell rings and usually most teachers won't ask for assistance until maybe 30 minutes or an hour into school)

I'm also a little concerned that I may not be prepared. As I said, I'm sorta child adjacent, and up until recently I've prepped myself more so with interaction of teenagers in terms of classes and studying taken. I do plan on taking an education class later this semester and hopefully something next semester as well, but other that I'm not sure how to prepare?

I like children, I like seeing them interact with the world and each other, how they operate and communicate, so this isn't really a matter of me not liking it once I start, but I guess a bit of jitters that I will actually be good with them, or that I can be helpful to their education (or just an hand to the teachers for tasks) but I'm worried I may not have any foundations that the normal education or child dev. has had ingrained into their mind. 

Are there any things or guiding tools/resources I should know before I begin? I am in California if that changes anything. What are the best way to interact with elementary?"
xaoxo3,11,2022-09-10,I Built a Full-Stack Blog Builder (beemy) - Self-Taught Developer Story,yoosh_crypto,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/xaoxo3/i_built_a_fullstack_blog_builder_beemy_selftaught/,"&amp;#x200B;

[beemy Demo](https://reddit.com/link/xaoxo3/video/jowf9n2h51n91/player)

**TLDR**

I built a full-stack blog builder called [beemy](https://www.writebeemy.com/) as a self-taught developer and created a blog page with 8 articles detailing technical lessons I’ve faced. Here is that [blog page](https://www.writebeemy.com/writer/@charlie/page/dev). You can also use beemy for free! There is a sample application for testing purposes where you don’t need to create an account.

NOTE - Because I’m using the free version of MongoDB - initial load times may be slow for the blog page. Article pages are cached on the server via Vercel Static Site Generation so article pages have fast load times.

**My story**

I say I’m self-taught, but I did take introductory level computer programming courses in high school and college - so I had a solid foundation for general programming concepts (classes, variables, etc.). However, I majored in Business Administration in college - not Computer Science. The majority of what I know and use in my everyday coding sessions are \*self-taught\* through many tutorials early-on and, of course, lots of Googling.

My web development journey started a little over 2 years ago when I was stuck at home (like everyone else) due to COVID-19. At the time, I was a Sophomore in college pursuing Tech Sales as a career and had 2 part-time relevant internships under my belt which ultimately helped me land a summer internship and return offer within a B2B Sales Development Program at one of the big Telecom companies. However, throughout this whole process, I really didn’t like the type of work Sales offered. So I started venturing out to see what other career options were out there. That’s when I discovered web development.

I always thought a career was something that you just did as a job and nothing more - but I actually really enjoyed web development a lot. I grew up playing a lot of video games, and the familiar process of leveling up my skills was fun. There is something really satisfying about continuously learning and applying what I learned to create a tangible interface.

I graduated college in a little under 3 years (relevant later) and started my full-time career in Tech Sales. At the time I started, I was 1 year in of self-teaching myself and had gotten pretty comfortable with the basics of web development. I would go to work during the day, and come back home to code. I hated that I sometime wouldn’t have the energy to code after work.

After around 2 months, I decided to leave. I could have totally milked the program and just waited until they fired me, but I just got tired of faking it. I think I knew deep down that Sales wasn’t going to be a long-term career path for me.

Over the past year, I’ve been continuously improving my skills and building beemy. It’s been a long and hard journey, and the number of hours I put into this project rivals the amount of time I spent on League of Legends in high school (which is saying something). I justified this learning period by calling it an “unofficial gap year” and that I was technically still within a feasible timeline. Despite being a “gap year”, I probably worked harder this past year than I did in college.

I understand that not everyone has the liberty to take a full year to solely self-teach themselves, so I feel lucky that I was able to do so.

**How I built It**

Now onto the tech stack! I’ll talk a little bit about why I chose each as well as my likes + dislikes. This list is nowhere near comprehensive and only includes ones that I think are worth talking about.

Frontend

[**Next.JS**](https://nextjs.org/) \- To be honest when I chose this framework I was going with what was most popular at the time. I had no idea what the difference between server and client rendering was or their respective use cases. But this was probably one of the best decisions because Vercel (the company that created Next.JS) made a really really good framework that makes building websites so much more enjoyable. I don’t have to think about the small configurations - Next.JS handles it for me. I remember at the time I was deciding between Next.JS and Gatsby and I am so glad I opted for Next.JS since it now seems like Next.JS is the preferred React framework.

[**Editor.JS**](https://editorjs.io/) \- I first discovered this when I was doing a tutorial online from Frontend Masters. It’s a really solid editor that comes with a lot of prebuilt components. They use classes for components which does take some time to get used to if you are coming from React functional programming, but I think it's the best-looking open source editor as of now. You can also indirectly incorporate React components in the class render function, so its not that bad - here is a [tutorial](https://www.walkthrough.so/pblc/QCawSCKwOQLn/creating-a-custom-editorjs-block-tool-with-react) I found online on how to do that.

[**react-dnd**](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about) **+** [**react-beautiful-dnd**](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) \- Used these for my drag-and-drop functionality for my blog builder (to drag articles to a blog builder component). I used to 2 drag and drop libraries because I wanted to cry after a day and a half of fiddling with react-dnd to try and create a sortable list. So I gave up and installed react-beautiful-dnd for my sortable list. If I were to do it again, I would opt for [dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com/). It comes with drag and drop + sortable lists. I picked react-dnd initially because I wanted a lightweight library.

[**SASS**](https://sass-lang.com/) \- I know there are a lot of new styling libraries out there like tailwind and styled-components, but I still just prefer regular CSS. SCSS is nice cause I can nest styles.

Backend

[**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/) \- I remember doing a lot a lot of research for which database to use. Fundamentally, I came to the conclusion that the most important aspect of a database is the number of features and speed of development, not cost. I don’t come from a SQL background, so the document-based query language wasn’t that unnatural for me. MongoDB also provides really specific and granular updates once you learn it. It also offers search! I don’t have experience with other databases, but I haven’t had any complaints with MongoDB so far.

[**next-auth**](https://next-auth.js.org/) \- Authentication took me a very long time to figure out. If you are trying to implement a full authentication mechanism with next-auth, know that it is possible. Specific examples aren’t heavily documented, but you can accomplish certain custom authentication steps by manipulating tokens and URL variables.

[**react-query**](https://tanstack.com/) \- Great for managing global context and syncing backend data with the frontend. I know this library was recently upgraded but I haven’t updated my dependency to the new one yet so don’t know much about the update.

[**Twilio SendGrid**](https://www.twilio.com/sendgrid/email-api) **+** [**AWS SES**](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) \- AWS SES is pretty strict on giving production access since they care about sender reputation. It has by far the best pricing compared to custom providers, but you are going to have to prove to them that the emails on your list are legit and vetted (meaning no bounces). I got rejected without a reason (they say it's for security reasons), but I’m pretty sure it's because I cannot guarantee that users don't maliciously spam my site with incorrect emails. So in my dev environment, I use AWS SES with whitelisted emails and in prod I use SendGrid. SendGrid allows 100 free emails a day.

**Challenges I Faced**

These challenges are more so geared around design decisions and later-on coding challenges, not so much about the early-on process I went through figuring out what to learn. I wrote a blog post about [that process](https://www.writebeemy.com/writer/@charlie/articles/building-my-first-production-app) in case anyone is interested.

*Algorithm-style utility functions*

When they say you won’t have to use algorithm-style questions on the job, that’s not 100% true. For my page builder, I have to perform connecting updates to pages that require recursion because I architected page links to have potentially infinite depth (meaning there could be an infinite amount of sublinks that correspond to the main link). Because I don’t have a lot of practice with these types of problems, this part took me some time to figure out.

*Architecting data models*

I only have 3 resources in my app - pages, articles, and users. However, it still took me a lot of thinking about the best way to associate these resources. I had to think about how my application would grow and take shape which would affect how I would request these resources.

*Custom vs. Reusable Components*

I chose not to use a component library for two reasons:

1. I wanted to practice creating my own components and styling them.
2. I wanted to be able to design my website as I saw fit.

It’s always a challenge to decide which components should be reusable and which shouldn’t. Some components might also require custom text, which becomes a pain. I found that if a component had the same HTML structure, that component could be reused. For the different styles, I used these strategies:

1. Toggled className with a custom “type” prop.
2. dangerouslySetInnerHTML for custom text
3. Rendered children for layout heavy components

**What’s Next**

I’m going to be shifting focus from building to looking for career opportunities as a Fullstack or Frontend Developer. I’ll still be building beemy, but just dedicating less time to it. So going to be getting back into that Sales mentality when applying!

For anyone else in a similar position to me, I wish y’all the best of luck. Some days have been harder than others to keep pushing but I’m hoping, in the end, it's worth it."

The second reason is that I live in Brazil and earning in dollars is worth a lot here. When I come to these platforms such as Upwork I see there is a lot job requests which some of them require the most diverse frameworks (which some of them I’ve never seen before), and this make me wonder how much specialized do I need to be in order of get to know a large number of these frameworks.

Things I currently need to learn/work on:

- Work itself (part time web development at my school)

- Courses:

    - Image processing course -&gt; need to come up with a project where I apply what I'm learning in class and build it
    - AI course -&gt; Have homework assignments and projects to do, for each of which I need to understand the various challenging concepts
    - Game programming course -&gt; not too bad but I'm working with Unity which I don't know a lot about
    - Capstone -&gt; this is a big one. Learning Laravel, Vue 3 (I work with Vue 2), Tailwind, hosting sites, learning how to make a site look good, various other concepts as well. All pretty foreign to me
  

- Outside of course work:
    - Leetcode 
    - Learning OpenGL in preparation for an internship so I can increase the odds of getting a return offer
    - Applying for jobs/internships, and doing any OAs and things like that

- Any personal programming projects I'm interested in (I simply don't have time for these but they're still on my mind)

And all of that is only CS related stuff. I also have non-CS hobbies and interests I'd love to pursue but haven't been able to the past 2 semesters since I'm slammed with the stuff listed above

It's all very overwhelming and I feel like I have no chance of getting ""good"" at any of it because there's just not enough time in the day. I just think about how much I'd learn and grow if I was working on one, maybe 2 big areas instead of what feels like close to a dozen.

Does anyone else experience this?"
xaupvz,4,2022-09-10,My Controversial Essay Writing Opinions,collegetalya,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/xaupvz/my_controversial_essay_writing_opinions/,"I love writing, reviewing college application essays, and applying to internships just because I get to storytell about myself. Which is something that I 100% hated during the initial stage of my college application process, because as is the case for most people, it's the first time where we have to be introspective and write about ourselves. So, what I think is really cool is that there are a lot of resources out there to help make that process easier, but sometimes they can inadvertently make your essay less personable because the advice is so cookie cutter. 

So, here are the most common essay tips and tricks that I generally disagree with (and why):

* Your essay NEEDS a hook
   * Sometimes hooks can raise more questions and concerns than actually build excitement to reading an essay. Especially if the one-liner is extremely cryptic to the point where readers end up reading the essay trying to make sense of your hook, as opposed to reading it with an open mind to trying to learn about you. 
   * The other downside is that a lot of people become anxious and won't start their essays until they've picked a hook, which can lead to procrastinating on the essays. Where in fact, you should always write the introduction last once you have your content built out. 
   * Finally, sometimes just jumping into the story, is the best hook that you can have, because the reader just starts off learning about you, so you don't need a slow burn intro/thesis nor a cryptic monologue at the beginning to preface whatever you're going to talk about. Instead, you can just start talking about it! 
* Extended metaphor/choose an object
   * I understand why this can be helpful because it encourages students to think introspectively and organize their essay in that way as opposed to a main idea + 3 supporting details like we might do in a literature/language composition class. And it automatically makes the essay multidimensional, which I always encourage. HOWEVER, the extended metaphor and/or object absolutely cannot be random and you're better off not using one if it does happen to be random. 
   * For example, if this metaphor/object has not tangibly been relevant to your life nor added value in that way, then it's going to be an uphill battle writing AND reading it, because there are going to be so many words just to explain why the metaphor is relevant. OR there will be a lot of words explaining the connection of the metaphor to a random part of your life, and you actually lose the actual story that you could have told about your life if you weren't stuck trying to mold that experience to fit your metaphor. 
   * You should always let your experiences speak for themselves and if there is an extended metaphor that you use, it should naturally show up in those stories as opposed to forcing the stories to fit in the context of your metaphor 
* Pick an impressive topic
   * This idea is fortunately retiring a bit, but sometimes we put pressure on ourselves when we see ""essays that worked"" to replicate those attributes in order to look impressive. This also goes for choosing awards/accolades or generally ""unique"" opportunities that you've had that may not actually be relevant to what you're interested in or passionate about. 
   * So, just to clarify ""essays that worked"" are essays that worked for THOSE individuals, and you have to find an essay that works for you. So, choose a topic that's genuinely meaningful to you, as opposed to something that you think an admissions officer wants to hear from you. It's really easy to tell when you're looking for content and substance that isn't there when reading an essay and that the only reason that you may have chosen a topic is because you think that it sounds good

And now a lot of you may be left with the though that ""my life isn't interesting/I don't have anything good to write about"" and that's also 3000% not true. Because think of meeting any new person for the first time, if they told you where they're from, what they like to do in their free time, and some of the things that they've gotten to experience, are you going to automatically assume that they're disinteresting? Hopefully not, because the truth is learning about someone new for the first time will always be interesting as long as there's as many details about you, your interests, and your story as possible. One way you can do that is to practice by googling ""personal questions to ask your friends"" and answer those to see if any of them spark ideas for you!"

xavjak,0,2022-09-10,Take startup offer vs. keep applying (graduating in December)?,rc6188,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xavjak/take_startup_offer_vs_keep_applying_graduating_in/,"Hello, I'm currently a CS masters student at Cornell graduating in December 2022 and I'm looking for full-time ML roles starting in Jan 2023. I'm hoping to relocate to the SF Bay Area so I've mostly been applying to jobs there or remote ones.

I'm about a month into applying and I've received two offers thus far, one from the company that I interned for over the summer and one from a very early-stage stealth start-up made by ex-FAANG employees. The startup has fewer than 10 employees so I'd be one of the first engineers hired.

The startup is offering me:

- 138k, no signing bonus, 15% annual incentive bonus (totals to about $159k)

- 0.5% equity (4 years vesting schedule)

- full health benefits

- 3 weeks PTO

- Start date for part-time work within next few weeks, then transition to full-time in January

This is basically my first real offer I've received from applying in the last month and I can't really gauge if this is a very solid offer for the SF Bay Area. Ideally I would like to work for a FAANG company, but I haven't mass applied yet and the ones that I did apply to haven't responded (only applied about 1-2 weeks ago).

Given the recession/big tech hiring freeze, I'm not sure if I should just take this start up offer or if I should keep applying for the next few months to see if I could land a better offer at a bigger company? I have a solid background from a target school and internship &amp; research experience.

Would appreciate any insight/advice! Thanks!

However, something annoying and disappointing happened  that I don't want to disclose made me postpone grad school amidst the  expenses I spent and the nonrefundable  more-than-one-month-worth-of-average-salary-in-my-country plane ticket. I  have already moved on because my situation in my country is already  frustrating, and I want to focus on things that keep my mental health  sane.

Going back to my real  purpose, I would like to seek advice on writing statement of  purpose/personal letter/motivation letter. I kinda know the difference  among them I will tailor them according to the program and the  requirements/criteria of the university. I have tried to research online  about the tips and templates that I can use as guide; however, when I  start to write, I become stuck and don't really know what to say. Maybe  it's because of my anxiety where I often times become unsure of things  although I know their nature. Or I didn't engage much experience during  undergraduate such as internship outside the university except the being  a member of the theoretical physics group for almost 3 years. Moreover,  I think that I did not do well during those three years as I was  preoccupied with financial matters. I remember having research meetings  with my supervisor but I couldn't focus because it was already evening  and I was starving.

After  graduation, which happened during the pandemic in 2020, I was suffering  mentally and unsure of what would happen to me. I almost had a gap year  because I was unsuccessful in being hired until the end of the first  half of 2021. I did not like my first job though and applied only because I was pressured and we were running out of money. However,  during the gap year onwards, I was developing interest in quantum nature  of spacetime and black hole physics, but my undergraduate research area  was more on the quantum foundations part.

Now  I am research assistant at my undergraduate university where this is  what I consider the-kind-of-thing-I-should-have-applied-for-during-undergrad-as-internship.  I learn a lot here within less than a year than I did during my  ""3-year-research-experience"" because my undergrad adviser was kinda more  lenient and wanted us to focus on the academic, but for my job I was  more independent and there are deadlines to think about. Still, my  research here is not related to black hole physics except maybe for the  optics, simulation and data analysis part.

Since  I really want to be a black hole physicist so much, I would like to  pursue graduate school. I don't like to apply here for master's because I  don't wanna end like what I was during undergrad. I don't want some  triggers to make me depressed and less focused that's why I refuse to study there. Theoretical research is also underfunded, and I don't know  if I can live and think if I all worry about is what to eat and how to  go home comfortably. That's why I have decided to apply for master's or  PhD (probably in the USA since it is incorporated in the PhD track of  most universities).

Since most of  the ""valuable"" research experience I have is the ones I am doing in my  job now, I am not sure if I could ever present a good image of myself in  the motivation letter. I am just worried because I don't have a really  high GPA (I think it's around 3.28), can't take GRE because even now I  haven't received my salary since June (and I'll be saving them for TOEFL  and application fees...salary is usually delayed like last March onwards), so my best bet is through my motivation letter in which I am  really not sure what to write.

Do I  have a high chance of getting accepted to my dream program if I only  have experience since the past year (work as data analyst + current work  as research assistant), plus the ones I have during undergrad but  having doubts because I think they're not enough? I am really lost in writing my letter because all I have is motivation but not enough achievement or proof yet of my ability as a prospective student. Moreover, I just recently started to have interest in black hole physics and I don't have that when-I-was-a-child-realization-story about why I am into that.

Although now I am taking an online course on data-driven astronomy in Coursera to supplement my knowledge on the field although I don't have any other research project other than the one I am working now.

I  plan to apply to PennState, UoW-Madison, Syracuse, University of  Florida, etc. Most of them are in the top-mid tier but it's because they  have a thriving research on the fields I am interested in although I am  still searching for other schools in Europe and the USA.

xb19la,5,2022-09-10,"""Do your best.""",minidog8,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/xb19la/do_your_best/,"I was told this ALL my life. I did. I always do my best in everything I do. I want to please authority figures. As a kid if I was not pleasing those in authority my mental state would crash sooo much.

In school I was often told I wasn't meeting my full potential and I was not doing my best work. I did not get diagnosed with ADHD until I was 14 because I didn't have academic struggles. I was visiting a professional for something else entirely. I literally do not know how I would have survived if she didn't notice the signs the adults in my life all missed. 

Anyways, I do fine. I do well and I am successful. But still, nobody believes that I am doing my best. It's exhausting and it makes me want to cry sometimes. My best is like, somebody else's 1/2 best. I work so hard to do the bare minimum that I don't have the energy or time to go above and beyond. All my life i have been told I half-ass everything. I believed that was true for so long.

I am student teaching right now and I had a conversation with the university person who was observing me where I expressed my frustrations. I told her straight up: I have never been the best, I never will be, but I just want you to know that what I'm doing right now is taking me my full effort. I am trying. Instead of dismissing me like teachers and other authority figures from my K-12 school life, she told me that she understood. She brought up ""adult ADHD"" and that she has seen it before. I did not tell her I had been diagnosed as a teen and have been taking medication regularly since, but that was still so validating.

It is a wonderful feeling to feel that somebody else is in your corner, and to have my efforts validated. Now that I think back and reflect on my life before now, I see how badly ""doing my best"" has effected me. I kept straight A's but I was unable to keep friends K-12. Participating in extracurriculars would result in my grades going down. I couldn't do it all. In college I was able to do well in classes and contribute lots of ideas but I would constantly fail at extending myself into clubs, internships, volunteering, and other extracurriculars. I did not maintain friends or hobbies because the two things I did, school and work, took all my effort. Having only two things to focus on, I should've been the most prestigious student and the most valued worker, right? Not at all! I did fine but again I was told I was not meeting my potential.

And you know what... That's not wrong. I am tired of using all of my energy just to meet the baseline. I am tired! I want to learn how to thrive. Never in my life have I thrived. But this realization has made me realize that I CAN figure out how to get there. Maybe one day I can do better than just what is expected of me, and then I can meet ""my potential"" and the expectations others have in me, and more importantly, myself.

TL;DR - I am not lazy, just have ADHD! Hooray!"
xb1qlo,42,2022-09-10,Tesla internship delayed due to visa issues,Pleasant-Invite-7681,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/xb1qlo/tesla_internship_delayed_due_to_visa_issues/,"I was supposed to start my fall internship at Tesla on Sept. 6 in Palo Alto but I’m currently stuck in Canada. Tesla started my J1 process pretty late so around Aug. 20 and I finally submitted my documents on Aug. 26th at the Van US Consulate. US embassy said my application fell under interview waiver so I wouldn’t need an interview unless they contacted me about it. 

Well, just this past Tuesday I get contacted by the embassy to book a visa interview appointment for my J-1 visa. The earliest time slot available is Oct. 25th and I asked to get an emergency appointment but they declined that. I am not sure what to do now 😭 I already started paying rent for my place in Palo Alto and my internship hasn’t started yet either. I am not sure if I’ll even get remote work. I am not sure if I’ll even get there to complete my project and finish my internship in time :’(( 

This situation sucks because it’s all out of my control :’(( I am so lost and confused about how to secure an earlier date visa appointment and what to do in general. Did anyone have anything similar happen to them? how did you proceed?"

xb2mxv,65,2022-09-10,"Went Above and Beyond, Now I Learned My Lesson",quantanonymous,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/xb2mxv/went_above_and_beyond_now_i_learned_my_lesson/,"I'm a software engineer at a relatively small company. Originally when I was working there the dev team only consisted of me and my manager, who we'll call Tim. Well, Tim left the company in the beginning of May, and I took on all of his responsibilities. The scope of my work expanded far beyond my job description and my workload effectively doubled, but I was still being paid an entry level salary. I thought that this was okay for the time being, because surely I would be rewarded for it later.

Time passed, and I ended up really meeting the moment. Revenue from web development soared under my leadership, and I implemented numerous desperately needed process reforms. On top of that, I consistently got great feedback from clients and coworkers. We ended up hiring a dev intern, who I then managed. He needed a lot of training early on, so that strained my capacity even more. Eventually he got up to speed and performed well enough that we kept him on as a contractor.

So at this point I'd been managing a team member and performing all of the duties of my former manager for about four months with great success, and I thought it was time to get some recognition. For whatever reason, my company had never given me a performance review, so I went to ask for one. In my performance review, I was verbally recognized for going above and beyond, and they mentioned how I'd done really well taking on Tim's responsibilities and managing the new team member.

I used this as an opportunity to ask for a promotion. If I was doing so well and the company recognized that, surely they would be open to adequately compensating me, right? I couldn't have been more wrong. The meeting to discuss my request for a promotion came a couple weeks after I asked. In the room was just me and the three highest ranking administrators in the company, clearly as some form of intimidation tactic. The meeting started and they broke the news.

They wouldn't be giving me anything. No new title, no raise, no bonus, no nothing. I stood up for myself, and they agreed that I was performing better than Tim had in that position across the board, but they said it didn't matter. When I was in the performance review, my performance was exceptional. Now that I was asking for proper recognition, they said it was ""adequate."" One of the administrators actually accused me of being greedy for asking for additional compensation. The salary I asked for was on the low end of normal for the role. But in their minds, this was alright. They were ""meeting me halfway"" by providing professional development opportunities. I told them I could get advice from anywhere.

This whole incident felt like a huge slap in the face. I really went above and beyond for this company to tremendous success, and when I asked to be properly recognized for it all I got were insults. Now I'm in the process of applying for other jobs, since I know I won't get any recognition here. It's been really hard to keep working for them in the meantime feeling so disrespected, but it wouldn't be financially responsible to let my employment lapse.

Anyways, let this be a lesson. It doesn't matter how big or small the company is or how much they claim to care about their team. When it comes down to it, they don't care about you. They never cared about you. They just want to squeeze every dollar they can out of you. Don't feel any obligation to do anything outside of your stated responsibilities. Doing anything extra is a waste of your time."

xb45po,1,2022-09-10,Data scientist (Machine learning engineer),MazeLess,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xb45po/data_scientist_machine_learning_engineer/,"# Dear Community,

I am reaching out to you as this is my last resort, I am a software engineer graduate and I specialize in Data Science, I graduate in Dec 2021 from on the best IT related university in Tunisia (If not the best). 

Now I am obviously still an Entry Level / Junior employee, however I do have interesting internships / academic / professional experience however small it is.

I worked remotely when I was still studying as a machine learning engineer for 8 months, I also went to France for a 6 months internship in one of the best universities in France (Research project). etc

Currently, I am unemployed, and I am looking for a job in my field, or even not, something related to IT (even IT support). I wrote a very good resume, professional, has all types of key words to pass the scanning, etc. I am pretty sure my resume is more than fine, I even compared it to some of my old classmates who graduated as well and it was even better.

However, working in Tunisia is NOT AN OPTION, the state of engineers here is devastating, you can work as a full time Data Scientist and get paid between 300$ and 400$ per month, that's how bad the economy is (whether public or private). So basically all new graduates seek opportunities overseas (Europe, Canada, USA, Asia...) Literally anywhere when you can be appreciated and get what you deserved.

I have been applying non-stop for the last 3 months, LinkedIn, [indeed.com](https://indeed.com), welcome to the jungle, [monster.com](https://monster.com), etc. and all I got is an endless amount of rejections. Now, one of the main reasons unfortunately is the visa issue, most companies do not want to bother with someone who requires a visa sponsorship, but still it cannot be this bad, especially that Tunisia is actually considered a very good source of good quality engineers in Europe, but I got no luck with this. After hundreds (I am talking 500+) of applications I ended up with only 2 technical tests, which I did great on but got rejected anyways.

I am pretty confident that my profile is good enough for a junior engineer, but it started getting on my nerve, especially that I didn't let any type of IT related position go buy, I am ok with the bare minimum of salary just to survive, and then things will turn up.

Anyways, I was wondering, if by any chance one of you works or knows any specific responsive company or a certain position that is available so I can apply I will be more than grateful.  
(Machine learning / deep learning / data science / python / tensorflow / fine tuning ...........)

I am willing to share my resume in private with whoever thinks he can help me.

Thank you very much and have a great day"

I thought I could get a job soon after I graduated, but I got nothing. I feel like time is running out. I feel like I'm getting rusty on programming at this point, and am starting to doubt my potential success for tech interviews or just a career. I also am just feeling unmotivated and have just started procrastinating and wasting time. I feel like my main barriers are that I never was able to get an internship so there's that lack of experience, and I feel my social anxiety and nervousness harms me in interviews. I feel like a failure who'll never get a job. How do I overcome this and finally find a job?

So overwhelmed by everything.,theNothingBurger,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/xb5abh/18_and_lost_in_life_so_overwhelmed_by_everything/,"Im currently 18 years old, male, turning 19 in December, and just starting university 2nd year. Im studying Computer Science. 

Im really just lost in life in so many ways. Even though some people will say I have a little bit done, for my age I feel like im so horribly behind. I feel like i'm cursed, to be bad at everything. There's quite a few things that are driving these feelings.

I've never had a girlfriend, let alone a first kiss. I went to a boys only Catholic school for high school and yes, I can use that as a excuse, doesn't make me feel any less shitty. I had a opportunity during my first year to get a girlfriend and made no progress. Although this year I have a couple female friends, I don't really see anything happening with them. Im not exactly very attractive, but I do take stuff like hygiene seriously. I just don't know.

Job situation isn't looking too hot. I've worked at retail for minimum wage as my first job during summer of this year, at 18. I feel like I should have worked when I was 16, but I just didn't. But I feel like, even though I got this job, I got nothing out of it. Like I'm not gaining any valuable skills from it, and I can't rise up the ranks of it or something. Since my major is CS I should be getting internships but im so far away from it. I know I need projects but I never have the motivation to do any of my ideas. I just feel stupid and lazy.

Then there's also just general career stuff. I glance over at my friends and I see so many Linkedin things. They're doing all these things like volunteering or band or leadership or just getting jobs. Their applying to all this stuff and I just don't know where to start with all that stuff. When I look around I feel overwhelmed and I don't know if what I choose will be good. I try my best in school, but im mostly in the average category.

I also don't have many friends. Maybe like 3 or so. And I'm not particularly that close with them. I really do struggle to talk with other people. Im awkward and not very social. I feel like everything I say is just weird and I don't have much to talk about.

I feel like I haven't had any success in life. To me, since I don't have a early success in life, I can never have success in life. I don't know if thats any true or not, but I just feel like a dumb person. I don't really have a natural talent, and I don't have anything that im proud of.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess thats all I can think of, if you've read all of this, thank you. I have a saying to myself, ""Success at None, Failure at All."" I just feel that way, it feels like I was born to suck. Im almost 19 and I have nothing in my life. Maybe I can't be fixed."

I’ve been trying to get back on my feet since my first suicide attempt at 18 after I came out as trans. I got fired the day after I came out to one of my co-workers (who I didn’t realize was in management, I thought she was just an intern) and haven’t been able to find work since then. Not for a lack of trying, it’s just that everyone sees my lack of resume and assume I’m just another druggie. Nobody is willing to give me a second chance. After all the time I spent in inpatient, in residential, the constant therapy, every time I got choked out or had a gun pulled on me by some psycho ex, it’s all been for naught. That was all three years ago and it’s only gotten worse.

I remember distinctly there was one night my boyfriend held me at gunpoint, pulled the trigger with this sadistic fucking smile. Obviously it wasn’t loaded, or I wouldn’t be here, but I wish it was. Because I have no friends, no love life, I haven’t slept with anyone in two years and the last guy I DID sleep with leaked my nudes. Every time I try to put myself out there, I fuck it up outright or just get hurt. So why bother trying? Fuck that, why bother making an effort when it never is worth it?

I’m 21. I have no job, I’m a community college dropout, still living with my mother who would be better off if I was dead and gone. So I might as well be. Not to mention I had a therapist who said I should look into a service animal. Another five grand on top of all my other medical bills, lovely.

I heard “it gets better” for the first time when I was wheeled back to the ward three years ago, and that was a fucking lie. I'm sick of people, sick of being alone, and I'm sick of being a burden to the few people I care about. I’ve got nothing left to live for and even less to lose. So I might as well just fucking do it, God knows I have nobody in my life who would actually miss me. Take my advice, kids. Stay the fuck away from people in general, because this world will only ever hurt you."

-World History teacher (11th grade), earned a C in the class, BUT I was always participating in class and genuinely enjoyed it, and he is the sponsor for Model UN, which has gave him time to know me more personally 6.5-7/10

DISCLAIMER: In my freshman and sophomore years, I earned A’s in all of my core academic classes, which resulted in a 3.9w gpa at the time. However, I lost a family member suddenly in the beginning of my junior year, which led me down a road of severe depression/bad mental health. Also, I struggled to work and do school at the same time. Because of this, most of my classes resulted in a C, and I failed algebra 2 and had to retake it during the summer as credit recovery. I’m planning on explaining the sudden drop in my grades on the additional information section, since I see it as my biggest weakness. I’m doing better now though, and I will be receiving straight As this year.

xbbwvs,9,2022-09-11,I need to vent about my manager refusing to communicate anything to me whatsoever.,allaboutthat01,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xbbwvs/i_need_to_vent_about_my_manager_refusing_to/,"Hi! I wanted to vent somewhere and ask for advice on my current situation. I just started a new job as a fall intern around 2 weeks ago, but my manager is absolutely negligent.

The red flags started popping up even before my first day. I emailed him asking for a quick meeting (as advised by my recruiter) to learn about my team and project a week before my start date. No response. I emailed him again 3 days prior. No response. I only received some kind of communication the Friday evening before my start date, which told me just to call him through his personal number. I’m a little put-off but this is going to be fine…right?

Wrong. On the very first day, I was supposed to go into the office and be shown around. But instead, I was told to onboard remotely. I open up my hardware and start setting up with him through the phone. But oops, we are missing a piece of essential hardware. Where is it? At a UPS dropoff point 10 minutes away by car. It turns out that my manager did not relay this message to me from the IT department last week. I don't have a car so I uber back and forth and waste an hour of my time (and 30 bucks).

I try to set up a recurring weekly sync (required by intern program) with him, but no, since they meet in the office every Friday, I should come in and just find an appropriate time every week.

It's the first Friday. I get to the office but have no idea how to navigate. I message him on his phone for assistance, no answer. I somehow get my badge and find a spot to sit and work. I message him asking for a time to meet. No answer. I push the message again. No answer (but I see that he READ the message). Welp, apparently, he has already left the office because he was sick, and didn't care to tell me.

Now comes this Friday. I message him again notifying him of my availability for our sync. Sends ""OK."" No response to my request to meet. He messages me after business hours saying: we were in the team area but I didn't see you there. Well.... maybe it's because you never cared to tell me where the team area was...?

And yeah, now I'm just fuming and venting on Reddit. It's just so frustrating how he makes it sound like my cluelessness is because of my incompetence and not his negligence and abandonment. The thing is, he sounds like a very nice person in meetings, but is just simply too easygoing.

Should I escalate the situation?

TLDR:

Manager doesn't tell anything to intern and expects him to know everything. Does not respond to messages and does not communicate any kind of guidance. Want to communicate the situation to higher-ups but don't know how to and don't know if it's a good idea."

During my undergrad, the only thing I was focused on was getting a job after college. Parental pressure and financial stress may have contributed significantly to this goal and I pretty much spent all my time doing online courses (20+), building personal projects ( recommendation systems, natural language processing chatbots, visualising path finding algorithms in Unity3D, a web based IDE that helps build, deploy and monitor machine learning/data processing pipelines) and leetcode. Lots and lots of leetcode.

While these helped me land decent internships ( academic internship at a global top 15 University, an internship at one of the largest aircraft manufacturing companies) and jobs ( TA at the university I interned at, a year at a travel tech firm as a software engineer and am currently working at a well known investment bank as a software engineer), I don't really know how much this experience can help me offset my low gpa.

While I don't regret any of the time and effort I put into all these projects, internships and jobs because they helped my family and I become more financially secure (enough to now afford to go to grad school), I understand that I should also have prioritised my GPA.

My undergrad GPA is now set in stone and there's not much I can do to change it. I've since been working on writing research papers in my own time after work ( one's been accepted already and is due to be published this month and am about to finish writing another one).

Will these factors help increase my admission chances or at the very least help make a good case for why my gpa is abysmally low?"

I talked to some experienced developers I knew and I just quit the job and started looking for another one. as much as it hurt but I didn't have any choice.

now almost every available job for developers in my country are in capital or just top big cities and I can not afford to go and every remote position just wants a senior developer with at least a few years of experience. even for internship (which aren't so many to be honest) I have to move

I am thinking of two options here. either get experience which I have no idea how without working in a real job. no matter how many projects I build, it's not the same as workspace. or I might just drop this and look for new skill to learn. because I don't see I can find a job here or move to another city. what should i do? i am really frustrated"

In the month before all the airlines shut down, I was suppose to be in Thailand but of course that got shut down. Accepting that I couldn’t travel I started my masters degree. I’m about 8 months from finishing and found a job I really liked 4 months ago. I ended up having to leave that job (long story) and it broke my heart. I am still recovering from the heartbreak but returned to my old job. I’m in an internship now so I don’t have much homework. I am feeling so stagnant in my life and career. It has made me a bit depressed whereas before I was constantly doing something fun or that furthered my career.

How do I avoid feeling stagnant when I can’t change jobs in my internship (my current job is very flexible) and I can’t travel? Why can’t I just be happy relaxing after two years of a go-go-go lifestyle?"
xbjzfa,21,2022-09-11,Advice on dropping a master's degree for the job,mohit2872,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/xbjzfa/advice_on_dropping_a_masters_degree_for_the_job/,"I would like to provide the full context before I ask the question. 

I have bachelors in computer science and 2 years of experience as a software engineer before I came for my master's in computer science degree in April 2021. I have been doing an internship since June 2022 and by the end of the internship (November), a full-time offer might be given. 

So, assuming that I get the offer, I will have 2 options - either I complete my master's degree and then join the company or straight away join the company. If I go for the first option, then it will take me till August to finish my degree and then I can start my job in September or October. 

My question - Is it worth dropping my degree for the job? I will state why I am considering it. First of all, I think 10 months of job experience are worth more than a master's degree. Secondly, I feel like I am learning a lot of things at my company and in 10 months there will not be just a more useful experience, it will be also more fun. Thirdly, I live in a small German city whereas the job will be in Berlin. So naturally, I am attracted to it. 

My second question - How much worth is a master's degree in Germany (or in Europe) for Software Engineers?

Sorry for the long post. Any feedback would be very much appreciated."

I had a big tech interview lined up, but I got this offer and accepted it, so cancelled that one. And after going through the internship...well I learned a lot about myself and working at a startup. 

It was really fun, you feel really energized about the work, especially if the startup culture is nice. But at the same time it takes a crazy amount of dedication, work, and hackishness to get things to work. At one point, I was coding so much both my hands bruised up. 

Most things you are doing will have limited resources for it. I can go on and on, but just wanted to create this post if anyone was curious about a career as a software engineer at a startup.

I'm a former college dropout that returned to finish my studies back in 2020. Prior to dropping out I had a 1.7 GPA( Yeah I know it's terrible ) and at the moment I've managed to get it up to a 2.79( Still terrible and I plan to leave it off of my resume ). In between dropping out and my re-admittance I worked a career in sales; working as a sales associate and moving up to management, then pivoting over to account management. After being incredibly unhappy with my career I resigned and I went back to finish school full time( I know this wasn't smart. I've got a great support system that allowed me to do it though ). I took no breaks, signed up for every Fall/Spring/Winter/Summer semester possible to finish up school. It took a little longer than I expected to finish because I really struggled picking up where I dropped off but I'm happy to say I'll be graduating at the end of this current Fall semester. 

I can give many excuses as to why I didn't go for an internship but the truth is I lacked the confidence to try to land one. I saw myself as the ""old"" guy in my classes and was far behind everyone else. It doesn't matter now as I can see how detrimental this mentality was/is for me; I should've just thrown myself to the fire and not fear the inevitable rejection that I'm going to face even harder now. I did no real development on myself and just tried to beeline right to the degree. Which leaves me in my current dilemma. 

I've started interview prep but I feel as if none of that is going to matter if I can't get an actual interview. My tech resume is pretty much nonexistent. I've got one project that I had to complete myself for my OOP course; a Space Invaders clone remade on a 2D grid. It definitely needs some TLC before I add it to my resume. It's something I had to work on and present myself since my group members bailed on me entirely. In my spare time I also work on a fitness app that helps track workout sessions as a personal side project but this is far from being complete. My question is what can I do from here on out that will help me stand out?  Should I create more projects to compensate for the lack of experience? Do I bother adding any of my old sales experience on my resume? I completely understand that I am not the ideal FAANG candidate and I'm just looking to be able to break into the industry. 

I know C/C++/Java/SQL/HTML/CSS/JS and I'm currently taking a Machine Learning course so I'm hoping I can add Python to the list soon. I'm not sure if it's relevant but I'm located in NYC."

hey guys, I am getting a very bad college (tier 10) it's a local college near my home.  
I am getting CS with AI and ML. I don't have any prior knowledge of coding so I am entirely on my own. My plan from starting was to go abroad which I will be doing for my master's (hopefully).

I need your advice on how to become a good programmer/developer on my own.

how should I start, how do I take internships from the second year, I have no idea how.  
As I said I have no knowledge of coding so from which language should I start, yt channels, or from where to learn?

The company which hired me, I applied to their software position and they were quick to take my interview and the interview was technical questions related to programming but when they made an offer they made offer for IT position which I accepted because I had no internships and at that time I thought to accept and keep looking before my start date. Unfortunately I couldn't find any other thing as they were lookin or asking for internships and the offers I do got were like 30K to 50K when the offer I accepted was for 70K. The company also allow rotations after 18 months. Now the issue which I need some advice or guidance is that ,considering the current situation of companies hiring freeze and companies laying off people should I stay at this job and company and after 18 months rotate to software position or should I just start applying other entry level software position?"
xbptar,1,2022-09-11,Anxiety about feeling incompetent while applying to first internship as an older career changer,VoluminousCheeto,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xbptar/anxiety_about_feeling_incompetent_while_applying/,"I need some real advice on how to deal with anxiety that's causing me to avoid applying to internships. I'm in my 30s and never finished my degree, so I've gone back to school recently and changed my major to computer science. I've mostly only taken CS50 and studied other introductory material. I did well in the course (completing all the more difficult problem sets except for Tideman) and created a little algorithm visualization web app as my final project. My Leetcode skills are weak. I still struggle with easies and mediums, and I do not have enough experience with graphs or trees. At this point I've only completed 18 mediums and 70 easy questions, and not all of them are optimal time/space complexity. 

I've heard how important internships are and how badly I need them, but I feel like I'm not even good enough for it to be worth applying. I think there's a high chance I'll fail any technical interview or even the online assessment because my algo &amp; ds skills are subpar. I don't want to embarrass myself. I want to apply when I'm actually a competent programmer and can do leetcode easies without struggling. But the season is now and I feel like I'm missing my opportunity. 

TLDR; I've basically only taken CS50 and I'm still terrible at leetcode. I feel like I'm doomed to fail any interview so it's not even worth applying until I improve. But I desperately need an internship, and I'm letting my fear of being trash stop me from applying. 

What should I do? Take more time to get better and put off applying, or bite the bullet and enjoy failing?"

I have a B.S. in Math from a state school and this is my fourth semester in the OMSCS program. I'm specifically interested in becoming a full-stack software engineer as I enjoyed the CS 6400 course project. 

I'm looking for some advice on what I should doing to prepare for this career change. I'm thinking about applying to internships in about a year at some big tech companies, and I'd like to know what I can do to set myself apart from the other applicants. This semester I'm taking CS 6300 and CS 6310 while studying data structures and algorithms in my free time. I'm planning on taking next semester off or taking a very light course while I focus on building small projects and learning as much as I can about web development.

Is this a good plan? Is there anything else I should be doing to get ahead? What are some cool small projects I could make to show to potential employers? Would I even be considered by top tech companies with my background?

Any advice from current software engineers would be appreciated!"

Is it worth having the semi-speculative bullet points or should I just write the position without anything beneath it?

I was able to be a TA for multiple intro courses. I later went on to intern as a Creative for my University's print/design department. This carried into an internship at a great Advertising Agency prior to completing college. 

Where things go off the rails is after college. I accepted a dream job at a major Ad Agency in Chicago that many would envy to have on their resume. I came in and started to continue the path for creating excellent work, mapping out my future in the industry in the process. 

However, I had a dark secret. I was an alcoholic and drug addict, struggling to stay alive at the age of 23. I eventually got help and treatment, which resulted in me having to leave this dream job. I moved back home and wasn't able to work for nearly a full year due to the dire state I was in and the amount of help I needed. 

Moving to a small town in Arizona, I had few options in the way of a good-paying job. I ended up joining a big corporation, training in business management. I was very good at it and kept making artwork on the side. I met my wife while I was there, and eventually, we moved to a big city as we wanted to have more opportunities.

 Somehow, it's been nearly 7 years since practicing design professionally. I have remained sober that entire time and welcomed my first child in late 2022. My child changed me when I looked at him. I didn't want to die thinking I gave up a budding design career. I have been motivated to make a change. 

I am so conflicted and confused at this stage. I have 7 years of business management experience and have been out of professional design for so long, that I don't know how I can get back in. I am extremely unhappy and disappointed in my career path, but it helped me stay sober and stay connected with my family. I still have a great (but dated) portfolio, and I recently built my own website with newer art I have created.

I do have a full time job, but if anyone has extra beginner work/ tasks they can have me do and help me through it I can do a few hours a week.

I enjoy webdev and I primarily do projects based around it, but I also fear that I'm somehow pigeonholing myself into a webdev career by spending less time in Java or C, and while I know money isn't the biggest thing - webdev of all the fields in CS seem to be on the lower end of the payscale since they require less theory and are a bit more open to bootcampers and self-taught.

Am I worrying too much, and should just keep coding what I like to code and not worry about it? How much does the type of projects on a resume matter for big tech so long as they are decent and show effort? Does having a webdev focused resume put me at a disadvantage?"

so i was scrolling on tiktok the other day and one was about Noah Schnapp and Upenn and in the comments, so many people were like ¨since when is UPenn an ivy league???¨ And im just like ¨... how do you not know that Upenn is an Ivy league?¨

bcuz in my mind, knowing all eight ivies by the time you´re in 7th grade is common knowledge. Its like knowing your ABCs. So that really got me thinking ¨...im living in a different world, arent i?¨

A world with many many of yall A2Cers.... cuz ik know a lot of yall are like me.

Also on tiktok, theres this thing going around where its like ¨When the honors classes are really honoring¨or ¨When you realize the AP work is really hard and you can´t just say youre an AP student.¨ And idk, I just thought these tiktoks were always really weird because to me, its EXPECTED for say a junior to take 3 to 6 APs. It´s not like some ¨advanced class¨ in my eyes. Yes its hard, but its expected for you to take them to me. Like AP student? What do you mean, taking 5 APs is normal...

And its also like when I see people listing out their extracurriculars and its just like maybe four or five ecs listed that are like ¨babysitting my siblings¨ or ¨art club member.¨ 

And im just like ¨wait... so are you saying there are people out there who arent president of 3 clubs, didnt do research at an ivy league, didnt do famous MIT summer programs, didnt play violin for the president of the united states, didnt write a 50 page science research paper, didnt win a national science competition, didnt win national math counts, didnt do a prestigious internship, who arent national merit scholarship finalists, ETC??????¨

And ik how shitty this thinking is. like art club member? babysitting? thats awesome fr. but my toxic mind cant seem to fathom not doing a shit ton of stuff in high school. I feel like most of us are in this prestigious univerity ivy league college admissions cult. Anyone else feel this way? Its fr a cult. Not A2C- but this mindset. 

And believe me, yall dont have to tell me any of that ¨it doesnt matter where you go because youll find your path¨ crap because ive heard it. Believe me when I say I dont want to be like this- i dont even know how i came to be like this. I just dont know how to escape this cult mindset."

Location Germany.

I am a student and was in a urgent need of a Laptop back in 2020. In May 2020 during covid I bought a Dell Laptop from eBay kleineanzeigen. Advertisement was officially posted by the seller. After having a chat on eBay kleineanzeigen and a zoom call to see the product, we finalized a price. 

I travelled to his location and got the Laptop and paid the money in cash. The laptop had a warranty until 2022. The seller said did not had the invoice bill so I made a hand written bill with his signature and the money received.

In April 2022 I had issues with the Laptop, so I called the Dell customer service, and there I got to know that the Laptop officially belongs to a company. I coordinated with the customer service executive and send them the bill I made with the seller, and asked if any more information is required from my side. The warranty expired in May 20222.

Now, in September I received a letter from Police as Vorladung zur Zeugenvernehmung in German language (subpoena for witnesses). I did translation, the letter says the Laptop was stollen and has the seller name in it. I need to visit the Police office.

So far, I have the Hand written bill, the train tickets I used to travel to his location with me. The chat history is unfortunately not available in my eBay kleineanzeigen account. Not sure how eBay kleineanzeigen can help here.

Will this cause any legal problem to me? Can anyone please guide as to what are the next steps to proceed? I am in the mid of my internship. My German is not so good and I am very nervous and worried.

I (18M) am a 2nd year CS &amp; engineering under grad student. I am clueless about my life and I have no confidence on myself.  I used to be a bright student at school until 8th grade. I started falling apart when I lost my brother when I was in grade 9. Since then I haven’t been focusing on my academics . So clearly when I graduated from high school I didn’t have a great academic record. I had those bad habits which pulled me down too. I turned into an introvert. Had limited friends and didn’t speak of any personal issues to them.  I somehow using my dad’s connections got into one of the best unis in the city I live in. Here, since I’m not a bright student it has been hard since day 1, I had just managed to not fail any course in my first year. I am not happy about my grades. 

I don’t know my interests, as of now I don’t play or follow any sport, don’t know   to play a musical instrument, haven’t developed any required technical skills. Our entire family has been grieving since my brother’s demise 5 years ago.

I have a handful of friends. I feel awkward  and hesitant to talk to new people. I think the others feel the same about me.I find it difficult to speak to my existing friends as well.

Enough said about my past,

Currently:

- My knowledge in programming is just as much as a high school student.

- My mental health is pretty messed up

- I don’t have a good academic record

- My family isn’t at a rly good phase and I need to be helping them out of it but I’m not.


- I lose hope in myself when I see my peers accomplishing greater stuff like doing competitive programming,working on huge coding projects, writing research papers, investing and trading stocks, participating in hackathons, getting internships, involving in community sevice and extra curriculars Which I must also be doing at my age.
I would say my life is stuck at one place.


Deep down I have the desire for a life where:

-I am physically and mentally

- Me and my family are happy 

- I feel confident about myself

- I study well and get good grades

- I have good problem solving skills

- I work by myself to learn and practice coding

- I hangout or play with friends

- I read self- help books

- I know investing.

- I speak to people confidently and make new friend.

- I am interested in a artform and work on it. 

And such stuff.

I don’t where to start and I don’t have consistency in what I do but I always but I always wish to become the person I want to.


THANKS FOR READING IT TILL HERE,  I AM OPEN TO WHATEVER YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY.

EXCUSE ME IF I HAVEN’T WRITTEN IN COHERENT WAY."

So basically, the entire day is free for me to study(and job hunt). My question is, how many hours should I be studying?

I seem to hit a wall at 6 hours a day basically practicing python, learning linux, bash, IaC tools like Terraform, AWS, etc.(6 hours a day 7 days a week currently)

I thought 6 hours a day of focused studying was decent(weekends included), until someone told me I should be studying 8-10 hours a day since I am not currently working.

I thought he was being unreasonable until I searched on Reddit and found that many coders spending 10+ hours a day studying, which seems insane to me. I even read posts about people in IT who get off work and then spend an additional 3+ hours studying studying the latest and greatest new DevOps tools.

Am I just being lazy? Or should I seriously ramp up my efforts in order to be successful in the DevOps field?"

I’m a 5th year STEM major, this is my last year at Davis. The problem is, I think UC Davis was the wrong university choice for me. I never made any lasting friendships at Davis (and in fact was super hurt by some of the ones I had), it’s way too far from home and I hate doing long distance with my boyfriend, I don’t have anything to go back to when I move in for Fall Quarter (no clubs, events, friends, etc.) just job I'm not that excited for, and I have nothing to look forward to when I go other than coming back home to see my boyfriend and other friends. My therapist’s advice when I started last school year with the same problem was to try to make some friends and connections in the city. My brother lives in Davis with his wife and two kids, and I want to see them and feel a little less alone, but I feel like they’re way too busy to have time to hang out with me. I tried to join clubs and talk to people in class and be social, but I always felt anxious and never felt connected to anyone and never made any friendships that weren’t superficial or toxic, not to mention everyone has established friend groups now and it's too late for me as a 5th year to start making new friends. I feel like everyone in my major is smarter than me and my GPA is barely a 3.0 and even though I a lab position and had an internship and some other things, I feel like I’m just not up to par with everyone else.

I honestly don’t know what to do. I keep telling myself that it’s only one more year and I already have my apartment rent and other things in Davis to pay for, so I might as well stay and tough it out, but being in Davis has a really bad effect on my mental health. Last school year I was so depressed that I cried myself to sleep (on the nights that I could sleep) and most nights I just stared at the ceiling until I had to go to class. I prayed that the days would go faster so that I could go home. I’m so burned out and depressed that I just want to drop out and go home and be happy. I’m really scared about moving back into my apartment and starting school next week, and I was hoping that a UCD student who may have been in my position or something similar could give me some solid advice. Or maybe someone who loves it here can convince me to as well, I'm open to trying.

\*

Note to any incoming freshmen reading this: This is just my experience, and most of the people I know at Davis love the university and enjoy their time there. Please don’t let this discourage you from UCD or college as a whole, I am part of a very small minority who had a bad time."

Current position:

I am currently doing a software engineering internship at Intel but I am not really developing my software engineering skills at the speed I can if I go by myself.

Plan:

I am planning to quit the internship and quit school and start solving problems by building software applications.

Background:

I have been developing for 1.5 years and have around 9 months of work experience. I have a base of full stack development and software engineering but I lack knowledge of some things like deployment, testing, and systems designing. The stack I am mainly going to use involves: React (Typescript), Nest.js, TypeORM SQL, Docker and Github

Goal:

What I want to achieve is being able to solve problems and build software applications on a lower/medium scale (this is important because I don't see myself working on large-scale projects alone, because it takes more time, more people, and is more complex. Also if I am at that point, I can hire people who have better knowledge than me to learn from). I want to be able to develop as fast as possible with sufficient clean code/architecture (again the goal is to solve the problem as fast as possible with the lowest sufficient ""clean score"", not build the cleanest software possible). Obviously, there is importance in clean code but up to a certain point, does it REALLY matter? I doubt it. There are plenty of people making a bunch of money with meh code. I want to be able to get an MVP in &lt; 1 month (a bit vague haha). I also doubt I need to know the ins and outs of f.e Kafka, Kubernetes and have a ci/cd pipeline that takes 3 hours to complete.

Question:

How can I achieve this? How can I go from being able to program on a junior/low medior engineer to a ""coding god"", where can I learn how to be able to define clear problems, develop things, test things and deploy things as fast as possible?"

I graduated from university around two months ago, I don't like parties so I just didn't want to go to the graduation party (mind you this was the best decision i ever made in my entire life) , around the end of the semester I had a seminar, I specifically told my parents I just mom and dad to come ONLY and they said they will come by themselves with no one else,  a few days before the siminar I get a text that the person who had molested me as a child is coming, I told them not to bring him, and they made a big deal that I am fussing over the fucking person who had ruined my life, so they decide that they don't want to come to the seminar, I kept my cool, went about my day untill I find out that my perents came with my sister and nephew to the city where my university is but they are not coming to the seminar, I shake things off like nothing happened, to my horror my ""sister"" comes to the siminar asking for my dorm keys, and embarrassed me infront of my friends who were trying to comfort me. 
I go home, they are all mad, I go about my 2 weeks there, I ask my dad for rent money for the previous month and he tells me to evict because he doesn't want to give me more money.
 I evict, my sister comes to the evicted dorm, makes a fuss , calls my dad, and for some reason i am a liar and I stole the rent money for the month of eviction! 
Just to make this a little more horrifying, my sister gets her own dorm for a year :). 
It doesn't end there, I go look for a job, I find an internship for 3 months online and onsite in the same city, I live with a friend of mine who actually works with me, my dad calls me and tells me to come home or else he would kill me, I fucking can't take this anymore. 
Now, I don't have any money, I am depressed, and I am constantly crying and thinking about killing my self. 
My dad has no right to tell me what to do, he left me with no money, he doesn't want me to work and thinks that i am an embarrassment, he treats my other family members well, and it's just only me who I'm treated like this.

Quick Background:

I am currently working as a help desk technician for a pretty good company. Work is great, I am just VERY bored and burnt out, I basically do this job blindfolded now and now I am looking to move into the cloud - specifically CloudOps / Cloud Engineering. Honestly, my primary motivation for this is that I love the flexibility of the cloud and the opportunity it provides for remote work, and from what I've seen even junior cloud workers are paid pretty well in my opinion. I want to be focused more on the operation side, sort of SysOps admin. I do not want to do Development on a deep level. I can surface-level work on most things and i have a degree in computer science so im no stranger to python, c++, java, etc. but I am by no means a software engineer or anything like that. I don't mind coding when necessary thought. I want to gradually get exposed and become more knowledgeable in that regard (Dev side) but my primary focus is becoming an architect later on and for now just getting my feet wet as a cloud engineer.

I was thinking of applying to AWS for roles like ""Cloud Engineer - Data/Networking"" and such. I am wondering if anyone is able to give me a quick rundown of what that may be like? What should i expect? Any general thoughts or info is appreciated, and some more questions below.

Some specific questions:

1. Is it a meat grinder environment? I've seen a few posts describing it as such; and if so, should I even bother? Or should I look for a position elsewhere maybe at a smaller company or something?
2. I've seen ranges from 50-70k and from 70-100k for this same position at AWS from different sources; What would be more realistic? 50-70k? No way a junior is starting off at 80-100k; Right? Glassdoor shows avg is 112k for me. I currently am in the 70k range with my current position (total comp, this is OT, bonuses, etc. base is like 42k but i work a lot of OT and am involved in a lot of things so) and would prefer to not go lower than that even if it is for experience and i'd be working less and all. So, would I realistically get a junior position that offers better, or is that unrealistic?
3. I primarily need exposure and experience. I've completed cloud practitioner and SAA certs - currently in progress for SysOps Admin Cert - I plan to go to a professional level or specialty level at some point. I need practical hands-on AWS experience beforehand though. I don't mind a junior intern or trainee type of environment/job but would that be the best method, or should I just go for AWS and jump right in and hope for the best? If i get cut at least i have tons of exposure and (hopefully) am paid well for that time?
4. Any other general tips, tricks, advice or anything of the sort that you may have for me? I am hoping to make this switch soon and dive right in. I appreciate any input"

My internship will be ending in a couple of months but would be good if I could somehow work for them part-time while on school. Aside from engineering duties, I am also working with Smartsheets for our project and portfolio management. I have built a couple of automated tools that isnt available on Smartsheet to make life easy  using Python via the Smartsheet API. It was recognized by the team and said have done a good job considering this is just a side task for me.

THE QUESTION:
 The resource management add on in Smartsheet will now be paid and it is a very neat tool! I am thinking of creating a dedicated website for this add on containing the resource management application which I will make from scratch and improve it as time goes by. I know Python but not web dev. From research, I would need to learn HTML/CSS and JS for if I want to be able to build web apps and use Python as backend. Would this be reasonable project to start with?"

xcedtj,2,2022-09-12,I feel like I made the worst decision for my career and don’t know where to go from here.,blueline7677,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xcedtj/i_feel_like_i_made_the_worst_decision_for_my/,"During college I (24M) got an internship with company X and they hired me full time doing logistics planning. I was located in Indianapolis Indiana which wasn’t ideal but I really enjoyed the job. When I started full time Covid created some issues but after a few months the job was great again. One year ago they announced we were closing the Indianapolis office and that we were losing the account for company Y that I was on. I was ultimately left with 3 options.

Option 1. Stay with company X and move to either Livonia MI or Harrisburg PA. But I have had talks with my managers about future promotion opportunities as I was a top performer in my role and took on a unofficial team lead role.

Option 2. Company Y ended the contract to bring the work internal. They noticed I was a top performer and told me to apply where it felt implied the job was guaranteed. Ultimately they gave me one interview in which 90% of it was them trying to convince me to join them. It was the same office as I was previously in because they actually owned the office space company X was using. Company Y offered about a 15% raise + better benefits.

Option 3. Look for jobs elsewhere and relocate to a more desirable city. I’m from the east coast and didn’t want to stay in the Midwest forever.

Ultimately I chose I mix between option 2 and 3. I applied to jobs in cities I wanted to be in while I waited for the whole hiring process for Company Y. I was applying for jobs elsewhere because while company Y certainly felt like a sure thing I don’t consider it a sure thing until I have an offer in hand.

I ended getting a position at company Y to start in December and I stopped applying at that time. I loved it there it was noticeable better doing the work internally than as a 3rd party and I already loved the old job. There was also very little transition because I knew everything. About 2-3 months into working at Company Y company Z reached out to me for an interview. I applied to hundreds of jobs so they weren’t the 1st company to reach out to me after I started at company Y but they were located in NOVA which was my top destination so I took the interview because why not. Company Z is still in supply chain but I am in a buyer role so it was a new experience and a solid step in my career.

I ended up getting and taking the job after being with company Y for just 4 months the money was 5K more but that doesn’t account for the increased cost of living but I wanted the location. They also gave me a 5K relocation bonus that I have to pay back a portion of if I leave before 2 years. 

Fast forward 5.5 months and I hate this job. I was really good at my old job and I am awful at this job. I loved all my old co-workers and old manager and worked closely with most of them. Here I don’t work closely with many people and the ones I do I don’t really like and I dislike my manager. I believe I have valid reasons for these feelings based on conversations I’ve had with other people. While I do love the area and love being closer to my best friends it’s more expensive and I feel like I haven’t been happy in like 3 months. I also fear I could get fired any day for poor performance because like I said I’m bad at the job.

At this point I believe that either options 1 or 2 would have been better for me both professionally and personally. I also face the dilemma that if I do leave company Z I will have 2 short term jobs on my resume back to back which will look bad. I can explain one easily but 2 is where it gets hard. I’m also afraid if I stick it out too long I’ll get fired making it even harder to explain. 

I just don’t know what I should do from here."

Are there any recommended machine learning/AI certifications/courses that I could possibly use to push myself forward into the career I’d like? I know Google has a TensorFlow certification but I’ve heard that it’s not very useful in getting jobs since it doesn’t show mastery in the field.

This  got a little rambly so tl;dr Mid 30's, new career change and working as  paid intern for 6 months at first CS related job, but given little to  no work (despite asking for it). Do you stay for experience, how long,  etc?

I'm currently in a  not-quite-midlife career change and for the past 6 months have interned  with a large local employer that likes to hire from the school I attend  (currently in my last semester). I was so excited when I applied to the  internship because it would get my foot in the door into a career in  application development, plus it also paid almost 2x what my previous  job offered (with a bachelors in an unrelated field).

My  excitement continued the first week or two as I was learning a lot  everyday (almost always on my own). I was told to shadow one of the team  leads, and so I started doing that next. So far he's been a great  mentor and has taught me a lot about the inner workings of the company,  but the work that he breaks off for me is so underwhelming that at times  it feels like a joke. Generally it will be a task that takes less than a  few minutes and I'm told that there's no rush to finish. I've had one  project that took  me more than a day of actual work, and it made me  feel excited again because I thought I was going to start having more  responsibility, but soon I was back to having absolutely nothing to do.  Also, my immediate supervisor transferred to our team shortly after I  did and literally had no experience with any of our systems, so when I  ask him if he has any projects he just refers me to the team lead.  Ultimately I spend my workday doing homework, reading programming books  and working on personal projects, trying leetcode problems and browsing  reddit.

I personally dislike a lot of the job (it's mainframe work and I'm trained in [ASP.NET/JSP](https://asp.net/JSP)),  dislike the office environment (although I do like my teammates), but I  can look past these factors when I'm actively engaged in a project and  using my mind to solve problems. However, when I spend 6-8 hrs a day  just waiting for the hours to pass, I feel like I'm wasting my life and  harming my career before it even really begins.

I  also want to add there's a 99.9% chance this will be a full-time  position once I graduate. Long story short, I want to know what others  would do in this position? Do I finish out the internship while  looking/applying for other jobs and hope something better comes along?  Do I finish the internship and remain employed for a few years in order  to gain experience that will make me a more attractive candidate for a  job down the road?

One thing about my college application that I do not feel positively of is the fact that I have a disciplinary record, there had been a few instances where I had been suspended from school due to a disciplinary violation so I feel like that could negatively affect my chances of getting into college a lot, however, I guess I could turn it into something positive by explaining to them how I had changed and improved since that. 

I'm applying ED to carnegie mellon school of computer science, and I'm applying RD to all other schools."

I have considered doing a PhD, and have began looking at schools to apply to. However, many schools I am considering only offer admissions for fall semester, which would conflict when I'm still in the MS program. I imagine circumstances such as this may be on a case by case basis for the university and I will ask admissions reasonably soon about what could be done. However if nothing can be done, for those who have moved from a MS to a PhD at a different institution, what is typical to do in gap year (internships, sabbatical, etc.?), or is it common to not finish a MS and transfer to a PhD? I will also put it out there I have considered spending a few years in industry instead and I think this may help me decide whether to do a PhD."

I've had to direct most of my questions to the senior dev/architect, and i haven't had much success in getting the information I need. The main issue is that if I ask a question of him, 9 times out of 10 he doesn't actually listen. This has resulted in multiple occurrences of me trying to restate the question in a more understandable way. This more often than not results in him becoming increasingly short and pissed off at me.  He's pretty high ranking, and my boss has even said that he can be temperamental. Many days I end up not being able to do much work, because I'll ask him once, not get anything approaching a coherent response, and then say okay and drop the question for fear of pissing him off. Sadly, there isn't really anyone else in the office that can help. When I've asked others, they generally just say they don't know, and direct me back to the aforementioned individual. Is this type of behavior common / to be expected when you're an apprentice or an intern? I'm kind of at a loss as to how to deal with it."
xcwhix,1,2022-09-12,Am I unintentionally burning bridges?,unintentionalarson,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/xcwhix/am_i_unintentionally_burning_bridges/,"ABA worker, working with kids with autism.

I've been working for quite some time now at one school site.  I've often been tasked with students who have high aggression, difficult behaviors, etc. and worked with them for extended periods of time.  Most cases people switch off MWF and TTH.  I've been tasked several times for full M-F coverage, which is nearly unheard of in most cases.  Often times I've also had to work with difficult parents who make requests beyond our professional/ethical guidelines.  In the 7-8 years I've been working there there have been no complaints from my end nor from the higher ups.

Well this is my last year at the district (i'm in grad school) and I'm coming off of two back to back years of aggressive students in classrooms that were woefully shortstaffed.  In short, I'm burnt out.  This year I was again tasked with a high-intensity student, but one who I didn't feel comfortable working with (can't go too deep into it for privacy reasons) and I requested to be taken off.  This is my first time ever making such a request.  Due to my unfortunately opening my mouth word got out I was ready to quit if this wasn't met which got up to my supervisor.

We're close as we've known each other a while but definitely professional.  He asked if this was true as it didn't sound like me, and I confirmed.  I said in sum:

I just don't feel comfortable dealing with this particular student and the level of care he needs.  Parent also has a history of unfounded accusations towards the school staff.  I didn't want my last year here to be marred by difficult experience with student/parent.  Thing is years of dealing with tantrums and aggression wear on you.  I will start internships by next fall and this will be my last year. I didn't feel like it was too big of an ask to avoid one student after eight years.

He seemed miffed and that was the end.

I couldn't handle another difficult year just for my own mental health/professional safety.  I've been running too hard for too many years. Request was granted and the general tone has shifted at work, which sucks but I can deal with.  I can handle my coworkers being mad at me for 'pushing off' the student on to them and while that's hard on me and is understandable, i've also dealt with plenty of high risk students already. 

Thing is I've been looking for a new job since the summer.  We're going to lose two more staff in the coming months.  

It feels like this incident is going to reflect poorly on my references if I were to get a new job.  I do have teachers (at work) who would be willing to vouch for me but I think it would be suspicious that I don't list my supervisor.  It also feels shitty leaving them shorthanded.  I didn't say that I planned on finishing out the year but I think they may have inferred so given the context so leaving after getting what I wanted seems like it'd be extra shitty.

xcz9fj,3,2022-09-13,Should I (21M) get tested for ADHD?,buildabruce,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/xcz9fj/should_i_21m_get_tested_for_adhd/,"I've been thinking about getting tested for ADHD for a while now, but I don't know if I should. I feel like a lot of people joke that they ""probably have ADHD"" so I really don't know whether my experiences warrant testing or if I'm just being dramatic. To be clear, I am NOT ASKING IF I HAVE ADHD. I'm just wondering if my situation warrants a psychiatric evaluation/if it would actually help and what I should try to manage myself right now. 

A little background on me. I grew up in a family where ADHD was mainly seen as an excuse for white people to justify their misbehaved children's behavior (sorry if that's offensive), so I never really took it seriously. Most people I knew with ADHD struggled in school, while I always found it rather easy. I guess I was very forgetful, talkative, and often interrupted others, but most adults found my talkativeness entertaining so it was never an issue. I also never got in trouble for being fidgety in class; in fact, most teachers praised me for being well-behaved (aside from the talking).

Currently, I am a senior in college and my inability to do anything on time is really starting to impact my daily life. I've tried almost every anti-procrastination method known to man (Calendars, To-do lists, the Pomodoro method, the X-effect method, physical reminders around the house, exercise, etc.), but nothing sticks. Though I try to wake up hours before my first time commitment, I'm somehow still always late. I'm 1 warning away from being fired from my part-time job. I'm also currently developing an app for a close-ish friend and it's embarrassing that I constantly find myself missing deadlines, canceling meetings, and making up excuses for why I can't show her the progress on the most recent deliverable (surprise, surprise... it's not done). We planned to have a working prototype by last month and even now it's—at most—half-done. I'm trying to apply for software engineering jobs right now, but it pains me that all I have to show for is 4 incomplete certificates, 7 half-finished projects, and 0 internships.

My friends are the main reason I'm considering getting tested for ADHD. They're worried about how I'll survive in the ""real world"" and have been pushing me to get diagnosed for the past 4 years. They point to my forgetfulness, impulsiveness, lateness, ""excessive"" procrastination, inability to multitask, and tendency to interrupt others as ""symptoms"", but I always contend that those issues aren't unique to ADHD. However, one friend whose brother has ADHD told me about ""hyper-focusing"" which is what made me really start to consider getting tested.

I've seen what others have to say about having ADHD online (including on this subreddit) and I relate to a lot—but not all—of it. I zone out/autopilot too often; tasks aren't real until they're due tomorrow; and my brain is too fast and too fickle. But what if it's just a self-fulling prophecy? I don't have 4 internal monologues going on at once—just 1 monologue managing what feels like too many thoughts. Admittedly, I've tried non-prescription Adderall and it helped a lot (though I try to use it only in the most dire cases). Taking it not only improves my focus, but also makes me feel more 'present'—if that makes sense—especially when I'm talking to people. But then again, what if I've just developed an Adderall dependence? I'm constantly changing my mind. Some days I feel like maybe a diagnosis could be helpful and other days I am annoyed at myself for blaming my laziness on anything but me.

Overall, do I have a reason to get diagnosed? I feel like these are normal people problems that I'm just bad at dealing with. What would a diagnosis even provide me besides the peace of mind that I (a) am actually a lazy POS or (b) have ADHD? Additionally, as individuals who clinically struggle with getting stuff done, what can I do to fix this all on my own? I'd especially appreciate hearing from those that chose to get diagnosed as adults. What made you do it?"

I recently (as of the last week of August) began a paid internship with the IT department in my state. It requires me to take a 15-week long coding bootcamp. I then began school the week after.

Here’s the thing though. I was diagnosed with a pituitary adenoma back in May. This is a tumor in the pituitary gland near my brain. I am currently on medication which reduces the size of it. The tumor alongside my medication have caused issues with my cognitive function and energy levels, and balancing school with work has shown to be very difficult. The workload is around 5+ hours of videos per week and a homework project at the end of the week. This may not seem like too much, but my condition adds significant difficulty to this. I usually lay down and rest after watching just 30 minutes worth of videos. I am also exhausted and have trouble focusing in my actual classes.

I’m regretting ever starting this internship. I feel sick and tired constantly and I also feel symptoms of low mood/depression due to the hormonal issues this condition brings. I feel very guilty quitting because of how much work it took for them to get me onboarded (getting me all my equipment, ID, etc in such a short period) and then suddenly quitting on them. I also obviously like the paid aspect of the internship. It is a bit nice to have some extra money.

I really I don’t know where to go from here. I’m definitely leaning more towards quitting, but it all seems so sudden."

I recently applied for a TikTok internship because I really liked their product and was interested to learn more about the technical challenges they are facing while growing so quickly. I have a good CV with great grades from a top university and multiple projects and work experience. 

However, I really wanted to stand out from other applicants because working at TikTok was a dream of mine for a while.

At the beginning of the summer I decided to start a project that is related to TikTok in some way. I thought it would be a great way to show my dedication. 

I spent several months building a mobile app which enables TikTok users to see detailed analytics about their follower engagement and track who unfollowed them etc. I published the app on the app store and mentioned it in my CV. There I explained my motivation behind it, the tech stack that I used and included a link to the app store listing.

On the very next day I did not only receive a rejection, but also a trademark infringement complaint from TikTok asking me to remove the app from the app store. Reason for this being that my app uses the word “Tok” in its name.

Especially since covid, I have had difficulty separating work time and free time, as my work space and private space were equally inseparable (I am a student living in a small apartment). This means I work, study, eat, and rest in the same general space.

During my internship (and in the midst of the pandemic) this became problematic. My internship was in a hybrid/work-from-home configuration so I would only visit the office a few times per week. As the lines between work space, rest space, work time, and rest time became blurred, my productivity shattered. I would frequently take breaks that would last hours and became easily distracted at any minor inconvenience from my job. As a result, I started feeling guilty of my lack of productivity during a work day and started extending my work time. I would (try to) continue working into the dark hours of the day, first 7-8PM, then until 10PM, to compensate for my low productivity. I would be exhausted, have no real 'free time', and when I did (such as on weekends), I would feel incredibly guilty, and feel I did not deserve that time off. Consequentially, I would feel uncomfortable and frequently think about work or desperately try to do some more work in the weekends to comfort my guilt. As a result, I never relaxed, I never had any time to recharge, and my productivity was terrible nonetheless.

During a conversation with my therapist we came up with the idea of 'scheduled free time', where I would quite literally plan an entire day as 'free' (for example, Sundays), and put this in my planner as such.

So far, it has done me wonders. I feel no guilt about my free time because it is literally planned in my schedule. I would still worry about work, productivity, and feel guilty if I had an unproductive day during the workweek, but I would not allow that on this day. I agreed with my therapist that I would not think about or do any work. I would not open my emails on that day. I would put my work laptop away and not use it that day. I could do whatever I wanted on that day; do nothing, go out, play games, anything. This allowed me to consider 'free time' as being productive, because having a day of free time means I accomplished what was on my planner for that day.

It is only a small psychological change in mindset. In reality, nothing has really changed. I still face the same issues with productivity and I am still working on that. This is not some 'magic cure' for AD(H)D. But what it has done for me, is allow me to take genuine, proper rest on a day, and really properly recharge myself. Since implementing this technique I have felt happier and more well rested. It is something I would love to recommend to everyone here who feels they are struggling with feeling guilty about having free time. Good luck and update me on your progress!

TL:DR

Due to my lack of productivity, as a result from my ADD and working from home, I would often feel guilty about taking time off. As a result, I would never feel well rested or relaxed, even on weekends, because I was always worrying about work or feeling guilty. During my therapy, we came up with the idea of 'scheduled free time', where I would quite literally schedule a day of 'free time' in my planner. I was not allowed to think about or do any work related things. It is only a small change in mindset, but it has changed the way I enjoy my free time. It has made me much happier and well rested. I recommend you to try it!"

I have been lurking this community for a short while, and I have already learned so much, so for that I am thankful to you all. I just have some questions for people who are actively in the CS community about my particular situation, and things I can do to make myself more competitive.

So, I am currently active-duty military, and I am going to school for Computer Science. Because I am active duty, it really limits the schools I can go to, however the school I do attend is accredited appropriately. It isn't like Vanderbilt by any means though. Will my school not being super prestigious hurt me? Also, since I am active-duty I cannot do an internship at some major tech company prior to my separation date. I feel like this is going to hurt me. Will it? 

Some things I think I have going for me are that I have a security clearance, and I have worked as a technician for the last 8 years. Some super vague details on my job are that I conducted preventative and corrective maintenance on classified sonar equipment to include troubleshooting both software and hardware issues. I have worked in the past with GE, Lidos, and Oracle. 

Basically, am I going to be competitive when I graduate and separate the service? If not, what can I do to be more competitive? Should I pursue some CompTIA certifications to go along with my degree? Google certs? Salesforce certs? Leetcode my butt off? Where should I try to get hired on at? I would like to go work for some major tech company, but should I try and stick with the contractor option? Any advice would be much appreciated, and I thank you all for any you can provide."

The reports coming in off of the dig site are fascinating in the extreme. To find out that so much of our early history was unknown to us is remarkable. The rationale we used to bury over the loss of so much of our history and culture - that the many early stellar wars among our kind did irreparable damage to our understanding of those ages long past that began our journey into the stars - that rationale seems so feeble now in light of the artifacts and data we have been able to retrieve from this wayward moon out in darkspace. How it got there is as much a mystery to the archeologists as why it contains so many relics from the lost past. 

How I wish I could be out there with them. Alas, someone has to stay and run the institute - crunching numbers, reconciling balance sheets, managing staffing, justifying projects and studies to the council's budgetary subcommittee. Shoot me. 

In any case, I'm glad that Dorat is leading the excavation team. Even with the light lag - two and a half standard years - the new discoveries are coming in at so rapid a pace that I don't have any doubts the council will be willing to enact my new proposed budget. To think, adding three dozen researchers to a project that at present has four - so much good work will get done. I need to give this moon a name - one that invokes the sense of wonder I feel. I read over Dorat's report and a line within caught my eyes: ""To think that so many treasures would be sitting in the first chamber we've managed to access within this reliquary makes the effort to breach into the next chambers so enticing.""

Reliquary. Yes, I think that is a fitting name indeed. Reliquary of all our unremembered past. Reliquary of guidance for our future.

&amp;#x200B;

***Log Entry: 742***

The council expanded my proposed budget! They're giving our team enough resources to accomplish in just a few standard years what would have taken decades - a lifetime even! I cannot put to words what this will mean for the excavation on Reliquary. Even the intern was thrilled, I think so anyway... so hard to tell with humans - why can't they express emotion pheromones like most other species? In any case, the human intern, Hossan Smith, has proven useful in giving an outsider's perspective on the data coming in from Reliquary. In fact, it was Hossan that proposed that the first chamber - now almost fully excavated - was built to serve as a clean room. Fascinating, really, but it begs the question - a clean room for what? Have we discovered some kind of genetic engineering lab? A bioweapons facility? A xenostudy research center? So many possibilities - and only a little time and effort separating us from knowing. Dorat intends to use low-grade implosives to breach into the next chamber - the engineers here at the institute say that this plan will have the best chance to reach the second chamber without damaging anything within. I fully expect to hear the results of this within a few weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Log Entry: 743***

Success! Dorat has breached into the next chamber. The initial scans show far less debris and damage to this part of Reliquary, the chamber being further below the rogue moon's crust. Excellent news, it means that we should be able to continue the excavation even faster. I am sending more equipment and a handful of extra scientists - each practically begging to go to Reliquary to work on the artifacts with their own talons. I can't say I blame them. In any case, the data we've received on the second chamber is heartening in the extreme. There are old computing systems here and based on their condition, it appears we may be able to power them back up for the first time in millennia. Finally, a direct connection will be possible with Reliquary's purpose! I can feel, deep within myself, that we are closer now to understanding our past than we have been in a hundred generations. 

Hossan came to me earlier today and asked whether we were being to hasty with this plan to power up the equipment. Humans are usually so unthinkingly brash that it caught me off guard. I asked him to explain the basis for his concern and he gave me a shrug and said, ""it's just a feeling I've been having"". Not very scientific a reason - something that I'll have to add to my report about his conduct and performance to the council. I'm still not totally certain it was a good idea to have a human scientist here, so close to the heart of what we are doing - humans are still a relatively unknown species. If caution had been merited anywhere in this process, it would have been with that intern not with Reliquary. Still, politics are politics and I'm sure the council have their reasons.

I don't have much time for the log today, we're bringing in everyone to receive the first full copy of the electronic storage in Reliquary's computer sets. Dorat said that it was more than three exabytes of data - so much!

Councilwoman Teira will even be in attendance here with us - just to see with her own eyes information that has been lost for thousands of years. How unprecedented, this really does feel like the culmination of so many years of work. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Log Entry: 745***

I don't understand. So much of this data is garbled and meaningless. Was it corrupted? There are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of log entries - audio and visual. They show what is clearly our kind laughing and dancing throughout Reliquary. It does not seem that any of these visual and audio entries were made to record anything of importance. There is no sense to be made of any of it - apart from that they certainly seem very happy. We're working our way back through the data - trying to make sense of it - but I'm beginning to feel uneasy. Some of this seems to have a religious component to it - odd because our species has no recorded religions. That was another observation made by Hossan after he had been looking over various images of glyphs. Maybe having an outside perspective was more useful than I initially conceived. 

The further back into the data we go, some of it begins to make more sense. The beginnings of a language are emerging - sentence structure and grammar are beginning to appear. It's almost like witnessing the birth of language in reverse. Fascinating. We don't have any of it translated into modern vernacular. I've assigned two teams to work on it - one for the language we can hear our ancestors speaking and another to comb through the written language. Hopefully we'll have something soon. 

Still, it doesn't feel right. Dorat added an addendum onto his file transfer, that they had found a third chamber on Reliquary and that he intended to begin exploring its contents. Given what we're seeing here, it certainly feels a little over zealous to move so quickly past what we found in chamber two. Hossan asked me again if we shouldn't hold off from further exploration until we understand all this data. It made me uneasy because I share some of the human's concern. This is species changing work we're doing I told him - it's not his business whether or not I have a tingle of doubt in my spine. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Log Entry: 746***

Reliquary is some kind of temple and genetics facility rolled into one. We've accomplished a great deal over the last few weeks, we've begun translating individual words and some phrases. We've also delved far enough back in the data to get a clearer picture. Here we have begun to find true reports as well as audio and visual records which seem to have an objective. There is far less smiling and laughter here than where we started. The tone is more serious - more scientific. 

However, I'm getting ahead of myself. Something happened to Dorat and his expedition. They're all alive and healthy - or were at least after factoring in the time delay. They were exposed to something in the third chamber. Some unsealed tube I think. In Dorat's report, he says that they're feeling no ill effects. But, I wasn't taking chances. I've ordered the entire expedition's return from Reliquary for a full diagnostic evaluation. Something is truly off about this moon - its purpose. I feel no closer to seeing how this is related to our lost history. 

Hossan seemed pleased by my decision. Perhaps humans are not as unthinking as I had originally believed. This one at least seems cautious. 

The council, on the other hand, was livid. They stated in no uncertain terms that my budget moving forward would reflect the fact that I have decided to temporarily halt our excavation efforts. They said that I did not appreciate the significant political blow this would cause them. I stood by my decision. In five years, the expeditionary team will have returned and can be fully evaluated for any impairments or other harm and so if my caution has set us back a decade for nothing, I suppose I have to accept that possibility. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Log Entry: 815***

The Reliquary expedition has returned to us. The Reliquary expedition has not returned to us. 

There is something immediately and evidently wrong with the voyagers. They're acting childish and impulsively. Hell, the autopilot had to dock the ship itself because no one on board, including six trained pilots, were willing or able to do it themselves. We made the decision to quarantine them all - including Dorat who asked me repeatedly what my favorite color was. Still, I shudder to think that we may have brought something back with them. They're getting round the clock care now - and there are a myriad of medical researchers being transported in to try and determine just what has gone so very wrong with the expedition members. 

We've spent the last several years trying to get a handle on just what was happening on Reliquary. Unfortunately, the oldest records are encrypted so we still don't have a clear picture. We've resorted to setting up four supercomputers to try to brute force a decryption onto the files - but the rate we're getting new data now is beyond glacial. 

Still, it seems clear that those on Reliquary did something to themselves. The why is less certain - but it seems that they wanted to change their cognition in some way. Was this an enhancement procedure gone horribly wrong? Given the state of our expedition crew - it seems likely. Is it even reversible?

&amp;#x200B;

***Log Entry: 816***

Bad. Bad. Terrible news. 

First, our researchers have begun to understand the nature of the ailment effecting Dorat and the others - it's a sort of contagious genetic disorder which trims back about a third of the neuronal connections between brain cells. Therapeutics aren't achieving a noticeable effect and the scientists tell me that it has something to do with the fact that from the effected individuals' perspectives there's nothing wrong with nor harming their bodies. In other words, this change is simply a natural process and has to do with the instructions which have been grafted onto their genome. Still, I remain certain - if somewhat uneasy - that given all the research we've been doing that we'll get a handle on this disease. 

Second, we've clearly failed to contain the degeneration. It has begun appearing among individuals and communities all across the planet. Worse yet, it seems to have caught a ride off-system too. Reports are beginning to filter in from the near colonies that they're seeing the same degeneration that we are. The entire solar system has been locked down by the council. Whatever this disease ends up being - we don't want it to turn into a pandemic. 

I've grown closer to Hossan in the last few weeks - he seems to be working himself as hard as any of us trying to understand what was going on on Reliquary and how we might fix it. It's touching that he seems hardly to sleep or eat and instead sits and translates the incomprehensible volumes of data day and night. I'm glad he's here with us. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Log Entry: 817***

I've been infected. I don't know how else to write it. It makes me tremble even to read it. But, the doctors have confirmed it. They quarantined me with the crew from the expedition along with more than a dozen scientists and researchers from the institute who had also contracted the disease. We still haven't found a cure. 

Earlier Dorat came and gave me a flower - though where he got one I have no idea - and smiled wide - I shudder at the size of that grin. ""Here here, happy fear, Dorat is clear"". He said as though it were sage advice - then he asked me my favorite color.  I couldn't even look at him. He left me alone after that.

Is that what I am to become?  A gibbering imbecile? Please no. I cannot bear the thought. I'm so afraid.

&amp;#x200B;

***Log Entry: 818***

Hossan visited today, he looked tired through the glass wall. He told me that they'd finished translating part of an encrypted document and that it was all about intelligence and satisfaction and their inverse correlation. It seems that our ancestors may not have failed in what they set out to do after all. Hossan says that this degeneration was exactly what they had wanted. They'd developed it themselves for use on themselves. 

It makes a horrifying sense. So much was lost not from wars and chaos - but because it simply didn't exist. We made no art. We had no history. We had remade ourselves into scions of the eternal present. Unable to build or plan. Unable to hope or fear or dream. A genetic lobotomy we had given our entire species. 

It's impossible for me to understand. And, I'm afraid that I never will have the capacity to do so. Sometimes in the darkness of night, I  can almost feel the trimming away of my intellect. Once, not long ago, I could solve Varrivia's Conjecture by wrote memory. I can no longer do so. Is it the stress and my increasing age that has caused that to be lost to me? Or is it this insipid disease that has imprisoned and begun to starve my intellect?

I asked Hossan whether they were making progress on a cure. He seemed uncomfortable at this question. At least he had the decency not to lie to me. 

He said it was chaos on the outside. Two of the council members have been found positive with Relic Disease. That's what they're calling it. In honor, no doubt, of the moon which I named. Relic Disease.

I hate to admit it, but I am no longer certain that we will overcome this crisis. My crisis. My fault.

&amp;#x200B;

***Log Entry: 819***

It has been six months since I was placed here. Hossan visits me almost every day. I like the human. He is very kind.

Really, it isn't so bad here. Dorat is fun to be around - he has the best jokes. The food isn't very good though. I miss... 

Actually, Hossan did tell me one thing: he said that he had talked to other humans about what's wrong with us. He said they wanted to help out too. I guess humans are very nice. I hope they bring us better food.

&amp;#x200B;

***Log Entry: 820***

They let us out! Hossan said it was because we didn't need quar... quarteen anymore. There are more humans now! They're all so nice to us! 

Dorat is mean though. He thinks green is better than blue. Stupid Dorat. 

Hossan says that I don't have to be scared anymore. I don't know why he said that. He said that the humans had agreed to take good care of all of us. That's nice.

Also, grass makes me happy! It's so nice and warm and comfy. I think I'll just lay here a little while and look at the sky. It's a nice day"

I'm struggling to exhaustion just to figure out how to write a Fibonacci algorithm based on the Wikipedia article. At one point, I just googled the algorithm and thought ""this is simple"", but again I couldn't do it because the usual implementation doesn't work in this context.

I do well with following the logic of the program until I need to implement some mathematical algorithm. I CAN make a whole program.

Hello all!

I have been lurking this community for a short while, and I have already learned so much, so for that I am thankful to you all. I just have some questions for people who are actively in the CS community about my particular situation, and things I can do to make myself more competitive.

So, I am currently active-duty military, and I am going to school for Computer Science. Because I am active duty, it really limits the schools I can go to, however the school I do attend is accredited appropriately. It isn't like Vanderbilt by any means though. Will my school not being super prestigious hurt me? Also, since I am active-duty I cannot do an internship at some major tech company prior to my separation date. I feel like this is going to hurt me. Will it?

Some things I think I have going for me are that I have a security clearance, and I have worked as a technician for the last 8 years. Some super vague details on my job are that I conducted preventative and corrective maintenance on classified sonar equipment to include troubleshooting both software and hardware issues. I have worked in the past with GE, Lidos, and Oracle.

Basically, am I going to be competitive when I graduate and separate the service? If not, what can I do to be more competitive? Should I pursue some CompTIA certifications to go along with my degree? Google certs? Salesforce certs? Leetcode my butt off? Where should I try to get hired on at? I would like to go work for some major tech company, but should I try and stick with the contractor option? Any advice would be much appreciated, and I thank you all for any you can provide.."

I have my MEd in School Counseling, but a few months before graduation realized what I really wanted to be doing was therapy. My school had a combined School and Community Counseling program, and I was told I could graduate with a School Counseling degree and then return to compete 4 more courses and be qualified to obtain my LPC. 

So in the Spring, that’s what I did. It felt really right and I know that I want to be a therapist. I’m currently in the process of doing the paperwork to sit for my NCE.

Now I have started interviewing for jobs, and I am finding myself feeling really anxious and under qualified because I didn’t do my internship in a clinical setting. I did my internship in a Chicago Public School, and while I think I made important connections and did good work, school counseling is so different. I did infuse a lot of what I did with CBT/DBT practices, and led a small group as well as having regular one on ones with a handful of students. Basically, I am worried I fucked up and spent all this money to go back to school and no one will hire me because I will have to learn a lot on the job. 

My friends who are therapists do not agree with my worries, and have assured me that everyone has to learn during their first job out of grad school. 

I’d love some opinions, thoughts, and if I’m honest, any reassurances!!"

(I had internships and academic jobs in uni, now I'm graduated and working for a company) I don't know if this is all typical of software companies.

Here's some things that have rubbed me the wrong way. The manager will call people out in group chats (bad code, late on ticket, forgot to change ticket status, etc.) And not really in a ""oh hey, you need to do this"" kind of way, more of a ""why didn't you do this, it should be done like this."" 

That leads me to the second point that my manager seems only capable of giving negative feedback. It's not overly rude, but kinda seems passive aggressive. Today he wrote on my PR ""should be in different class. Why is this in here? What example were you following?"" And tbh I cried a bit(I do need to work on being less sensitive, but also couldn't he have got the point across   the first sentence?) And I feel like I've had some good successes for how new I am, but didn't get positive feedback. Only when I mess up. I've seen this pattern with others who were hired shortly before me, so I don't think it's just me.

I was immediately (2nd/third week) given tickets to make fairly large APIs. (Several classes, significant configuration changes) And encouraged to ask questions to fill in the gaps. However, when I ask questions (I usually try my best to find answers on my own, and only ask when I can't), I'm given very short answers. Sometimes I'll send my manager a list of 3 or 4 questions and he only responds to one.

When I started, I heard that there were a bunch of developers who quit recently, and also that new devs have a really high turnover here, but that was usually because they were bad programmers.

I did really well in school and had great relationships at my internships and academic jobs. I graduated with distinction and have sizable side projects, and have been very confident in my programming skills before this job. Now I just feel really bad at programming and i wonder if this job/my manager is the reason.

At this point I graduated a few months ago, and finding a new job would probably take me a few more months, and I don't want that big of a gap on my resume right after graduating. I'm kind of inclined to stay another year, try to get a good reference then find something else. Not sure. Am I just being picky/sensitive?"

However, I'm located in Omaha, Nebraska (not exactly a tech hub) and I currently work part time at my school for $15/hr. I'll be starting a fulltime internship in January for $30/hr that's not local. This is a massive pay jump for me, and even then, it's not a crazy wage for CS. I went around the career fair today at my school, but no company there is going to be offering more than $30 (based on the few ranges I've heard, and knowing where I'm located). In my mind, these companies aren't even worth looking at because taking an internship/job at them, while local to me, would pay less than my internship, and I might be better off finishing my classes and applying to better places in the meantime. I want to only look at jobs that pay the same or more than my internship. Am I way off for thinking this?"

Aavari 

Aavari was about to lose his mind. He was a high member of the council of Quortals, the eldest of Antrions. Quortals were the ones responsible for all mortal matters, including a creation or destruction of various races off the face of the world. Yet, he had to deal with a non-trivial matter of young Curmiolini, the Celean intern, using the summoning circles without expertise, destroying them in the process. 

It would be one thing if he only used one or two circles, but 47 of them? The amount of prayers needed to construct even one of those circles was so immense, mortals (with a few exceptions) could not afford even one.

""Do you understand what you did?"" he asked Curmiolini beside him, whilst looking at what was left of the summoning altar and surrounding area. The once beautiful lush green and turquoise garden was gone, replaced by fires of different colors, consuming the remaining grass and whatever Mana was left in the air, which was filled with black smoke.

""I attempted to summon a powerful being without supervision or asking, destroying the altar in the process."" The youngling said this without apology, which pissed Aavari off. He silently nodded, and sent Curmiolini back to his room. 

Turning around to the rest of his clan, the Antrions, he simply stated: ""We'll have to wait for the fire to die down. Only after that will we be able to find if Curmiolini succeeded and where the summon ended up."" 

""I've always said that this exchange program between Clans is a mistake. This was bound to happen sooner or later"", came the angered voice of Anterion, the pessimist of the clan, whose voice was simply ignored. Everyone here had heard this story many times over. 

""Can't we just extinguish it with water magic?"" The newest member of the clan, Aderrio, asked. Aavari just sighed, and as calmly as he could, explained to the young one that that would only add to the power of Mana Flames now emitting from the broken rings. 

""Alright. I will now go to the summit of Clans to discuss how to handle this situation. Until I return, no one is allowed to leave the sanctuary. The only exception are our VVIP believers' summons. I'm looking at you, Ahrain."" 

Ahrain, as was tradition, immediately retorted: ""Damn it old man! How many times do I have to tell you to stop telling me that? It was more than 250 years ago. Stop rubbing it in my face!"" 

""Yes, yes, whatever. I'm leaving now. I'll leave the things here in Anterion's hands."" As Aavari finished speaking, he vanished with a flash of light, reappearing on his throne in a round room clad in gold and marble. There were 26 thrones in a circle, each one with a different capital letter made of pure gold and decorated with rare gems. He was 19th to arrive, and he did not have to wait for long before the rest of the Clan elders arrived and their meeting began.

""I'd like to thank you all for coming here on such short notice today."" Aavari began. ""I've called you here because of a certain phenomenon most of you have probably noticed already: the massive Mana Deprivation Wave that came across all the sanctuaries just an hour ago."" After saying that, he let the elders discuss it for a few moments, before releasing a bit of Mana to let everyone know that he wished to speak again.

""This Deprivation Wave originated nowhere else than in the summoning rings of sanctuary of the Antrions and was caused by unauthorized operation of the rings."" As expected, a wave of murmurs spread across the room. The only ones who did not take part of it were the eldest of the Antrions and Celeans, who had been informed in advance.

After everyone calmed down again, Capeih, the eldest of the Celeans, stood up and took over the position of speaker. ""Please, everyone. Before you start putting blame on the Antrions, I'll have to inform you of all the details of the incident. It has been caused by a member of our clan who had been attending lessons in the Antrion’s sanctuary. The member in question is very young, only 3 months since his ascension to the Clan member status."" 

This quietened everyone. It was quite common to fail at rings usage, but to use another clan's rings without permission was something entirely different. A ring was an important and expensive asset of every Clan. Even the weakest of clans made sure to have at least 2 of them functioning, to summon powers and sometimes living entities from beyond, and use them to get more power and wealth than the other clans. The Antrion Clan and Celean Clan were two out of the four most powerful Clans, so one of them causing an accident with the rings of the other was a problem of the highest caliber.

Capeih continued. ""Our Clan member has misused 47 circles, ruining them all, as well as starting a Mana Deprivation Fire to the Summoning Garden. We, the Celean Clan, offer you, the Antrion Clan an amount of Prayers worth 50 circles, to pay for this incident and spare the life of our member, as well as Prayers worth two circles to every other clan for the complications our young one’s misstep might have brought upon you."" 

What followed after those words was shocked silence.  Two circles worth of Prayers? To the weaker Clans, it was enough to last 2-3 decades. To the strong ones, it was a nice gift, saving them maybe a month of harvesting. The Celean Clan was offering almost 100 rings worth of Prayers in all, because of a blunder of one of its younger members. All eyes in the room turned towards Aavari, who thought deeply. The amount of Prayers was vast, and would be more than enough to make up for the losses he and his Clan suffered. 

As he was about to accept, Aavari received a mental message from one of the members of his clan that made him think about the pros and cons of said offer and consider a new counteroffer. The message was made of four words only: 'The Summon was successful'.

Aavari stood up and began pacing around the room, making a full circle before sitting down again, looking directly at Capeih. ""The Antrion Clan is grateful for your offer, but there is something else we would like to obtain."" After saying so, he watched as the wheels in Capeihs head began to turn in a futile attempt to find a way not to surrender his member.

Trying to stop his overthinking, Aavari spoke to all the elders in the room. ""The Antrion Clan will give up those 50 rings worth of Prayers for the rights of the creature your disciple has summoned. The Celean Clan will be responsible for offering half the amount of Mana for the creature to connect it to the World System, as well as giving up the rights to the creature, but other than that, we won't want any other reparations."" Putting on his best poker face, Aavari sat down, and looked at Capeihs' changing expression. He could not read it, as he was not knowledgeable in facial expressions of other Clans, but Aavari predicted he'd be pretty shocked. 

Capeih

Now it was Capeihs' turn to think. A creature summoned with the power of 47 rings would indeed be very powerful and dangerous, as well as incredibly helpful. The problem was that it was not summoned onto the altar but to the world below, meaning the need for actual ascension to join their ranks. This process would require more than 1000 years of it running wild in the world below with little to no chance to guide its behavior, unless it proved to be extremely compliant. The offer stated the need for them to give the creature enough Prayers to join the world system (which was usually about 20 rings worth of Prayers), but that would be paying in advance for not having trouble in the future. They could use their arrays of circles to summon and enslave enough strong creatures before the millennia passes, effectively catching up to or even passing the Antrion, and getting into leading position. He made his choice.

""The Celean Clan will accept your generous offer. We will proceed as soon as my Clan pays the promised prayers to the rest of Clans, and your Clan finds the creature."" Capeih said, and nodded to Aavari, who was sitting on his throne and smiling. ""Shall we begin the Prayers transfer?"" he asked the rest of the elders.

\---

One hour later

Capeih walked side by side with Aavari towards the place where Antrion Clan found the creature. They did not talk, just walked in silence, so as not to alarm any being that may have been nearby.

About 200 hundred meters from the clearing where the summoned creature was, they encountered another member of Antrion Clan, Arreani, who specialized in espionage and twisting laws in her favor. ""Arreani."" Aavari said, surprised she was not near the clearing. ""What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be watching the creature?""

Arreani simply looked at him, and after a short pause she simply answered: ""Self protection! The thing was able to detect me, even while using countermeasures. After scouting the terrain and witnessing combat results, according to our predetermined laws, I decided that retreat was the safest option, and I opted to inform my superiors in a predicted safe distance."" She then looked at Capeih, simply bowing her head.

""Combat results?"" Aavari asked. ""Give me the details. As much as you know.""

With a practiced “bored” look and a monotone voice, Arreani began reporting her findings. ""I’d found the creature approximately 20 minutes prior. It was walking in circles, obviously looking for something. After disguising myself, I flew to the crown of a nearby tree to watch the clearing, from there I saw 5 carcasses of Curmin origin: one of them decapitated, two of them with large holes in their flanks, one thrown into toxic mushrooms, and one lying near a bush on the edge of the clearing. I decided to check the bushes around for any clues of the combat, and found another carcass, this time without any sign of external damage. After thorough inspection, I discovered a shockingly strong impact to the flank, which was probably enough to throw it halfway through the bush. Around that time, I noticed the creature watching my every move, unaffected by my countermeasures. I decided to fall back and report to you. That was about 10 minutes ago. I don't know if the being decided to walk away, but from what I saw, it planned to stay the night.

Capeih and Aavari looked at one another, and wordlessly walked the rest of the way, this time much more circumspectly. Stopping at the edge of the clearing, they saw a weird scene of an Ent sitting next to a fire pit with burning wood, and right next to a bipedal being, clad in fabric of green and brown colors scattered in an unorganized way, partially blending to the background. Ents did not usually reveal themselves, as they preferred just protecting their quiet places and despised any creations of Clans. 

The two Clan elders looked at each other and tried to come up with the connection between a monster capable of killing Curmin and that thing over there, casually chatting with a guardian of a forest in its native language.

\---

James

James was watching the figure of moonlight, as it searched around the clearing and studied the body of the first cat-like thing he kicked, before looking at him and disappearing. James watched the bushes around for a while, before going back to the lizard to check on it. It was sleeping, but it had started to get pretty cold. ""Fuck it. I already decided to spend the night here, so why not just get to it?!"" He opened his backpack and took out his sleeping bag and mat, lowering the lizard carefully onto the mat and covering it with his sleeping bag to hopefully heat it up. 

While he was doing that, the weird bird landed near his now opened backpack, pecking at the bag he cut off of the armor. He tried to shoo it away, but to no avail. ""What the fuck do you want? Huh? You wanna bite some meat off of those parts or what?"" James asked no-one in particular. 

""The bird is trying to look for some seeds that are probably in that bag. Why don't you try and look for them?"" James was quite surprised when he heard an answer coming from behind him. Turning around, he saw a being describable only as an Ent. About 2.5 meters tall and with legs replaced by moving roots, it was probably the closest thing anyone could imagine.

""An Ent?"" James asked, and the Ent simply nodded its head, rustling leaves in the process. 

""It looks like you're trying to set up a fire pit. As you still have not been noticed by The Will of this world, I have come to show you some rules, so that I don't have to fight you. That ax on your pack looks dangerous. By the way, my name is Nheeria, it is nice to meet you."" Nheeria slightly bowed, and James did the same. 

""James. The pleasure is…mine?"" James replied, a bit shocked, and then the words dawned on him. ""Wait a minute. You said that I've not been recognized by The Will of this world. What does it mean?"" 

""It's quite simple. As you have not been noticed, you have not been linked to the inner works of it. That way, you could not sense the will of various spirits and guardians of sorts. If you could sense them, you would know that the place you are allowed to make fire is right next to the place you laid the Raaketig.""

""Is that a bad thing? That I haven't been noticed and recognized?"" 

""You don't have to worry. I'm pretty sure those who are responsible for your arrival are looking for you now. While they are still searching for you, I'll be your company. If you do not mind, that is."" 

James nodded. Thanks to Nheerias navigation, he was able to dig a fire pit using his shovel, which for some reason kept catching Nheerias eyes, and he even managed to collect some nice, dry firewood. He was also surprised by Nheerias offer to light it for him, but seeing the hesitation in Ents eyes, he politely refused and rather lit it with classical flint and steel, much to the relief of the Ent.

After attending the fire for a while, James pulled the mat with the sleeping lizard closer to heat it up, but not close enough to endanger it by his sleeping bag catching on fire. He then went to his backpack and brought it to the mat, took out few apples to eat, and sat on the opposite side of the fire from the lizard. Nheeria watched him carefully the whole time, only freezing for a moment when he took out the apples. 

After James sat down, the Ent lowered himself next to him, and they began to talk. James offered one of the apples to Nheeria, who blissfully accepted and held it in his arms, like you'd hold a newborn child. Nheeria began to talk about the forest and some of the common animals in it, but he also told him about the land that surrounded it. 

James began his education about this place, and was assured that this was indeed a new world. After all, you can't expect things called Mana Eaters or the ""Misty Bear of Anguish"" in the forests of Earth! He was also told about the things he killed - the Curmin, and the lizard he saved - the Raaketig. 

Nheeria viewed the Curmin as sadistic tyrants and the Raaketig as oppressed scavengers with good ties to nature and other living beings. The forest was not a friendly place, but some species have adapted to it by developing immunity so they weren't affected by the numerous kinds of poisonous plants and mushrooms, or some other kind of countermeasure. 

Nheeria was just talking about a small kind of frog, and how it developed special hormones to ignore one very specific kind of plant, forming a symbiotic relationship with it, when he suddenly stood up, putting the apple held in his embrace somewhere into his crown. James stood up as well, one hand resting on his machete, looking around the clearing for a threat. Seeing two figures, shining in the moonlight the same way as the one he saw about 15 minutes ago. Nheeria spoke up. ""I see. Your guides have arrived. I am no longer needed, as they will show you the basics of communicating with this World. I will now leave you here. Should our fates cross again, let's hope we are not opponents. If you want to, you can find me again by remembering my mana and following it to the source. I'll leave you a trace on your pack here. "" He touched one of his shoulder harnesses, brown specks of light emanating from his hand. He then bowed, and walked away, to the opposite side, than the two figures were.

Watching the Ent leave, James was silently thinking of what was to come next. Turning around, he watched the two figures slowly making their way towards him."

*I will preface by saying I understand a majority of these programs are ""ambitious"". I also understand a common strategy when applying to college is a ""safe/target/reach"" strategy where one allocates a certain number of schools in each tier. I am choosing to overlook this strategy given that from the below list of schools, one of them is my undergraduate institution where I am guaranteed admission. In the worst case, I will end up going to my undergraduate institution for my Masters. If I get into a better program, I will go there.*

\*

There are also a few schools on this list where I will be applying for a PhD since those schools have faculty members that have similar research interests. 

**Schools I'm Applying To:** 

UCB(\*), UCLA, UCSB, UCI, UCSD, Stanford, CMU, GT, UIUC, UT, UofT, UBC, UMass-Amherst, Princeton(\*), Columbia, Northwestern, Duke, Cornell(\*), UW (PhD), MIT (PhD), Harvard (PhD)

&amp;#x200B;

\*I am aware these schools have a small cohort for CS MS. Are these schools where I should go MS/PhD or PhD?

&amp;#x200B;

Also wondering if there any schools on here to add or remove. I will not be applying to USC, NYU, or Caltech -- I am very familiar with each of these programs/schools. They all have their own issues that I am not willing to subject myself to."

So I have pretty severe ADHD and heavily rely on my adderall for my daily life. I joke that all my conviction and go-get-it attitude is stored in that pill. As without it I literally don’t feel like doing anything at all. I struggle to even get myself out of bed. My executive dysfunction absoltuly rules my life without it. But when on it I am constantly busy and get all kinds of stuff accomplished. It’s very effective to say the least, and with very few side effects. But I would definitely say that I am dependent on it. I have been on it for as long as I can remember. If I had to guess I would say since sometime between the age of 12-14 all the way up to now at nearly 23. I used to only take it during the school week and came off it on the weekends and summer break when in middle and high school, but once I got to college and started a job on the weekends and had essays and stuff to write over the weekend I started taking it on the weekend too. And then I started taking summer classes and stopped coming off it during the summer. The only time I really take breaks is once in a blue moon when I have a day off to relax, when I forget to take it, when I am sick, and over holiday breaks like Christmas. 
My parents have recently been bringing it up that I should come off it as I can’t be on it for the rest of my life. That I will have to come off it eventually and that I don’t need it when at work and only for college and I am currently taking a break from classes this semester as I am doing an internship. So they’d want me to come off it for this semester. 
My parents are very much the type of people who believe that add/adhd only effects school work. They don’t believe that it’s effects other aspects of life like executive dysfunction. And I have a majority of the symptoms of adhd that I honestly think they think is just laziness. But I see their point that I can’t be on it for the rest of my life. Right? If I come off it I will not be able to function, my life quality will decline, I will probably lose my internship, etc. But I don’t know what to do. Because I am willing to admit that I am dependent on it. And even when I am done with college in a couple years, I just can’t picture myself going to work every day without it, or eventually raising kids without it. So I don’t know what to do. How long is it safe to stay on adderall?"

Hoping to get some perspectives here I haven't considered before committing to the job search.

My new boss had two interns start over the summer at the same time as me and one intern stayed on to work part-time during school. From the start, the interns have been able to dabble in all sorts of interesting statistical modeling projects while my main assignment that a senior dev tasked me to do is basically an IT process that notifies a customer service team, even though I've completed graduate courses in statistics/ML (getting my MS). My boss has mentioned to me that creating models is 'a privilege' which I kind of don't understand since that is what a data scientist is supposed to do in their job. Nothing against IT developers, but this was not what I signed up for.

I tried to bring up to my boss that it seemed like the interns were doing more difficult work, but he brushed it off as interns doing work they knew they could handle, and that he had other priorities for me. There is one other project a different senior dev and I have started to collaborate on, but he is kind of working at it at his own pace, so it's more like I'm tagging along and not really contributing anything substantial.

My dad has told me that I should be okay with having a relatively low-pressure job while I'm taking grad courses part-time, but my concern is that after several years, it's going to be hard for me to state I really achieved anything impactful in data science.

Am I being under-utilized in my job? Are my expectations too high? Should I just coast it out for up to a year or is it okay to start applying now? Any advice is appreciated."

I had an internship this past summer but I was working with mulesoft, so sadly not full on coding experience (they said “Java” api’s…. guess technically they didn’t lie). I’m also working as a network technician at my college, which is not coding experience either.

I have a couple of VERY small personal (not school related) coding projects to my name on GitHub.

I’d like to get into either c/c++ or Java development.

Would it look better on an application if I stayed with my current networking position, or resigned and put that time into developing personal coding projects so I have something to show to employers to demonstrate my skills?

Secondly, whatever the answer may be in the first question, how would I go about it when going to a career fair, where my resume is on paper? It would be difficult to condense it into one page and having two resumes would look, in my eyes, unprofessional, though I could be wrong.

TL;DR - Mechanical Engineering Major, Comp Sci minor, experience in both, not enough space on the page. Split into two or no?"

Hello all!

I have been lurking this community for a short while, and I have already learned so much, so for that I am thankful to you all. I just have some questions for people who are actively in the CS community about my particular situation, and things I can do to make myself more competitive.

So, I am currently active-duty military, and I am going to school for Computer Science. Because I am active duty, it really limits the schools I can go to, however the school I do attend is accredited appropriately. It isn't like Vanderbilt by any means though. Will my school not being super prestigious hurt me? Also, since I am active-duty I cannot do an internship at some major tech company prior to my separation date. I feel like this is going to hurt me. Will it?

Some things I think I have going for me are that I have a security clearance, and I have worked as a technician for the last 8 years. Some super vague details on my job are that I conducted preventative and corrective maintenance on classified sonar equipment to include troubleshooting both software and hardware issues. I have worked in the past with GE, Lidos, and Oracle.

Basically, am I going to be competitive when I graduate and separate the service? If not, what can I do to be more competitive? Should I pursue some CompTIA certifications to go along with my degree? Google certs? Salesforce certs? Leetcode my butt off? Where should I try to get hired on at? I would like to go work for some major tech company, but should I try and stick with the contractor option? Any advice would be much appreciated, and I thank you all for any you can provide..."

I grew up in a household where my parents often struggled to put food on the table, but always did their best to make sure me and my siblings had the skills we needed to be successful. My wife, on the other hand, grew up in a fairly rich household, traveled the world and all that, but her parents' view was that their daughters would just marry rich and so didn't need basic life skills. We got married so young because she wanted to get out of that environment. I had been supporting myself since 16, working full time since 14, and so we were able to do okay after she started working. With me working two full time jobs and her working one, and with the help of scholarships, we were able to put both of us through a state school without incurring any student debt, which I saw as a huge accomplishment. 

What I didn't realize was that by working so much we sacrificed the opportunity to participate in the internships and other opportunities that actually turn your education into employment. I only learned about internships being the new entry level when I was rejected from job after job because I hadn't had an internship, and no internship would take me because I wasn't a student anymore. My wife majored in a STEM field, and met with the same problem. 

I opted to join the military, since it can open a lot of the same doors I found closed. I'm in intelligence and I love it, I could definitely see myself doing this for 20+ years. My wife, unfortunately, is still stuck in the same situation, made worse by the fact that we're going to be moving every few years if I stay in. She's become very angry and bitter at everyone and anyone, angry that she never got any ""leadership experience"" in high school, angry that she's never been promoted to management anywhere she's worked, angry that everyone hates her when nobody does, and more. 

She says she feels like she's been mediocre her entire life and she's in raging hysterics more nights than she isn't. I honestly have no idea what to do. My dad's advice growing up was always to be smarter, to work harder, and to make sure everyone around you was successful. I've tried to do that every job I've had, and it's just worked for me. I've never had to struggle to excel at work; it's been hard, but never anything I couldn't just figure out. I have no clue how to help her get out of the stuck she's in, and I'm afraid I'm going to lose her if I can't do something. Help."

hi guys, for years (like the beginning of youtube) i've always admired how people did let's plays and the youtube commentary side with the people i watched. i (21F) LOVE video games, i had my game boy &amp; DS. it was my favorite thing to do when i was little. so the youtube commentary thing was something i always wanted to do but then i grew up &amp; just focused on trying to become a lawyer, someone in law enforcement throughout my high school years. i never stopped watching youtube, but the job idea just faded away since so much can happen in a few years. fast forward to the beginning of college (3 years ago), i decided to not do the lawyer route &amp; to enroll as an environmental science major, which led to me switching to sustainable agriculture but now, i don't want to do that. recently, i've found out that a lot of my choices were based around what my parents have surrounded me in. we have cows, chickens, goats, parrots, dogs, and a cat. my dad is a retired vet &amp; wanted me to try to go into the air force, but not any other branch bc af is the ""safest"". don't get me wrong, i was interested in it at one point but that was two years ago.
BASICALLY i've NEVER known what i want to do as a realistic career. but the reason i need advice is because my mind is unraveling &amp; i don't confide in anyone irl.
this summer, i did the most spontaneous thing i had ever done. applying for an internship with a really famous ""magical"" company. long story short, i got accepted &amp; told my parents. i thought that they would be happy since we had just taken a trip &amp; heard about the internship from a bunch of people. my dad was the one who suggested i apply at that time. but when we started talking, he wasn't supportive. ""why would you wanna move so far away?"" ""it's so far"" ""the pay doesn't seem good"" it was $15/hr... my mom was 50/50. so for months, he tried to get me to stay in my hometown. until he succeeded... i was running out of money since i was only going to school and everything was expensive, in general, during this time. he said that he would help me get a good paying job that paid $18/hr and help me fix my macbook for school but only if i stayed. the job working hard labor, like the bottom of the food chain: working in demolition. i desperately needed the money but i wanted to be able to live my own life alone. i was already sleeping less hours bc i was taking summer classes but even less since i was just stressed out by the situation.
(atp, i want to delete everything and put on a brave face) i took the job. i'll just say i met some of the coolest, wisest guys. i got along with mostly everyone (i mean, no one treated me like shit) especially since i was a girl but i was already hardworking but never anything like this. i lasted 4 weeks, day and night shifts. $1000 a week. NEVER AGAIN. but something that i realized working there, (btw this is not just a physical challenge but a mental one too) i cried three times, i just wanted my mom to hug me. i realized that i just wanted to live the life i wanted. i finally decided to settle for becoming a streamer. part-time of course &amp; i would still be going to school. but i need to give my parents something to let them know that i wouldn't be a disappointment by choosing this lifestyle. is there anyway i can be a part-time streamer and enlisted in the air force? i'm thinking that might make my parents feel better financial-wise."

xdpnzt,0,2022-09-13,"25 male, feel completely lost and behind everyone else my age.",ProcedureFair8325,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/xdpnzt/25_male_feel_completely_lost_and_behind_everyone/,"Just a heads up: it will be a **long** text. Also, English is not my native language so I'm sorry for any errors.

Context: im 25, male. I still live with my parents  (that's normal in my age where I live). I went to the best business school in the country (lets say it's like what Wharton would be for US). Now, that was great for learning purposes, but extremely bad for my mental health, since I got into a place with people who had completely different lifes than me. I graduated top 20% (not that good but oh well).

When I got into business major, I was planning on having my own business. That was because my father's influence. He is a entrepreneur, so he never told me to get a normal job, but instead always told me that the best path was to have my own business. So I did it: from July 2018 to August 2019 (I also graduated aug/19) I worked on my own business: insurance brokerage. That's what my parents did, and since it was good money and I had all the know-how easily available in my own house, it made sense. During that time, all my college friends were working on internships on big banks (80% of my classmates went to financial markets, specially investment banking). I hated working insurance brokerage, and I started having major problems in my family (my mother worked with me and my father often made the decisions). I then decided it was enough and it was time to try the corporate world.

I got into a  Forensics **Trainee in a Big 4** Consulting company. Stayed for 6 months (september/19 to january/20), and I left because the job was completely boring (for 5 months all I did was investigate e-mails looking for any signs of corruption in one of the largest companies in the country) and the salary was well below average in the sector.Decided to give another shot on having my own company and then... covid hit. My father and I made a plan to try something new on the market... insurance brokerage was very old-style and we decided to try something new. Except... he didn't do his part. I waited for 1 year while all my college friends were getting raises and promotions, and that really destroyed my mental health and I got into a huge fight because I felt betrayed by my own father.

2021 comes and I decided to go for financial markets, since that's what most of people who graduated from my college went for. June 2021 I worked in **Investment Banking** (I didn't really like what IB people do, just figured I would do what everyone else did). Long story short: first week, my grand father died. Second week,  my father finds out he has cancer. Put all that together with 15 hour work days (including weekends) and **I completely broke down**. I felt so weak because I couldn't manage all my emotions during that time and I decided to quit. Also, I must mention I found out that I definitely do not share the same values as people in IB do. Talking about cheating was completely normal, just for an example. That job lasted 2 and half months. (June 2021 to August 2021). I had to take anxiety meds and start therapy because all this... and because I felt quitting IB (even if I knew it was not for me) was basically giving up on a lot of money.

November 2021 I got called to work as a **Business Strategy Analyst** for a big startup and 3 months later I got a better offer to work as an **Treasury Analyst** on one of the biggest fintechs in the country. I accepted it. Now, I must say I really liked the work and the freedom of it, but my boss and my boss'es boss was asking for stuff way beyond what an Treasury Analyst would do. And I wouldn't mind if it was financial stuff. But they started to give me commercial goals, which was completely outside my work field. Got into some fights with my boss and, for the first time, I got fired. (I worked on that fintech from February 2022 to July 2022).

It was the first time I got fired. All other jobs I had i decided to quit, and when I left everyone told me how great I was. Even when I decided to quit my job in the Big 4 Consulting, my counselor told me even the partners were talking about me and I was being called a genius in the Forensics department. I'm just saying that so you guys understand im a good employee and I always deliver more than what is asked.

After I got fired I decided to take 1 month vacation (my family wanted to travel). Now, 2 months after I got fired I still have not got back on my feet. I feel completely lost. When I compare to my college friends, I feel like shit, because they're all seniors by now, making 2-3x what I would make as an analyst. And I know that's not fair with myself... those guys have been raised to work in private equity, investment banks and hedge funds ever since they walked their first steps. I only found out about that when I was already mid college (my family was poor till I was 12. Then, they started making decent money). So It's not like we've been raised with the same incentives, objectives, and values. When I compare to my high school friends, people I grew up with (9 years old to 17 years old) I'm doing pretty well.

***Anyway, I really need some advice on what to do***. I know having that many short work experiences in my age is bad. People don't look well on guys who have many 2-6 months work experiences (that's why I got mad when I got fired... I really wanted to stay there for atleast a year).I was thinking about taking some SQL/Python classes, since many financial analyst are being asked to have that skills, and then going for that job or something similar.

Sorry for the bible-sized post and thanks in advance for any advice."

I'm a student currently studying for a master's in Mechatronics, coming from a BSc in electronics engineering.

I've always wanted to build a CNC machine but i was wondering if I should actually do it or if I should focus on my exams.
I'm currently studying in Italy but I'd like to land an internship in Robotics at FUNAC or ABB in other countries in Europe, so I need to make my resume somewhat more competitive.

What i would like to do is:
1) Design the mechanical part of the machine in Autodesk Inventor (already done, actually)
2) Create a PLC-Like panel housing the machine control circuitry, initially basically a GRBL board, stepper drivers and power supplies
3) Replace the initial GRBL board with a custom built controller using STM32s and Rust
4) Replace the initial stepper drivers with custom built current-control stepper drivers

Regarding the custom controller, I'd like to implement some things that i saw during the robotics course, like a direct and inverse kinematics model and a static and dynamic model of this relatively simple Cartesian robot.
These would be used when executing gcode commands.

The stepper driver will consist of two h-bridges controlled in current and of fault detection circuitry communicating with the control unit.

This obviously is a lot of work. O would definitely enjoy doing all of it since i find these things lots of fun, but I'm wondering wether i should do it. 

Should I instead focus on finishing my exams and my thesis? Would this project not look as good as i think on a resume?

Thank you for any opinions!"

I applied to this large IT company as an intern a couple of months ago. The training was set to be two months, starting in the middle of July until the middle of September. As part of this contract, we’re given around 15k allownance monthly. We would then be given a JO after training. However, the training contract also included a 2 year bond. Salary would have been based on our training performance at a range of 20k-30k.

So far I’m ranked at the top of our batch of interns, and its pretty much safe to say that I’m gonna finish the training on top. 

Here’s the dilemma: we were recently informed that our training would be delayed and we’re now expected to end on Septmber 30, the same day that our training contract terminates. This works for me. By the time the company gives our JO, I can negotioate the terms of the new contract and possibly avoid the 2 year bond. I can then also for a higher salary, given that I ‘ve performed really well througout the training. Only problem is that if I do so, the company might choose to not give me a JO instead - leaving me unemployed."

In my resume, I am wondering if :

1 ) I should include that I have work authorization or not, because when I apply they won't know if I am from Switzerland or not.

2) I should include karate since it doesn't contribute to showing I am a good candidate.

3) I should include languages since people living in the USA don't include a section like this, knowing that I can speak French, German or Tibetan in a foreign country won't help ?

4) I should include a skill section ? Where I say for example : Java, Python, React, Vue, C, ...

So here I am, I was thinking of doing my thesis on private equity (growth buyout) because I am passionate about this subject.
I have an interview for an internship in private equity and I would like to send them my willingness to do my thesis in parallel with a potential future internship in their company.

In short, I'm asking you to give me your opinion but especially to know if you have any interesting thesis topics related to the subject disclosed above.
I thank you in advance for your answers!

I want to preface this by telling you all about myself. (Can skip to TLDR if you want) I'm currently 24 years old. I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Psychology back in May 2021. To be quite honest, while I was in school, I was a terrible student. I spent my first two years as a Biology major with aspirations to go to medical school. After two years in, I realized that school was not for me, the pre-med track was not for me... and so I switched over to Computer Science on a whim. Honestly, I had taken a few CS classes in HS (including AP Comp Sci) and it interested me at least a little and I knew it would be a solid career path, so I decided to switch.

The Computer Science major was extremely tough for me. I failed many classes along the way. However, it was also partly really rough on me cause I crammed the major into 3 years, cause I didn't want to 4 more years at my University after I made the switch. (Which I now kinda regret). Because of this I didn't get any internship experience cause my summers were spent taking a bunch of CS courses in order to try to cram the degree into 2 years (I ended up taking 3 years anyways, because of how many classes I failed). So, I destroyed my GPA in the process as well. Granted, I never even learned anything about CS tbh. I mostly banked on curves going well for me, because I would get so frustrated every time I tried coding that I would just give up on projects that I couldn't figure out and take 0's. I got through a lot of my classes by having good partners/groups that were willing to do the coding and just let me do the documentation for it. Of course, this felt great in the moment.... I was able to slack off and enjoy partying and college while just barely scraping by in my classes to get the CS degree.

Unfortunately, after the pandemic sent us home back in 2020, I was forced to take my last year of classes online, which really affected my work ethic even more, to the point where I was barely doing any work for any of my classes. Also, because of the pandemic, I started smoking a lot of weed. Flash forward to 2021 and I graduated with a CS degree. By this point, I'm pretty much a full-blown stoner, spending about 8-10 hours of my day high. After graduating with my CS degree, I feel kinda proud, cause I honestly didn't think I'd make it this far and get that done. I decide to give myself the summer to relax after some of the most stressful 3 years of my life, because of course even though I was slacking off  a lot, I still did put in a lot of effort at certain times and I wanted to reward myself for finishing the degree.

The main thing is that I fell into a pretty bad depression with all the weed use where my entire life for  a year just revolved around waking up, smoking weed/nic all day, and playing video games. Any motivation I had to get anything done was completely lost. This went on until a few months ago where my condition from abusing these substances had taken such a toll on my physical and mental health that I ended up in the ER. This was kind of the wake-up call for me. If this hadn't happened I'd probably be on the same downward spiral I was on before. This motivated me a little to at least start trying to place more value on my own life. I started going to therapy these past few months and it's been helping a little.

Anyways, I can't seem to find any job openings because I""m not a new grad technically anymore and I have absolutely zero work experience. I also couldn't do any leetcode problems if you asked me to cause I have very preliminary knowledge of coding even though I have the degree. I probably couldn't pass a single technical. I don't know how to code, I didn't learn anything in school. My resume is pretty empty except for two large course projects I did in college with groups. I can't even explain them cause I don't remember then nor did I do the majority of coding for them.  I  just feel so lost and hopeless and I spent so much time and money getting this degree, I want to put it to use. I feel like I want to be a software engineer but at the same time, it's so much effort to learn and also, I'm running out of time to learn and get a job. I feel like a burden to my family and to those around me, it's honestly so sad. I was wondering if I should just take one of those jobs that bootcamp you and then place you, but every time I get a call from them, it just sounds like a shady business practice  on top of them asking for 2 year commitments and I'm scared. I guess I don't have much of a choice, but I just feel like there has to be a better way.

Lastly, I don't know how to explain the gap to employers. Like, I can't just tell them, ""I was depressed and had no drive and motivation to do anything for an entire year."" Nobody wants that kind of volatility in an employee and I don't blame them. I just feel like I wasn't built to make it in this world and it makes me extremely upset.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**: Graduated May 2021 after struggling through the CS degree and not learning while obtaining it cause I finessed my way through school. Huge depressive episode for the past year until about a few months ago. Traumatizing experience that sent me to the ER changed my outlook on life. Have no work experience, don't know how to code, feel like I'm running out of time to start a career now and that my time for when I should have applied past. Don't know how to get my first job or what to do, been applying to hundreds of places for a few months, but no luck. I do get callbacks and interviews from those bootcamps that train you and then place you, but those seem shady to me, but I guess if I have no choice, I might as well do that? Just feeling extremely lost and any guidance in any direction would be extremely helpful. Thank you.

Edit: Current Resume - (I know it's bad but I don't have any other experience to talk about) [https://imgur.com/a/4jHIjqw](https://imgur.com/a/4jHIjqw)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: Thank you all so much for your insightful responses. I knew a lot of the things you guys are pointing out about myself, but having so many people tell me it is a completely different feeling. Thanks to anybody who gave me their time of day to try to help me. Also, there's a difference between tough love (which I can respect) and just being an asshole. Please don't be an asshole. Thank you again."

xe21ko,1,2022-09-14,time to leave new job?,sweetmorty,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/xe21ko/time_to_leave_new_job/,"I posted this in r/work but got no responses so I figured I'd post this here:

So I've been a data scientist in this analytics team for about 5 months after working with the company for several yrs and starting to look for an exit. Hoping to get some perspectives here I haven't considered before committing to the job search.

My new boss had two interns start over the summer at the same time as me and one intern stayed on to work part-time during school. From the start, the interns have been able to dabble in all sorts of interesting statistical modeling projects while my main assignment that a senior dev tasked me to do is basically an IT process that notifies a customer service team, even though I've completed graduate courses in statistics/ML (getting my MS). My boss has mentioned to me that creating models is 'a privilege' which I kind of don't understand since that is what we are supposed to do as data scientists. Nothing against IT developers, but programming a notification process was not what I signed up for.

I tried to bring up to my boss that it seemed like the interns were doing more DS work than I was, but he brushed it off as interns doing work he knew they could handle, and that he had other priorities for me. There is one other project a different senior dev and I have started to collaborate on, but he is kind of working independently at his own pace and direction, so it's more like I'm tagging along and not really contributing anything substantial. 

My dad has told me that I should be okay with having a relatively low-pressure job while I'm taking grad courses part-time, but my concern is that after several years, it's going to be more of the same and it'll be hard for me to state I really achieved anything impactful in data science.

I guess I am a bit frustrated/disappointed with the situation as I had higher expectations and kinda don't feel it's worth trying to work out a better understanding with my boss because he's got more of an ego unlike my former manager. Am I being under-utilized in my job? Are my expectations too high? Do I need to stick it out for up to a year or is it okay to start applying now? Any advice is appreciated."

I want to explain about my situation - I am 21 and I am an international student at Politecnico di Torino in Italy, studying computer engineering. I want to note that this month I will start to my third year; yet, I have completed only 3 courses yet as it is quite tough for me to study. The courses in our university are highly theoretical and I have no motivation whatsoever in listening to them. Also, honestly Turin makes me depressed as it is very old city and houses usually are not comfortable for me. However, this university is very prestigious, before I had goals to work for top tech companies; thus, I chose this university. Over time, my passion for this became less and right now I am an intern. I think about starting from zero in Poland, I think about choosing more practice-oriented and relatively easy university so I can pass courses more easily and have more motivation due to that. There are significantly less opportunities for internships and jobs in Turin than in Warsaw or even smaller city, like Krakow. Honestly speaking, not working and not earning money affects my confidence in a way that I am not useful to society, not to mention that I cannot pass classes.

**My question is following:**Is it worth to endure education in Politecnico due to its prestige and think about working later or to choose regular university and have more opportunities for self-growth yet have diploma with worse prestige? My personal goal is to both have fun and work/study at the same time. Thanks!"

I work about 35 hours a week at my job at the moment and I am doing full time school 5 days a week. (This isn't include the hours that I spend on just homework) I also have an internship that I have to go to once or twice a week. There is a lot of driving, a lot of sitting through lectures, and a lot of working. Because of this, I just can't find time to eat anything. 

I didn't even realise anything was different until I was getting those black spots while walking to a class. I am so low on energy it's not even funny. My day starts so early in the morning that I don't have time for breakfast and I finish work at 11pm. On the days I don't close, I have school till 9pm. 

I live with a big family, but they already eat everything by the time I get home. It's also not possible for me to eat with them when I am there during meal times (almost never) because they put meat in literally everything. I'm vegetarian, and have been for 10 years so that isn't the problem. I also refuse to eat meat so that is also something I can't do. 

I'm just SO hungry it's not even funny. I just don't know what to do. I work in a store and I buy little snacks at work to bide me till the end of the night. Not enough to fulfill me, but enough to make sure I don't pass out. Do you think just buying a multi-vitamin would help?

Any advice AT ALL on how to deal with this or if someone else has a similar experience would be awesome. I have some money (not a lot) so I can probably buy something, but got to find the time.

xe9s0c,0,2022-09-14,Switching jobs for 10% raise?,Low-Good-3126,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/xe9s0c/switching_jobs_for_10_raise/,"Hi all, looking for some advice here! I have a job offer for a 10% higher salary. It is the same type of work I’m doing now but with “Senior” in front of the title, so the next logical step in my career. I actually did my internship here so am familiar with the management and I like the organization. The benefits at the new job are slightly less competitive but still decent, pension is the same, vacation the same. 

Is 10% raise enough to make it worth leaving? It’s a great next step in advancing my career (I’m 25), but I could potentially have this same position within a year or two at my current role. I’m hesistant to leave because our team is already short staffed and it will be quite the surprise to my boss that I’m leaving (feeling very guilty)."

&amp;#x200B;

Profile:

\-2 years of experience at the point at which I need to start applying to UK jobs.

\-BSEE:  Bachelor of Electrical Engineering  with high marks and multiple internships.

\-I like my current position and see a future in it.

\-Considering LDR with GF however I don't want that to stop her from pursuing this opportunity.

\-Scholarship will give her a healthy stipend for living expenses and flights back and forth.

\-Also considering making my side gig(photography) my main if needed.

&amp;#x200B;

I am growing increasingly confused about the UKs skilled worker visa policies. From what I understand I first need to apply for a company that is willing to sponsor my work visa, but I have no idea what companies are willing to do that based off the job ads I've seen. Usually on US applications it will say if they re willing to sponsor workers or not. I'm not worried about the hit in pay I will take, I just dont want my career to be hurt by this move. By the end of this year I'll have my Event and Portrait Photography website online which will propel my hobby into a full on side gig.

I'm hoping to reach others who have tried to get work visas and gather names of firms that would be friendly to foriegn engineers. Also the timeline of your experience, when should I start applying to these companies? For those who have jumped from one country to another, how has that affected your career trajectory? For Residents of london what is the need for Electrical Engineers or Photographers?"

In this case, the contents were a careful mix of some astonishingly acidic lemon seeds, ground into powder and mixed with what was labeled simply as *Luminous Dust*. What they were reacting so rapidly with was in turn a mix of capsicum oleoresin and a highly basic cleaning liquid, and the results were exactly as I’d predicted.

The reaction frothed up almost immediately, as the acid-base reaction turned citric acid and *something* into carbon dioxide, water, and something I vaguely remembered as being a food additive—well, assuming the chemistry of lemons was the same here. The resulting turbulence did a great job getting the rest of the dust in contact with the liquid, and the entire mixture turned into a churning, pressurized cloud.

A *glowing* cloud, glinting and scintillating in every color of the rainbow.

I allowed myself one manic half-giggle, half-cackle on my first pump of the atomizer. The moment it compressed, though, I was all business, watching the mist spray out in a narrow, powerful jet that splattered all over the inside of the primary containment. There was a beam of light that, in defiance of all physics, seemed to be spraying out with the mist—it refracted partially off of the inner surface of the glass in exactly the same way that the spray did.

Not all of it did, though. It was glass, after all; enough passed through the vessel to cast a brilliant spotlight on the stone wall. A narrow pinpoint, it looked like it had all the concentrated light from a flashlight more powerful than anything I’d ever touched, and I pumped again as it started to fade, grinning broadly as it brightened up again.

I pumped it a third time, and a sense of distraction flooded me, a demand for my attention from that immaterial connection to the System I’d been calling my bridge.

“Kelly. You have the baton?”

“I… what?”

“System’s calling. Take over the experiment, or at least make sure it doesn’t break.”

“Yes! Yes, yes, I’ve got it!” She didn’t push me aside—which was good; I’d have been *mad* about that—but she all but leapt to grab the pump and run her fingers along the sides of the flask. “This is great and I’ll be fine and have fun, now go!”

I snickered, stepping away and making sure nothing was out of place or unsecured. Leaving her to enjoy a moment of mad science, I crossed the room to a bench near the ramp, well away from the experiment. Even keeping my attention on walking that far was difficult, but one foot went in front of the other until I sat down. Only then did I let the connection snap into place, and the words washed over me.

**&lt;Review Path (Mystical Chemist)&gt;**

**&lt;Evolve \[Worker\] Into \[Alchemist\]&gt;**

**&lt;Awaken, To Return In Due Course&gt;**

I felt the flow of the words stop, and paused for a moment to assess what the options felt like. I didn’t want to make a hasty choice, and it didn’t *feel* like this was a one-time offer. There was a sense of patience to the moment, an idea bubbling up through my head that of course I could choose to awaken and then return here, wherever here was, whenever I so chose.

I needed that. As tempting as it was to keep diving into this path, as incredibly curious as I was to find out more about my Path-with-a-capital-P, I had left Kelly in a room with an active experiment. I had left a *complete novice*, someone with absolutely no training, in a room with an ongoing experiment that paired volatile chemicals with magical reagents.

I didn’t think anything bad had happened or would happen, but it was still at least a little bit irresponsible of me.

I took a deep, entirely imaginary breath, and deliberately shaped my thoughts into the mental act of choosing to awaken.

Sensation, memory, and the memory of sensation flooded back into my awareness. Like a fog clearing from my mind, like a flash of recollection, I *knew* that in the approximately two minutes that had passed, very little had happened other than Kelly somehow turning the lights off—the windows were dark, too—amidst her escalating laughter. It had started as a delighted giggle and passed, in short order, into more of a maniacal cackle, and when I looked over, she was only just starting to wind down.

I could see her rather clearly, by the glow of the wall.

Kelly wasn’t pumping the atomizer anymore. Standing behind the bench at a respectful distance, hands clasped behind her back, she was bobbing her head and swaying her hips as though dancing. I stared, mesmerized for a long moment by the combination of that and her still-diminishing maniacal laugh—and then I rose, transferring my attention to first the flask and then the glowing wall.

“That looks verging on the edge of unsafe.” I nodded at the flask, smiling happily. “You stopped in good time, though?”

“Soon as the clouding started, ‘cause I was worried about what that meant for, I dunno. Anything?”

“That was the right call.” I put as much praise into my voice as I could, drawing on memories of hapless undergraduate interns. “The clouding meant that it was going to absorb more of the heat, and it had already started affecting the structure. No telling what was going to happen then, and we weren’t set up for the flask exploding.”

Kelly was silent for a long moment, and I looked over at her, raising an eyebrow. She seemed lost in thought, and I let her be as I double-checked the state of the ditch-valve—something, some twitchy but contented instinct in me, was telling me that this incredibly resilient bit of the apparatus had been the most likely single point of failure, and it looked fine after the experiment.

I made to walk towards the wall, but stopped after a couple of steps, whistling in surprise at the radiant heat coming off of the stones. “You know,” I murmured, “I hadn’t thought about what it means that the stone is glowing enough to light up the experiment nook.”

“I’d say that was the other reason I stopped, but.” She giggled, a little watery and a little exhausted. “I was enjoying it.”

“As is proper.” I couldn’t stop looking at the stone, watching it shift just ever so slightly, deforming. “Is that going to, like, be a problem?”

“Nope!”

I turned to look at her, raising an eyebrow in my best unamused-supervisor face. I held it for about a half second before I started snickering, just long enough for her to plant her face in her hands. “Sorry, sorry. That was just too funny.”

“Mean, *mean*!” She walked up to me, bumping my hip with hers and giving the emphatic lie to the petulant whine in her voice. “I guess it was a little funny.”

“So why exactly is this not going to be a problem?”

“Well, I mean, it’s not gonna make the building fall down, right? And the Stone Team can just fix it real quick tomorrow, or Kan can just do it himself, ‘cause that’s easy peasy. Little job, barely a breath in and breath out.

“And he’ll *want* to, ‘cause he won’t believe us! That stone doesn’t melt easy. The floors, that’s one thing, they’re tiles. The walls? The wall’s *bonded*, I’ve never seen something like this.”

“Brightly Burning Mist.” I clasped my hands behind my back in a conscious mimicry of her earlier pose, stretching and enjoying the lack of pain in my shoulders. She’d carefully not answered whether she was a budding pyromaniac who was going to violate lab safety procedures in a fit of fiery fun, but she hadn’t done so this time. “I guess that’s a fair name. It’ll light a whole lot on fire.”

“Two doubles. Overlap.” Kelly and I spun around, startled witless—or at least, I was—by Hitz’s voice. Prosthetic notwithstanding, they’d walked up to a few feet away from us; they stumped over, every step loud. “Clever. Journeyman potion. Base of five?”

“You’re gonna—Kelly, *you’re* gonna have to explain that to me, sorry Hitz, don’t mean to impose. While we break this down?”

“While we… oh, Thousands. Shiuai bless, I lost track of the time!” Kelly grabbed my elbow, effortlessly spinning me around to face the ramp. “We’re gonna be late for second sitting! We can’t miss it, we *can’t*, not after getting that big of a basket, Thesha would have *words* for me. But as long as you get there as fast as you can, it’ll be fine.”

“Kelly, we can’t just leave—”

“I’ll take care of it. You need to *go*.” Her voice was emphatic, intense. “I already vented the leftovers into the ditch-valve and neutralized it with the sand. I’ll put the other flask in a hardbox and put *that* in a drum, leave the cyclers running with enough mana for a day, and catch up, I might even beat you there. But go! Take the ring road through Tome!”

I started walking, stripping off my protective equipment. “Make sure nothing’s near the drum, point the flask at a wall.” Gloves, goggles, and mask went onto the bench I’d been sitting on. “And anything with residue—”

“—goes into an autoclave, I’ll be fine! Mother hen that you are! If I’m not sure about something, *Hitz* is here!”

I hesitated one brief moment at the threshold of the ramp. It wasn’t that I didn’t *trust* Kelly, it was that… well, that I didn’t trust her, in my professional sort of way. But I needed to trust her in *her* professional sort of way, and I *absolutely* trusted Hitz despite not seeing them at work, and Kelly was telling me right now that I needed to make haste to the refectory on the other side of the village.

Besides, that little voice in my head, the one that had identified the ditch-valve as being the weakest link, was absolutely silent. And if I couldn’t trust what I thought was my new Skill, well, the other reasons were still salient.

I ran.

I’d never been much of a runner. The joints would have precluded it even if I’d enjoyed it otherwise, but I really didn’t. It wasn’t even the pain of it, since an exercise bike or a hard hike wasn’t any less inclined to make my muscles burn; it was the tedium.

Maybe it’d have been different if I liked listening to stories.

Running around the arc of the ring road in Kibosh was a revelation. The motion sang in my body, and I felt every beat of my heart as though it were pumping diluted glory through my arteries and veins. My boots were wrong for this, but it didn’t matter; every step propelled me forwards, and the sheer clarity of the air was such a joy as to fill my mind.

A scattering of people—from their shops or on their walks, from their work or from where they gardened—cheered me on or heckled me in turn. *Go, girl, go* and *Now kiddo, that’s why we leave on time* spurred me on equally, my breath going short as I laughed. A shout from a reedy figure of middle age and indeterminate gender rang out, a clarion call of **\[Arcane Endurance (Lesser)\]** resounding across my world, and the burn that had started to grow faded.

Now almost sprinting, I passed through Tome, the library on my right and the combined administrative center and guardhouse on my left. I heard laughter that was recognizably Meredith’s and caught a glimpse of a waving James. I waved back at him and ran on.

I passed into the quints near Fall, lungs starting to burn as I slowed down. The light of the noon sun and its reflections was almost blinding, and I didn’t see the oh-so-helpful woman who called out in heavily accented but perfectly comprehensible Shemmai. I waved to her, not really processing what she was saying, and in return she incanted one short, catastrophic phrase.

**\[Benison: Swift Movement\]**. She called it out to the endless plains, to the spirit of the dogs and the traditions of the herders, and the power swept around me and propelled me forwards.

I couldn’t see well enough, and I wasn’t prepared. I made it three steps, three vast, bounding steps, before my left foot caught on the end of the path. It didn’t matter how little the toes dug into the soil, at that speed; I sailed, gracelessly airborne, for a split second.

When I slammed back into the ground face-first, it was in shocked silence and two flares of pain, in no small amount of shock and a strangely bright lucidity.

*That*, I thought to myself, *is some broken ribs and a fucked-up nose*.

And then the shouting started, and the apologies, and the laughter; but at least the only one laughing was me.

I'm a freshman pursuing a cs degree right now. This isnt my first time attempting college I started fall 2020 but had my legs kicked out from under me with covid and my inability to get myself to study online.

I took a break and tried another online college for business and hated that but im FINALLY back and pursuing a degree that really has my interest. I'm 4 weeks in now and we are learning java. I cant help but feel like I screwed myself for starting late - the same people who I graduated highschool with are preparing to graduate next semester and im only a freshman. Im going to lose my golden years in my 20s trying to get this degree while managing my time.

I'm trying to set myself up for success here in this first year so I may have a chance at standing out against others I have a particular interest in SWE work and would kill to intern this summer but I'm not sure where to even start. I cant apply now with only 4 weeks of programming experience. So any tips or advice is great Ive taken alot of info from other threads and saved lots of useful websites.

I have a leetcode account now but uhm 😄 I think these problems are far beyond me as most aren't in syntaxes i recognize yet. Im wondering what our senior students or graduates of this subreddit think that I should be doing in my little spare time after class what should I be trying to learn or study.

Also how do you all manage to work while attending school especially when CS students need to teach themselves valuable tools if they want to seem like a good candidate to hire. If I do all my classes then my HW where is there time to cram leetcode and work? 

Also wondering what kind of work you guys might reccomend? My city blows pretty hard but ive been trying to find any small company in my city that deals with tech who might take me aboard. Might also try a govt job in entry level IT and buddy up with the guys there. 

Lastly how do those who struggle particularly with math overcome the difficulties the classes required for your degree put you through? I cant organize a million algorithms in my head if I dont understand them and It leads to me struggling fiercely in math classes. Im expected to take algebra - precalc - calc - stats - discrete - physics 1 and 2 and probably 1 more and i have no clue how I will manage to graduate. So Please Help im Begging.


TLDR;
1. Any advice on going from a complete greenie noob freshman to good enough to get an internship?

2. 4 Weeks experience java programming what should I be learning at home alongside my prog class and labs?

3. How do students manage to work - attend a full schedule - do homework- and teach themselves softwares, tools, frameworks ECT. at home?

4.What kind of jobs would you reccomend for an absolute greenie not including internship?

5. Advice on for someone whos an absolute pepega at math on how to survive a CS degree???"

So I know this question was just asked approximately 20~ minutes ago, but I figured I’d ask about my particular situation. 

I’m a law enforcement officer (25 years old if that matters) who has just enrolled in an online post bacc CS program (Think OSU post bacc, auburn, etc). When do you think it’s best for a career changer to apply for internships seeing that they don’t follow the same class schedule as traditional undergrad students? 

For example I’m taking computer ethics and will be enrolled in CS 101 and discrete structures in December. 

Any advice would be appreciated!"

First of all, I have my associate's degree already and have gotten by well with it. I had an internship that led to a full-time job at a great company, so I don’t need to get my bachelor’s to secure suitable employment. I am one of those people who can teach myself skills very quickly. Also, I have found through conversation that I am more knowledgeable than most people with bachelor’s degrees in business. I have also been in the business world since I was 19, so I am corporate literate. I feel like I’m not learning much in my bachelor’s program that I don’t know already, and the things I am learning are things I could learn through my job’s provided training courses. I am also launching a business that I see as being very profitable and successful, so I need to save my time and money for that. I value education so much, but as I said, I am not learning much, and I CRINGE every time I check my student loan balance after only one semester. I am also stressed out trying to juggle work, my business, and school. I told my counselor about it by outlining some questions, such as refund information and re-enrollment eligibility, and she had a mini heart attack. She didn’t answer my questions, only made me feel guilty, and said, “you’re doing so well in your classes; why would you wanna drop out?!?”  Having a 4.0 does not mean I am gaining valuable information or knowledge. What would you do if you were me?"

I’m a 30+ career changer who’s now back in school to complete my degree. I’m technically a junior, but by changing majors to CS I’m practically a freshman.

I really need an internship but I’m afraid my skills just aren’t there yet. I only learned how to invert a binary tree yesterday. I'm worried that applying will be a waste of time if I can barely solve easy questions.

xehkfz,1,2022-09-14,NSA Internship Advice?,lockidy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xehkfz/nsa_internship_advice/,"I’m a freshman pursuing a bachelors in compsci. I’m really interested in [this](https://apply.intelligencecareers.gov/job-description/1191819) internship. I go to school at one of the site locations so it would be an easy transfer.

I have no technical accolades. I am a member of my ACM chapter and in the cyber security subgroup, and I’m a cadet in ROTC. Highschool GPA is above the preferred. Since it is open to freshman I’m assuming they’re expecting people with barren resumes to apply?

The likelihood of me contracting with my military branch before the spring semester is high, and that would mean I will obtain a secret clearance as all cadets have to have that before commissioning. I’m confident I’m eligible for a TS clearance as well.

Is it even worth my time to think about this. I’m very interested in this program and I’m willing to put the work in."
xehvnd,0,2022-09-14,Need some mentoring.,Humble-Giant,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xehvnd/need_some_mentoring/,"In need of mentoring.

Hey guys. I'm a freshman pursuing a cs degree right now. This isnt my first time attempting college I started fall 2020 but had my legs kicked out from under me with covid and my inability to get myself to study online.

I took a break and tried another online college for business and hated that but im FINALLY back and pursuing a degree that really has my interest. I'm 4 weeks in now and we are learning java. I cant help but feel like I screwed myself for starting late - the same people who I graduated highschool with are preparing to graduate next semester and im only a freshman. Im going to lose my golden years in my 20s trying to get this degree while managing my time.

I'm trying to set myself up for success here in this first year so I may have a chance at standing out against others I have a particular interest in SWE work and would kill to intern this summer but I'm not sure where to even start. I cant apply now with only 4 weeks of programming experience. So any tips or advice is great Ive taken alot of info from other threads and saved lots of useful websites.

I have a leetcode account now but uhm 😄 I think these problems are far beyond me as most aren't in syntaxes i recognize yet. Im wondering what our senior students or graduates of this subreddit think that I should be doing in my little spare time after class what should I be trying to learn or study.

Also how do you all manage to work while attending school especially when CS students need to teach themselves valuable tools if they want to seem like a good candidate to hire. If I do all my classes then my HW where is there time to cram leetcode and work? 

Also wondering what kind of work you guys might reccomend? My city blows pretty hard but ive been trying to find any small company in my city that deals with tech who might take me aboard. Might also try a govt job in entry level IT and buddy up with the guys there. 

Lastly how do those who struggle particularly with math overcome the difficulties the classes required for your degree put you through? I cant organize a million algorithms in my head if I dont understand them and It leads to me struggling fiercely in math classes. Im expected to take algebra - precalc - calc - stats - discrete - physics 1 and 2 and probably 1 more and i have no clue how I will manage to graduate. So Please Help im Begging.


TLDR;
1. Any advice on going from a complete greenie noob freshman to good enough to get an internship?

2. 4 Weeks experience java programming what should I be learning at home alongside my prog class and labs?

3. How do students manage to work - attend a full schedule - do homework- and teach themselves softwares, tools, frameworks ECT. at home?

4.What kind of jobs would you reccomend for an absolute greenie not including internship?

5. Advice on for someone whos an absolute pepega at math on how to survive a CS degree???

ps. Kind of trying to figure out where to start RIGHT NOW. I have a few big reddit posts I need to read through on info to learn but most is beyond my skill level."

I am done with college. I have never had a paying job before (besides various land scaping jobs). I did, however, work an unpaid internship in college. I am currently in the middle of a job search. I have a lot of student debt, but my parents already agreed to pay those for me. 

I currently have my learner’s permit. It expires in August of 2023, which leaves me plenty of time to get my driver’s licence before my permit expires. 

I am completely financially dependant on my parents. Every job interview that I have have had, my mom has had to drive me. 

I now that you usually are not supposed to tell people on the internet what stet you live in, but since my state of residence is important to the story, I live in Connecticut. 

What do you think are the chances that I will be able to move out of my parents’ house before I turn 30? Any advice how to to increase my chances of moving out before I turn 30?"

Didn’t think I’d be posting here asking for help but I think many are in similar shoes as me.

Long story short; Few years of grinding college, projects, internship, and now have been working for 2+ years at a Big tech company in that long ass acronym. 

The last few years were a lot of “do what you must to get to a good place” mindset. Now I’m there. So, now what?

I don’t really find my work fulfilling but I have no place to complain for how much i make. Do I just rest and vest? I do a lot of backend work but I’ve always been a visual/art person. I’d like to do something more creative like web/mobile or games. But I hear with web you get pigeonholed and with games they literally make you dig your own hole.

I checked out job postings and idk more than half the tech these fuckers are asking for. I also absolutely dread having to do leetcode and interviews again. Thinking about trying to learn these new skills sounds horrible. So what do? Work as long as I can without blowing my brains out?

Would appreciate any advice."

I'm attending a career fair tomorrow and didn't have much time to get help with my resume.

I graduate this December, Computer Engineering major/Computer Science minor.

Unfortunately, I couldn't really get any internships throughout the years of being in school because life kept getting in the way and that'll decrease my opportunities significantly, so I really need my resume to impress recruiters, just not sure what to mention, keep or remove.

Also, Do I mention that I require H1B visa sponsoring? to avoid wasting anyone's time.

I appreciate ANY comments or suggestions you guys may have!

I have been working for my company since Dec 2021. I first came onboard as an intern at minimum wage, and after my 3-month contract came to a close, and multiple more contracts with little pay came and went, I finally secured what I would consider a real contract. They hired me as an IT Implementation Specialist, which I had been doing for the past year pushing me towards $64k/year (CAD). I really enjoy the work I do and the people I'm with. However, for context, I live in Toronto where things are very expensive, I do not have a car, I'm stuck traveling 2.5 hour commutes to work because of circumstance. 

Last week I had been discussing with my manager the possibility of continuing with the company, and with 3 days left before my current contract comes to its completion. I’ve been offered a new contract with a 3% pay raise up to 66k/year. 

I was told that my work had always been exceptional and that I do very well in my position and they would be extremely happy to keep me onboard. To to the best of my knowledge I am well liked by my colleagues and manager. I was also asked about taking on more responsibility- to which I answered I would be happy to always expand my knowledge and prove myself to the company. Then I was sent this contract, and now I cannot help but feel a bit insulted. YTD Inflation is around 8.1%, so in effect I’ve done very well in my position, taking on new responsibilities, for what ends up being a \~5% pay cut with inflation factored in. 

I have a degree in computer science, and Toronto’s not cheap. Does it make sense to reject this offer – especially as the clock is running out?"
xeo4kk,1,2022-09-15,Please advice or provide feedback,TheRealCryptoKing,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/xeo4kk/please_advice_or_provide_feedback/,"Hello! I hope you all are doing well. I am just hoping to get an honest opinion on whether I am doing things right or just living in fantasy land, going nowhere. Feel free to roast me, I don’t mind strong words as long as they come from a place of genuine thought or concern.

Here’s my journey in short:
Good student in high school. Graduated from dental school and finished internship in 2013 (age 23, single) in my home country and became a dentist. I did not practice dentistry other than internship.
Moved to Canada a couple of months after and enrolled in business and marketing program later in 2013. I took construction jobs in summer time at sawmills, made about $50k and all that went towards paying off college. I had other part-time jobs at college and at college residence that paid for my basic needs and also free rent. I graduated in 2016 (age 26, single). Had no money left on my 26th bday, however no debt either. I had an old car that my supervisor at sawmill gifted me for hard work. I started at a perfect 0 in summer 2016.
Saved up downpayment with overtime and bought a house just before Christmas 2016 (4 bedrooms, was cheap then, $200k) in city I was living in BC.
I had lost connection with dentistry by then (and I didnt like it anyways during school, but still finished degree as I was already too deep into the program to just quit and walk away). For me to return back to it, I had about 3 years of prep+university to get Canadian license and an average cost of 200k for that school. 
I didn’t feel motivated enough and continued to work at the college I graduated from  and with promotions I made average 55-60k each year. 
I did for about 5 more years, and finally decided to quit my job and start my consulting business.
So, I started the business in Fall 2019. It started off good, I hired one staff and then 3 more by 2021. Things seemed fine, until I made a series of mistakes like big discounts to clients, payment plans, expensive staff and office etc etc. I started running it like a non-profit, tried to help every person I could, even if it was free. Cash flow became an issue and I barely scrambled to make payroll, not paying myself at that point, working 16 hrs 6 days a week myself. Business failed and I was roughly in $120,000 debt by June 2021. I was honest with my team throughout, so they were able to find better jobs as I was transitioning into shutting down the business. I got myself a side job to cover expenses. Fast forward, I pinned down issues in my business and narrowed down 2 things that made money as well as a self reflection of my values. I was still very sad, embarrassed, angry, upset, etc etc and lost a lot of confidence and a desire to take action. However, I slowly worked on things, on myself, and had a side job that paid for basic needs, mortgage etc. 
Summer 2022, I felt like I had recovered from that mental state of failure. I narrowed down 3 things: my clients need help with housing, language, and healthcare. And I further narrowed it down to offer limited but focussed services. I started working towards those 3 business opportunities while working full-time and bit of studying here n there. 
I completed the mortgage broker program and got my licence. I also started an online school/app for language training (almost fully automated, that is sold to larger organizations) and thirdly a travel nurse agency (i was able to get a contract from one province as well an employment agency licence). I also had a self-talk about returning to dentistry and finding ways to fall back in love it. I decided one way to return to dentistry was through join army, and serve in exchange for support with school. I applied and passed all the tests, and now waiting for basic training before I can qualify for officer training and dental school funding. 

Right now, this is where I am (single, 33):
Full-time job (in-person now, but 100% work from home later this year)
Mortgage broker (starting out, 90% remote, with scheduled in-person monthly marketing and community engagement events)
Online language school (slowly getting sold, 100% remote)
Travel nurse agency (going to be sending 1-2 nurses at a time for an hourly commission, 100% remote)
Ongoing training with Canadian forces, and possibly return to dental school in 2024 and get licensed (100% in-person). Forces might pay me a salary while in school, so I can quit my full-time job then or earlier if other businesses take off fast.

I need an opinion on whether whatever I am doing is okay or am i messing things up? What would you do if you were in my shoes? I get anxious sometimes and feels like a mid-life crisis. Some mornings I wake up and feel so lost, while on other I wake up and feel like I am doing great. 

My house has $150,000 mortgage left, my ram 1500 pickup is paid off and I still have my old car that supervisor gifted me. I have a class C 2000 ford motorhome paid off and an old 1987 bayliner boat paid off. I have $70,000 business debt from previously failed business. I have about $300,000 equity in my house, from renovations and rise in market value. No student loan. No credit card debt. No savings or pension plan.

**Hello, I'm from a tier 3 college in India, in my final year and here are some of the details about me:**

* **Graduation**: May 2023
* **GPA**: 9.17/10
* **GRE**: 320 (pretty moderate) (152V, 168Q)
* **TOEFL**: 105 (R29, L26, S22, W28)
* **Research Papers**: 1 definitely in IEEE and the other might get published before application deadlines though not sure. First one focusses on ML and deploys DL to use.
* **Internships / Work experience**: One internship for 6 months in 2021. I started freelancing post that and work as a lead developer at a Web3 company. (I still am a student)
* **LORs**: 2 pretty average LORs from academia, professors whom I have worked under. 1 from the web3 company mentioned previously.
* **Extracurricular**: I've attended an international competition held by the US and represented India. Stood 12th worldwide. I also have some leadership experience of approximately 2 years among clubs in college.

My main aim for securing an admission in Fall '23 would be to get in one of these programs in the universities so I haven't kept any moderate or safe ones, basically I would rather wait another year, gain work experience write a few more papers and go in Fall '24 than go to a university one would consider safe.  
Here's my list:

* UCB (MSCS terminal degree)
* CMU MSCS
* Stanford MSCS
* Georgia Tech MSCS
* UCSD MSCS
* UCLA MSCS
* UiUC (MCS or MSCS) - still confused
* Cornell MSCS
* UT Austin MSCS

I am considering UMich - Ann Arbor, UMD-College Park, USC and UCI. Please let me know what you feel about the selection or any other program that I might have missed out on. Cheers :)"

They called me a few months later telling me about an unpaid internship that I will have to pay $2k for. Obviously I said no, wtf is this bullshit. 

That's not the main problem I have, the main problem being that:

1. they are named like and pretend to be a real tech company on job adverts (e.g. "" We are seeking to hire a skilled software developer to help with the development of our current projects""), but they are actually a recruitment company in disguise, which feels really scammy

2. They did not mention the internship would be unpaid, and the ""placement fee"" request just came out of nowhere. It pisses me off that they continue to advertise on LinkedIn and other job boards

I want to report them to the job boards I see them on, but I don't know if the negative experience I had was just for the one internship they were recruiting for, or if this is a regular thing they do.

Anyone have any experience with Nexus Silicon Technologies?"

As avea nevoie de câteva păreri..
Am lucrat ceva ani in automotive. Nu m-a pasionat și mereu am zis că vreau sa fac o tranziție de pe embedded pentru că a fost moartea pasiunii pentru mine.(am fost sincer și am menționat asta și la locul de munca de-a lungul anilor, dar mereu am amânat pentru că am fost fixist și voiam să îmi văd mereu responsabilitățile duse cu bine la capat)
Am primit o oferta pe C++, as lucra la un tool intern care inca este în creștere și e folosit in multe din locațiile lor.
Ar fi un mic pas pentru mine spre ceva ce îmi e mai drag ca și tehnologie.

Fast forward a few days, am spus de oferta la locul de muncă (și că mutarea mea nu are nicio motivație salarială) și s-au deschis toate porțile...
Mi s-au prezentat două poziții, una de devops (Python, Linux-administrare server, automatizare etc.) și una de full stack (.net, js).
Menționez că mereu am privit ca un dream goal sa ajung pe una dintre cele două ramuri.
Adevărul acuma e că, am mai făcut tooling, mai sunt familiar cu unele limbaje, dar clar sunt underqualified pentru astea două poziții. Îmi sunt prezentate pentru că nu mă vor afara..
Totul e super pe graba și cu multă presiune, având în vedere că ar trebui sa dau un răspuns în vreo 2 zile.

Întrebarile mele sunt.. cum ați proceda voi?
Cum sa îmi dau seama cat de ok sunt aceste două poziții, adică ce fel de întrebări as putea pune la ""interviu"" că sa îmi dau seama că sunt poziții ok pe aceste arii. (Fiind în cadrul automotive parca nu știu ce să cred)

Hey guys. Some quick info about me. I have a bachelors degree in Artificial Intelligence, masters in Data Science. Have 3 internships under my belt. Currently work as a data scientist at an asset management firm. I make apps as my side gig.

I’m interested in moving abroad, I need new changes in my life and I’m interested to moving to the States (specifically east coast). I haven’t done much research yet, but I know moving to the US can be difficult. I would want to work in data analytics/data science in the US. 

- How likely would it be for a US company to sponsor my visa?
- I recently graduated with my masters so I do not have too many years of experience
- Is it easier to work at a US company based in the NL then transfer to the US? 
- Is there other steps I can take?

Edit #2 : I’m really confused whether to REA Princeton (I really LOVE Princeton) or EA at USC where I can have a remotely realistic chance of getting in.

Still, even with some experience of programming I can't seem to understand how people create mods and bots for games, specifically, how do they get the source code? how they test it? what kind of environment they are running?   
I assume that creating mods is much easier than creating bots, creating bots would involve a lot of maths and logic (e.g. move here, target monster, kill monster, loot, use hp pots to heal and repeat)  


There is no in-depth tutorial for creating bots (not that I can find it), so how people even learn to code it?   
Also, python i would say would be best suited for creating bots? correct if I'm wrong.

**The exam**:

* The PBQs were quite interesting and kinda fun. Definitely take your time on these and save them for last.
* The multiple choice is FILLED (probably almost half of my exam) with screenshots of packet captures, IDS/SIEM logs, etc., so be prepared to take your time looking through that stuff (I believe this is why CompTIA gives you so much testing time for this exam).
* The questions felt much different than Sec+, which threw me for a loop because I expected this exam to more or less be a big brother to the Sec+

**Preparation/Background**:

* Previously obtained my Sec+ in April (scored 765)
* I've worked about 5 months in help desk and have been a infosec intern for 3 months
* I used Jason Dion's CySA+ practice exams on Udemy (Quite good, just not a fan of him reusing questions from his Sec+ exams)

And out of those 9, 6 now already have project experience whether it be internal or outside. I am happy for them but I can’t help but think WHY WASNT I CONSIDERED OR TALK TO FOR THOSE!

I looked at our background and the only difference was one coding language, a CS bachelors ( I have an MSc in math) and an internship ( which I never had the opportunity to do. Every stand up is hell for me now because I keep hearing “call with a perspective client” and that makes me want to break something. I have told my manager about my frustration and he said something will line up soon but it’s getting more and more frustrating. I have already cried twice from this.

Edit: I have now cried and cracked 3 times. And my boss said a lot of projects coming up have been Java which is rare and I don’t have Java. When I said “ ok I need to learn Java now”. He said it wouldn’t hurt but it is rare for Java projects. As for company X he said he would try to make that work in the future but it wasn’t a good fit right now."

It's been 6 months since I started my internship, and my first project (dashboard) was built solely in Power BI using DAX. I learned a lot: especially for a guy who's coming from a completely different background (civil engineering). And I did it, the project is complete, BUT:  


There were times when I genuinely didn't know how to solve a problem, and I found myself posting about it for someone to help on forums like Microsoft or even Reddit.  


Because of that, I feel that I am not a real DA and everything that can come with thoughts like these.  


Is it okay?



UPDATE:

Thank you all for your words of support, really. There are times when you know it is the imposter syndrome, still can’t help but ask for engaged peoples’ opinions, and I glad that I did it!"

I feel to switch before my probation ends as the 90 days Notice period seems a big hassle to deal.  
My DSA skills are above basic and my knowledge in Web (HTML , CSS, JS) could be termed intermediate. I feel I am more of a product person than a proper programmer.   
I have this dilemma whether to prepare for SDE roles, or Frontend specific or something else. I am decent at programming but I have this Entrepreneurship / Ownership mindset, because of which I enjoy more on the Product side than just being a programmer who codes out the idea.   
I am not that much aligned to shift to a no code job like Product Management. So I tend to have this dilemma about how to present myself and for what type of job.

xf0i1u,63,2022-09-15,Reality of Quant,quantthrowaway38285,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xf0i1u/reality_of_quant/,"I interned at a quant firm this summer and want to share some insight about WLB, importance of team selection, compensation, job security, and who quant is good for.

# WLB

* In general for WLB, SWE &gt; QR &gt;&gt; QT. WLB also gets progressively worse the more front office you are. For example, quant devs would have worse WLB than SWEs.
* WLB of all the major quant firms are similar (JS, HRT, Citadel Securities, etc etc). In general, there are high expectations on what you deliver. The vast majority of teams do not care how long you stay for but how much you are delivering. The only quant firm with similar WLB to tech would be Two Sigma, but their compensation/pay growth is lower.
* I observe people around me worked \~45 hours.
* WLB is highly based on personal competence. I observe that the amount of work might be roughly 1.5x-2x what you get in big tech. Most of my coworkers worked \~45 hours, but they are all highly competent and probably would've exceeded expectations with just 30 hours at Meta.
* Highly competent coworkers mean you must work hard or be left behind by the pack
* **Coasting is not an option in quant firms. If you want to rest and vest, you will probably see no bonus growth or get fired. There are people with 10 yoe making the same as people with 2.**

# Team Selection

* The team you get might be the most important part of your internship. Culture is highly team dependent, and comp as well for certain companies. This is especially true for **siloed** firms such as Jump Trading and DRW. Being placed in a back office role/poor performing desk equate to poor comp.
* Some firms are more collaborative in nature (Jane Street) and in those firms, team selection is less important. Firms like these aim to pay everyone based on personal performance. On the other hand, you are missing out on upside if you end up on a major PNL producing team.
* Internal mobility for most firms (non siloed) are generally OK. You can move if you want, but it will take some work.

# Compensation

* Compensation for all roles are great. In general, SWEs will be compensated less than QRs and QTs.
* Growth is highly correlated to how much you produce. In general, YOE matters much less in quant firms.

# Deferred Compensation

* Most of the firms have forced deferred compensation (I know Jane Street does not). What generally happens is that a % of your comp over a certain threshold gets taken and invested into an internal fund (with good returns) and you get the money over a certain amount of time.
* Some firms DO NOT pay out deferred compensation if you leave (ex. Jump Trading).

# Job Security

* SWEs are generally more stable than the front office revenue producing roles (QR, and especially QT).
   * A lot of firms cut a % of QTs in their entry program (Optiver, SIG)
* A lot of the perceived job security in quant is due to their selectiveness. I have no doubt that low performers will be either given no pay growth or fired.

# Value of X role

* QTs are more valuable at semi-systematic and lower frequency firms (ie. Jane Street, Optiver, SIG).
* SWEs and QRs are more valued at systematic and high frequency firms (ie. HRT, Citadel Securities, Jump Trading)

Also, Citadel is not a quant firm. Only GQS and EQR within Citadel can be called quant.

&amp;#x200B;

# Who is suited for a career in quant?

* Ideally, you should love your job, because again, WLB isn't great
* Willing to work longer hours
* You think you are competent with whatever you are doing

TLDR: if you want to rest and vest, a quant career is not what you want, unless you are a mega genius, which is unlikely given how ridiculously competent most people in the top firms are"

I hope this is the right place. I'm double majoring in Psychology and Computer Science, only because I switched to CS in my senior year after all of my Psych requirements were met. I've almost met all the CS requirements too because I've been drowning in credits for the past year, and I'm set to graduate this Summer of 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question #1:** Would it look bad if I graduate with just a Psych degree so that I'm able to look for full-time work? Obviously, it would be bad, but I'm only thinking of doing that so I can at least have a degree because I'm well over 120 credits at the moment.

**Question #2:**  If I graduate with Psych, could I come back to take the few CS classes I have left, and would that even count towards a new degree?

**Question #3:** Do companies actually check to see if you graduated with a CS degree?

&amp;#x200B;

I hope these aren't all common sense but I'm just feeling very frustrated since I've been in school for 4 years and have nothing to show for it. Plus, I have some BootCamp experience and a couple internships / a new grad offer lined up for the next year. I just don't want to affect those if I graduate with a different degree.

What would you do?"

During my poly studies, I’ve done some projects regarding software engineering in particular developing a website using LAMP stack which based on my research is slowly being phased out and replaced with MEAN/MERN. I’ve also done quite a bit of cyber-security as well as networking courses while in school, though I’ve forgotten a lot of it by now. During my intern, i interned at a manufacturing company and managed to develop a small 3d visualisation program that saved the company an estimated amount of $35,000 (but it’s totally unrelated to software development, so I don’t know if this will be useful in getting me a job in my desired field).

So currently, i would say my skillset is in front-end developing using the MEAN stack. I am fine with no WFH, and honestly would just like to experience working as a front-end developer in Singapore with my diploma and have a pay-check.

With that, my main issue is that I don’t know where to start. I know there are many in tech on this sub, so i would really love to hear your advice in terms of companies i can try to get into with my qualifications, pay (I don’t think 0 year of experience can negotiate right?) as well as how to go about the interviews (i believe people with degree goes through multiple interview? And it looked extremely daunting to me, especially coding and data structures interview)

Sorry if this is a long post, and thanks to anyone giving me advice or even made it to the end!

I've been working IT since my Junior year in high school. I was an intern for two years, and for the last year and a half i've worked as the sole building level IT Tech for an elementary school, however I put in my two weeks last friday, (Sept 9th) in order to focus on classes for the next semester. I have an interview for a part time IT tech position at the University I study at, but otherwise I've got savings enough to last until I'm able to find a job in the next year or so. 

I picked business as a computer science major didn't appeal to me as much, (Not to say it's a bad major, I'd just rather have a major with more widespread coverage.) Future wise I may get a more computer focused masters, or go further into data analytics. Alongside the business analytics program I also plan on starting the Google Data Analytics cert program in the meantime. In terms of long term goals, I'd like an upper level IT position in either Data Management / Analysis or Security.

My main question is what steps should I take to help me? I've still not decided a minor yet, though something IT related feels best. I also am considering some of the CompTIA certifications.

I've been applying to both internships and some full time roles. Done a few Hackerranks and whenever there was a DS/ML question I was usually given a Jupyter Notebooks IDE.

Yesterday I was doing another Hackerrank, 1 question was more basic and had a regular environment where I could use Python and run it, so it was fine, but the 2nd question was an ML one, where I'm expected to build a model and the environment was the same. I wasn't able to load any visualization packages, I have to rerun all the code every time, which is time consuming and it only displays up to 2 print statements at the time. I tried to struggle with it for 30 mins and it was just insanely frustrating and makes no sense.

I emailed the recruiter, assuming they just made an error when were loading the question and the response was along the lines of ""Thanks for bringing this up, it's a valid concern, the limitations of the environment are certainly considered when evaluating a solution but this problem is solvable within the parameters of the testing environment.""

So the question is - am I being picky and this is a normal practice? Or is this odd and a red flag that the company wants me to do it this way when it's so easy for them to update it to DS friendly IDE? Just feels like I have to jump through additional hoops for no reason."

The recruiter did tell me I was welcome to do my graduate internship next semester at their company (graduate internship is full time).

In the meantime, I found a part time internship where they hired me and I now am working there.

A few months later though, I noticed that the company who rejected me, did hire roughly 20 - 30 fellow students of my course and also who were in the same year and with the same time frame as me.

My first thought was that they lied to me, that there was another reason they didn't mention, but at the same time, why would they offer me to do my graduate internship next semester at their company? It's contradictory.

At the college I am attending, I have a bad reputation (yes, even among people who never met or spoke to me) due to gossip and that could be the reason why they didn't hire me (because of bad reference, cannot be proven though, so it doesn't exist).

Last summer I did an unpaid internship because it was all I could get with my grade level and with only 1 year of coding experience. 

The internship was not at all what was written on the application information. Instead of looking at any code whatsoever they made me cross check data, and put it into excel. They made me do this for hours and on free time I just coded projects for myself because they didn't let me do anything. Overall it was a waste of time and money to travel. I did this for the entire summer. 

What should I do on my resume? The official title of the internship was just ""Computer Science Intern"" but do I even list it? I did nothing related to coding.  Should I just not put it? If I did put it and got an internship will they expect me to allready know what to do? 

On one hand I didn't gain anything from it besides working, and on the other hand I've heard that the first internship is the hardest one to get, and after that it gets easier, and I don't really wanna let that opportunity pass.

Any help is really appreciated, Thank you."

We have chosen one intern from this group that is proving to be more advanced than the others by far and has learned a lot of what we taught him in a short time. We have given him rights to reset password in active directory, which from my point of view and experience  is fine, when i interned at bigger companies i had the same opportunity to learn these skills.

Thank you for your quick response to the matters raised, on behalf of some faculty, about the student(s) having administrative rights on the Active Directory within the IT department. I am certain you would agree that this matter is of high importance and must be swiftly addressed. 

The response provided appears not to address the real concern in hands and the security risk factor for   Your original email referred to concerns about Active Directory Administrative Rights given to the student, however, the response was about Domain Controller Rights and some limited restrictions that are given to the student.  

The answer in my opinion is ambiguous and did not provide the level of technical expectation.  We must get specific answers to the following questions:  

 

1. What       type of access right has been given to the student? 
2. Why       is a student given access to the Active Directory and for what       purpose? ""

With that said, I am not concerned with getting some super-high six figure salary right after graduation. I am not opposed to it but I can easily live on much less, and from what I've seen, the WITCH salaries are ~60-80K, which is totally fine by me. Therefore, I am willing to sacrifice potential income earned in the first two years to get me experience and a much easier time getting a higher paid salary later. I am also able to move to wherever they need me to go.

Currently, I am a CS student at a crappy school. I've been here for a year and while I have learned a TON, I feel woefully underprepared for internships. I tried one hackerrank assessment for a position and floundered. I can look at the problem and kind-of think of a solution but never quickly enough and not without opening the documentation to remember correct syntax. I mix up my Java and Python built-in functions all the time. I don't have time to study outside of school or work more on my projects as I'm taking 20 credit hours this semester. The pressure and stress of applying to internships for next year when I feel so unprepared is crushing me.

I will have my associates after spring semester and will very likely be transferring to another school. I'm also thinking that doing the bootcamp will ensure I'm not behind my peers next fall. I really want to go to solidify/expand my skills and knowledge, but I know that having an internship is extremely valuable experience as well.

**My question:** Am I crazy for wanting to quit the internship search and go to the bootcamp next summer instead? Would having a bootcamp on my resume in between my associates in CS and bachelors in CS be completely useless?

Pros

* it's FREE
* will deepen and solidify current knowledge,
* will learn new parts of development like front end, AWS integration, and how to create a full-fledged program
* access to job placement services
* build confidence in my skills

Cons-

* no hands-on industry experience
* no interfacing with a potential future employer
* bootcamp may be some stuff I already know
* only one summer internship opportunity after this
* have to travel to Washington and pay rent there + rent at home"

Ever since I started interning at the agency that I am at, I noticed that two particular supervisors were a bit strange. (One of them is mine.)

For example, let’s say that I were to go to mine in particular for advice on a case, 
the conversation would take a weird turn where they would start trying to do therapy on me and dig into my life (usually stating that there may be some transference going on and that is why we are not able to figure the case out).

These moments are extremely uncomfortable not only for me but for a few of my colleagues as well, and we’ve had discussions about how unethical it feels. 

Especially because it is as though they are trying to pull personal information out of us,
and because of the power dynamics many interns have shared more than they’ve wanted to and end up feeling really gross about the whole interaction later. 

Have any other clinicians dealt with this before? If so how did you handle it?"

Basically, I transferred to a 4-year university after being in community college for two years. I can graduate in another two years, but I would have to take many classes because I just recently decided to pursue a CS degree, so most of my core classes are missing. I was also thinking about taking a summer class even though in that same summer, I'm planning to have an internship (2023). This would mean I would graduate with one internship and not a lot of projects and hard skills (outside of college courses) to show, but I would graduate on time.

The other option is taking a decent amount of classes and extending my graduation time, which lets me potentially have two internships on my resume and a lot more time/experience to work on personal projects &amp; gain extra technical skills. The main downside is that I graduate after my peers so I'm wondering if the delay worth it.

Any input is helpful, and I'd love to know what you would do if you were in my shoes."

I am currently a junior in college and will graduate after next December with a CIS (Computer Information Systems) degree, but I'm wondering if I made the wrong decision. I really want to be a software developer, which I wasn't 100% sure of when I started school so that's why I went into CIS not CS. But, now that I have learned more code and have done it for longer its definitely what I wanna do as a career. As there is a good amount of coding in CIS, I've been wondering to myself If I should switch over to CS and finish my degree with that, but obviously that would set me back. Not sure if its the right choice or not. I've heard CIS degree's can be fine for getting a software development job, but I also heard CS is the clear way to go. As I know you will be a better programmer after a CS degree than a CIS degree. One reason that's kind of telling me to just stay with CIS is that I actually already have a internship interview lined up and they seem to like me. So I feel like If I get into that which will be all summer and I learn more in depth on my own to sharpen my skills up on data structures and algorithms I should be fine with getting a job. Any advice on which I should do? Should I make the switch to CS? Or just stay on my CIS route and hopefully with this internship experience, try and get a job that way."

I managed to shell out and tailor a lot of resumes for different companies to really show common interests that most employers had. That sounds wonderful on paper. The catch? I’m a second year student not listing my GPA. Every time I get an email from a company interested in interviewing I start to panic thinking that they’ll inquire about it and end up not responding in time, just blowing away my chances of getting an internship in companies I am really interested in. 

I’ve been interested in electrical engineering in my focus of power electronics and sound electronics since I was a young kid. I took engineering classes in high school and performed well in Calculus and Physics E&amp;M with a GPA of 4.6. Then came college. 

A quick background: My family is a somewhat dysfunctional working class one. During the pandemic, a family member of mine became terminally ill with cancer but hospitals were so overwhelmed with high medical bills that we had to provide hospice at home. I had to prepare for the next chapter in my life while my grandmother in the room next door was literally dying. She was truly a parent figure for me. When she died just days before my semester began, I felt completely numb but my parents wanted me to toughen it out. 

My first semester was the most disastrous one I’ve ever had with me just barely passing classes. General Chemistry: D+, Calculus: C-, EE Introduction: C. I mean my GPA crumbled as I felt as though everything was futile and fell into academic probation. 

The following semester was one of fighting tooth and nail with excellent results. B+ in Intro to Computing (Assembly, Microarchitecture), A+ in Calculus 2, A in Applied Linalg. My GPA was getting close to a 3.0 and I got involved outside of my classes joining a solar vehicle team with a pre-academic intro to power electronics and PCB design. 

I then took two summer classes while also participating in a national competition. Untimely circumstances and poor communication logistics brought the climb to a halt. 

Now as I fight tooth and nail again, I know there’s no more room to slip up. Fall semester felt hard for me before but now I’m worried that no matter how hard I go I still won’t be good enough for internships, employment, nor grad school compared to students who have higher GPAs at my year."

* **Internship**
   * 6 month long research internship at Monash University (although remote), worked on a segmentation model and currently working on publishing the results. ( should ideally be wrapped by the time of the interviews)
   * 2 month long internship at Goldman Sachs, offered PPO, work related to ML.
* **Projects** :- Worked on multiple projects with CS profs and also had good course projects ( all related to ML and core cs )
* **Publications** :- 1 Paper at IEEE (not first author tho), 1 should get into publication in the next 2 months, both related to computer vision.
* Currently working on BTech thesis on deep learning based neural operators.

1. Able to make connections &amp; friends with students of the same course.
2. Able to better understand the CS curriculum and difficulty.
3. Able to take modules in advance or allowing myself to have a more slack sem 1.

Pros of Internship:

2. Able to learn a lot of different frameworks/ coding tools &amp; some system design
3. Able to use this experience to better beef up my resume which for now is really empty which may allow me to get a future internship at a bigger firm.

For anyone who has went through either of the paths before matriculating is it possible to advice me which path is better for me to develop career wise? For some background I know basic programming ( Python, JavaScript, Java, CSS, HTML), databases(SQL), data structures &amp; algorithm &amp; REST APIs. Also the monetary aspect is not really a main issue as I have a side hustles which generates a livable wage.

xfkm48,69,2022-09-16,Don’t give up,sharkonaut,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xfkm48/dont_give_up/,"I’ve recently seen a lot of posts concerning clubs, frats, etc and the rejection that follows. 

Just remember to value yourself on your own accomplishments. You’ve achieved a lot in your life, simply by attending this university, and you’ll have plenty of more achievements that follow. It’s very easy to get lost at this school. Feelings of isolation, diminished self-worth, and  self-pity are quite common at Berkeley. 

But the microcosm of Berkeley is not the rest of the world, fuck it’s not even the rest of the Bay Area. Once I was doing internships and getting job offers not once did anyone give a shit if I was a part of some consulting club or business frat. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is, just do the best you can and don’t worry too much about what other people think of you. Don’t compare yourself to others and remember that you’re the one living your life.

Go Bears.
Class of 2020."
xfm0b2,28,2022-09-16,Should i accept the offer?,Money-Excuse3137,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/xfm0b2/should_i_accept_the_offer/,"I started working in a Product based company from January 2022, done 6 months of internship and they offered me a PPO of 12 LPA. I accepted that and started working as a full time dev. 

But i really don't like the work culture, there are 0 perks and benefits e.g. No health insurance, no reimbursements, no laptop and i think i don't learn much here. I finish work in like 3-4 hrs everyday and binge watch Netflix. So i thought to make a switch, started giving interviews. 

Today, i got an offer from a company (Product+ Service based, they call it hybrid) for 13 LPA. When i applied i told them that my expected CTC was 15 LPA. Should i make the switch? I have only 2 months of experience working as a full time. This company provides all the perks and benefits like - health insurance, laptop, internet reimbursements, WFH setup cost coverage etc...

And Both the companies are Fully Remote.

Please help me in making the decision, would really appreciate it."

xfn3xm,2,2022-09-16,Questions about first project.,mlYuna,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/xfn3xm/questions_about_first_project/,"I am a CS student and really interested in Data Engineering. I've done a Data Science course in course with taught me some basic statistics to do things like Linear Regression, make Decision Trees, .. and i also know the basics of SQL, Python (Pandas, Numpy) and a little bash scripting. 

Now i'm wondering where to go from here to get into Data Engineering. 

&amp;#x200B;

In 2 months i will have an internship (looks like its gonna be at a bank) and i wanna prepare myself as good as i can and do a project in which i can combine these skills (Python, SQL) and learn more about ETL and Data Engineering in general. 

&amp;#x200B;

I heard someone say on a youtube video that first project should be a Flask API but i'm not sure if thats the way to go and wanted to confirm it here. Thanks!"
xfnzkz,1,2022-09-16,How do I get over my ex? It's been 3 years now.,Blah_Blah6789,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/xfnzkz/how_do_i_get_over_my_ex_its_been_3_years_now/,"I  (21 F) am frustrated. This is beyond irritating, I just can't seem to get over my ex. We had a 3-year-long relationship and we broke up in 2019, so (3 years back) but I can't seem to get over him. He is always on my mind. We went to the same school and were in the same classes so we were basically always around one another. Our breakup was out of sheer immaturity and childish insecurities from both sides but anyway it ended badly, so we went complete No Contact after that. I haven't even seen him in person for such a long time. The only way I get to see what he is up to is through his Twitter and I deleted my Twitter account now because I was obsessed with checking his profile regularly.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have tried everything I could to move on, tried going on tinder/bumble, tried continuously being engaged in my studies or participating in competitions to keep my mind distracted, even tried to meditate and take him out of my mind. 

From the outside, everyone thinks I am doing well. I am at the top of my class, I am ahead of everyone in terms of extracurriculars, I just completed an internship at a Fortune 500 company and I have an amazing friend circle so it's not even like I am lonely, but this guy, him and his thought are constantly eating me from the within. It sucks, I want to just forget about him, but it's not happening. I still love him dearly, I act like I don't care about him in front of my friends, but I do, I really do. I recently came across his university graduation picture (he did a 3-year degree and I am currently pursuing a 4-year degree and hence he graduated earlier) and my heart was full, I was so happy for him and a part of me was so annoyed that I couldn't be a part of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please give me some solid advice to move on. I know some may recommend therapy and counselling but frankly, I can't afford it on my own as of now and as per my family seeking help through therapy is a stigma so they wouldn't pay for it either, btw they never knew about my relationship because I come from a conservative family. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, please help."

I started with this company as an Intern and got hired on full time after a year and have been here since. I enjoy my job, the company, and coworkers. The problem is it is an internal IT gig, with 4 other co workers. Everyone has their role and things that they handle so I don't get a lot of experience with different things. I mostly handle all of the low level help desk kind of things. I handle some AD stuff, M365 management, imaging and deploy PCs/laptops.   


My problem is I don't have the experience/knowledge to make a move to a lateral or higher position like sys admin / network admin type of role. But if I go ""backwards"" it is a decent pay cut that I cant afford to take right now. I almost took a job at a MSP for a $5K pay decrease but decided not too. Right now my plan is to just obtain a few certs and hopefully find another position with similar pay that I will be able to learn more in."

I was told I didn't use enough of my brain. I have been feeling disengaged and unseen at work lately, and feel viewed as being incompetent. I feel like it is becoming a cycle because I can't get out of it mentally.

Only to find out afterwards that the expected salary was around 34k, in a Dublin based role.

Currently at home I would be earning around 44k, in the Netherlands in a smaller town/city where living costs are... Let's just say 900 euros for a one bedroom appartment. So way lower.In Amsterdam I had an offer of 52k that I could easily commute to with the train from the same low cost town.

Then I looked on Linkedin and saw that a lot of graduate roles get around 30-35k, how is anyone expected to live in Dublin with those salaries??? Are graduates not respected at all??

Does anyone reckon I could find a junior/grad role that would pay around 55-60k? When considering the cost of living compared to my home, and the offers I got, I feel like that is an appropriate salary.

Edit: good to mention my internship in Dublin paid more than the offer I got!!! A return offer would be around 70k however they're currently on a hiring freeze... :("

xfsk61,0,2022-09-16,Should I stick to Data Science or switch to Backend Engineering?,rick4588,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xfsk61/should_i_stick_to_data_science_or_switch_to/,"I am a 4th year CS student and currently doing my 3rd Data Science internship. This is a really good company and it'd be great if this is my first job out of college, think just 1 tier below FAANG. I have been into Python and Data Science since my 2nd year and went into DS thinking that I wanted to do something different and not regular web-dev. However, the more and more I worked with all these companies and gained insights from online communities and experienced people, the more I learned about the realities of this field. 

The ratio of Data Scientists to Software Engineers in the same company is very low, even if there is one. The reason does make sense, SWEs are actually building the product which generates the revenue while DSs/MLEs often work on cutting costs (through optimization) in most companies. I also understand that the career growth for a DS guy stops at either Head of Data or Director, Data, who in turn reports to the CTO who's very likely to come from a SWE background. 

I had all these in mind the past 2 years but still went forth with this field in the hopes that with my resilience and hard work, I could still make this work. Now, I'm not a super mathematic person but I still like some aspects of Data Science especially if my work is useful to someone and has an impact. After a conversation with my current Data Science team, they all agreed on the same thing there's way more scope on the SWE side and more room for vertical growth as well. When layoffs are around, DS would be on the cutting floor before SWE since they aren't directly generating revenue, mostly. There's also the fact about your work being more measurable and you'd know your impact in an SWE setting, which could often get vague in DS.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am faced with the decision of what to do. I have about 5 months left in my DS internship and IF this converts into full-time, I'd definitely go ahead with it, simply because of the company brand value. However, I wasn't able to convert my 2nd internship and so I don't want to like on that hope and would like to have a backup. I do like building things and even managed to piece together a full-stack web app with JS and Java for my college project in a few weeks, without knowing either one fully. 

If I had to switch to SWE, some would say it's too late since my college placements have already started a couple of months back and my DSA knowledge is also not good enough for interviews, though I do know Python and SQL. On top of that, my entire profile is built for DS from projects to internships. Even then if I had to, I'm ready to work at night and on the weekends on DSA and projects for Backend but I don't have a lot of time. At the end of the day, I'd rather make a switch before my full-time career starts than 5-10 years later, keeping in mind I would like to have the ability to build things and measure my work. What do you think I should do right now?"

The reason does make sense, SWEs are actually building the product which generates the revenue while DSs/MLEs often work on cutting costs (through optimization) in most companies. I also understand that the career growth for a DS guy stops at either Head of Data or Director, Data, who in turn reports to the CTO who's very likely to come from a SWE background. 

I had all these in mind the past 2 years but still went forth with this field in the hopes that with my resilience and hard work, I could still make this work. Now, I'm not a super mathematic person but I still like some aspects of Data Science especially if my work is useful to someone and has an impact. After a conversation with my current Data Science team, they all agreed on the same thing there's way more scope on the SWE side and more room for vertical growth as well. When layoffs are around, DS would be on the cutting floor before SWE since they aren't directly generating revenue, mostly. There's also the fact about your work being more measurable and you'd know your impact in an SWE setting, which could often get vague in DS.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am faced with the decision of what to do. I have about 5 months left in my DS internship and IF this converts into full-time, I'd definitely go ahead with it, simply because of the company brand value. However, I wasn't able to convert my 2nd internship and so I don't want to like on that hope and would like to have a backup. I do like building things and even managed to piece together a full-stack web app with JS and Java for my college project in a few weeks, without knowing either one fully. 

If I had to switch to SWE, some would say it's too late since my college placements have already started a couple of months back and my DSA knowledge is also not good enough for interviews, though I do know Python and SQL. On top of that, my entire profile is built for DS from projects to internships. Even then if I had to, I'm ready to work at night and on the weekends on DSA and projects for Backend but I don't have a lot of time. At the end of the day, I'd rather make a switch before my full-time career starts than 5-10 years later, keeping in mind I would like to have the ability to build things and measure my work. What do you think I should do right now?"

I'm very interested in cyber security. I have been studying it for sometime now but I also know projects and internships are key.
                 I already had made a post about this previously here and I got some good advice but it doesn't really look like it can work out.
So here I am, again. Asking for guidance about internships and projects. I've been really at a roadblock in this and I hate it. I'm ready to put in the work and I'm constantly trying to learn more. 
                 So I humbly ask for guidance from any security professionals that are here in this sub. 

Skills : C, Python (intermediate), decent understanding of networking (studying whenever I can), knowledge about tools like nmap, metasploit, sqlmap, dirb and some others, Familiar with Linux(not a power user), have knowledge about various vulns.

I also use tryhackme and I have nearly finished the complete beginner path. Will soon start more hands on practice on maybe hackthebox.

If there's anything else that needs to be added about me, please mention. I'll provide the details.
            Thank you in advance."

I am a uni freshman and I have been wondering what programming language to continue with. I want to be able to work for a big tech one day, but I think ML and AI are really interesting and something that I want to pursue in the future and I also like web dev and the development of apps. I have experience with the aforementioned programming languages but I feel like I have been juggling all these languages without actually going too deep into them individually or specializing in them. So I want to focus on a single language and dive really deep to solidify my understanding of them (DSA, frameworks) over the next year so I can hopefully land an internship by the summer of 2023. I know Java is an enterprise language, JS is web dev and Python is ML, but what advantages do these have over each other in doing what the others can if I do decide to switch?"

xfwn7t,8,2022-09-16,Jane Street vs. IMC Trading for Internship,Sario25,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xfwn7t/jane_street_vs_imc_trading_for_internship/,"I'm a junior in College who was incredibly lucky enough to be reaching the end of my recruiting season after getting offers to intern at these two firms next summer, both in SWE / Dev roles. I'm just using this thread as a chance for anyone in this community to ask me anything, but also to ask the community to help me reason about these two companies as I make my choice.

A number of people I've talked to who are also recruiting seem to feel that this would be a no-brainer choice for Jane Street, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't just chasing the slight prestige hit that JS brings over IMC.

IMC Pros:

\- Really great community / culture, intern classes seem very close

\- Really extensive onboarding / training programs. Good career progressions

\- Chicago is significantly cheaper than NYC

Jane Street Pros:

\- More compensation (altho NYC is more expensive than Chicago so this may actually be less significant than first appears)

\- Slight prestige difference for people in the industry (e.g. for resume purposes)

\- Get to live in NYC, the city that I had gone into this season wanting to land a job in

Looking at my IMC pros, the biggest factors seem to be things that Jane Street still does decently in, just areas where IMC may have a slight edge based on people that I've talked to. I was just hoping that anyone who had experience at or with either of these firms could bring up anything that I wasn't thinking about when making this decision before my deadline next week."

Most people are looking to get into the field- I was looking to get out.  This was a little while ago.  

I’m curious for those of you in IT- especially in business roles how you left the industry and where did you transitioned too?

Back story: 

I ended up in IT coming out of uni after studying social sciences at an MSP through a friend: doing an internship in the PMO and then getting hired as a project coordinator mostly doing admin.  

I grew into a project manager- which honestly sucked and didn’t play to my strengths.

I pivoted internally to an account manager for our clients because of my social skills - for lack of better words and someone left and I already knew the clients.

Getting into IT/ in hindsight, kind of pigeon holed me to IT according to some feedback I received.

I was always more interested in business than the technology- although I learned a lot of the technology and lingo.

I made some mistakes after leaving.  I’m looking to learn what I should have done based on others experiences.m and how they leveraged their experience in this field to other, non IT related positions.

Thank you."
xfxje6,1,2022-09-16,Advice overcoming lack of motivation/laziness and the future?,Shmubler,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/xfxje6/advice_overcoming_lack_of_motivationlaziness_and/,"(Wasn't sure whether to put this under mental health or emotional advice)

Hello, everybody! I (M22) graduated from college a few months ago with a bachelors degree in computer science, and now I'm starting to have intense fears about my future and how I'll be able to ""make it"" in the field I chose... 

My biggest issue right now is with my own work ethic, I'd say. Or more-so my own motivation to do independent projects/work. When working on projects for school and my part-time job, I am very efficient and will get any job done to the best of my ability. I tend to lean more towards getting a job done effectively as opposed to quickly, but either way the job gets done. I've been complemented by customers, my managers and even fellow employees about this, and it's something I hold very dear to me.

But this attitude does not extended to my personal projects and studying. I've wanted to pursue game development as a side hobby (or perhaps a source of income while I pursue software/web development as a legitimate career), but can't seem to find the motivation or creativity to work on projects. I enjoy the game development process, and will begin a project and get very excited about the prospect, and then it just doesn't go anywhere. I know this is a relatively common thing to happen, but it's happen so many times now that I don't even really start projects anymore. I think about them, and then nothing happens. 

I've been applying to jobs and internships in my field, and haven't been getting anything back. I want to expand my portfolio/resume to make my chances better, maybe with a certificate or masters program, but I'm afraid I won't have the ethic/motivation to put in the work. Or I'm afraid my portfolio of projects won't be impressive enough to even land a job at all...

I've been working on my own emotional/mental well being a lot lately, and I figure it's time I work on this part of myself to. So what do you guys think? Have any of you experienced something similar to this, and whether you have or not, do you have any advice on how I can work my way out of it?"

xfyvt5,8,2022-09-16,Best Schools to study Music Business (from a recent grad perspective),TurnipOne4471,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/xfyvt5/best_schools_to_study_music_business_from_a/,"I’ve finally decided to make a list of what I think are the best schools to study music business. As a recently graduated senior who now works in the music industry, I’ve surveyed my friends and colleagues who attended college and asked what their experience was like/ if they have any opinions on top contenders. I remember when I was applying it was hard to find a proper list because there was never any consistency. Below I have a top 3 with explanations why. These were all the most common mentioned/most raved about. I think the problem with most lists is *they never explain what you may actually get out of a program*, so I tried to give detailed explanations of that! I just wanted to share my wisdom, because I know how insane and time consuming music program applications/prescreens/portfolios/ live auditions are, so I’m here to save you some time on where you should apply/what you should probably add.

***Top 3/Most common mentioned:***

**Northeastern University** \- This may come as a shock to some, but Northeastern is one of the best schools in the country to study music business. The music industry majors are taught courses on copyright law, artist management, music supervision, music production, (and much more!) by faculty who currently work in or have worked in the industry. This includes Grammy winning professors, big name entertainment lawyers, and professional musicians (some that are even signed to major labels). On top of this, Northeastern’s co-op program has partnerships with LiveNation, Glassnote, Universal Music, Warner Bros, Apple Music and Republic Records to name a few. Typically music industry students do around 2-3 co-ops, which leaves you with a year to a year and a half of work experience in the industry when you graduate. This is great, because networking and resume (especially where you’ve worked) are EXTREMELY important in the music business. A co-op is a 6 month internship where you work instead of taking classes. The benefits of co-op vs. real internship are the duration you work there and the work you are assigned. Since you will be full-time, you are essentially treated as an employee and have assignments that you wouldn’t get at a typical internship. You don’t have to pay tuition, it is usually paid, and you can choose to co-op anywhere you want in the world (California, Nashville, NYC, the UK, and Spain for example).

Fun fact: Tyler Arnold was a northeastern student on his co-op at Republic Records, when he himself discovered someone we know today as Post Malone! He’s now the VP of Republic Records.

**NYU Clive Davis** \- Another one that you may have expected... Like USC, Clive is one of the most sought after programs to study music business. It’s especially lauded for its access to premier resources and connections. Students in this program experience frequent visits of guest speakers of major recording artists in the industry as well as a tight-knit environment with other students and professors. You can also concentrate on a particular interest of yours such as songwriting, performance, or music production as you learn about the music business. Similar to USC’s format, you take business classes at Stern, but you also will take music performance classes at Steinhardt to hone in your skills. If you enjoy the creativity of music but also are considering the business route, this program is perfect for you to gain practical education and gain skill on your other passions. This program is very course heavy at first, and it isn’t uncommon for first year students to be enrolled in upwards of 5+ classes (you typically would take 4-5 classes in a normal full-time student schedule at other universities). Along with this, internships are common ground for music business students, and it’s not unheard of for some students to intern nearly every single semester along with their classes. Because the program is so small, you will have an advisor (who just works for music biz students) to guide your through your scheduling and potential internship opportunities.

**USC Thornton** \- This one is obviously a no-brainer, but Thornton is long hailed as the Harvard of music business schools. Students here take combined classes at both Thornton and USC’s top-ranked Marshall School of Business for a very well-rounded and practical curriculum. Thornton is home to multiple Grammy-winning professors and some of the most highly respected experts in Hollywood, and students work closely in their small classes and collaborative environment. Due to its proximity and connections, USC is a major feeder into many local labels and music biz hubs such as LiveNation, Warner Bros Music, Universal Music, Sony BMG and more. The plus to this is many faculty either have worked at, currently work with, or know plenty of people who work at these companies. Due to the small class size, the personal connections made with professors gives students an “in” to the industry. In addition to this, with Thornton being one of the most prestigious music schools in the world, students are lucky enough to be surrounded by the future face of Hollywood. There are dozens upon dozens of up and coming musicians, composers, agents, and managers, and even more of those who are already ""made it.""

The honorable mentions I didn’t learn much about as those three above seemed to dominate/I knew the most people from. They're also some of the most competitive. Those listed below are also programs I’ve heard great things from, and I would suggest still applying to if you’re planning to major in this!

**Honorable Mentions:**

* UCLA
* UT Austin
* Syracuse University
* Belmont University
* University of Colorado- Denver
* Berklee College of Music
* CSU Northridge
* University of Michigan"

I recently graduated in May with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering and to be honest I kind of procrastinated in applying until July. I've submitted 50+ applications now and the only interview calls I've gotten weren't really even interviews. They were from those companies that make you work as an unpaid contractor under them after doing some X-week coding boot camp which I was told to avoid.

I'm starting to think that my experience and ability is the problem. I used to think I was a good programmer, I basically served as an unpaid tutor for some of my peers at university. Then I found out I can't even solve some of these ""easy"" LeetCode problems without taking a couple of hours on it (Binary Trees kick my ass, recursion is hard). I was able to try some of those HackerRank tests for some of my applications but I failed pretty hard due to the time limit that's imposed on those things. Also, a lot of job listings have things that I never really used in University before but are apparently a pretty big deal in the development industry i.e. AWS and SQL.

Furthermore, I don't even have any professional experience as a developer. The only internship I have is in IT, which I don't imagine has much overlap with developers other than they both work with computers.

After struggling for a bit (and I know that a lot of people have had it worse than me) I figured I need some help and now I'm coming to y'all. Can someone please guide me to what I should do to make myself more marketable and what steps I need to take to get closer to working in the industry? Do I need to practice more? Try and start some personal programming projects? See if I can help with any open source projects? Fix my resume? Talk to people in LinkedIn to get a referral?

Currently, I'm working 8-5 as a temporary Desktop Support Tech for the company I interned for because my wallet's getting pretty low. I'm pretty confident that this isn't the career path I want to go down. When I get home, I do some daily necessities like walk the dog, wash the dishes, laundry, etc. (Still livin' with my parents. Love being rent-free!). Then I apply to some companies, grind some leetcode, try to learn some new technologies like AWS (planning on learning basic SQL queries eventually), and then fall asleep.

I'm really worried that the more time I don't have in the industry post-graduation, the less likely I'll ever work a career in what I studied for.

&amp;#x200B;

Heres my resume: [https://imgur.com/a/S0yFoWt](https://imgur.com/a/S0yFoWt)

I thought it was good, but then again I'm also not the target audience of my own resume. Do I need to study more or am I decently qualified for some entry level positions? Or is it because I simply haven't applied enough?

Also if anyone on here who knows me is on here and is able to narrow down who I am and happens to have a job in a company that is looking for new grads, shoot me a message 👀👀👀"

(venting)",Khenghis_Ghan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xg3vo8/approaching_a_year_of_unemployment_how_fucked_am/,"So, I have a graduate degree, technically in MechE, but I did my thesis around scientific computation and GPUs. I spent 2020-2021, very nearly 2 years, working as an SDE at a prominent national research institute, and ended up quitting because I just hated the top secret work environment and struggled with the ethicality of the work. I feel like I have a lot of the big SEO terms - Python, C++, machine learning, a thesis which incorporated GPUs, a couple years FTE dev experience which was from an internship promotion, all good signs.

What was stupid was that I quit before I'd lined up my next job (just couldn’t be with the stress any longer). I faffed around for the first 8 months and really only started responding to recruiters/applying to jobs the last 3 months because on paper I (think) I’m a really strong candidate, and I only started making cold applications in the last two weeks, which, those feel like just wasting time, like the application just goes straight to the bin if there isn't a recruiter to represent you. I have had 3 interviews get to the final round in the last month or two, including at a major company, but each time I've scuffed something and was told no (I think a technical round in each one but who knows), which, [I posted about here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/x8kxqg/made_it_to_the_final_round_at_a_big_company/). I am still getting hit up by recruiters, so that's good, but they're overwhelmingly for contract positions, and, having done that before grad school I know how much being a contractor sucks, both in terms of compensation compared to what you'd get FTE and the kind of work, and I don't want to go back to that, not with a grad degree and a couple years as an FTE dev in a position with some responsibility. I do feel like the number of recruiters reaching out on LinkedIn has declined the last 4 months even if my profile views are good, and the majority of recruiters reaching out to me now are no longer English first language and are finding me on Dice, so, I feel like they're low-yield, or just doing it to fill some quota.

I'm coming up on my 1 year anniversary of my last job in a couple months and I feel pretty low, like I'm at square one. Like, I've been turned down without even a phone interview for positions that I was pretty uniquely qualified for as a MechEng-SDE combo, and the only thing I can think of that would just get me screened like that is I've been unemployed for a while. What can I do to get further with LinkedIn/better quality recruiters reaching out? Are cold applications just a waste of time, should I be trying to make network connections with recruiters?"

I just graduated from my undergrad and I’m planning on applying to PhD programs this fall (looking at CS and information science depts, interested in critical computing and HCI). I have a good amount of research experience and know that I genuinely love research and think that I want to be a researcher — I’m as sure of that as I can be sure of anything at 22 years old.

but I’m also terrified of phd student life! It seems like it’s designed, whether intentionally or not, to destroy your mental health. Pressure to publish + lack of work/life boundaries + being severely underpaid + exploitation + possibly abusive environments + loneliness &amp; social isolation + many more things…I’m overwhelmed thinking about it. I already have mental health issues (that I’m actively working on with a therapist), and I’ve observed that these issues are much easier to cope with when I have ample time for rest and life-giving activities. I’m also a young woman of color so extra nervous about associated challenges. It seems like every day on Twitter I see another tweet about yet another broken aspect of the institution of academia. I had an industry research internship this summer, and while it was much better in some ways, I still felt the isolation and pressure to publish.

I guess I feel frustrated as to why it seems like I need to go through a traumatic experience to become a researcher. Are there places in academia that are supportive of a healthy lifestyle, or is academia just incompatible with that?

I apologize in advance if this was too pessimistic. I ask these questions because I love research so much, but I feel hopeless about being able to do research without major consequence to my mental health."
xg459h,4,2022-09-16,Lost and found myself - Am I having an existential crisis of some sort?,aquatarkus_,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/xg459h/lost_and_found_myself_am_i_having_an_existential/,"I feel like I’ve either lost who I am or found a new version of myself that is still so new that it scares me…

When I look at my life right now, there is not that much to complain about, actually.

I’m currently seeing a very sweet, thoughtful, and caring guy, who really makes me feel things I’ve never felt before. The only catch is that he’s about to spend a year in the US for an internship. We want to try our luck at long-distance and honestly, this doesn’t really scare me all that much. I’ve been in a LDR before (which def. didn’t end because of the distance), and I know that I’m good at finding ways to make another person feel loved that doesn’t have to include physicality.

Also, I’m almost done with my studies, I only need to finish my bachelor thesis. Okay, I am very anxious in general and writing papers has been notoriously hard for me, because of my overbearing perfectionism but I wouldn’t say that me feeling lost stems from that.

Another thing is, that I’ve rekindled a couple of my friendships with the people here in the city I live, which means that my social life is actually going better than before. On the other hand, I’ve had a huge fall out with a long-term friend of mine (of more than 10 years) and currently I don’t feel like being in contact with them at all. So, this could actually feed into my sense of confusion… - It’s like we’re grown so far apart… I feel like I’ve changed so much that a person like them cannot be part of my life anymore. I never thought that this would ever happen, to be completely honest. —

Especially my relationship with this guy made me question a lot of “person truths” I thought were a constant in my life. I never wanted kids, but since I’ve met him, I can suddenly imagine myself being a mother. And I don’t mean in a lustful: “I need him to make me pregnant NOW” kind of way, it’s more like a: “Oh, this could actually be a possibility for me in the future.” And it’s not even (only) in reference to him. The father of my potential child could be anyone…

My family is pretty chaotic and for the most part of my life I actually felt like I didn’t really have a family. But these last few months it got better again (after a bad phase because of COVID and differing opinions about the vaccines etc.) and the last time we met, I just really felt a deep sense of community and I understood that I wanted to have this “for myself”, building my own little family when I’m a little bit older.

Also, I’ve realized how much of a touchy person I am. I’m always holding my partners arm, touching his hand or kissing him. Back when I was younger, I literally didn’t even hug my best friends. I was so scared of touch and also weirdly thought of myself as being “above physical touch” (what a load of BS lmao). But I have just denied myself all these years… I am extremely physical, I love sensuality and I love having sex.

Despite this context, I really started to like doing sports the last few months. I’ve always liked dancing and such, but never realized how much I love challenging my body and really expressing myself with it. I’ve added swimming back on my weekly to-do- list and it really helps me grounding myself. Back in school, I really wasn’t that much of a sporty kid and people would also tell me that I’m not very good at sports, which definitely influenced my thinking, I guess. Also, I’ve always told myself that I cannot be a physical person, because I am artsy and ‘intellectual’… and these things, from my narrow-minded perspective back then, just didn’t fit together.

Funnily enough, the guy I’m dating is very good at sports but also super philosophical and extremely book-smart. At first, I was so confused by the way his interests and his outward appearance seemingly “clashed”, but then it just stopped me in my tracks… I realized how weird and “in boxes” my thinking was the whole time.

Now, I feel like I can accept all the parts of myself way more than before. I don’t have to deny my need for physicality anymore, it doesn’t have to be a paradox, because I also love reading theory etc.

I’m also not denying my emotions anymore. I understand that I can sometimes be very erratic and moody, but I am first and foremost extremely sensitive, which also makes me very understanding and empathetic  to others, which is definitely not a bad thing. It is hard sometimes to work through all of my emotions, but it is worth it. I don’t have to act like a cold and ‘rational’ stoic anymore. I don’t want to act like that anymore.

Also, my worldview changed a lot the last couple of months, the last year. I’ve started to talk to different people and actively chose to leave my bubble. I’ve been a completely different person 4 years ago, ideologically, but it makes me feel so free and hopeful. A lot of opinions I’ve held when I was younger I actually find very funny and almost embarrassing nowadays. But it’s good to cringe about your past-self every so often and I guess it’ll be weirder if I still held the same worldview of when I was 18 (I’m 24 now).

Another thing that shocks me is the fact that I’m currently not interested in making music anymore. For the longest time, it was my passion, I always wanted to be a musician, but I’ve lost that motivation.  Not in a bad way, I don’t really feel sad about it, it just doesn’t mean that much to me anymore. I sometimes get the sneaky feeling that making music was just a compensation for something else. That I needed making music in general to feel beautiful and to feel worthy, like a form of escapism into a world I can freely mold according to my imagination… But now I just AM the person I always wanted to be and don’t need to imagine it anymore. Adding to that, I have different aspirations as a cultural scientist and essayist, wanting a more “direct approach” to how I process the world (it feels more ‘immediate’ to me, even if some may say… it’s not ‘hands-on’ either, which is true). But because I kind of lost that passion, I wonder if there’s something wrong with me, if I’m maybe just depressed, you know?

Like I said, I’ve denied myself and I talked down to myself for wanting basic human things like touch or human connection for years, and now that I’m finally healing from so many things, I realized that a whole different person wants to come out of this shell. This is so confusing and scary and makes me question my entire past identity. Like I’ve been living a lie for most of my life. Could this be the reason why I feel lost and scatter-brained lately? Or is it just my partner leaving the city? Or me having to finish my bachelor thesis… Or everything all together?

Can anyone here relate?

I felt how I slowly became a shell of my former self, I remember someone saying that I was ""maturing"" when in reality I lost my happiness.
I feel like I miss the old days where I was just happy and never was never bothered what others might say.

The bullying happened, I lost one friend bc of their personal issues with their parents bc of their relationship with someone, my best friend told me that she said it was my fault. I lost another friend because of their issues with other friends and their bf and after some time, after many times of just trying to give advice and trying to help. I lost a good friend, bc they lied to me horribly. Their life went on, while I was constantly sad, felt guilty where I should have.

Last year me and my friends graduated and I started an ""internship"". Some friends started studying at universities and I think that's were it started getting way worse. I felt worthless bc I didn't go to an university like the others, I was constantly sad and felt like I wasn't good enought. I aced almost all my classes and still felt worthless, still feel. I got really sick and think to this day, that it's because of all the stress I caused myself.

I went to some type of therapist thinking she could help, but after some time she let me go, bc she thought all my problems where solved bc I applied for university.

The past year I feel like it's gotten worse, the sadness, the stress, the crying. I feel like there's no future for me, if I think about it, there is nothing, nothing for me to do, I don't see a future for me, it's just blank. And I have nobody to really talk about my feelings bc on one hand I think that they won't understand or could really help me, on the other hand I think that I'm just thinking that these are serious problems, that maybe they aren't real or serious, that I'm just being dramatic.

Yesterday it got so bad, I cried, couldn't properly breathe, idk what happened.

I just don't know anymore, is it just me being overly dramatic or something else?"
xg6b2s,1,2022-09-16,This is dumb af but WHAT DOES HE WANT???,taradaijo,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/xg6b2s/this_is_dumb_af_but_what_does_he_want/,"Long story short, I (f19) met a guy (m20) about a month or two ago and we went out a few times and we instantly clicked - our sense of humor is similar and I find him very attractive and he made it clear he finds me attractive too.

On our third date when we were talking about male-female relations and stuff like that. He said that recently the idea of seeing someone casually with no labels has been appealing to him. I have no problems with casual relationships and rn I have no particular need for either a casual or a serious relationship so I really don’t mind whatever direction this “thing” with him goes.

We talk every or every other day in between our dates, we kissed a few times and are pretty touchy with each other and on dates we have great chemistry and the (sexual) tension is definitely there, but I felt like it takes him forever to ask me out on another date or that his texts appear dry sometimes. (He’s a bit of a dry texted generally though)

Before you say it I know this might be bc he doesn’t care that much (but I didn’t get that impression tbh) but it’s probably bc he has both an internship and a job currently and his schedule is quite busy. (He also lives a bit outside of the city and doesn’t have a car)

So one night when me and my bff got a bit tipsy we decided to mess with him over texts and after he told me “go fuck yourself” I told him “if you had the balls you would fuck me”, which lead to a conversation about us wanting to sleep with each other and how shocked he was with my statement and how he would “gladly fuck my brains out if that’s what I wanted”

Anyways, the kicker is that 4-5 days after that he put something interesting on his instagram story. It was a post that said this: 

Fuck you (declaration of love)

Fuck me yourself (reciprocated)

Literally what we said the other day lmao.

I might be reading to much into this, but regardless of him saying he’d probably want sth more casual rn, he’s acting like that’s not what he wants. He told me he wants to feel butterflies in his stomach again (like you do when you’re in love) and it’s completely valid that he doesn’t want a serious relationship until he falls in love, but why would he have the need to tell me about wanting sth casual if he’s actually a hopeless romantic? Like we still don’t know each other enough to tell that we ARE or ARE NOT gonna fall in love. Maybe he’s just playing?

We’ve seen each other once after those texts about having sex but another friend was there so we couldn’t really talk about it more like we said we would.

Also the fact that after I specifically told him I want to have sex with him, he’s not rushing to meet me or anything like that makes me feel like he doesn’t really want casual - I mean what else is casual if not being more than friends and less than romantic partners - having sex with that person but not being in a committed relationship. So why isn’t he “rushing” to sleep with me?

Like I said at this point idrc if we’re casual or not, but he’s kinda sending mixed signal and I’m curious about what he actually wants. 

Ngl I’m eager to sleep with him nevertheless so like why isn’t he initiating sth more at the moment"

Hey guys. I'm a freshman pursuing a cs degree right now. This isnt my first time attempting college I started fall 2020 but had my legs kicked out from under me with covid and my inability to get myself to study online.

I took a break and tried another online college for business and hated that but im FINALLY back and pursuing a degree that really has my interest. I'm 4 weeks in now and we are learning java. I cant help but feel like I screwed myself for starting late - the same people who I graduated highschool with are preparing to graduate next semester and im only a freshman. Im going to lose my golden years in my 20s trying to get this degree while managing my time.

I'm trying to set myself up for success here in this first year so I may have a chance at standing out against others I have a particular interest in SWE work and would kill to intern this summer but I'm not sure where to even start. I cant apply now with only 4 weeks of programming experience. So any tips or advice is great Ive taken alot of info from other threads and saved lots of useful websites.

I have a leetcode account now but uhm 😄 I think these problems are far beyond me as most aren't in syntaxes i recognize yet. Im wondering what our senior students or graduates of this subreddit think that I should be doing in my little spare time after class what should I be trying to learn or study.

Also how do you all manage to work while attending school especially when CS students need to teach themselves valuable tools if they want to seem like a good candidate to hire. If I do all my classes then my HW where is there time to cram leetcode and work? 

Also wondering what kind of work you guys might reccomend? My city blows pretty hard but ive been trying to find any small company in my city that deals with tech who might take me aboard. Might also try a govt job in entry level IT and buddy up with the guys there. 

Lastly how do those who struggle particularly with math overcome the difficulties the classes required for your degree put you through? I cant organize a million algorithms in my head if I dont understand them and It leads to me struggling fiercely in math classes. Im expected to take algebra - precalc - calc - stats - discrete - physics 1 and 2 and probably 1 more and i have no clue how I will manage to graduate. So Please Help im Begging.


TLDR;
1. Any advice on going from a complete greenie noob freshman to good enough to get an internship?

2. 4 Weeks experience java programming what should I be learning at home alongside my prog class and labs?

3. How do students manage to work - attend a full schedule - do homework- and teach themselves softwares, tools, frameworks ECT. at home?

4.What kind of jobs would you reccomend for an absolute greenie not including internship?

5. Advice on for someone whos an absolute pepega at math on how to survive a CS degree???

ps. Kind of trying to figure out where to start RIGHT NOW. I have a few big reddit posts I need to read through on info to learn but most is beyond my skill level."

What should I say when I am asked about my salary expectations.

My school calls the First Semester of Senior as the ""Last Mile"". and I totally understand. It is the last mile, for most of us.  Once January 15 hits, we are all free, whether we want to or not. I am the typical try-hard kid, but I have parents who did not care about college application until like June of this year.   
In Freshman and Sophmore year, I was in the top candidate pool for valedictorian (well technically half of my class is because everyone has really similar schedule). 4.0 with no sweat, student council member, being the candidate for the next leader of many clubs, nearly catch my first puppy love. 

And then Junior year hit. It wasn't the most pleasant experience. I got Cs and Ds in the beginning of the semester, because my school purposefully made Junior year the Screening threshold. Students began to get the freedom of the class of choice, and therefore GPA difference began to happen. I would say I made all of the worse decisions anyone could made in my school about class-selection and overestimating themselves. (I took AP Biology and APUSH and also took Physics. APUSH the test was not as hard, but my techer really graded us really harshly aand I was put on a curve against the current valedictorian and two saludicotrian candidate. Our class had 4 people and I was the discard. Physics was designed for those hwo have completed precalculus and trigonometry, but in my school you have to be at least a junior to take those math classes because of the slow track my school is in). I kind of saved it, I ended the year with 1 A-, 1 B, and 5As. Yet this also flipped me off of the saludictorian candidate pool.   

Not only so, I got 2 consecutive 1440 on SAT in Aug and Mar of Junior Year. I was already giving up and planning on applying to only my original safeties but new reach. I was not the club leader for all of my clubs anymore, because 1) I did not have time to do clubs in Junior year, and 2) the valedictorian in my class is crazily advanced, she became the club leader of all of the clubs we were in together. (She had more clubs, I don't) (and Technically one of the club I was supposed ot be the leader because the previous Senior promised me of it, but then the three of us became teammates in a competition and then he found her more responsibile than me so he dicided to give it to her instead) (No salty here, She's really good at what she does and I've never been on the same level as her from the start.)   


I spent the whole of April and May making peace with myself. I was so mentally drained that I would think about all the impossible coincidences and then paralyse myself with the hope that if they happened I would succeed. I was almost reconciled to the cruel reality (that I had nothing to do with everything I had dreamed of as a child) when my mother came out of nowhere and said, ""I want you to retake the SATs, and I've hired you a very expensive tutor. I've hired a very expensive tutor for you. Your cousin, who was a complete idiot, got into NYU after being taught by her, and you can definitely get 1550."" Her words gave me hope. So I went back to my internship and SAT practice with all my might.

&amp;#x200B;

In August, my score improved by 20 points, a figure that could be ignored. I was now in a strange mental world again. My mother and my SAT tutor are trying to motivate me to try again in October and to chase the dreams I had as a child. I promised to do it but I couldn't do anything about it. I was so tired, I didn't have any motivation to try again because I couldn't see any hope. In Year 9 and Year 10, I was forced to try because of the blurred distance between me and my dream school. It seemed that if I tried hard enough, I would be able to reach it.

&amp;#x200B;

According to my mother's and my tutor's plan, I had to take an SAT every day and write an essay for my application every week. I quit almost all of my extracurricular activities for this project and planned to take the plunge. But even when I did get home early, I was so tired that I only slept in bed until dinner time and finished my school work in the two hours between dinner and bedtime. I don't know what happened to me, but in 11th grade I slept only four or five hours a day and still managed to finish school, extracurricular activities, and SAT practice with aplomb. But now I'm sleeping eight hours a day, drinking a cup of black coffee and two cups of green tea at school, and I still feel so tired every day. I even sleep for 10 to 12 hours on weekends and I can't wake up at all. In this situation. I'm lucky if I can keep my school grades and not get kicked out of school and home, not to mention the SATs and writing essays."

i know there has been pro-china propaganda circulating amongst the older generation, but has anyone ever heard or dealt with this kind of “propaganda”?

my mother, with a history of schizoaffective bipolar, has been swayed by some sketchy podcasts on youtube made in the US. 

the gist is that there are these “experts” claiming that money/cash will be phased out and “useless” in the future, and that people should be buying gold &amp; silver instead to keep their wealth.

she has been buying gold and silver coins like crazy since, in hopes of doubling her money and not losing her money to inflation/something like that. she has even spent all my scholarship money on these stupid coins, to lose them all during one of her psychosis/mania episodes. 

she is now planning to sell the house to buy more gold and precious metal to prepare for the “global catastrophe” that is going to happen in the near future, according to her words, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. 

has anyone else experienced something similar? how can i convince her not to sell our entire house to buy more “gold” when she has already spent all our savings + the money meant for my university education?? 

p.s. she also listens to a lot of pro-trump/republican propaganda for some reason, and has been convinced of “trump’s glory and reign”.

edit: she is also obsessed over conspiracy theories from the same channels, and i’m a loss on what to do because i am her main caregiver due to her mental illnesses. 

she is not supporting me, rather i am supporting us through an internship plus tutoring jobs/other side jobs. i am under 21 and still require her legal consent on a lot of things, and am worried about how this is going to play out in the coming future."

**Little about myself-**

I come from a decent background. Childhood was very very tough financially. Saw very bad days. Doing good nowadays as a software engineer in MNC.

I am a 2020 CS graduate. I did no coding throughout college(Wanted to join the army). Covid happened. Dad got into an accident a day before lockdown. We got the surgery done somehow during the lockdown. We all got stuck into enormous debt. I gave up my dream of the army, joined a company, and gave my whole salary since July 2020 to my family(I am really proud of it, but I do feel bad and left out when my friends are buying new stuff, enjoy and all. I can't even spend 1$ without thinking twice.).   
**Conclusion** \- Time was tough but part of life. learned a lot. No complaints.

&amp;#x200B;

Present day - I am working as a full-stack developer.  Happy with job. A few months back I started learning about DSA(Leetcode) and all. Struggling with time management. Started **Grind75** 2 weeks back. I want to shift abroad(USA, Canada, or the UK). Moving forward I have 2 options-

* Grind DSA get a job and shift. Basically VISA sponsorship.
* Apply for masters(USA, Canada, or the UK). Grind DSA while doing a part-time job. Get an internship in FAANG/startup. Get a PPO.

I am more inclined towards the master's option because I'll get time to study, work on fundamentals, and maybe enjoy college life this time since I have some money saved and I can work part-time. I am confident that I'll get a scholarship in USA/Canada. Other than that I'll take a loan which I can pay off once I am working full time.

But on the other hand, getting a job directly will make everything so much easy. But I am not confident about that I can do that(Maybe I should STFU and start grinding).

I am legit confused!!!! One way or another I am traveling abroad next year. I want to earn enough to be able to sleep without worrying about money. I am just 23 and was not ready for debt.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S - I love my parents a lot. I just hate the situation."

I am a junior computer science student and although I’m a junior, I’ve only recently became a CS major, (I was originally a biology student planning on teaching).

I have only taken:
Python
C
C++
HTML/CSS
Basic computer architecture (current)

Anyway…I’m wondering if any one would like too recommend additional subjects I should focus on that are career heavy. 

I also subscribe to udemy to learn/relearn subjects on the side of my college curriculum. I’m retaking C on udemy and plan to take an advanced after. I’m also in the middle of a full stack web dev course. 

But I feel like I am not learning as much as I should be. Am I just diving into imposter syndrome? Should I know more by now? I’m scheduled to try and land an internship for a summer course credit and I don’t feel like i am as prepared I should be. 

What else should I be learning? Recommendations? 
Im thinking APIs with python or C#.

Also, is the software dev/coding career so saturated with different options and languages that I am over thinking it?"

While applying for co-ops/internships during college, do they like it if you are a member of student organizations? Or can having previous internship experience make up for that"

For context, I'm a science highschool graduate and currently a college freshman taking BS Computer Science. I'm currently an intern (was invited, never applied) sa university na kung saan ako nag-aaral and I'm currently developing a GIS web application (mag-isa akong taga-code, pero sinusupervise parin naman for production-related concerns para magiging seamless integration at deployment sa current infrastructure dito) para sa mga geographic-related data na ginagamit ng management ng administration ng university since currently lahat eh naka-autoCAD lang or spreadsheet or papel pa lang.

I've always wondered kung worth it pa ba na tapusin ko na ba college or hindi. I'm currently planning to find a remote job abroad (many global companies don't even require a college degree na), a startup to be specific, and eventually drop out of college. Pinupursue ko nalang 'tong course na 'to as a backup plan pero minsan nakakaumay narin. One of the main reasons why gusto ko nang dumeretso magtrabaho eh due to current financial struggles, pero i'm also acknowledging the fact na giving up your tertiary education has a huge risk.

Basically, I transferred to a 4-year university after being in community college for two years. I can graduate in another two years, but I would have to take many classes because I just recently decided to pursue a CS degree, so most of my core classes are missing. I was also thinking about taking a summer class even though in that same summer, I'm planning to have an internship (2023). This would mean I would graduate with one internship and not a lot of projects and hard skills (outside of college courses) to show, but I would graduate on time.

The other option is taking a decent amount of classes and extending my graduation time, which lets me potentially have two internships on my resume and a lot more time/experience to work on personal projects &amp; gain extra technical skills. The main downside is that I graduate after my peers so I'm wondering if the delay worth it.

Any input is helpful, and I'd love to know what you would do if you were in my shoes."

I have a very long list of invoices I have to parse into DocParser. 

Right now I'm uploading the .pdf and highlighting areas that are needed to be parsed. Some sections are located using anchor words to find the necessary data. I really want to attempt to automate this so I can get some programming experience.  Problem is that every invoice is different, so not sure how I could go about doing this. May not be possible, but I figured I'd ask if anyone had any ideas.

And now none of the companies that come for campus recruitment won't even let me in for evaluation in the first round.

I am sure I have to find a job by myself but the ones I think I can do (python/c#/oop development) they require at least 1-3 years of experience.

The ones that take freshers are hiring for call center/tech support which won't translate to the 2-5 years of SD experience that other real companies are asking for.

It took me 5 YEARS to get a job in my field.  During this time I feel into depression as companies either ghosted me or rejected me without any helpful insight. 

I recently landed something close to a dream job. A couple months into my new job recruiters from companies I applied to in the past are now reaching out to me. One idiot recruiter had the audacity to reach out to me on my work email telling me they were now interested in me and desperately wanted me to apply for a specific position.

All of the recruiters reaching out to me at the moment, are from companies that rejected me in the past. They didn't even want me for entry level positions because they claimed that I did not have enough experience (despite several internships) and/or the title of my degree was not what they were looking even though it was relevant to the job.

I decided to burn a bridge with the person that reached out to me on my work email by responding, ""l don't understand why you are so interested and desperate for me now. I still don't have 3-5 years of experience for your entry level positions. Obviously there must be something wrong with your company culture. Thank you for rejecting my past applications.""

My background is from a top public university with majors in data science and statistics. I want to apply for computer science masters this coming year after working in the industry for 2.5 years. Here's the breakdown of my 3 LoRs:

1. Post doc that I worked really close with for half a year for a full time research internship at an econ/public policy related research center. The work itself is focused on building tools. This is my main LoR that's related to research, I asked the post doc already and I'm sure he will write me a good LoR. But I talked to my phd friends and they all say you need a professor to write your LoR. One of them said I could ask this post doc to draft it and ask the professor who is leading this project to sign it. My concern is I don't want the post doc to be offended and feel like I do not appreciate him, which I do, a lot. I've also never talked to this professor before, the post doc directly hired me. **Should I ask the post doc if it's possible this LoR be signed by the professor?**
2. My senior manager from my consulting job. I'm also sure that he will write a good one, but from what I've heard, industry managers' LoRs matter less.
3. Post doc who taught a 2-week workshop that I attended, who is in my field of interest and knows a few professors that I want to work with.

xgy9px,17,2022-09-17,Firme cu interviuri de algo + system design,xtrqw,programare,https://www.reddit.com/r/programare/comments/xgy9px/firme_cu_interviuri_de_algo_system_design/,"Salut,

Cred ca ar fi utila o lista cu firmele mai importante care au interviuri ca cei din big tech de la noi.

Lista mea (incompleta): amazon, google, microsoft, adobe, uipath, crowdstrike, bolt, booking.

Din ce am discutat ultima data cu un recruiter de la microsoft au un proces similar ca amazon. Poti avea test online preliminar la care ai sanse sa dai skip in unele cazuri, interviu telefonic 60-90 min, 4-5 interviuri tehnice  de 60 min fiecare in aceeasi zi (algo/oop design + system design + leadership principles la amazon). La fel ca in US, poate putin mai scurt in functie de caz.

De google nu prea stiu nimic, pentru ca nu mi-e clar daca inca au interviuri exact asa sau sunt orientati pe ce au nevoie pentru fitbit (deci ios/android in mare) si daca mai au partea aia cu gasitul unei echipe, care poate dura. Oricum nu cred ca ai cum sa scapi de algo la ei.

La Adobe nu stiu sigur, difera totusi din ce am citit si in functie de pozitie, dar ai totusi partea de algo.

Booking sunt mai noi (e hibrid, 2 sau 3 zile de la birou, au on-call, dau actiuni, sunt la Tineretului (Bucuresti), cladirile alea noi langa Sincai, pentru cei interesati), au 2 interviuri tehnice de 60 min fiecare (algo + system design) si unul cu un hiring manager (comercial awarness ii zic ei, include si discutia legata de experienta ta).

Bolt au 3 interviuri tehnice (2 algo + 1 system design), iar dupa cred ca discuti legat de echipe.

Crowdstrike au similar, nu mai tin minte exact, dar gasiti si pe reddit sau in anunturile lor, dar au si ceva home assignment, nu stiu detalii desi sunt curios.

Stiu ca exista diferente in unele cazuri (internship, incepatori, unele posturi nu au aceeasi structura la interviu etc.) dar nu e asa relevant, e vorba mai mult de posturi generice de software engineer.

La toate firmele astea mai poti avea intrebari de OS/networking, probabil cu mai mult focus pe low-level web stuff (sa explici 3 way TCP handshake etc.).

Fiind mai dificile si mai lungi interviurile e bine sa avem o lista cu ele ca sa stim cam ce alternative sunt, fiind sanse mari sa nu primesti oferta din prima. Btw, cred ca e mai usor sa va ia in vizor CV-ul daca discutati cu un recruiter de la ei sau sunteti recomandat, in comparatie cu a aplica direct la ei.

Nu ar strica să adăugăm și firme ok care angajează remote din RO și au interviuri similare. 

Altele?"

I am also a part-time intern at NASA, in a non-engineering internship.  I know everything so far sounds great, but my biggest problem is myself. I'm a huge procrastinator and it always makes me feel horrible and I promise myself I won't do it again but I keep doing it. It seems almost impossible to break out of this cycle. On top of that, I have impostor syndrome to the max. I can't see myself doing anything else with my life, but at the same time I feel like I don't belong in the engineering field. To put it differently, I am really self-conscious about my intelligence. Sometimes, I'm not able to pay attention in class, and most times it takes me more time to grasp the material than my classmates and I feel like the dumbest one in the room. I have been slowly plucking up courage and going to office hours as much as I can, and studying with classmates who actually understand what's being taught, but after the latter I always feel really bad- like my inability to understand is annoying them and that they now hate me (which I know isn't true- they might think I'm a bit dumb though). I know reading books, any books help with improving intelligence but the issue with that is I have no time because of my procrastination habit. On top of that I zone out a lotttt. Anyone who talks to me, even if it's with a friend and talking about something I like- I zone out, and I am aware that I am zoning out and I feel guilty about it and try to zone back in but I feel frozen before I'm able to snap out of it, so you could imagine how it is when I'm in an 8:30 am Dynamics lecture. 

There is so much I want to do with my life- I want to go to grad school, I want to take extra classes outside of college (like history, circuitry, astronomy, woodworking, etc) to learn random new things, I want to go to the gym regularly and go to sleep at 11:30, I want to become fluent in a new language and be a really good engineer. There is so much I want to do with my life but I feel so lazy, unmotivated and dumb. Plus procrastination has been killing me. I don't know life without procrastination, I've been procrastinating on assignments ever since I can remember. What do I do to change myself? Where do I start? How do I stay motivated when I want to give up? How do I make a schedule and stick to it/ how do I develop discipline?"

I am supposed to take MAST 333 and comp 367 next winter, they are both only offered in winter sessions and there is a conflict between the lectures. I spoke with SAS and they won't approve a class schedule overload. Taking another class like STAT 360 for example to replace MAST 333 wouldn't work either since it has STAT 249 and STAT 250 which would mean that even if I fit them in my schedule for this year I will have to take 2 extra courses + another MAST class to ""fulfill my graduation requirements"".
I know it's a but of my fault there, I should've noticed before and followed the curriculum but I screwed up basically and now the only solution there is, is to wait an additional year.

I'm just letting it out here, I feel really dumb as this could have been easilyavoidable, but being caught up in a winter internship last winter and with the whole covid mess I screwed up my whole curriculum. I'm really scared that because of this my whole career would have to be delayed for a whole year and that I would have to only look for internships because I don't have that ""piece of paper"".

Would anyone be able to give me any advice? Or if they've been through this what was it like?"

xh6huf,5,2022-09-18,How did you get your first C++ job?,SpideyLee2,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/xh6huf/how_did_you_get_your_first_c_job/,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this question or not, but I'm approaching wit's end.

I should start by explaining that I graduated about a year and a half ago with a BS in computer science. I have been unable obtain a programming job (that isn't completely and utterly predatory) since then. In college, I had a short internship where I worked by myself on a VR game which, I have to say, is the worst working experience I've ever had because my boss didn't know anything about what he wanted or how anything worked and I was new to programming professionally and had little experience in Unity.

I have been studying OpenGL and C++ for 5 months now. In the past 2 or 3 months, I have applied to over 100 jobs that have at least SOME kind of C++ programming involved, whether it be computer graphics (what I want), embedded systems, etc. Anything that says C++ on it, I apply for it. I have some projects I've worked on in OpenGL on my GitHub, but they're not huge; I spent about a month on one and am currently working on the other one.

However, I have only heard back from \*2\* of my applications, one I did at the start of my job-hunting journey that I sent to Nvidia, and one for embedded systems work for agricultural equipment. I bombed the Nvidia one with flying colors, but I was clearly unprepared for that one at the time. I feel like I would 10x more successful if I had that interview now. The embedded systems one went well - I didn't even get asked a technical question - and I got dropped from that too.

TLDR; It seems impossible to find an entry-level C++ job. Who did you get your first C++ job with (and was it even your first programming job)?"

1) Wrote a research paper in economics about agricultural economics and planning to publish it soon.
2) have strong grades in my math and econ (8/9/10) classes except in second semester (4/5/6) where I fucked up shit because of mental health. 
3) I'll try to go to research intensive internship at KAIST, Seoul National University, NUS, NTU. If not, I'll intern with professors in my country. I know seniors who successfully have done it 
4) have a personal project (twitter bot) but none in AI.
I'll work on working on those in next 1.5 years.

My goal is to get a research masters in Social Data Science or AI, and potentially continue to PhD in the same field in EU.

xh87u3,1,2022-09-18,How to change careers at 45 out of marketing/comms for nonprofits?,career_changer1977,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/xh87u3/how_to_change_careers_at_45_out_of_marketingcomms/,"Hi,

I was a secretary for 16 years at a labor union then spent the past 5 years doing email marketing for nonprofits. I want to transition out of the progressive community and marketing/communications completely. I want a career path, and I have no desire to be a director of communications. However, I have no idea what I can transition into.

I have a master’s in library and information science from 2013 which wasn’t a well-researched decision, but it’s a line on my resume. I might be able to leverage it to get into a more technical field, although if you know an MLIS from a shitty school, you’ll know that the “tech” isn’t really.

The degree did help me get a brief 8-month stint in political data where I tracked the process for building a 250M person database, providing status reports and quality assurance by comparing numbers and using common sense. It was my favorite job and if I can find something like that again, I’d love to have it.

For the past 5 years, I’ve been doing email marketing for 2 nonprofits, and after 22 years of working for the progressives, I want “new challenges,” ie, I am fucking done. I only started working for them because I got the job at the union through a friend of a friend after undergrad, then got sucked back in when I found the first email gig through my old boss in 2017.

I’ve been at my current employer for 3 years, an environmental nonprofit, and I don’t want to be their director of comms. I do manage the internship program which gives me some management/personnel experience but essentially it’s a dead-end job at a shrinking, struggling org. It’s time to leave.

One option I have is to pivot on email into another sector. I’ve applied to 11 Email/CRM positions at a university, healthcare, gaming, finance, software companies. Declined at 2 (gaming and finance), got an interview at the healthcare company for Tuesday. There are directors of CRM roles which are a bit more technical than marketing strategy but it’s still marketing/comms. I really, really want to get out of this.

But what to do! I have a complex about being a secretary from my 16-year gig at the union so I don’t want to go administrative assistant, I just can’t. I thought about operations because that would let me do some administrative work (which I’m actually quite good at) in process management without the stigma of being a secretary. Besides, I can’t take notes in meetings and most admin assistants/secretaries need to do that.

I took the Clifton StrengthsFinder test and came up with Input, Intellection, Learning, Adaptability, and Connectedness. The Input is what I tapped when I pursued the MLIS (13 years before I took the test) and organized the build process for the voterfile, and since it was my first strength -- doesn’t that mean I should pursue some kind of job in that field? I can find input jobs in marketing/comms (there’s an element of data gathering and work in stats) but I really, really want out of this.

I also don’t want to apply for positions asking for more than 3-5 years of experience, despite having 22 in an office setting. I seem to have forgotten how to work and need to learn from the ground up in a new career anyway. I really, really am not capable of having more responsibility right now. Oh, and I also can’t code/program. Just can’t, I’ve tried for years, it’s beyond me.

Finally, I'm a medical marijuana patient so any drug test has to let cannabis through. 

Totally up for more discussion in the comments. Hopefully someone can help."

Recognized by the USC Pacific Asia Museum as a leading member of the politically active South Asian youth

Numerous Speech and Debate awards

Numerous Model UN/Geography Olympiad awards

Designed a new flag for my city (Councilmember recognized and thanked me for it)

**Extracurriculars**:

Youngest ever intern for one of the most renowned Muslim American political organizations (focused on Foreign Policy)

Foreign/Public Policy research internship for a nearby congressional candidate (lost slightly in the general election, candidate publicly recognized and thanked me for my work, received some award for it)

Political News/Opinion writer for the largest Pakistani-American newspaper

Finalist for YES Abroad High School Exchange Program (First student from my HS to do so) (Went virtual a week before departure, pursued online platform in turn)

A few other government/public policy-related ECs, can't get too specific because i'd likely get doxxed LOL

City's Islamic Center's interfaith coordinator

Model UN (9th-12th) (President by Sophomore Year. The club was pretty much a zombie when I was a freshmen, revived it and managed to get 20+ members and plans for attending in person conferences.)

Speech and Debate (9th-12th) (Currently the Vice President, have attended Nationals twice)

**Essays** :Really like my common app essay as of right now. It is about how I was tasked to bring about our city's jewish congregation to work with my mosque for our Humanitarian day. Largely talks about how I was raised with relative ignorance of the jewish faith due to cultural/religious/political reasons, and how this experience cultivated a change to such a belief. Highlights how I was able to get the congregation on board, Humanitarian day was a bigger success in face of covid-19.

**LOR**:

&amp;#x200B;

Speech and Debate teacher: Had this teacher every year of High School Speech and Debate. We've had a long relationship because of this, well aware of my activities and my involvement within Speech and Debate. Known across the school as one of the best LOR writers.

English 5-6 Teacher: Cool teacher, had him only once compared to the others. We hit it off though, we read a book about Afghanistan for a few months in the class, and consistently referred to me for geopolitical/historical reference. Applauded me for significant improvement in my writing, especially for our end-of-the-year research essay (which was about America's usage of sanctions). Not necessarily a direct translation to a government-related major, but a lot of what I did in the class may look well on a LOR by him.

Counselor: Generally aware of much of my ECs and such. I think it'd be a good LOR.

**Schools**: I'm still relatively unsure about what schools I wish to apply to. Though, American University, Seton Hall University, George Washington University, and other IR schools will likely be the ones I'll apply to. Really hoping someone could provide schools with good IR programs that fit my profile.

Hi! So I (18, NB) have been having a lot of trouble with loneliness lately. 

I’ve been reflecting and realized that my friends don’t treat me well and I occupy a caregiver and/or punching bag role for all of them. I’ve tried to change this, but it just isn’t possible because of circumstances outside of my control or their own unwillingness to change. 
I was already trying to make new friends and to be friendly, I think that is a good perpetual state, but now I’ve been putting myself out there even more. I’ve gone to clubs at my college, I’m friendly to my coworkers at my internship, I talk to people in my classes, etc. I’ve even gotten a few peoples numbers or hung out and talked with people from class one-on-one. It just all seems to fizzle out. 

A major problem I’ve been encountering is that, especially in my city, everybody smokes and drinks. To the level where it seems to be the only social activity for most people, especially my age. Except that I don’t. I have endometriosis and take medication for it, which doesn’t mix well with alcohol, and I was sexually assaulted by my former roommate about 8 months ago. This has caused me to develop PTSD, I experience symptoms of full body numbness, shaking fits, flashbacks, inability to/disturbed sleep, etc. My roommate was high when she did it, I come from an area where it’s much less common to smoke so this was my first exposure to it, and I associate the smell of it with that because I froze and that’s what my brain latched on to to cope with what was happening and not feeling as though I could safely flee or fight back. Im currently in an intensive therapy program in order to process and cope with what happened to me, but the event unlocked memories of CSA I experienced when I was very young and it causes me to be triggered more often for the time being as I spend a large amount of my time trying to address the issue. 

As such, it’s caused a lot of difficulty making friends. I’m good at being friendly and outgoing, but have no idea how to overcome this. Nobody my age seems to want to deal with my chronic illness symptoms, people look at you like you have the plague if you’re an 18 yr old who uses a cane. And I don’t think that I’m in a place where I can be friends with people who are going to regularly be high around me. Even if I tried that, and I have, the smell and the way people act to where you can tell that they’re high triggers the symptoms I mentioned before. This either results in me appearing super spacey as I replay events and fear that they will become wildly unpredictable and hurt me, or I become visibly uncomfortable and appear ‘off’, for seemingly no reason to the other person and come off as being weird or disengaged. But I still think it’s pretty mild and I manage it well. This has caused several people to stop talking to me, the only times I’ve been invited to hang out have been to drink/smoke and I said no. I think because of my reactions they perceive me to be morally against it, which I’m not. I’ve tried to explain this isn’t the reason and just say that smoking makes me really anxious, but they never seem to believe me and just stop talking to me. I don’t know what to say, I think coming out and saying what happened to me would make most people really uncomfortable and I’d prefer to not have to divulge my trauma to everyone I meet. 

Maybe I’m just meeting the wrong people, but I don’t know how to meet the right ones that will understand. I thought setting boundaries and saying no would be the right thing to do. 
How do I socially navigate these issues of being disabled and triggered in such common social situations? How do I say no in a way people will be receptive to and not interpret as unfriendly? When is it appropriate to tell someone I’ve been assaulted/raped? I want to have an enjoyable college experience and connect with people, is that still possible? 

Thank you so much!! :)"

Reading my notes, the sheer amount I wanted to cover would have read like a lecture in and of itself, so I'm using perspective to tell the story in a way that focuses on impact vs just facts.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/xeidpt/human_vaultkeepers_101_intro_ch1_oc) // [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/xeqprx/human\_vaultkeepers\_101\_chapter\_2/)  // [Next] 

\*Jettison Labs, Area 102\*

It was his first day. His first day! Sure it was just as a lowly lab tech, only a step above a janitor, really, but he was finally *working in a lab*! After 12 years of schooling, theses, internships, and more than a few shifts at his uncle's cabinetry business, Fred truly felt like he had *made it*. 

He was, finally, a *real scientist*. Okay, a lab dedicated to what they called ""non-organic cloning"" (he still wasn't sure what that was) sounded interesting, but his field was in nano-biology... About as far away as you could get, at least as far as he could tell. 

But still, **first day baby!**

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

\*Four Hours Later, Jettison Labs, Area 102\*

It had taken several hours to get his security clearances, do the tour, and get lunch, but now was the real beginning: a two-hour introductory session to their research. Fred couldn't be more excited if he'd grown a third arm and hand to take notes even faster! 

As the lights dimmed in the large auditorium-style environment, the speaker strode to the front of the room. ""Good morning everyone, and welcome to Jettison! Today is not just the first day of the rest of your lives, but it could well be the first day for the rest of humanity!""

There *was* a smattering of applause, but it probably wasn't anything like the speaker expected. Only one student was enthusiastic in his response... Fred. Fred was so excited, he was waiting for the speaker to shout out ""I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!"" in order to get what Fred felt was the appropriate reaction.

""Right, well, let's dive right in, shall we? Let's begin with a quick history lesson. While this *should* all be familiar to you, this is the best time to ask questions as your coworkers won't see your confusion. So don't be afraid to ask, answer, or just ask for clarification."" 

Fred could almost hear the confident wink, even as many others in the room groaned in frustration. 

An empty timeline appeared on the board, as the date 2045 appeared.

""Don't worry, I won't quiz you on the basics, but I also don't want to spend too much time on the early parts that have led us to where we are today. So..."" He quickly ran through the key dates:

\- 2025: First contact  
\- 2035: Galactic internet integrated into all societies  
\- 2045: Galactic citizens begin creating data at a faster rate than storage can be manufactured

He turned to the class, asking ""How can it be that we cannot produce more storage faster, at this stage? Surely more factories would solve the issue?""

As nobody responds, Fred slowly raises his hand.

""Yes, Mr... Tom?""

""This is just a guess, but supply chain issues? Maybe some materials can only be mined so fast, so end devices can't be made any faster?""

The teacher pauses for effect. ""That is close, but you are actually at the wrong end of the supply chain. After all, if minerals could be mined in one part of the galaxy, they could be mined in other parts. No, the issue is similar, but more dastardly: time. You see, the galaxy had already tapped all of the sources close to their species, which meant spreading further and further out from the various population centers.""

As he talked, a map of one such center, focused on the Pattayans, came into focus. Around it were several mining operations. As they dimmed - having been used up - others were slowly added further and further away. As those dimmed, it dawned on one of the students in the front row, a short woman with bright white hair and glasses.

""Oh! Is it..."" She paused.

""Go on, Miss Thomson. This isn't school, no sense slowing down.""

""Oh, okay. Um, well, as the materials get further away, it takes more time to build ships, send ships, and return the minerals. The time to mine is the same, but the round-trip time goes up until it takes longer to survey, build ships, and travel, than it takes to manufacture... Leading to a bottleneck at the manufacturing level?""

The teacher paused, Fred was impressed, and ""Miss Thomson"" sat down and received a high five from her seatmate for her answer.

""Indeed, that is very close to the issue, Miss Thomson, so close that it isn't worth berating the point. Yes, the '\law of diminishing returns\' has never been so dreary a mistress before: at some point, we were generating negative returns, and eventually, it simply became impossible to keep up. Even building more ships would simply deplete the mines faster, leading to more ships and mines and further distances and eventually...""

Pausing again, he looked around the room. He didn't like to pick on new employees, but he also wanted to encourage those who had kept the discussion moving.

""Mr. Tom, given this section's focus is on non-organic cloning... What do you feel we could be looking at here, as a possible solution? I know this is broad since you have had no information on our actual research, but I am curious what you think it *could* be. And don't worry, I am not averse to the occasional conspiracy theory. Mind you, I promise, we have not embedded mind-reading threads into sheep's wool... Yet."" This time the wink was not lost on anyone, though the humour certainly was.

Fred stood up. He honestly didn't know how to answer, so he did what he always did - what his father taught him when he was learning calculus as a child - slow down, take things one step at a time, what do you *know* and what would happen if you stretched that one thing to the next logical step.

So far, he only knew only one thing for certain: the focus on ""non-organic cloning"" was tied to a cliff in resource extraction. 

Taking a deep breath, he began speaking. ""Well, if I'm thinking out loud... I only know one thing so far, besides the illuminating history we've just discussed, and that is that we are to focus on *non-organic cloning*. In effect, while manufacturing can handle whatever we throw at it, we can't mine enough to keep up with growing demand. So, um, my simplest guess is that ""non-organic cloning"" allows us to recreate non-organic matter without having to... Well, in this case... Mine it? If so, that would allow us to solve the issue in the short term?""

The lack of confidence ending his thought wasn't exactly endearing to the teacher, but one small white-headed hair was nodding along.

""Hmm... While the first part of your answer is close enough as to be right, how do you mean short-term?"" A small hand shot up from the front row.

""I'm sorry to interrupt, but perhaps laws of thermodynamics apply here? I mean, I can maybe wrap my head around the concept of rearranging atoms and molecules and such, but the power...""

Fred jumped in, excitedly, ""Yeah, and if it takes anything like the kind of power that it *feels* like it would take, there would have to be an upper bound somewhere to how much could be produced without draining all the stars in the galaxy?"" 

An awkward unconfident pause ensues.

The teacher takes a step back, mind reeling from the implications of this conversation. ""You are dismissed, for now. Please head to your quarters. Refrain from discussing today with anyone. Generally, a good habit to be in is to not gossip outside secure rooms.""

*Could... two new employees have just proven their entire new venture was only a bandaid?*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

\*Ratchapat University, 2100, Human Vaultkeepers classroom\*

The memory finished flooding his mind as Fred finished his greeting and took in the room. He was lucky it was only one memory at a time right now. When it was up past 100 simultaneously it was hard to remember to breathe: a terrifying experience, to have to consciously choose to do something so engrained in everyone else. 

Taking a deep breath, he began again. ""I'm sorry Professor, class, I did not mean to be quite so dramatic. While true, we will get to that later. I want to start with the basics. I will let your professor decide how to divvy you up, but I want to hear from each group an answer to one of these 3 questions: a) in what way are human's physical brains different from most other races, b) are ""auras"", that is, a type of energy around each sentient, real? And, if so, what are they?, and c) what is the best sandwich in the world?""

As he sat back down, he sent a thought-mail to his friend: ""The one you are capable of eating at that time and place, at that moment.""

The professor shook his head, directing the class to form groups of 3, and that they had 10 minutes before presentations. Knowing what he knew of his friend, he was intrigued. He had never done this exercise before. What had changed? He seemed slightly more energized, awake (and not in the physical sense) and ... present.

Something to keep an eye on, to be sure...

Curiosity would have to wait, though, as he went from group to group prodding, poking, encouraging, and (only) once berating for lack of participation. This *was* a participation-based class, after all.

I changed my major already and because of that I am scared I will keep changing and keep “wasting“. I know it’s not that bad and it actually helped me figure out what I absolutely don’t want to do but I can’t seem to shake off the feeling of being trapped in societal expectations. 

I am very interested in the field User Experience and actually wanted to go for the degree called Human Computer Systems which focuses on exactly that, yet I couldn’t move because me deciding to move was short-term and because I never actively planned to move away for uni. I wish I could have commuted for that uni but it’s too far away. So I found a flat in that city but moving in with men is an absolute no-go for me, so I had to say no to that opportunity for now. 

On the other hand I am very interested in Psychology and also know you can get into UX with it. I could get into a private uni for that since it’s hard to get into a public uni for psychology here in Germany. 

So yeah. I feel horrible all the time:( I am scared to run out of time as well and I WANT to find something I love so badly but I feel like things just go wrong all the time in that particular topic. Now I feel like I wasted another year… when I know I didn’t because I kept trying to search for something I could be interested in. It just sucks when people around you find a path and try it out without being anxious about it…

I was thinking of doing some internships in that field for this year until I could move out next year and plan everything properly. Or just start private uni for two semesters to get some credit points and transfer them when I study Human Computer Systems.

xhj8ak,121,2022-09-18,From Struggling With An Intro To Programming Course To Becoming A Software Engineer At A Silicon Valley Tech Company,lifting_and_coding,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/xhj8ak/from_struggling_with_an_intro_to_programming/,"Whatsup everyone.

I remember when I first got into computer science and how I struggled like crazy with the intro to programming course. At that time, I made a promise to myself that I would work my butt off and once I got a good job, I will post on programming communities to motivate others who may be at the same starting point.

Well I'm glad to say that I've been working at a Silicon Valley tech company for just over a year now and I feel it is time to make this post. Hopefully this will motivate some of you out there who are at the same starting point.

**My Starting Point:**

I was finishing up a criminology degree and I became interested in CS at the same time around the last semester of my crim degree. I signed up for the CS program at a local university and was soon accepted. Luckily a lot of the credits from my crim degree transferred for the general credits in the CS degree so I only needed another two years to complete my CS degree rather than 4.

Keep in mind, I've been a terrible student all my life. I didn't graduate high school in time and failed many courses in HS. However, I was an above average student in my crim degree. My above average grades in my crim degree are what got me accepted into the CS program.

**The Struggle:**

The acceptance into the program is where the struggle began. I started with an intro to programming course and understood NOTHING. I remember feeling so hopeless and trying to reach out for tutoring. I had one lesson with a tutor and everything he explained went right over my head. At this time, all the imposter thoughts were swarming into my head (""Am I smart enough for CS?"", ""Can I really do this?"")

However, I kept pushing. This MOOC course was a life saver for me in finally grasping beginner programming concepts [About the course - Java Programming (mooc.fi)](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)

There were more struggles along the way. The next one was mathematics. Remember how I said that I didn't even graduate high school in time? My math was barely at elementary school level when I joined the CS program. I had to work on my foundation of math from the base. The best resource I can recommend for this is Professor Leonard [Professor Leonard - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ProfessorLeonard). Simply the best math instructor ever. Period. Difficult math concepts that I could never grasp felt so easy when explained by Prof Leonard. Cannot recommend enough!!!

That's a glimpse into the educational struggle. The next struggle was actually finding a job/internship. My advice here may not be the best b/c all I did was apply apply and apply some more. I applied to so many positions its not even funny. My inbox is flooded with rejection emails.

I remember the first coding challenge I got was for an internship from one of my dream companies at the time (not FAANG or any Silicon Valley company). I took it and failed it MISERABLY. Looking back, the coding challenge was actually pretty easy. However, at the time, this was demoralizing.

About 8 months into my CS program is when I got an interview that translated into a job offer. This was at a small local tech company. However, I ended up declining the offer because I felt that it would significantly slow down my progress in school. My number one goal was finishing the degree up ASAP.

12 months in, I applied to the same company at which I had failed the initial coding assessment. As luck would have it, I ended up passing the coding challenge this time and I got the internship. The pay was nothing major but I was ecstatic.

I worked my butt off at that internship and was in the process of being converted to a full time employee.

At this time I was also applying to other companies as I wasn't a full time employee at the company I had done an internship at yet, so I felt it was best to keep applying in case things didn't workout there for some reason.

Again, I was rejected by a lot of companies but one Silicon Valley tech company responded back to my application. I went through the process and soon had an offer on the table.

Prior to this offer, I had never made more than $20/hr in my life and this offer was for six figures. It was a beautiful moment to see all my hard work pay off. I still remember how that felt. In a weird way, that feeling was worth much more than any of the money.

**Where I Am At Today:**

Today, I am employed at said company and have been for over a year. I do get FAANG recruiters hitting me up from time to time on LinkedIn (less now due to all the hiring freezes going on). Overall, I'm very happy with how my career is progressing.

If you're in the same place I was when I started, here are my closing thoughts for you:

\- Computer Science is for you. Put in the hard work and I have no doubt you can get to whatever company you want or whatever your goal may be.

\- Having said the above, I will re-iterate that doing this just for the money may not be the best idea. While software engineering looks really comfortable (remote, well-paid, lots of demand), it is constant problem solving and learning something new everyday. I love it and if you love it, then you'll fit right in. If you hate problem solving and can't stand looking at code, yet are only doing it for the $$, then I still think you can be successful if you work hard. However, is hating 8 hours of your day, 5 days a week, really the life you want to live? There are other well paying professions out there. I'm not saying you have to love everyday of your job but rather, find the profession that best meshes with your personality.

That's all, feel free to ask any questions.

To give some context, I am located in Canada (working remote).

I also have a YouTube/Instagram where I share my journey and give advice on this tech journey. I won't post it here because AFAIK self promos are not allowed but if you're interested, DM me and I'll link you to my socials."

xhlaei,10,2022-09-18,Fall AWS Capstone Group,BinaryBeaver,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/xhlaei/fall_aws_capstone_group/,"Hello I am looking for member(s) to create a capstone group for this Fall. I'm a 4.0 student, recently completed an internship at Amazon and will be returning there early next year as an SDE. For the capstone project I want to create a serverless web application hosted on AWS. An ideal group member would be interested in learning about AWS and ideally has taken some initiative in learning about it on their own.

The basic architecture of the project will be a single page web app communicating with Cognito and API Gateway. The frontend will be able to sign into a Cognito user pool, and maybe the user pool can be configured with a social sign in provider like Facebook or Apple. The frontend can then make calls to API Gateway (with some calls requiring a JWT token returned by Cognito) and will trigger some Lambda function that can then process the request, communicate with a database or other resources, and return a response to the app.

AWS technologies you would work with on this project:

* Lambda
* API Gateway
* Cognito
* Amplify (to easily connect the frontend with Cognito and API Gateway)
* S3
   * Maybe CloudFront
* DynamoDB (or other database service)
* CDK

Writing all the compute logic with Lambdas will let us develop an app that is highly available and scaleable, while costing us nothing because it is pay per use and all these technologies have a free tier. Also, it is easier to write the app because there is less overhead.

My internship project this summer used all these technologies and I am comfortable using them again for this project. I can write the frontend as a Create React App project but if a team member is interested in doing the frontend they could do that however they want. For the Lambdas we could write them in any of the supported runtimes (Java, Go, PowerShell, Node.js, C#, Python, and Ruby) but I would prefer to use Python or Node.

Please send me a DM if interested :)"

I can take both internship and bootcamp at the same time and they are not from the same company.

I really like the front end part and never learn something fully focused in OOP like Java. I have a strong feeling for Android as I'm really familiar with some aspects of it, so I sometimes I think about going to Java and then Kotlin as they both connect really well.

Even though I think this bootcamp can be a good opportunity for future jobs or/and learning things about coding, my head keeps thinking about the ""time lost"" as I should focus more in the front end part of the web.

for some background information, i used to fail virtually every class until i turned my grades around in one year and ended up scoring A's in all subjects with 5 of them being A\*'s in my international exams. trust me, to make up for my past lack of interest in academia, i had to work my ASS off - late night cramming, downing caffeine, lost over 10 pounds, low blood pressure, losing hair (had a few bald patches once that thankfully grew back).

as an asian student, my parents, of course, squeeze at least 2 hours of tutoring daily into my schedule. after deducting the time needed to eat, shit, bathe, sleep (8-9 hours as recommended for pupils my age), partake in tutoring lessons, transport, go to school, i have less than 1 hour to complete my homework, assignments, projects, internship work, debate preparations, and studying - which is IMPOSSIBLE. given this info, you can guess where i deduct my time from in order to get through school and maintain somewhat high grades - hygiene and sleep.

my parents storm my room and start heated arguments on such a frequent basis that i've found myself crying while studying at least once per week. they're hell bent on the idea that i've just not been working hard and fast enough during the day and i'm reaping the consequences of my ""laziness"" at night. recently, they've been yelling at me a lot for drinking tea or caffeine to stay awake, then proceeded to BAN me from it.

it used to be tolerable, since i'd still get my tasks done, but now that my caffeine is gone and they've amplified their ""storming the room"" incidents, i really feel the fatigue catching up to me. im struggling to complete school tasks, and i cant keep up the facade of the smart and hard-working student at school anymore.

my parents will go ham on me for bad grades, but will also prevent me from studying late at night and drinking caffeine in order to achieve their desired high grades.

i understand that my parents are just concerned for me and, perhaps, committing verbal atrocities is simply their love language, but im just stuck in a constant cycle of being yelled at, sleeping at 1-4am, struggling to keep up and maintain high quality schoolwork.

all in all, i really just dont know what to do anymore."
xhmp1u,105,2022-09-18,I'm 28 and I'm lost,Nic727,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/xhmp1u/im_28_and_im_lost/,"Hi,

Not sure if I'm just unlucky in everything I'm trying to do, but I feel like I failed my life. When I was a kid, I always dreamed about being a pilot or living on a farm with animals, because I love nature. However, when I was in college and it was time to choose a path, it was very difficult, because I love too many things. Travel, history, animals and aviation. When I entered college, I decided I would try biology as I was imagining travelling the world, analyzing and helping animals. But I discovered I was very bad in math and science. Plan B was history, because I volunteered on some archaeological site and loved it, but I discovered that jobs in the field of history aren't like that. Most people become teachers and do research on the side because the archaeological pay isn't very good.

Finally, I was very good with computer, so I decided to join this program and graduated with excellent grade. But it's been 5 years I'm looking for a job in my field and it's so competitive, that people with more experience than me are taking all the jobs. Also, I feel so restricted in the sens that most people I want to apply are abroad in other countries and most employers are not sponsoring visa for unexperienced people.

To summarize, in 5 years I got some internships and contracts, but nothing of great value for an employer looking for someone who know everything and has more than 5 years of experience. Till now, I'm still working in a supermarket...

\---------------------

Right now, I'm thinking about a lot of stuffs.

1. Creating my own business combining nature conservation and travel,
2. Be a freelancer in the field I studied via Upwork
3. Quit my job for 3 months and go volunteer abroad in ocean conservation, returning home and taking pilot lessons to become a professional pilot.
4. All those things

For real, what I'm looking for as a job right now are marketing jobs in travel companies or conservation organization around the world. That would be a dream! But I know I need to look at other jobs too and that's what I'm doing, but I just don't feel it when company A is about a certain topic that I don't care about or don't know anything about it. I just feel like it will be boring working for an employer who doesn't have the same values as me. Last week I had to reject a job offer, because it wasn't offering any benefits and no vacation for the first year + I had to keep my current supermarket job since it was part-time. I want to live and not only work!

\------------------

Looking around me, people applying to jobs and almost getting an instant interview and offer make me very sad about my situation of applying, applying and just emptiness."

I usually browse LinkedIn but haven't came across a huge number of game dev companies on there, so I was wondering if there's somewhere better for me to look, or if it's something a lot of them just don't do

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, what I should focus on if I come across internships I would like to apply to? In the sense of whether I should focus on having a portfolio rather than just a traditional resume. I'm entering my 2nd year of university with 2 internships completed (one was related to making a video game in my university, while the other was a more traditional internship in the fintech space involving c#), as well as a few projects on my resume which aren't video games (more web apps involving python, golang, react), so for programming experience I'm not the worst, but I was wondering if I should focus on having a more game dev oriented resume and try to pick up C++, as I understand C++ is one of the most popular languages for game engines

Last week all interns received a follow-up from their recruiters and many winter interns who originally had offers were told that they were now on a new grad ""waitlist"" (essentially rescinded). I heard that overall, less than half of the intern class (including summer interns) received a full-time offer.

For context, we were told whether we got return offers at the end of our internships in April. This came in the form of a letter of intent, which we could activate any time before October, and the moment we activate it, we had 2 weeks to decide whether to accept the offer letter. Most of us had summer internships lined up, so we waited to open the letter until after our summer internships to decide. In July, I was reached out to by my recruiter telling me that my offer letter would not be valid (rescinded) and they would be doing ""recalibration"" to see which winter interns would get a new offer with new offer terms (including adjusted compensation). We were also told that we would be recalibrated against the summer interns, inherently giving them an advantage, as they knew new grad headcount was lowered and could spend more time working on their project to receive a higher intern rating. Other recruiters didn’t even tell their interns that rescinding was a possibility, they were just told that offers could not be opened until the fall. It was only confirmed last week that many interns would be on the new grad waitlist.

The recruiters were also very untransparent throughout this whole process, not giving any (or conflicting) information regarding the return offers, even when multiple interns had other offers and was waiting to hear back on Stripe. When Facebook, Coinbase rescinded their new grad offers, they got a lot of flak for it, however I have not seen any posts talking about Stripe rescinding their offers. As unfortunate as Facebook barely giving out new grad intern return offers is, they were at least up front about it earlier this summer --- allowing interns time to re-recruit. It feels like we were blindsided by Stripe. Many interns I knew personally were not planning on re-recruiting as their recruiters made it seem like we would only get our offers ""adjusted"" (lower comp) rather than rescinded. Part of that was our fault for being naïve for trusting them, and I understand that it’s a tough situation for everyone in tech right now, but the whole process just felt very untransparent.

TLDR: Stripe just rescinded many of their winter intern offers and gave very few summer interns offers."

My first two years of college was quite unenjoyable and as a result I became depressed. I recently transferred schools to a much more enjoyable college (known for being a party school) and also much more prestigious for my program (Computer Engineering).

However, all I really feel like doing is just socializing because I really missed out on doing that the past two years. I can graduate in 4 semesters if I want to but I want to graduate in 5 and take a couple of blow off classes in between my other really hard classes.

I already have two summers of internships under my belt and I honestly just don't feel like trying much harder in school because I'm confident I'm set. However, something about focusing on socializing and having fun makes me feel bad because I have the potential to double major or minor in something else (I originally wanted to minor in physics but I dropped it because I wanted to socialize more).

I stay in India so I use a platform called Internshala, I've made a decent number of applications, I've been applying for 2 weeks or so and I've put in around 5 applications a day atleast. Any advice is appreciated."
xhzh6d,47,2022-09-18,"Senior Devs, how would you handle a new grad?",hope9-,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xhzh6d/senior_devs_how_would_you_handle_a_new_grad/,"I'm in a team and my project manager is really bad at crafting tasks for me. She creates a very complex task then tells me to ask for help to a mid guy. In the process I feel I either have to figure it out by myself, which is impossible, so I have to ask that mid guy to virtually do all the job for me. That guy is also busy with other tasks so at the end, he does his best, but most of the time I feel alone and a pain in the ass for others. Added to that, there are weeks where I have no tasks at all or I just block and I cannot go further so I just fall asleep waiting for some response from the mid guy.

From my perspective, I think the best approach is to avoid my manager giving me tasks since she seems unhappy doing it (its either complex tasks or no tasks at all for days/weeks), and just be an append of the mid guy. What I mean is: the mid guy should share his tasks with me and give me small chunks of doable work rather than me harrashing him with the poorly crafted tasks from the manager. This way I would be seen as an auxiliary help rather than a baby crying for help and sometimes ignored for days.

This worked pretty well at a company in my internship and I proposed this methodology to my manager but seems as if I spoke to a wall. So, I started actively asking the mid guy to share his problems with me and he is giving me subtasks from his tasks. My bet is that this way, he will be more willing to mentoring me as I appear more and more as a helpfull companion rather than a rat trying to force him to do my work.

I really hate what my manager does, just throwing me tasks that she don't even know how to do. As if she received the task from the client and just poorly copypasted to me, expecting to be magically solved and understood. It makes me feel stupid all the time as if I was supposed to know everything and a pain in the ass for people who I must bother for help that are occupied with other projects.

This is my view. What do you think? Am I wrong and my manager just don't give a fuck about me? Or is this subtasking from mids idea is the way to go?"
xhzlz4,2,2022-09-18,Keep return offer or try to delay grad for another internship?,pyjl12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xhzlz4/keep_return_offer_or_try_to_delay_grad_for/,"Now to preface - I understand that I'm really in a situation that I should be grateful for, and I am! I'm just wondering on what might be the best option in this case.

I recently interned at a company in the midwest this past summer and was able to land a return offer - my issue is that it only pays around 65k - 70k and is remote (I live in HCOL) and I don't believe that they're going to renegotiate.

I have a few interviews lined up in terms of internships for this next summer / spring, but none of new grad opportunities.

If in the event that I'm able to land anther internship (assuming at a larger tech company that compensates more) -&gt; is it stupid or irrational to take that internship and risk not getting a return offer? Or should I just play it safe and take the full time position and just keep grinding LC for the time being?"

I ended up spending a year trying to find a job, and eventually got an internship at a company who sell software used in hospitals for standards tracking, which is pretty high pressure considering it's used in live surgery.

l've been here for about a 1 and 1/3 years, and all my hopes of things becoming better have gone out the window by this point. The biggest problem is that the development team of this company consists of 2 people, myself included. The entire staff is 7 people.

As my first job in the industry I expected to pick up lots of knowledge and to be criticised on my code endlessly, which is exactly what I wanted as a newbie. I still haven't had one single code review after hundreds, thousands of changes. I haven't had one comment on how my code could improve. Then, if anything ever doesn't work as expected, I'm first in line for possible causes, regardless of whether or not I was involved.

My development manager is in his late 50s/early 60s, so obviously the twilight of his career, and he doesn't even pay enough attention to respond to messages I send him, or respond to things I say to him verbally.
It comes without saying that I need to go elsewhere, but if I leave I can effectively guarantee that he won't give me any kind of reference, given how small our team is and how much that'd be putting a burden on him. I also care about the rest of the team, and leaving would likely put extra stress on them at a time when it's already difficult to work here.

I cared about this job when I started, and I loved coding, but this has ripped a lot of that away from me frankly.

TLDR, I hate my job, I work in silence and isolation every day of the week, get blamed for things I didn't do (or did do unknowingly because my code is never reviewed), get underpaid, overworked, have no one to talk to at or out of work about this, and I see no way out without throwing my experience here down the drain as I don't see myself getting a positive reference if I suddenly leave, which would make it impossible to find a new job and in this economy/recession, I don't particularly want to put myself through that.

What do I do?"

I am currently working 2 part-time jobs. One is working at hospital doing cleaning work and the other is helping at a small office as an assistant (making copies, handling mail, ordering office supplies, etc). Having 2 jobs to survive and not having a “real” career is making me both burnt out and depressed.

I busted my ass off in college working retail jobs and doing some internships while trying to complete my degree. I was trying to break in the video games industry but a part from internships, I had no luck. 
After graduation I applied to dozen upon dozen of places. I continued to work retail jobs to pay bills while I applied to both gaming and non-gaming jobs hoping some place that is not retail would hire me. 

After rejection after rejection over the years, I figured that I am not good enough or not a big enough name to make it in the industry. 

I like coding so I attended a couple of coding boot camps. However they turned out to be a waste of money. I haven’t been able to land a job in that field either. I still do stuff like CodeAcademy to practice but I don’t know what good that can do. 

I feel that I wasted so much time and money and I ended up nowhere. I am just so tired and frustrated working all the time and not progressing in life. Any advice on what to do? Should I do more classes? Get a certificate in something? Pivot to a new career?"

However, I did study in a Filipino-dominated school overseas all my life (except university), so parang feel ko nasa Pinas pa rin ako kasi lahat ng classmates and teachers ko back in elementary to highschool were Pinoy.

I started as an intern in a high-growth startup based in MENA around June 2022 getting 23k as a monthly allowance. After 3 months of probation, nagustuhan ako ng management and gave me a full time role and I’m now making 78.5k/month all inclusive. By Q1 2023, I will get a performance review and if I meet all their KPIs, they will bump up my salary anywhere in the range of 120-190k/month (depending on how many KPIs I achieve).

The work environment is great. I work anywhere from 6-8 hours a day and I get along with my peers pretty well. Ako ung pinaka bata tho but it doesn’t hinder me at all. Dami ko ring natututunan since my boss mentors me.  

My question is, given the fact na maganda ung future prospects ko dito, should i even bother applying for other jobs? I know that if I look hard enough, I can find a job in an MNC that pays 3-4x my current salary. Kaso nga lang, natatakot akong umalis kasi what if this startup becomes a unicorn and since kasama ako sa growth (being one of the first 15 employees), I think they would offer me more than what an MNC can offer.

I’m now a bit older. I’m approaching that point in my life where everything seems a bit duller in life without a mother. Graduation, college move ins, engagements, marriages, internships, first jobs. Nobody quite celebrated my achievements like she did and nobody was as uplifting as she is. I have pictures of her all around my room, her ashes on a shelf, and little sentiments here and there, but I don’t have her.

I’m struggling to see the point anymore. I know that sounds horrible and I wouldn’t say I’m suicidal, I just don’t see the meaning behind things the way I think I was supposed to.

After medications and therapy, I still feel no further than I was six months after she passed away. I still find myself sobbing at night so hard that my head hurts. I have emotional outbursts for no reason. Constant nightmares, stress dreams, panic attacks- everything. I feel helpless and like no matter what I do, I’ll never meet the standards of someone who’s opinion is nonexistent.

I feel like I’ll never be enough. Not in the eyes of her, nor in the eyes of anyone else.

I read through their policy for software engineers (I read a lot of the company’s confluence pages and policies during my internship), and the way it works is that by default, engineers are designated as remote, but we can come into the office whenever we like. In order to have your own designated desk, you need to register with the office and come in at least 3 days a week, otherwise, you can come in and use some of the unassigned free-for-all workspaces that they have. 

This is a great policy in my opinion, but I was wondering how this would impact my taxes if I want to spend some time in the office (in NYC) and some days back home with my family (in a different, driving distance state). I would prefer to pay taxes in my home state than NYC, and I was wondering how I would need to break down my time in each state to do this legally. I don’t want to do anything that could be sus/fraud—I just want to know how to best optimize my situation while being in the clear ethically/legally.

I'm a graduate in Computer Science, I got 1st class honours, I've done a couple of internships, and I think I have really great communication and teamworking skills.

I could have been coding something for somebody for the past few months. Hell, I could be coding something for somebody *right fucking now* instead of complaining about it on Reddit. I speak English and French (probably the best language duo for finding possibilities in tech in Europe I imagine), I'm willing to relocate to almost anywhere on the continent, and I think my CV shows a history of being incredibly adaptable and willing to learn. 

But because I have not sung the right song or danced the right dance in front of the right recruiter, I am languishing, sitting in my chair at home, trying to hunt down every junior software engineering position I can find (even tho from my results thus far there's almost no point applying outside of the city / country I live in as no one wants to help relocate when they can just hire a local).

Our capitalist friends say this system that we live in promotes efficient usage of resources. How is having me, a young worker with skills that he is more than willing to bring to market, scrolling through page after page of applications of 'junior' positions (looking for minimum 3 years professional experience of course) an efficient usage of resources? And I can assure you of course I'm not the only young graduate in this position. 

Maybe deep down this is just a rant about my current predicament, but it gets a derisive chuckle out of me when I imagine that this is supposedly the most efficient system our truly brilliant species has ever come up with. Apparently."

On one of our dates we agreed that for now we’re gonna hang out casually and without labels since that’s what fits us both best atm.

We kissed a few times and were pretty touchy and our dates consist of a lot of teasing and play fighting. He’s usually the more “open” one when we see each other and gets more close to me, but it’s not like I’m acting shy lol, I’m totally “matching his vibe”.

We hear from each other over text every day or every other day and sometimes his texts are a bit dry and I find myself waiting for him to ask me out again and giving him hints, but he’s not really taking them or doesn’t wanna take them? (I have no problems initiating dates, but I’ve done it more times than him and the last one was initiated by me too)

On one occasion I told him I want to have sex with him over text and even though he was shocked by me saying that so openly he expressed his wish of having sex with me too and he proposed that after we go out a few more times and get to know each other some more, we’ll have a movie night and bla bla. (We talked about sex face to face before this so it’s not like I scared him off or sth)

After that we’ve seen each other only once and a friend was also present so we couldn’t exactly talk more about our conversation over text as we said we would. 

Idk if it’s important but I’m a virgin and he knows that so maybe he’s nervous about making me uncomfortable by initiating sth? Still, I think that despite his busy schedule (internship and job and he lives in a town next to mine) he could still show more interest and initiative when it comes to just seeing each other again and not having a booty call lmao.

His behaviour face to face and “the plans we made” make me think it’s impossible that he lost interest in me, but idk lol.

Back story: I live in Egypt and finished my first year here of college, I study (FMI) Financial Markets and Institutions, and I finished this year with a GPA of 3.91. during the school year and summer, I became a delegate for the EBSM Egyptian banking system model, a collaboration between Bank Misr, EB Bank, and the Central bank of Egypt. I also became a delegate at the CFA Ambassadors (StockWolves Council). I also became an Internship trainee in Atijariwafa Bank for a whole month (full time). The thing is I have been trying to go study abroad for a while but I don't know how I need serious help and my budget isn't big around 3,000 USD a year, which is why I am mostly relying on a scholarship or something to help with the costs or getting a full-ride scholarship. Also, there is no particular country that I want to go to, thinking about the usual such as Canada, The United States, Europe, etc.

So if there is any way anyone can tell me how to get a scholarship or go abroad or have any tips, in general, please say."

I have taken some relevant course work like discrete math, machine architecture, algorithms and data structures. Etc.

xikllp,1,2022-09-19,Potential career switch to CS- advice?,Prestigious_Bet_4653,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/xikllp/potential_career_switch_to_cs_advice/,"Hello, everyone!

I am a recent university graduate with a BA in Psychology and Criminal Justice. At the start of my college experience, I thought I had it all figured out and was very passionate about working in the field- getting into some high-level super cool investigative job where I get to fight crime and making the world a better place. I never really managed my expectations for this field, and currently find myself incredibly burnt out, dissatisfied, over worked, and frankly not really caring about the work I do. My mindset and priorities have changed drastically, and although it upsets me to no longer be passionate about this field, I had done a lot of reflection on what I really want in life. Which has lead me here.

I have always loved computers, software, cybersecurity, coding, being able to create something from nothing, and problem solving in general. Some of my favorite teenage memories are of my friends and I hacking and re-coding Minecraft mods and files into the most ridiculous spin-offs. I have been entertaining the thought of going back to school for CS/IT for quite a while, even while I was still in school for Psych and Crim, but honestly the though itself arises a lot of concerns that hopefully some of you will be able to provide some insight into.

1. Am I too old to go back to school and re-enter a new field after?

\- I just turned 22 last month, and I know that is still fairly young, but going back to school (even though I loved it) at my age makes me very nervous. I have done some research and with my previous degrees and credits, I would be back for about 2 more years. My anxieties about this do not stem from how people would perceive me or whatever, I am just concerned overall about going back into undergrad after already graduating once.

2. Internships, finding a job after school, job security, etc.?

\- I have seen many posts about how its a good idea to secure a job at a helpdesk while in school to gain experience, which I would be open to. However if anyone has any insight on other potential ways to gain experience, that would be great. Also, how vital is finding an internship in the field as a student? I understand that internships are always a great way to get your foot in the door, but what is this experience like in the CS field, and would it be possible for me to secure one in my two years at school? General information about any of this would be wonderful.

3. If you have worked in the CS field, would you recommend it? Or is this potential switch a bad idea.

If you have read this far, thank you for listening to me ramble. Clearly, I have been giving this a lot of thought, but would just love some general insight into the field; what to expect, what I am going to learn, am I making a good decision, etc. Anything would be appreciated!"
xikt43,0,2022-09-19,Career/Salary Progression Hacks,adot404,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xikt43/careersalary_progression_hacks/,"Hi everyone. I’m wondering how I can sort of “hack” the career progression ladder in software engineering. I’m a college junior and I’ve completed two internships at separate big tech companies. That didn’t come without extensive preparation though. I learned to code in high school and as I researched my future career prospects in the field, I went down a few rabbit holes that really just seemed to point towards cracking the coding interview and internships as the silver bullet.

So with an eye on my graduation again, I have a similar question in how I can optimize both my scope and salary when I graduate. I’m not as concerned with work life balance right now. I assume the throttle should be eased once I have a family and they need me. So for the 5-10 years until then, I have no concerns in regards to prioritizing work at the cost of a more robust social life or interesting hobbies. To get that ball rolling, here are a few ideas that I’ve gathered over time:

- Read Designing Data Intensive Applications
- Job hop every couple years
- be upfront with manager about ambitions

Best case scenario I’m looking to reach sr engineer at around 4yoe (not including internships), and staff engineer at 7yoe. At that point I expect to cross $500k annually so any raises will have diminishing returns, and I assume promotions will be heavily politics driven so those will be less fulfilling. I’ll likely turn my attention towards other things at that point."
xikzx9,1,2022-09-19,IBM internship questions,funky_boiiii,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xikzx9/ibm_internship_questions/,"I'm a college student applying for CS internships, including a few at IBM. Since I'm very new to this, I accidentally applied to a few entry level positions before realizing that there were internship positions as well, so I withdrew the applications to the entry level positions. I got a few emails saying that I should take the coding assessment for a few of the positions (both internships).

I then got an email to take an assessment for one of the entry level positions that I accidentally applied for. Unfortunatly, this position has the same title (excluding ""entry level"" vs ""internship"") as one of the internships I was supposed to do a coding assessment for. So, once again not realizing that this was the wrong thing, I started the assessment.

Now, I'm not sure if its the same assessment for entry level and for internships, but I was not prepared for this assessment. Only one of the questions was straight coding, the others were Docker/Kubernetes/Bash/whatever, a bunch of stuff that I don't know about as a beginning-of-second-year student. The coding one was also broken, I tested my solution afterwards since I recognized the question and it worked...

So I basically just bombed this entry level coding assessment because it was stuff I didn't know. It happens. But I also don't have/wasn't sent links for the other positions, ie *the ones I* *actually applied for*, even though IBM sent an email saying they'd send them to me, and now I'm worried that me bombing that coding assessment means I bombed my other applications as well. 

Any advice on how to approach this would be appreciated since IBM doesn't seem to have a good way of contacting them in situations like this.

TLDR: I bombed a coding assessment for a job I wasn't qualified for and withdrew my application for before they even sent the coding assessment and now I'm worried that the bombed coding assessment will be what they have on file for all future jobs I apply for at IBM."

for the first 3 years I was a receptionist that occasionally did random things for people around the office. things weren't so bad they had a few red flags but not much, this was the honey moon stage I guess. 

Well are company started getting really busy and I got dragged to employee benefits, and I really enjoyed this job but I was very split between receptionist and employee benefits ( they did not pay me more for taking on the extra work)  and that was basically my job for 2 years and by the end of the EB 2y mark all my receptionist task had turned into just answering the phone and doing employee benefits. (now at 5years)

well the main employee benefits guy was leaving for another job (there's only two of us) , I had assumed I would take over the role as I had basically done it by my self for solely a year, also to note I have never had a write up or any problems with anyone during these 5 years. Well they decided to give the EB job to another receptionist, who had never done it a day in there life and speed trained him a month. 

well that really ticked me off bad, no reason was given why, but I held in there, but then covid hit before they had a chance to replace my job duties and they left me in that office all alone with my only job assignment is to answer the phone while everyone else worked remotely. for 3 years. Now I get that barley any work is nice but I lost my shit and I became the biggest bitch that office had ever seen and evetime I saw my boss I would flat out ignore her. she would try to get her lackies to come find out was wrong to which my reply was always ""my mom taught me if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all"" 

And they would take that back to her but she never tried to reach out and figure out the problem herself, she would give me busy work but barely and was left alone without any work or anything to do for 8 hours. 

Now I want to through in everything this lady has done in the last 8 years. 

shew has covered up 3 sexual assaults' all by the same guy and he still works here. ( all of the girls were 18yo interns) 

there was a physical Asselt with a deadly weapon and the police where called she made us all lie to them and used are jobs to force us and then fired the guy who got the weapon pulled on him for causing a disruption ( and bringing the police there)

she has stolen millions from the company using fake business to pay there pockets. 

well after everyone came back from covid, the employee benefits guy put his two weeks 

this had interested me as I still knew I enjoyed the work but I was also very prepared for the bitch to not give me chance. I knew that I had to sit down and talk to her but before I could she decides to go on a rant about me to my coworker where everyone could hear her. 

Telling them him how I'm useless, I'm not capable of anything. basically just bad mouthing me.

so I just want to know, am I really the problem?"

I’d have to graduate early, after this school year though. I looked it up and it’s smack in the middle avg salary for SF.

I’ve been applying to so many tech companies, a few with referrals for internship roles but it seems to be way harder than last season even though I have internship experience now whereas before I didn’t. In a normal year I’d say no to the FT offer and stay in school while trying to look for an internship that pays well, has high return offer rate, and has a better new grad offer just because I’m not in a rush to graduate college.

In this situation, what would you all do?
a) Accept and renege if I get a good intern offer
b) Accept and work FT then maybe after year I can look for better opportunities
c) Decline and keep recruiting till I find good intern offer

So as the title says I’m looking to apply to a school I’ve had my eyes on for quite some time now, since I’ve grown extremely tired of working on a factory floor and need to change careers.

But since I don’t have any insight into the industry there’s no way for me to know if the courses will actually give me the skill set I require to succeed after graduating.

I have spoken to the person responsible for the program in question and asked him about it, but of course his opinions are heavily biased. So I thought maybe I could show you guys the courses contained in the program and see if you think it’s crap or not!

Anyhow! Here’s the courses included in the program.

**C#** - .NET, .NET Core, LINQ etc.

**Database** - SQL Server, Raven, Mongo, Entity framework, Azure Framework.

**Web Development** - .NET Core, API, MVC and MVVM.

**Agile Development**

**Customer understanding and consulting**

**Clean code** - TDD, BDD, SOA.

**Internship**

**Final project**

I understand that this is a horrible wall of text, but if you read this far I thank you a thousand times!"

My friend I’ll call her “Beth” and I were inseparable all throughout college. We have so many memories and always laugh so hard when we are together. We consider eachother best friends. Throughout our friendship though I noticed some behaviors that would come off as deal breakers for most people. 

Some examples:

She will literally out of nowhere ghost people from anywhere to a day to weeks. For example one time I got a call from a mutual friend that was on a kickball team with Beth. She called me concerned bc Beth didn’t show up to the kickball game and she wasn’t returning anyone’s calls. We both went to her apartment and banged on the door while her car was in the driveway. She wouldn’t answer. Later I texted her straight up “hey just let me know you’re okay. Just tell me you’re alive”. And she finally replied. But she literally was ignoring everyone else and me until I had to send that. 

She’s had a lot of falling out with friends for this type of behavior and there have been times her and I didn’t talk for weeks bc she straight up refused to talk to me. The thing is a lot of the times it’ll be just one person she ghosts but she will still be normal with everyone else. Sometimes it is bc she is upset about something but alot of times the stuff she is upset about is not even a big deal and could easily be solved with a conversation. 

She’s done some shitty things. There was one occasion where I was going to stay with her in our college town. At the time I was doing an internship in another state. It’s about a 4 hour drive for me and last we talked I told her I’d be there in 4 hours. My phone was on silence bc I was driving but 2 hours into the drive I got one or two texts from her asking for an update. I didn’t open them until I (as scheduled) showed up to her place 2 hours later. I then call her to tell her I’m here and no response. I bang on the door nothing. Then after 45 mins I get a text from her that she is “an hour away bc she wanted to go to this haunted house and won’t be back until the morning????” She told me that she wasn’t sure if I was still coming bc I didn’t reply to her? When I told her it was bc I was obviously driving and now I didn’t know where to stay she was like “well can’t you stay with (insert friends name)? I’ll be back in the morning” like what????

But it’s weird stuff like this she does and she does this is everyone. Feel free to read my other post I gave another example. 




She also does this super weird thing that I can’t explain but it’s like she will almost seem to purposely refuse to pick up on hints. It’s almost always petty stuff so it’s awk for you to call out. 

For example: one time after we graduated and we’re living in separate city’s it was my bday and I noticed she hadn’t said happy birthday. But I noticed she was watching my stories where I was opening cards etc. so it was obvious. The next day I try and casually bring up the fact that it was my bday and she either didn’t care or literally didn’t pick up the hint but she didn’t say anything. 

Then one time I went on this super cool international vacation and snap chatted her pics of it and she didn’t ask me one question about it. So I mentioned casually this country I was visiting was so cool and how maybe one day we could go back and visit together since I have family we can stay with. She completely ignored me…. But then a day later sends a random snap chat. For some reason that bothered me so I sent her text saying “hey Im not trying to be pushy about traveling to (country) I just thought it could be something fun especially since we can stay somewhere for free but no pressure just thought it’d be cool!” and she ignored it almost like she was doing it on purpose. Then a day later texts me something completely unrelated. 


Now the weirdest thing, no one in our friend group has seen her in 4 years. Everytime we try and plan a time to see her she avoids the question or just says she’s busy. My other friends have stopped talking to her mostly  but Beth and I are a lot closer than anyone. She will still text me all the time but when it comes to making plans she will literally not respond. 


I just find it all so bizarre. She has almost been bizarre when we were friends in college but I almost feel like her being friends with me she kinda learned how to treat friends. 


She has like one friend In her new city but it’s a work friend and Im pretty sure they only hangout during work/ occasionally happy hours. She mostly hangs out with her family and is obsessed with biking. That’s all she really does. 

I just don’t understand what is wrong with her or if she has some mental disorder or disability?  Or Maybe she’s just inconsiderate. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt bc I know not everything is white and black."

I'm exploring a couple other options as well- reaching out to Cal professors in polisci to see if they could use any student volunteers, in contact with a Harvard lecturer and human rights lawyer so something may come out of that, my teacher has mentioned that his good friend's wife is a State Dept lawyer and wants to put me in touch with her.

My dream schools are Princeton or Brown, then Tufts, UChicago, Penn, JHU, Georgetown + all UCs/CSUs. I can basically either go to one of them or a UC because I don't qualify for a lot of financial aid (income is around 225k) at most schools, but I live in a very high cost of living area so my parents probably couldn't afford to pay full tuition otherwise."

Started off in their intern program and got hired on fulltime. When I started everything was great, my supervisor seemed like someone I could turn to for support and mentorship, encouraged me to continue learning etc. We got close, not to the point where I told them my life story but where I had started feeling comfortable confiding in them etc.

Supervisor isn't as technical as they led me to believe and I started to out perform them and have to FIX their mistakes. (I also have a technical BS in Cyber Security which is a huge hole on the IT roaster) Things were great until after my one year review. I started to notice the Supervisor getting short with me, becoming less willing to help in areas of the business unfamiliar to me, i got met with a lot of ""figure it out"" statements. Whatever, Im pretty independent and don't need much direction. (Except when starting new projects/tasks etc)

There have been several moments of unprofessional behavior on the sup's part (e.g gossiping to staff about other staff, making contradictory statements, passive agressive behavior and comments et ) after about a year and half of doing the work of 3 people (with no thank you, or we appreciate you, or RAISE) I told my supervisor ""I'm burnt, I can't keep working unpaid OT and keep being treated like my life outside this place doesn't matter. I had an anxiety attack from the stress and constant lack of sleep. (I suffer insomnia FYI) She made it out to seem like change would happen better delegation of tasks etc. I was a sucker, should have known! Especially when COVID hit. It sucked because we werent prepared for a pandemic ( like most) didnt have enough equipment to send every one home with, supply chain issues, high stress, low morale etc. Our company had tons of layoffs, IT wasnt affected luckily.

Fast forward to 2021, pandemic has started to improve, we are pulled back go office but offered hybrid schedule. Max 3 days remote. That works well for me, I need the coupe days in office to do hardware etc. The days im remote I work on assigned projects (for less interruption) Supervisor pulls me aside and pretty much promises me a promotion. Sets up a meeting with the VP of our dept etc and says "" hey I appreciate all your hard work and you've been a great asset to the team etc. I'd like to reward you with a Jr. Sys admin/security position. By thid point I had been the one implementing different security measures and working closely with our Sys admin. Got crossed trained in networking/VM'S etc. 

Sup fair warns me VP will want to see me complete a project before promotion is finalized. Just to make sure I can handle the responsibilities. (Which is dumb AF as I'd already been doing that) mind you Sup led me on to believe all was hunky dory.


Fast forward to meeting with Sup and VP of the dept. I get blindsided by the SUPERVISOR in the meeting. Completely throws me under the bus for things that were outside my control, says im not meeting their stamdards, basically questions my integrity and work efforts. They completely did a 180 and embarrassed me in front of the VP. Then when I questioned Sup and said ""if you were so concerned with my performance why didn't you attempt to address this with me? 1v1"". VP agreed and was shocked that hadn't happened. I asked Sup for specific examplea of the so called standard's and challenged every BS claim they made. Stating that I cannot possibly know what you expect of me if you dont effectively communicate with me. Sup got super defensive. At that point I didnt care, they had already ran my name through the mud and embarrassed me.

I asked that since these ""standards"" were holding me back. To give me the opportunity to prove otherwise and get in writing the ""things"" I need to improve upon. I'm not perfect by any means, nor do i claim it. But when everyone singa your praises to your boss and they then turn around and betray that trust it makes you question a LOT. To say I was upset was an understatement. I promptly left after this BS meeting/review. (My shift was over) things werent the same after that. This was a pivotal moment in which I knew my Supervisor didnt have my best interest at heart and didnt give a flying eff about me or anyone but themself.

This happened on a Friday, after calming down I sent an email that I wanted to discuss what had happened in that meeting. I made it clear I felt blindsided and lied to and didn't appreciate the lack of professional curtosey in my ""under performance"" that was about as useless as their so called milestone plan they promised. (Never happened!) I was on the brink of quitting. I got to the point where I know longer gave a rats butt. Stopped working late, stopped confiding in Sup, pretty much only engaged with them when necessary. Things went into limbo. 

Fast forward to Monday after s**t storm meeting, the supervisor got promoted to MANAGER. I lost it all over again. I realized what had really happened. I got thrown under the bus so they could move forward. I immediately started interviewing for other positions. The disrespect and blatent disregard for employees well being became more apparent. The supervisor's promo to manager was the hot gossip of the office. Many other managers questioning the choice... former Sup now manger became public enemy number one. Started to lash out at staff in front of other depts, really making themself fall into everything gossip was saying.

I kept my mouth shut, head down, did what was asked no more no less and went home. I had confided about the situation with a few trusted individuals who all begged me to get the eff outta dodge. One issue with that, interviews that I lined up went nowhere. 

I suffered through it, we finally got additional techs, who quickly saw the poor behavior of the now manager and pointed it out. I was voluntold to train the newbies on top of my already unmanageable work load. Oh joy! Mgr continued to show their butt to everyone. 

Fast forward to late 2021, I had a family emergency, my younger sibling had to have a very invasive procedure. Boss was cold but allowed me to do what was needed to get younger sibling intervention. Before my rather quick leave mgr had screamed at us for our drowning queues and long to do list in front of multiple depts( again). I mentioned that they had come off a bit harsh and it was a bad look to do that so publicly. Basically mentioning it looked really bad and everyone was walking on egg shells as not to set the MGR off. 

Oh boy did I eff up, I became the personal punching bag of MGR. Blamed for everything, vilified etc. Told people we're complaining about me. (Bold faced lie, literally told me the week before all the higher ups were saying what a great job I do and that mgr is lucky to have me etc) so I let it go in one ear and out the other. Mind you I was still struggling with the famoly emergency. Mgr snapped at me and I snapped back. 

I shouldn't have and just let MGR look crazy per usual but i just couldnt bite my tongue with the mental abuse and verbal abuse anymore. ( Also HR is useless and the main HR person hates me because I stuck up for myself in a past situation) I stepped away after the conflict to get it together for my ownsake and continuing training the other techs. They all knew something was up, I get quiet when sad or upset, stopped cracking jokes etc. Everyone was genuinely concerned about my mental health EXCEPT mgr. 

Before I left mgr made it a point to pull me aside, took me into a conference room and screamed at me. Threatened to write me up, said they went to HR and said I was being insubordinate etc. Didnt let me talk (has a bad habit of talking over others, this happens daily), told me I was disrespecting them etc. Essentially projecting their own insecurities on me as normal. Called me unprofessional and told me to get out. 

Everything they had accused me of was how MGR was behaving. Come to find out MGR had personal issues at home. Which does NOT excuse this behavior! Mentioned me reporting them to HR if we couldnt figure our differences out. Now I'm not the one with the problem its MGR. I promptly said bye and left. 

We got a new sup and things have been better however my relationship with (still MGR) has been completely minimized to being civil. No more, no less. I've lost all my love for this job, dont confide in them. Don't talk about my personal life, have pretty much distanced myself as much as possible. Knowing that going to HR woupd only get me wrongfully terminated.

Present: new Sup is great, but I'm burnt out. Hate going to work, avoid MGR as much as possible and put up with constant disrespect from a GREEN tech. (Aka first IT job, doesnt have a degree and always argues with me on eatablished and working procedures) this new tech is the golden child and only acts this way with me, I have seniority. I was trained by MGR. I no longer care or have any sympathy for the whining about work load. Have become jaded etc and shrug and says boo freaking hoo when said golden child makes a stink about fairness and stupid crap. 

Thank you for those that may read my rant. My question is at this point what do I do? How do I get through my continuing Ed and find another way out? I have spoken with the new Sup about golden child. They addressed with MGR who I have lost all respect for. I dont expect any change knowing the MGR is full of empty promises. They still try to gass me up and pretend like there is room for growth. When i know there isnt.

How do I survive until I can secure another job?! How do I recover from such a terrible burnout. This job has turned me off from even wanting to pursue IT any further. 

Tldr: burnt out, No faith in MGmt, no room for growth. Stuck in dead end job. How do I salvage all the hard work I've put in?"

xix8u7,1,2022-09-19,My boyfriend is graduating soon and I am no where near close to graduating,Greedy_Exercise7041,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/xix8u7/my_boyfriend_is_graduating_soon_and_i_am_no_where/,"My boyfriend(M23) of 5 months is graduating college this spring and then he is off to do internships and starting his career in a town that is 2 hours away from where we go to college. I(20F) am in my third year of college and I plan on furthering my education and getting a masters for the specific career that I want.

I know that we haven't been dating for a long time, but I can't help but to feel anxiety of how our relationship will go once he leaves. I personally have not been in any long- distance relationships before and going into this will be uncharted territory for me. I have really bad anxiety and I can't help but to worry about the future of our relationship even though this obstacle will be months away. 

For a little bit of back story that is relevant to know, I was in a very abusive situation before I met my boyfriend and that has caused me to have some anxious thoughts that I have today about our relationship and the direction that it is heading. 

Ever since I met my boyfriend, he has been the best thing that has ever happened to me and I mean that whole heartedly. I have never met someone who has genuinely cared about me as much as he does. Our relationship is very healthy and he makes me one of the happiest girls alive. However, despite how much things are going good right now, I can't help but to think the worst. 

Some of my anxious thoughts include,

 ""What if once he graduates he can't do long distance for 3 years and he will break things off?""

""If he does plan on breaking things off, why should I give my all into falling more and more in love with him if I am just going to be hurt in the end?"" 

I am someone who likes to put my 110% energy into someone, and as amazing as this man is to me, I want to give him my all and just put my 110% into this relationship. The only thing that is holding me back is fear that I will end up hurt in the end because I know that this one will hurt me a lot. 

What should I do? I have never felt so lost. How do I deal with this dilema?"
xixhit,6,2022-09-19,I am BSing my way thru my MechE degree,TopDogAlex,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/xixhit/i_am_bsing_my_way_thru_my_meche_degree/,"I am currently in year 3 of the degree. I am a decent amount ahead so my 4th year will have 2 semesters of 10 credit hours each. Currently standing at a 3.5 GPA and I don't see that changing too much by the time I graduate. I had a project internship between my first and second year that I very much enjoyed, so I know that I want to do engineering as my career.

Last summer, I was unable to find an internship despite my having experience previously. I even went through multiple rounds of interviews at some places just to get ghosted. I sent many inquiry emails to places that are taking on interns, just to receive no response from their hiring managers. How am I supposed to get a real job after I graduate when I can't even last an internship with decent academic stats and projects?

After a summer of not working an internship, I have lost all motivation to try in school. I use (orange cheating website) on every single assignment. I skip class at least 5 times a week. I don't study other than a day or two before exams, and it turns out fine. I have yet to receive below a B in any class because I would consider myself to be a pretty good test taker. Sometimes I pull an all-nighter before the exam, whatever it takes to do well. Just last week I got my first Fluids exam back with 98% and a Thermo II exam back with 92. All because I studied the entire content of the exam the night before in a 5-6 hour ""binge"" session. I feel like I'm exploiting the system. At my uni, exams are worth 90-95% of the overall grade, with no curves, so I feel like homework/studying far from exam time is largely useless.

Thanks for listening to my rant

TL;DR: What's the point in trying in school if I can't get opportunities in internships"

At the same time, I don’t want to wallow in pity and play the victim, especially since I graduated 2 years late because of mental health issues, so I can see why my dad could be angry. 

I did say I didn’t want to pursue the career path he chose (he wants me to do the bar exam, I said I didn’t want to as I’d rather work, but didn’t outright say I don’t want to be a lawyer) but he kept insisting and now I feel like I’m stuck. In the UK it’s normal to do a law undergrad and go into other fields after and that’s what I wanted to do until this happened.

I do have a plan (certification exam for the field I want, mini internships etc), but the internal struggle is so hard.

I wish to escape the toxic work culture of Singapore and settle down in Germany. I'm currently eyeing at the job market in Berlin specifically due to its acceptability towards the English language. 

I don't speak German, however, I am willing to learn and once I have the necessary proficiency in German, I would love to move to a city where German is much more dominant such as Munich."

I have so many things and i am DYING i dont know what prompted me to take 2 AP classes while doing volleyball (fall/winter), soccer (spring semester), and ice skating. On top of that, with my preexisting issues, I quite literally cannot eat. I'm. Not. Capable. I look at it and I'm like no. No. Absolutely not. It looks gross. I will not eat anything that is too squishy, too mushy, the wrong texture, too sweet, ANYTHING. It makes it really hard to eat and I end up just getting some form of salad. I will not eat the squishy greens though (idk what those are called lol) I swear I don't have an eating disorder, I'm just picky to the sun and back.

But I mean, I'm quite literally not allowed to do that. So I guess suck it up then? Welp. Also its really annoying because the amount of stuff I do pretty much disables me from having a social life which is actually why I'm on the internet being spiteful. Its not like I'm not able to handle the homework load, its rather that I'm handling it too well and I'm afraid I'm gonna fuck it up and fall into my old cycle of procrastinate, never finish, procrastinate... you see the pattern. I'm. Literally. Terrified. Of that. I just want that sweet academic validation (preferably in the form of valedictorian and a 4.0+ gpa? and a perfect grade?)

“We were passive for way too long, you lulled us into a false sense of security ever since we came here! So we are going after the loot and that’s not up for a discussion!” Philip said visibly frustrated, which was out of character for him.

Milla noticed the atmosphere in the room was tense before the council even began, this was boiling in Phillip for quite some time. And who could blame him after everything he and his crew have done, he was supposed to listen to these opportunists who saw frightened men, women, and children and used their fear to gain some form of power. They liked their titles which they threw around like they meant something in this crazy new world. And they had the power for some time before Phillip, Elicia, Viktor and the rest of them arrived. 

Milla wasn’t a part of their original crew that saved their asses a year and a half ago, she almost lost her sister and father, and well to be realistic they all would have died if they showed half an hour later. That’s one of the reasons she was on their side ever since that surprisingly hot day in December when the battle took place. Getting to know them only reassured her original thoughts, these guys and girls had somewhat of a plan and they didn’t care only about their own asses. Ever since then she began combat training and was pretty prolific with a bow right now both in distance and close combat.  

“I agree with him, let’s put this to vote,” Milla stood up and gave Phillip a reassuring look.

“We can vote, but it won’t change an outcome, we are going towards that ship when the radiation clears in 3 days,” Phillip didn’t even notice her glance, he was frustrated and focused, like in battle.

“You will leave us exposed here,” Theis said. 

Theis and his friends, many of whom have died in the last three years since Milla came here, founded this sanctuary in the Austrian village of Hallstatt, which they renamed New Hope. Milla found the name unoriginal, but the name had already caught up by the time she arrived. The village was surrounded by a lake and huge mountains all around with only two entrances that were easy to guard. It was a natural stronghold, something that was in huge demand in the past five years. Theis named himself a leader when he brought the original hundred people back then and no one objected as he did provide them shelter and some form of security, but he had more luck not to be in the crosshairs of anyone for so long. As he welcomed more people he only gained more power to the point where he and his entourage became consumed by it, they were not challenged by anyone at the time. So when the battle happened and they saved them, the balance was disrupted.

Milla was just a kid back then, well frankly she was still a kid, only a few months after her 17th birthday had passed, but no one had time to be a child anymore, you had to fight in order to survive. 

The council eventually decided to put things to vote and Milla alongside several other people was asked to leave, she wasn’t a council member she just came with Philip, Elicia, and Simon. They gave them three spots out of fifteen in the council.

She walked down the dimly lit hallway, the only source of light were several torches on the walls. 

Living without any form of electricity was immensely thought at the beginning, humanity became overly dependent on it without even realizing what they used electricity for. From obvious things, light, heating, and cooling to the point where most of their cars and other appliances couldn’t work without it. When the whole world was left without it five years ago, too many died out things that could have been easily avoided. She didn’t remember, but her Mother told her how one of her cousins that was only a year older than her and had diabetes died due to the lack of insulin. Insulin production stopped and to preserve remaining you needed to have fridges but with no form of electricity left it was impossible. All the insulin they had went bad and people fought for the remaining insulin, unfortunately, they couldn’t find any in time and she passed. 

Her eyes got used to the dark, yes the hallway and the streets were lit by some torches, and the most important places were lit by the Emeridious or Ametrindor, but those stone’s gemstones were too valuable to be wasted purely on the light. 

As she left the building she stumbled onto Andreas, the group’s de facto leader even though he thoroughly denied having that role every time it was brought up.

“What’s going on inside kid?” Andreas asked.

He was in his late twenties and at first glance, you wouldn’t have guessed he was a part of the apocalypse. He kept his beard shortly trimmed and his hair short at the sides and long a slicked back at the top was almost always in the perfect shape. He was wearing battle armor, he rarely walked without it, with his huge axe-like weapon strapped at the back.  

“They are going to vote now, but Phillip is unusually angry,” Milla answered.

“Told them they shouldn’t even go to that meeting, we are going to go no matter what they decide,” He said with his usual confidence. 

Before Milla could continue the conversations, three blue flairs were fired from the south watch tower. They were under attack. They looked at each other and started running towards the south entrance. For good measure, Andreas fired another flair, and a few others followed from the various points of the village, everyone should have seen the signal by now. 

The blue flair meant they were not attacked by the Algrads or other hostile humans, red flairs were reserved for the aliens, if it was hostile Humans it would have been the orange one and the green one would mean they had human visitors with unknown motives. 

Two of them ran towards the south entrance picking up several guards along the way. Milla didn’t bring her bow to the meeting so she was running weaponless. Luckily, her house was along the way and she picked the bow without losing much time. This was on her inexperience, “I won’t head the end of it from Philip,” she thought to herself catching up to Andreas who now had a dozen guards running beside him.

By the time they arrived at the south entrance, a small crowd has already gathered, including nine members of their original team. Their swords, axes, spears, clubs, and bows illuminating the crowd and the entrance with various colors provided by their glowing gemstones. 

“What is?” Yelled towards the guard tower.

“It’s a pack of Vukclaws, seven or eight of them,” The guard, Milla recognized him as Emil a lanky fellow who always had a smile on his face, yelled back.

Andreas turned towards his team and the guards.

“How many of us are here?” He quickly counted members of his team. “Nine if we include Milla, are you ready to go?” Andreas asked her and Milla nodded.

“We won’t need you if it’s seven or eight them, but be on the stand-by if things escalate,” Andreas said to the Guards. “And one of you go get Phillip, Elicia, and Viktor from the meeting and the rest of our team if you can find them. Tell them about the situation, they will know what to do.”

“Got it,” One of the guards said and ran back towards the building the meeting was happening in.

Five years ago a best like Vukclaw would top of the food chain, probably one of the strongest predators on the planet, but these days that wasn’t the case. They were still dangerous to an ordinary human, if a person found themselves eye to eye with one of the beasts without any Algrads weapons or a gun with a high caliber, that would be the end of them. 

Vukclaws were similar to wolfs in both build and mentality. Their packs on average had seven members with one of them being alpha. But the beasts were much larger than wolfs almost three times their length and height, sometimes even as long as five meters. Similar to wolves they had fur, but the fur was longer and mostly black with ruddy lines over their massive back. Their skin was thick and could repel smaller caliber weapons, as well as ordinary swords and bows, that is if you even got a chance to hit them as they were very agile for their size.

The beasts were aggressive and their main source of food was raw meat, hence their reason for the attack, they were after the cattle and other animals in front of the New Hope gates. At first, they had most of the cattle and other animals inside the village, but as their population grew, now counting above four thousand, they had to move large parts outside of the secure area that was surrounded by the mountains. 

Andreas took the enormous axe from his back and activated his gemstone, his axe was powered by the Ametrindor which gave a violet glow. He knew that if they wanted to minimize losses to cattle and structures in front of the sanctuary they had to react right away. He would prefer to have more of his team with him, but nine of them could do the job without much risk, one for each Vukclaw, with their weapons it shouldn’t be much of a problem. 

They charged thru the tunnel beneath the mountain that used to be one of the entrances to this tourist attraction back in the days before all hell broke loose and ordered the guards to close the gates behind them. 

“Stay close to me kid,” He gave Milla direct order, and others already knew what they had to do, each of them already killed dozens of Vukclaws in the past five years, but this would be Milla’s only third time in a real fight and first time against these beasts. The other two times the threat was smaller and she was more a spectator than a fighter. 

Once they ran out of the tunnel they saw the Vucklaws, there were seven of them at first glance, and four of them already ran towards the cows breaking the wooden fence, and the rest of them ran to the left side towards the sheep.

“Milla and three of you right with me, rest go left.” He shouted and jumped over the fence rest of them following. 

Milla kept the distance of several meters behind Andreas with her bow activated and ready to fire. Mateus, Uma, and Cade were with them and each of them engaged the first Vukclaw they encountered. These were not that big, most likely still young, the largest one barely double the wolf’s size, no more than three meters long. Andreas ran towards the improvised stable they built in a rush only to protect cows from heavy snow during the winter, looking for the alpha beast and Milla followed close behind. 

The alpha was already inside and managed to kill several cows before they caught up to him. It was much larger than the ones outside with a large scar and chunk of fur missing on his back. 

The beast noticed them and turned towards them. Without a second of hesitation, the best charged Andreas was standing in front of Milla. Andreas swung his axe with both hands as the best lept towards him. He only managed to graze him as best anticipated the hit and jumped slightly to the side. The beast used its massive tail to hit Andreas below the knees making him lose his balance and he ended up on his back. The beast turned back towards him ready to charge him while he was on the floor but Milla’s training kicked in and she charged her bow drawing the energy from her gemstone which made a blue arrow out of thin air, her bow used Sapphirion, a process that always put a smile on her face. She released the string and the arrow flew directly at the beast who tried to dodge it, but its reaction was too late and the arrow hit it in the black left leg. The blood sprouted out of the wound and the best made a loud unnatural sound and turned towards the Milla with a bloodlust look in its eyes. 

The shot wounded him, but the beast was still on his feet and it moved with a noticeable limp. Milla drew another arrow firing it at the best head, but this time the best was ready and used its three healthy legs to jump to the side using the wall as a stepping stone, and launched itself towards Milla. Milla tried to charge her bow again but before the arrow formed beast was already on top of her. Hitting the ground hard pushed all of the air out her lungs as she found herself face to face with an alpha Vukclaw. Its sharp teeth were only centimeters from her and its mouth opened just enough to take her life in one bite. 

Before the beast could make its move it got tossed to the wall like it got hit by a truck. Andreas was standing next to her with his hand towards her helping her up. His axe was gone and as Milla caught her breath and looked around she noticed it was stuck in the Vukclaws side. The best twitched and made its unnatural sounds as Andreas walked towards it pulling the axe out and swinging it back down chopping the beast’s head in one swift motion. He made it look effortless, yes having Algrads weapons helped but you still needed to have the strength and technique to execute it this perfectly.

“This was a sloppy one,” He said as he slicked his hair back into a perfect form.

“It was fun,” Milla answered.

“Almost getting eaten by a Vukclaw is your idea of fun, kid?” Andreas asked her.

“Well, not that part, thanks for saving me,” 

“You saved me first, so we are even,” He smiled and walked out of the stable thru the hole in the wall that was made by the Vukclaw.

The situation outside was under control, all six remaining Vukclaws were already taken care of and their heads chopped off. Philip, Elicia, Simon, and the rest of the team managed to arrive to at the scene by the time Andreas and Milla disposed of the alpha Vukclaw.

“How did the kid do, was she afraid?” Phillip asked Andreas as he pushed Milla on the shoulder.

“She saved my ass, actually,” Andreas answered. “Gather all Vukclaws heads and bring them inside and get someone to fix this fence while we are still outside so the cattle don’t escape during the night.”

Vukclaws and most of the other bests that came from Algrad had gemstones growing as tumors latched to their brains. It wasn’t the rule but most of the time bigger and older the beast the bigger gemstone was found inside. These seven beasts would provide them backup gemstones for their weapons, in perfect time for their planned action in three days.

“So what happened at the vote?” Andreas asked Philip as they walked back inside the New Hope.

“Surprisingly, Theis got outvoted nine to six, so we are clear to go from the council’s point of view as well,” Philip answered.

“Well, that’s an unexpected turn,” Andreas said. “Good that they finally realize we can’t just stay inside and ignore the rest of the world forever.”

As they entered the village two horses carrying and pulling a trailer passed them. Micha waved to them from the trailer as he went by on his way to pick up the Vukclaw heads and bring them inside. 

Andreas went back to his house, which he shared with seven members of the team due to overcrowding, to take a shower and Philip went on towards the armory where the Vukclaws heads will be delivered for the process of gemstone removal which was done by Viktor who at the time of the invasion was at a medical school learning to be a surgeon.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

*5 years ago, in Berlin, Germany.*

Andreas woke with a headache and dry throat. It was his last day in Berlin as his visit came to an end. He wanted to spend a quiet night watching some movies, but Philip insisted they go out for one drink. He resisted Philip’s idea a few times, but Philip knew to be very persuasive so eventually, they went out for that one drink. When two of them were involved one drink always turned into two, which quickly became four, and who goes home after four drinks was their saying. 

He went to wake up Philip in the next room so they can go and eat something before his flight home. As usual, it took Philip more than half an hour to get out of his bed and another twenty minutes to get ready.

“I called Mateus, Emil, and Peanut they will meet with us down at the kebab place,” Philip said his voice raspy from the night out.

“Fine, let’s finally go,” Andreas said.

The kebab place was a few blocks away and they each picked up a can of energy drink on the way. It took them a few more minutes than usual to arrive due to their hungover walk. 

“Here come the party bros,” Peanut said as they walked in.

Peanut got his nickname partly due to his short stature, and mostly because of his idea that he was allergic to peanuts but regularly eat chocolate bars that had peanuts in them. He insisted he was deadly allergic to peanuts but once they were wrapped in chocolate the allergy was negated, so someone years ago said he was smart as Peanut, and the nickname stuck.

“Don’t squeak before we eat, please,” Philip said 

They exchanged handshakes, ordered kebabs, and summarized their week concluding with the crazy last night. Once their stomachs were full they went back to Philip’s place to help Andreas pack and they all would go with him to the airport.

Once they arrived at the apartment, no one actually helped him pack as Andreas already suspected. Luckily he only brought a small suitcase and borrowed most of the stuff from Philip. Andreas needed this week off to get his mind in the right place, once he gets back home he will have to finally graduate and his internship at the bank was waiting. He only recently admitted to himself that he completely missed a mark when choosing his career, but what was done was done, for now, he needed to get some work habits, stop the partying and start acting at least semi-grown up.

“Guys come here, check this out,” Peanut from the couch browsing his phone.

“What is it?” Philip yelled from the kitchen, Mateus only shrugged and Andreas was too lazy to even ask.

“There is a post on Reddit trending, someone pasted a picture on r/space subreddit of Saturn taken by their telescope with what appears like a spaceship around it,” Peanut said.

“Yea right, Aliens is what we need after the pandemic, wars, and other global crisis,” Mateus said.

“Why do people even upvote that photoshopped shit, they only add fuel to conspiracy theorists?” Philip asked.

“Apparently it’s not photoshopped, few other people are posting their photos in the comments all showing similar images,” Peanut said and shared his screen to TV.

The image appeared on the big screen showing a blurry picture of Saturn and several tiny objects near its rings. Peanut scrolled through comments opening several more images showing similar things.

“It’s probably Saturn moons or some shit man,” Emil said. “With deepfakes, photoshop, and other editing software I don’t believe anything I see on the internet anymore.”

“True that,” Philip said.

“Yea, we don’t have time for that, let’s get my stuff to the car and go. I wanna get early there and we can sit at the coffee shop if we have some spare time.” Andreas said.

They left the apartment and packed the car, Mateus drove Golf as a true German immigrant. They barely all fit in the car and went on their way, the drive to the airport with normal Berlin traffic would take around half-hour. 

“What’s up all the police around the city?” Philip asked.

“Probably some political gathering, or a protest, everyone is protesting everything these days,” Mateus answered.

It took them a bit longer to arrive at the airport with all the police and even some military vehicles around the city, but they still had some spare time to sit for a coffee before boarding starts.

“Bild is reporting on the Saturn images,” Peanut said. “They are saying the pictures have been authenticated and that they are not fake, but that they still don’t know what it is.”

“Leave the phone for a minute man, let’s talk a bit more before I leave, God knows when I will be able to visit again,” Andreas said.

“Fine, fine,” Peanut answered.

They each ordered espressos and Andreas went to the store across the coffee shop the buy a pack of Cigarettes. A dirty habit he was quitting for almost two years now, but in reality, he didn’t miss a day without smoking at least a few. Andreas lit the cigarette and inhaled his first smoke of the day on the way back to the Coffee shop that was part of the Airport. Going back he noticed the huge crowd of people gathering in front of the entrance to the airport some murmuring, some yelling, and a few police cars arrived at the scene already.

“What is that about?” Andreas asked the boys.

“You didn’t check your phone?” Philip said.

“No, why?”

“All of today’s flights have been delayed until tomorrow,” Philip answered.

“What, why?” Andreas asked.

“They said there is a security risk of some kind, but that’s all for now, more will be known later,” Philip said.

“Fuck my luck,” Andreas said with a frustrated tone.

Mateus suggested that they leave right away to avoid a total traffic collapse with all the people leaving right now. On the way back they noticed even more police vehicles and military presence across the town, something weird was definantely happening. They got some beers on the way back and went back to Philips apartment there was a game on later tonight. 

Andreas had to admit to himself, he felt a little bit relieved, he had one more day free of the obligations that were waiting for him at home, one more day to let his mind wander and relax. He opened a cold beer and laid back in the massage chair that Philip conveniently found next to the dumpster some months ago.

“Eee, guys,” Peanut yelled scrolling through his phone once again. “They deleted that Reddit post, it had over 90k likes. Let me check,” He murmured to himself. “The Bild deleted their article as well.” 

“Probably proven fake by now,” Andreas said. “Is there any information on the airport and the flights?”

“Nothing yet, it only says that all of the flights have been delayed until tomorrow and that more will be known either tonight or early in the morning.” Peanut answered.

Andreas nodded and went onto the balcony to light one more cigarette to go along with his cold beer. They spend the rest of the day playing some PlayStation, watching football, and enjoying each other’s company. Mateus, Piglet, and Emil left sometime before midnight, and they made an agreement on breakfast in the morning and the airport again, the same schedule on a different day.

So I am fairly new to programming( learning for the past 1 month). Apparently the company where I work as an Intern involves stuff related to data analysis, where the pandas Library is mostly used. So my question is , how do I get familiarized with the whole pandas library, like I understand the basic functions, but if I want to go into the intricacies like changing the arguments inside the functions etc that's when I start going blank. I go to the pandas documentation but I am neither able to make head or tail of the whole documentation. The whole thing seems too cryptic to me especially  the API reference where they explain each function in depth .Is there a better way in going about this? I thought the best way is trying to find some beginner related data analytic projects and try to solve them step by step, so that I can familiarize with all the functions etc. But many projects which I see online either don't have any solutions or they are paid.

My other colleagues either have been programming for min. 2 years or come from a c.sc background and so when I ask them something they are immediately able to give me the answer by typing so and so statement and I get the required solution. But I really don't like this, as at the end of the day I am not learning anything. And also, I try googling but I somehow don't find the exact answers to the questions I have and after a while I almost feel like giving up, as I don't know where else to find the solution and I also don't understand the pandas documentation. This sometimes makes me demotivated in learning programming and feel like maybe I am not suited to learn programming. Any help or suggestions are very much welcome."

So as the title says im graduating in a couple of months with no relevant experience and a low GPA. I do, however, have a rough long term plan. 

The Plan: Get some decent paying finance job for several years in order to save up for a quality MSF. Hopefully then get a role with Treasury OIA or as an economic analyst at an OGA. 

I find myself in this predicament as my security clearance was denied for a role due to drug use within the preceding 48 months. In the period of time from my application to that job until now my GPA slipped significantly (from a 3.7) due to being on a prescribed medication that messed me up and the suicide of a close friend (though last semester i pulled a 3.5 when i stopped taking the meds). Heres a bit more about my background

Pros:
-Go to a solid semi target (ND/BC/UVA/UNC/UMich)
-Major in finance with fairly strong grades in major
-Very strong people skills/articulate
-Strong non finance extracurricular/volunteer experience 
-Parents live in CT so NYC is easily commutable 
-Naturally inquisitive/adept problem solver
-Decent at excel/modeling 

Cons: 
-Cumulative GPA
-No relevant internship experience
-Haven’t networked much 
-No leadership roles in finance or business clubs
-No short term direction/passion for anything in particular in finance that im qualified for right now


In an ideal world id get an ER job but I know my GPA will preclude me from that. I have taken a number of classes and am interested in the renewables space. Intrigued by CRE development and have taken courses but think it is not helpful towards my goals/MSF application. 

 
If you were in my shoes what roles would you shoot for? Any roles that are “ER Lite”? Anyone happen to work in project finance for renewables? Any further advice would also be appreciated."

My degree will be done in two months to be precise and my parents decided they r going to force me into an arranged marriage as soon as possible so that I won't be able to taste independence and friends and normal households. They want to force me into an arranged marriage in three months or so. I tried telling them I don't want to get married, begged them for some time (atleast an year) assured them that I have no male friends. I just wanna feel freedom. They just won't let me do it. My mother is the aggresive narc in the family she manipulates me telling me I am selfish for not letting them have the happiness of seeing their only daughter's marriage. She keeps bringing up her health issues to manipulate me. I tried killing myself so many times before and ofc it never mattered my mental health is never addressed and it's just attention seeking. My childhood is filled with beatings, insults, burning my body, my mother will still hit me to pulp if given a chance. I now recently realised my childhood is not okay and it's abusive..

Now all that is out of the way. I saved up some money enough for me to last a month. I started applying for various jobs. No luck so far. There are so job opportunities that needs some time like a month or so. My parents are not letting me live. They keep mentally torturing me forcing me these marriage proposals and I want to die. Every other day I Google how to kill myself and leave it at that. I need to leave or I am going to die. I need help on how to navigate moving out and dealing with narcissistic parents.
Please help me out
Any advice. Please. I just want to be free


UPDATE:

Went for an interview today. I don't know how I did, I'm just hoping it is good enough. Job location is like one hour away from home. I am wondering if i should take it  or let go and find for jobs somewhere far away. In case if i get selected I want to take this because i know how difficult job hunting is, I dunno, any advice?

UPDATE 2:

I got the job. Not a bad pay and they said they'll increase the pay if i go good in 6 month period. I asked for worked from home for two months before i complete my internship and get my certificate and stuff but they said wfh is not available and i should be present for atleast three days a week and the rest of the days i can wfh which i think I can manage. The problem I'm facing is 
should I tell my parents about the job? They'd say no. They don't want me to work they want to get me married. It'll be a huge fight probably resulting in either of these scenarios
1)my parents taking my phone away and locking me up
2) beating me up and not allowing me to go out
3) My mother having an all alleged  heart attack or an asthma attack and I'll be guilt tripped
4)none of the above but they'd be too much interested in my work place and meddle , talk to everyone there and tell them shit like she'd get married in a few months this is a temporary job or something like that and kinda make my life hell
5)Make my life so miserable until I'd choose to end my life myself

If i didn't tell them about the job and sneak off 
1)They'd hunt me down and get me off the job
2)They'd mess with the very few friends I have and I'd be with no emotional support
3) my work place is like only one hr away and it's easy for them to find me if they want to so once they find that out, I'm sure they'll find my higher ups and completely mess up my chance of work
  My work place is like one of those highly secure jobs they don't want anything like this associated with them.
5)Once they'd hunt me down it's gonna be either 1)2)3)4)5)of the first scenarios all over again

Making scenarios and calculating the damage is a coping mechanism of me growing up and anticipating shit from parents all the time. I'm sorry if this is very lengthy and unnecessary

All this is weighing too much on my mental health and I'm absolutely losing it. Thank you for anyone who'd want to give me a different scenarios or advice. Please any advice would help me immensely. Thank you"

I am a career switcher - I was pursuing a masters in bioeconomics (math minor) and chose to leave the program after 3 years. During that time, picked up Python and caught the CS and Software bug. I built a spatiotemporal model and designed and developed a relational database as a personal project (learned much about DBs on the way). My interests and experiences lead me much closer to backend development or data engineering. 

I was able to find my way into Shopify and get a four month internship, but that ends in Nov/Dec. Afterwards, I’d go back into my past role in Support - times being tough it’s unlikely this opportunity will manifest into a full time dev job. But the experience has been phenomenal nevertheless. 

So I’m gearing up to apply for internships and full time positions, but the road ahead is going to be difficult given the angle in coming in from and the state of the economy. I don’t have a CS degree, though I’m an avid learner and always reading (Working through DDIA right now). I work on Leetcode problems and read a lot on concepts you’d cover in a CS undergraduate degree (think computer networks, data structures, common algos, and then DDIA is my supplement for distributed systems work). 

Despite my grind, the road is tough, but that is to be expected. What can one do as a career switcher to even just get eyes on the resume beyond sending it in? I hear frequently how people get screened out by systems if they don’t have CS degrees, so I need to work with that. 

Ultimately, just looking to hear how people who pursued the self-taught route found their way into the industry in Canada? My Hail Mary play is going to be  going back to do the 2 year Comp Sci degree at UBC in Fall 2023."
xjcr74,1,2022-09-20,How to look into the future clearer?,hi579579579,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/xjcr74/how_to_look_into_the_future_clearer/,"I’ve always found it hard to look into the future because I’m scared of it, so I tend to shy away and try my best to be the least bothered about it, when it’s actually a bad habit. My mind does this by just going with the flow, which is so wrong because I have no control over myself. It stays in the present, trying to find joy in what’s happening now, or when it feels miserable it tends to look at past events that do basically nothing for me, or they catastrophize a negative thing about me after I compare myself to others out of nowhere (such as if I’m doing my work too slowly than other people on campus), and make me feel like I don’t have much potential to achieve my higher self.

I’m a college junior majoring in CS, and it’s pretty much past the normal time I should be aware about internship search which I have JUST gotten to worrying about recently, and my senior year when I’ll be searching for jobs (Note: I am passionate about CS. It’s hard, but I do enjoy and think this major’s the right fit for me, but I haven’t planned my career goals for it yet). Not only just jobs, but just everything in life.

Some including where am I planning to move? What are the consequences if I don’t make the most of my time with my life right now (making new friends, doing hobbies etc.)? Decision-making is a problem too. I hate asking myself “what’s the consequences of this decision?” I tend to straight up do it without thinking deeply enough of it. I do ask questions to myself though, but with how scared of the future I am, I tend to avoid the deeper questions. 

I get mad when people ask me, what’s your plan in the future? I don’t know, but I look like I just wanna eat, take walks and travel to new places LOL. But this is bad because I have no direction. Even my emotions don’t, and I don’t feel like I take the effort to try and do something about them. If I feel sad one day I don’t take the time to learn from it or find a way to make myself feel better, I just feel upset and whine about it to myself or someone, when I need to be finding a solution, or LEARN from it. 

This is going to mess me up in the long-term, and I want to stop this mentality and face the future without feeling afraid. I want to feel like I’m going in a direction and not just letting my emotions do whatever it wants, or let a future be shaped by simply doing nothing. Any help? Thanks!"

xjdsmo,1,2022-09-20,Do I need an internship if I'm employed at a small company?,weirdladyy,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/xjdsmo/do_i_need_an_internship_if_im_employed_at_a_small/,"Hello. I'm currently an undergraduate student at Berkeley majoring in Cognitive Science. I initially chose this major because I knew that I wanted to work with something involving technology and science. My main goal has been to become a UX designer, but I'm also open to other areas.

I'm a transfer student, so I just started at Berkeley and have two years ahead of me. As soon as I transferred, my Data Science professor recruited me to start working at their SEO (search engine optimization)/web development company. There, I work part-time and get paid almost double what I was making as a tutor at my community college, and I can ""choose"" what areas I want to focus on: data, web development, design, etc. 

My question here is about the importance of also getting an internship. I'm really feeling the pressure of having to attend career fairs etc (which I have) but it feels so weird that I'd need an internship considering that I have a job. I'm really paranoid about these things, so I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. 

My professor seems to want me to continue working at his company. They even gave me a $5 raise out of nowhere. 

My fears: 

* If I eventually decide to leave the company in the future or if the company shuts down, will not having had an internship during school hurt my chances of getting a full-time job?
* If I want to work with UX, will having a job in a similar field help? I create ""intuitive"" designs, but I don't conduct interviews with users or anything like that.
* I worry that I'm getting paranoid. I'm a recent immigrant to the US so I'm always feeling like I have to be two steps ahead of everyone in order to actually have a ""life"".

Thank you so much for reading this, and I appreciate any input."

I am interested in applying for the Start Consulting internship at PWC. I think that I have a relevant background and work experience related to the role.

Any advice on where/how to reach out for a potential referral? I am more than happy to chat with someone and talk them through my background to make them more comfortable with providing me a referral. I definitely don't think I would make the referrer look bad. Any help/advice would be much appreciated.

xjhhra,12,2022-09-20,I just failed my first programming test for a job. How do I do better next time?,HelpNarcParent,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xjhhra/i_just_failed_my_first_programming_test_for_a_job/,"So I recently got contacted by a company for a software development internship. I was really excited since it was a big name, and they do some really interesting stuff.

I sent them my CV and cover letter, and I got a reply the very next day! They sent a link which required me to solve 5 questions by writing code, and needless to say, I failed miserably.

I don't know why I got a massive brainfart but I had very similar questions while at uni, and for some reason, I just couldn't solve these ones. Out of the 5 questions, I only managed to write the code for one of them, and it barely functions...

So there's that job out of the window. I am not going to quit though, I will just keep trying to do practice interview questions until I'm ready to apply for anything else that comes up.

For these interview questions, should I keep practicing in my spare time and use sites like LeetCode?"
xji7d5,1,2022-09-20,Am I SOL for the 2023 CS Summer internship opportunities?,Bit_Sorcerer,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/xji7d5/am_i_sol_for_the_2023_cs_summer_internship/,"Hey y’all!

Background: Just looking for a little guidance/information to manage my expectations. I’m a controls engineer with a BSME, looking to go back to school for a MSCS. I have 2 quarters of prerequisites to take, then 49 credits to complete the masters program. This leaves me to finish my masters by spring 2024.

I see that people are already applying for internships regarding the 2023 Summer, though currently my resume is almost entirely void of professional CS work experience. 

Question: Is it even worth applying for a internship this summer once I have those prerequisites to add to my resume(That would be by the end of spring) or am I mostly SOL for this summers hiring pool? 

Secondarily: What would y’all suggest I do when I finish my masters… should I look for an internship or go straight to full time job hunting? I would have close to no professional work experience in CS at that point as well. 

Thanks for all information!

Note: I would love to post this in cscareeradvice I just lack the karma. Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit."
xjku62,1,2022-09-20,Do I need an internship if I'm employed at a small company?,weirdladyy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xjku62/do_i_need_an_internship_if_im_employed_at_a_small/,"Hello. I'm currently an undergraduate student at Berkeley majoring in Cognitive Science. I initially chose this major because I knew that I wanted to work with something involving technology and science. My main goal has been to become a UX designer, but I'm also open to other areas.

I'm a transfer student, so I just started at Berkeley and have two years ahead of me. As soon as I transferred, my Data Science professor recruited me to start working at their SEO (search engine optimization)/web development company. There, I work part-time and get paid almost double what I was making as a tutor at my community college, and I can ""choose"" what areas I want to focus on: data, web development, design, etc.

My question here is about the importance of also getting an internship. I'm really feeling the pressure of having to attend career fairs etc (which I have) but it feels so weird that I'd need an internship considering that I have a job. I'm really paranoid about these things, so I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.

My professor seems to want me to continue working at his company. They even gave me a $5 raise out of nowhere.

My fears:

* If I eventually decide to leave the company in the future or if the company shuts down, will not having had an internship during school hurt my chances of getting a full-time job?
* If I want to work with UX, will having a job in a similar field help? I create ""intuitive"" designs, but I don't conduct interviews with users or anything like that.
* I worry that I'm getting paranoid. I'm a recent immigrant to the US so I'm always feeling like I have to be two steps ahead of everyone in order to actually have a ""life"".

Thank you so much for reading this, and I appreciate any input."

xjnrma,1,2022-09-20,Debating between two topics for my UIUC Supplemental,cs-boi-1,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/xjnrma/debating_between_two_topics_for_my_uiuc/,"Hey guys, so here's the prompt: **Explain, in detail, an experience you've had in the past 3 to 4 years related to your first-choice major. This can be an experience from an extracurricular activity, in a class you’ve taken, or through something else. (150 words)**

So there are two very meaningful activities that I've had that I'm debating between.

1. NASA Internship - This is my number 1 EC and it's my most impressive and also related to my major (Computer Science). I already wrote the essay about this for this prompt, but it just feels too boring. Idk why, but I haven't really grown too much out of this experience and I basically just wrote about what I did during my internship. I don't even know if the AO's are gonna understand exactly what I did because it's fairly technical.
2. Coding Teacher for Elementary School Kids - This isn't one of my top 3 ECs, but it was still very meaningful to me. Although this doesn't sound as cool as my NASA internship, I feel like I can write a lot about how I grew and how I combatted my shyness and developed more confidence by becoming a teacher (I used to be the kid who would never talk during the entire school year). I can show a lot of my positive qualities through this like my charitability and how I love to inspire younger generations, etc.

So if you guys were in my position, which option would you go with? Like would simply the name value of ""NASA"" carry my essay even if the substance of the essay isn't that good because this essay would just be about what I did at NASA and how I learned some generic things. On the other hand, option 2, although not as exciting has NASA, really shows a lot of my growth."
xjnrxl,0,2022-09-20,"Currently interning at the rainforest company as a BI Engineer, but not sure where to go next. How should I plan my next steps?",Jonathaneus,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/xjnrxl/currently_interning_at_the_rainforest_company_as/,"I recently graduated with a degree in economics from a top school. In hindsight I should have done engineering. Would like to go back to school in the future and study some sort of STEM master's (maybe even PhD) but no idea what that would be in. Anyway, I know a decent amount of econometrics and statistics, but when it comes to programming I only know Python and SQL. The BI engineer role is really just writing random scripts and solving problems with pipelines here and there. Kind of like a data engineer but slightly less technical.

I have a few months of this internship left and was wondering what the best use of my free time would be. I have no idea where to go after this, and I don't think I can convert due to headcount. Even if I can convert, I don't know if I'd want to do this exact role full time. Although I enjoy my current work, I'd prefer to get really good at something in particular instead of being a generalist.

My first idea is to improve my software/data engineering skills- learn about algorithms, start leetcoding, learn TypeScript or some other language. This would help me do better in my current role, maybe help me go down the software engineering path?

My second idea is to learn some machine learning and also improve my maths. There are some machine learning projects that I could potentially take on at work and it would be interesting to see if I can go the data science route- but as far as I'm aware, a lot of proper DS roles require a master's.

My third idea is to spend my time outside of work preparing for quant trading internships. This is something I want to try, but of course, the application process is very difficult and I haven't prepared much yet despite most applications closing end of October.

So my question is, what usage of my spare time over the next few months would give me the greatest ROI? I want to try new things, but I'm limited by my current skillset and don't know the best direction to go in. All three ideas listed above interest me, but I'm underqualified for all of them. I'd like to have another internship/job lined up for when my current internship ends, but I understand that it might not be possible right now. Feeling really lost so any advice is appreciated.

(also, I struggle to find energy to do my own projects and learning outside of work which is another roadblock...)"

I was hoping to get into FAANG when I graduate, but I feel like I'm inadequate and already so behind most other people here and elsewhere. I haven't programmed much prior to this year, so my projects aren't complex - I only ever made a sudoku webpage, and I've been working on my personal website for the past few months. I've seen other people's projects, and they're way more original/complex than mine, even the ones I was considering doing. The actual complex ideas I've seen wouldn't be original if I were to do them (if I could ever do them). I started practicing leetcode and I'm taking data structures this semester, and I see so many other people already know the ins and outs and also get high scores on code signal etc. I also see people show off their WFH setups/apartments and it makes me feel so bad about myself. I know it takes time and effort to get to where they are, which is what I've been trying to give myself / do, but these same people were often times rather than not doing more than me when they were in my position."

Today I solved 1695 and 318 in O(n\^2) both. I only know how to do it in brute force, not even close to optimal solutions. Then I just realize that I am dumb. Everyone told me that I would begin to see the pattern after 200 and skill at it after 300. The fact is that I can barely solve 1 out of 5 medium problems on my own and today is already a lucky day.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also an intern now and pretty sure that I got in because interviewers were more 'old-school' and focused on my projects without asking me any algorithm questions. The team has no plan to provide full-time positions for CS background for now. So job hunting becomes really stressful again.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope someone could give me some suggestions. Each time after solution accepted, I read the optimal solution, modify the code then analyze time/space complexity. Coding solved problems is easy, but I can not find the bridge linking the old problems to new ones."

Hey guys so I recently just changed my major from exercise science to computer science. I originally wanted to go into healthcare either as a physical therapist or physician assistant but after shadowing and ALOT of thinking (especially about the loans after undergrad) something in my mind just clicked and I didn't want to do healthcare anymore. During the summer I was having pretty big existential crisis and fell into a really bad depression. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life anymore. I had just finished my first semester of junior year so I felt like I had wasted a lot of time/ money. I thought back about all the coursers that I had taken so far and I realized that I enjoyed two of my electives in which we programmed in python.

So I started looking into programing and the tech world and I found out how fuckin vast it was. When looking into careers stuff like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, data science and cyber security seemed really cool to me. What really peaked my interest was software engineering.

So I transferred over to a new school that had a computer science program and luckily a good majority of my credits transferred. At this new school I am considered a sophomore and what I have left of degree are the main core classes. I think after this fall semester I am junior again. As of now I am a month into the new semester and have a couple of questions

Do you think it is possible for me to get an internship for the summer since I am considered a sophomore?

I don't have any projects or any other experience with the field. On my resume I have two shadowing jobs and like 6 years of food service/ retail work experience ( I started working at 16 and I'm currently 22 just to clarify) My gpa as of right now is 3.6.

Do guys have suggestions/tips on what I should do as a new CS major?

Should I concentrate on making my LinkedIn/ Resume better?

Do I start leetcoding like a mf or do projects and if so where do I get ideas for projects?

I did the math and I'm due to graduate the fall of 2024 if nothing goes wrong lmao which means I have two summers do shit.

What should I do? Any info would be really helpful!"

Dont know what to do",juniperroot,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/xjx1el/32_failed_at_everything_career_wise_dont_know/,"I have to post this. Im not necessarily looking for advice I just need to confess. to be yelled at. Last time I posted this is was flagged for spam, not sure why...

I turned 32 in July. I have failed every goal I ever had, career or otherwise. graduated at 25 with a computer science degree, but un-accredited, no internship or real programming experience. I tried learning on my own, panicked, then got an IT job, which I was fired from 13 months later.

I got the brilliant idea to just work a regular minimum wage job while I studied for a cert, as I had no real IT skills. I studied for the CCNA. which toook 2.5 years. I got another IT job in early 2019, which was very entry level in terms of skill but I somehow managed to struggle with that. I tried to get another slightly better IT job but the covid lockout started, there was a hiring freeze, I had a job interview but I lost the opportunity. I didnt get another job until July of last year when I was contacted out of the blue.
I was on the fence about being in IT since beginning of 2021. I re-enrolled in college studying accounting, but I dont think I want to pursue it

I felt invigorated at first, it was only a meager pay bump but I feel like it represents a 2nd chance. I took the time to read a windows server certification book as a sort of last chance self test. It took me.a year to get through and I didn't get too much out of it. I feel like its time to face facts and admit IM not cut out for this.

even worse, I never left home. I was hoping to make it a position where I may enough that I could afford to rent a cheap place+amenities and still have a some money to save at the end. I guess I technically reached that point buts its a sobering thought that my meagre saving might be wiped out going to school :/

For some reason in spite of all of this I dont find myself to depressed or despondent, in spite of how clearly dire my situation is career wise. I think its because a part of me still believes in myself. I just dont know if a career change is warranted but my feeling is yes, but I dont know what that would be. MY mom suggests going back to school to be an MRI tech, which as time goes on Im strongly considering. I feel like as I grow older its far more important I have a stable job and income then getting fulfillment or even liking my day to day job. Im starting to feel guilt about my lack of success and the effects its had on my parents."

(New Grad),sbfffnico,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xjyi3t/how_many_years_of_experience_to_list_new_grad/,"For anyone with some wisdom, when applying to jobs as a new grad, how many years of experience should I be entering?

Just a little background.  I'm a 31 year old recent computer science graduate from a state school up north who was working full time while going back to school.  I have about three years of experience working in the oil and gas industry.  This is/was mostly dealing with data analysis (Spotfire/Tableau) and building tools for operations and billing teams in excel using VBA.

The rest of my work experience was some form of technical support, customer service, or collections.  Nothing that has resulted in compensation for software developer skills.

I do not have any internships, which I am aware will not help my chances at my first job.  But I'm also aware it won't necessarily make it impossible.

I have been honest on my applications when years of experience for languages/technologies have been requested and entered 0 years.  This is under the assumption that the requested experience is work and not personal.

I've been applying for anything 2-4 years of experience or less and anything containing junior/associate/entry level to help my chances of getting my foot in the door.  I have been avoiding, as best I can, any of the seemingly predatory contract consulting firms.

I do feel proficient in a few languages, frameworks, and other technologies.  My resume shows both personal projects and some of the professional ones I have created.  Through the professional ones bring me concern as they were built mainly using Office/VBA and may not hold much weight for the career shift.

Am I filling out my applications properly, or have I been shooting myself in the foot by listing 0 years of experience on all of them?

TL;DR On applications, is experience with languages/frameworks referencing personal experience or purely occupational (paid work)?"

Basically, I have been struggling, frustrated, avoiding, toggling, and just conflicted with updating my resume. 
I have severe anxiety around this process because I actually had a very poor academic performance through 8 years of college. Yes, I finished my Bachelor's degree, but it was such a terrible output that I don't even feel proud of the ""accomplishment"" I supposedly have made.
On top of that, nearly everything that I have been a part of I cannot honestly say I did well with. I had multiple jobs, a few internships, and several extra curricular activities during those 8 years. Plus these additional past 2 years I have done an assortment of activities as well but nothing that I feel I can proudly present and get referrals off of. 
I have gone from job to job, task to task - and really there's nothing I have to show for it. This isn't anyone fault but my own,  I understand this. 
I feel so stuck because....I'm just not.....I think something is wrong with me. I'm not performing well at nearly anything I'm involved with. I have poor focus whenever I set out to do a task. I don't have the passion that I have seen my peers have for their education,  for their jobs, for their career paths,  and even for their hobbies. 
So when it comes down to creating this resume I feel an overwhelming pressure because I don't even feel qualified to create 1 even though I have actually done many things that should warrant at least some array of skillsets that could be respected. 
I'm not even sure what I'm getting at in this post...maybe I'm just venting? I keep going back and forth getting upset that I'm not really progressing at even getting a basic job in my major because I couldn't keep my head straight during school due to not managing my emotional chaos at that time and now I'm paying for it again in the form ofnot being able to lock down a professional job in the real world.  
I'm kinda just over it. But I know I can't quit at this either. I do push myself to move everyday towards accepting gigs and thats been at least paying my bills but I honestly just want to find something fulfilling to do and not feel like a loser all of the time who can't ""adult"" properly. 
I get anxiety about just the idea of sitting down and working on my resume. And then when I finally work up the courage to do it, as I work on it - I get immense imposter syndrome and fumble on what should I say about myself and these positions I have done? Many of them did not end on a particularly good note, but while I was there I did actually do some good things. So I end up questioning the validity of my own works and throw the whole thing away getting stuck all over again.
I'm tired of myself and struggling against my own emotions. I need to move forward but I'm not even sure how to or what to do about.....about myself. 
I can understand how some may view my experience as ridiculous or just some pity party or self inflicted issue which honestly is what I think myself and it begins the onslaught of my anxiety. 
Idk what to do about it.
I know that I can do great things and that I actually am capable to be reliable. 
I'm scared.
Point blank, I'm just scared of what I am or maybe what I find out that I'm not?
Kinda just want to crawl into a whole and cry because either don't even know where to begin and just, has anyone ever experienced a form of this? If you have, how did you deal with it? How did you get yourself out of it and overcome it? Thank you"

I know this is a general question but what level of competency is expected from interns for say, a java backend internship? Is the process very similar to a graduate role or are interns expected to not know too much on their own and shadow an experienced dev? 

Also, should I look exclusively for placement in a field I'd be interested in as a grad or should I broaden my search and apply for any/every opportunity out there? 

Finally, what tips could you give for securing an internship/placement? I'm not a 4 year CS student or one of those people who have been coding since age 12 but I will have the majority of my course done by next Summer plus some independent study and personal projects.

I'm trying to be realistic as I know this won't be an easy feat but I'm being optimistic because I've heard everywhere that placement is important for employability and I'm excited to learn more about software dev. Thanks all in advance."

For the record, I’m already going to the gym five times a week, playing piano regularly, grinding HARD for an internship this summer in my free time, participating in social events and going to two college clubs' activities.

that led to some slacking on the job admittedly but i don’t feel very sorry for that because i honestly didn’t have the brain space to care after being made to feel so shitty at my old job. it seriously occurred to me that no employer, however nice initially, cares about you outside of the value you produce. not that i would expect otherwise, but it just felt like a sharp reminder not to give much to any job, let alone one that paid minimum wages for what was essentially being the assistant director of a noteworthy organization.

now, i’m back in university and it’s been 3 weeks since the start of the semester. i still feel so much residual lethargy and just…. fog from getting burnt out even though it’s been a few months. is this normal? does burnout last this long usually?"

Anyways, we're all students at a very prestigious university, #1 in the tri-state area, ranked #6 in all major football leagues and #13 in water polo. 

As background, I was offered a team-lead-student-work-internship position after The Knack^(TM) was observed at the library, the work was doing mostly Mac desktop support and paid well too. 

The cast:    
$Kevin - For that is not is name - 4.0 GPA - no IT street smarts, no filter, now writes code

$George - From chronicles of George    
First year engineering student, loved to shred it on electric guitars, has yet to understand the laws of physics, did not write good support tickets. 

$Kara - Math genius    
Destined for great things, handled the awkwardness of our dynamic duo, awesome and friendly. 

$Girlfriend - Now wife - would hang out in the office and either supervise us or do lunch ^((flirt)) between our classes.

$Me - The intrepid hero, team leader extraordinaire, teacher of the teachers, boss of the bosses, expert of the experts, builder of the builders, the next Elon Musk... ~~no wait, we're getting ahead of ourselves~~

Kevin had a very curious disposition and really really really loved his anime.    
He couldn't focus on anything for more than 3.57 seconds before reverting back to his beloved topic. 

I was multi-tasking on a new PC deployment and asked him to start windows updates as part of the upgrade to Office 2016 and then return to HQ, I wrap up and then realize he didn't exit stage-left with me.

Couldn't find him for the next iMac deliveries and after dodging the dangers of the fire swamp... again I found him sitting at the desk staring at the same computer instead of working with the rest of the office.

$me - Ummm, what's going on?  
Windows update runs in the background if you start it, you don't have to wait for it...

$Kevin - I thought I had to stay for the whole thing (zombie voice) 

There were other things Kevin did that were blocked from memory like not formatting a single ticket correctly or doing anything without having to be re-taught how to deploy a Mac or PC daily. 

\*A few months later\* 

He finally reaches the end of his internship ^(and my patience) and I had encouraged him to branch out some and interview in places and spaces and he managed to make the finalist pool by sheer luck or a low barrier of entry. 

\*Ding!\* A wild new email arrives!

$Kevin - Ooooh! I  now have two companies bidding for me... like a geisha girl!

$Me - \*Hisses\* Kevin! That's not work appropriate!

He laughs it off after I lecture him about getting a lid or handle on not letting his inner thoughts become outward thoughts. 

After he graduated, I found his e-resume to be rather embellished for someone who didn't understand anything in the internship:  
Inventory management system (I was there, he didn't make one)  
Documentation that was very convoluted (I had to redo all of it)  
Imaging and deploying of PC/Macs (I had to help him push the only button &gt; next)

One day, he asked me what part of the tri-state area would be good to live in and the rental listings shared were in possibly the worst neighborhoods of the city.

$Me - You can go there if you like a daily schedule of gunshots, gang wars, and police raids?    
He then found better places to live after whining about his budget.  

Enter George:  
Occasionally his schedule would overlap with Kevin, much to everyone's dismay. 

They were in cahoots and when combined and a nearly unstoppable force of destruction if ever let loose on their own. 

There was trouble brewing because they were constantly giggling like schoolgirls about something in Asian. 

One day, they got on about some very 18+ raunchy Asian stuff in front of $Kara.   
(thankfully not about her) 

\*Verbal warnings ensued\*

$Kara blitzed him and rattled the desk.   
I addressed them sternly and nearly broke the office door off it's hinges. 

The girlfriend \*stared at them in French\*   
I suspect that if they had seen her glare, they would have been instantly vaporized. 

Anyways, after that incident, short leashes were instituted and George managed to slip off for a repair ticket went at it unsupervised. 

The ticket was to fetch and replace a broken classroom projector, and his claim to fame was to take it in a hand truck down a flight of stairs. 

These stairs are 20ft/6m away from the handicap ramp... I don't yell at people, but he learned how far I can project my voice outside ^((I surprised myself that day too))

I then confiscate the projector and drag him to the install to replace it in hopes he hadn't turned the really important bits into sand.

After a miraculous and blindingly bright test and while wrangling it into position  
$Me - Screwdriver please  
$G - \*Hands me a wrench\*  
Yaaas George that is exactly what I needed, now give me the yellow handled screwdriver \*there\* 

He finally left stage right after a few more little issues of not being able to follow the simplest of directions. 

Endnotes:  
Kara finished her internship with excellent marks and her support tickets were stellar, cherished by the entire academic entourage and support staff.   
The girlfriend (now wife) didn't vaporize anyone else and we all graduated with excellence, she still flirts ;)"

Since I've never lived abroad, I'd like to use the chance and go live somewhere else for a while, to get to know living in another culture. The obvious move would be to search for an entry-level position. But I'm still a bit undecided as to where I want to head in my career (academic vs. applied), and so I'm thinking that it would be a good idea to take a research internship. But from what I've seen so far, it seems to me that most internships require one to still be enrolled in a university while doing them. However, my enrollment will end as soon as my thesis gets graded, so I can't really satisfy this requirement. So I was wondering if you could recommend me research institutions in Europe which offer research internships to people who already finished their degree.

I'm looking to start in February/March and aiming for 6-9 months. The working language should be English, but I'm not too picky about the country. I know some French and Spanish that I would improve if I were to move to the respective country. My thesis is in the area of algorithmics. During my intense studies, I've dipped my toes into many subfields of computer science and have very broad interests. But ideally, I'd like to do something associated with discrete algorithmics or the theoretical side of software engineering (e.g. static analysis, novel testing techniques).

I'm currently working on my resume because it's internship application season. I'm a sophomore, and I don't have that much experience compared to my peers. Outside of taking programming classes at, working as a coding tutor for kids, and being in academic clubs, I don't have that much to put on my resume. Companies like to see that you have experiences with creating personal projects and participating in event like hackathons, but I haven't done any of that. I've only been trying to improve through leetcoding. My resume is a bit empty, so would it be okay to list some assignments I have done in class?"

I’m currently applying to software development jobs as I graduate from college in a couple months and I’m have hesitations. Ever since I was a kid I’ve always had a bunch of serious hobbies and in the past few years I have successfully ""worked"" in a few different fields: tech career (landed and had a few SWE internships at legitimate tech companies), music career (worked my way into DJing residencies at some of the best clubs in my city) and travel-influencer (built upon a decent following on my travel blog). I enjoy work when it’s new I don’t like work when it feels like work doing something repetitively. I start thinking to myself why am I spending all of this time on one thing when there are so many other things I want to try in life. I always want something that is new and I always something different (or I’m noncommittal) and I don’t like working too hard on one thing or taking things too seriously. For example I want to spend time with my friends and family in the States but also want to travel the world. I also want to work hard enough that I have money but not work too hard to where I can enjoy friends and family. I think some of these expectations come from the fact I was raised by a high-achieving family where I was taught to believe anything is possible. 

Writing this has helped me reason out in my brain a little. I like new things and I should embrace that within reason but at the end of the day I do have to prioritize a little and remember I can’t have everything I want it and not to take life too seriously.

Cheers,

Sam"

No experience but was offered an internship at a large provider. I’m thrilled at the chance to learn but often feels like the blind leading the blind. Customers are
Constantly dissatisfied and fair enough we are advertising a fast good cheap service and falling short on all aspects. The content is very broad. From what I can tell, my team, which is about 3 functioning people on a good day, covers 30 companies all in varying capacities and programs. The vibe is very casual, a self proclaimed bro culture and constant drinking / cigarette / weed smoking around the building. People are judgmental of customers and coworkers with a lot of gossip, unhelpful, overwhelmed, and always working. Almost feels like a construction site. Being neat and timely is unheard of. Is this common in Helpdesk roles?"

Their first requirement relates to Tableau and I have Tableau listed on my skills on my resume with a portfolio project made in Tableau as well, perhaps they will likely ask me about that?

Any other ideas?

Get and confirm information in LinkedIn --&gt; put it in excel

&amp;#x200B;

The Primary Basis is the Company Name.

Look into LinkedIn search results (full name, company name), see if it matches the name and if he works at the company, if not or no result print a message. If it matches, see employment history whether he still works there or not, as well as his/her current position at the company; see also if there is a bio/about the person; and the country he is residing. After all these, get the URL (for source).

With this information, put them in an excel URL (many of us work at that file simultaneously). 

I want to know if this thing is possible, if any of you have done things in the past, and how to approach the problem?

&amp;#x200B;

For context: I am an intern at a company and there is a team of interns working at cleaning the database from SF. We are using excel manually and it is boring and labour intensive. I can imagine a way to make things easier, but I lack the knowledge to execute them. I have been learning Python for over 3 months, and I think this is much easier because I am working with strings; no numbers, no dates, nor emails.

P.S. I was learning openpyxl yesterday but forgot that you need an excel file to use this.  Also excuse my grammar. Thanks!!"

Chance me for T20’s+ recommend schools

Demographics: White Trans Male living in WV, in a very low income and rural community. We rank super low in everything and I think I want to tie that in based on how it affected me growing up. Super low income (&gt;16k a year) 
I want to major in government or political science and minor in either sociology or journalism. 

ACT: 33 (may take again because my math was a 29. 35 in English and reading and 34 in science) 

SAT (not sending) 1350

gpa- currently a 4.14, will be a 4.35 or so whenever I graduate. 

Our valedictorian system is really weird and isn’t based off GPA, But I’ll be top 5% at the very least. 

CLASSES- 
my freshman and sophomore years I wasn’t taking very hard classes just because I had a different career part at the time and I wanted to go into digital design and marketing, so I won’t include my classes for those years but I’ll mention I’ve always been one math class ahead of the majority of my grade. 

JUNIOR YEAR- 
Spanish 2 
APUSH
APGOPO
APLIT
Intro To Criminal Justice (Dual Enrollment, 5.0) 
ENG 101 (Dual Enrollment, 5.0) 
TRIGONOMETRY 
Internship 
Virtual Class Period
Anatomy 


Planned Senior Year 
APBIO
AP HUMAN GEO 
AP GOPO COMPARATIVE
AP LANG
AP WORLD 
There will be more online ones that will be taken during my second semester, our school just recently changed our system so we aren’t sure what ones will be offered. 
-I want to add our school only offers one more AP not listed and that is AP PSYCH. 

———ESSAYS———
Writing is 100% my strong suite, and I’ve had a lot happen to me in my life that that I could 100% tie into my passions. I have my personal statement done as well and it’s been through like 4 people. 

——LORS—— (Planned) 

APLIT Teacher- We’re super close and I’ve had her write multiple letters for me before for summer programs, QuestBridge, etc. I’ve also excelled in her class because I’m pretty good at Literature and writing, and she’s told me she thinks super highly of me. She knows me well enough that I think the letter would be a 9/10. She’s also the advisor of the newspaper I created. 

Gopo teacher- he loves me and also calls me patient all the time bc he struggles with my pronouns. Told me he wants me to do it again and has always praised me as being one of the best students in there. I’m also a strong lead for our teams in that class and have always excelled in competition -7/10 

Teacher from GHA - obv can’t be too revealing abt this one but he taught my intensive class at my 3 week program, and I spent well over 3 hrs w him everyday. He’s one of the best people I’ve ever met and the impact we had on one another was huge. He’s also a journalism teacher at his Uni and has a way w words. 9/10 

Science Teacher- had her last year for anatomy and this year for AP bio. I also stay w her during my virtual periods. We talk all the time and genuinely just have a rlly rlly great dynamic. 8/10? 

Counselor- she doesn’t really like anyone but I will say we are semi-close. I’ve done a few projects w her. I’ve had to keep my bridges mended w her recently bc of incidents at school lol. 



———————————
EXTRACURRICULARS/HOBBIES
-We The People Competition- super passionate about this one. Goes hand in hand with our GOPO class, and I’ve spent a ton of time and effort on it. Also combines a lot of my interests such as politics and writing. 

-Newspaper Team- Created a school newspaper, head of it. Put my own money forth to create a website in an effort to save paper. Hand picked the team after talking w teachers to see who the strongest writers, editors, etc were. (V important to note that our school doesn’t allow clubs so getting it approved was a pain) 

-Creative Writing- 
I’ve wrote like 50k words of creative writing at this point lol, it’s just something I do on my free time but it’s a huge interest. 

CERT- digital design/social media worked for our community emergency response team. Recently got promoted to manager of my own division 

Student council, 11th grade. President this year. 

National Honor Society

WVGHA- Governors academy for top like 100 students in the state. My classes have an emphasis on politics and government with some literature on the side. I loved this sm and tied it into my story a lot, I came out the day I got home from GHA. Genuinely life changing. 

I’m a QuestBridge prep scholar and won a scholarship for the Stanford Envision Law program. 

Yearbook for 4 years. We are technically only allowed to take the class twice, and I only done it once. The summer after my freshman the teacher came to me and asked me to help him finish the yearbook since his last class ditched him as soon as Covid began. I’ve been an advisor/editor ever since. 

I want to add that we don’t have clubs and I’ve never been able to do sports or anything that required travel due to how low income we are, like we literally didn’t get a car until like two years ago. A Lot of my opportunities have been self created because of this. Sometimes this sub makes me feel like I have no chance, but I do think that my circumstances and opportunities will play a part in admissions.

The work was somewhat challenging. My project was constantly behind and I felt I had trouble managing expectations. I was far from a perfect intern. I felt there was so much that I could have done different.

Towards the ending of the internship, I knew with certainty that I would not be getting a return offer. My manager seemed a bit more distant and hands-off (understandably so). During my last week, we had our final performance evaluation meeting, and it went horribly. All of my faults, misteps, and mistakes were highlighted. It was almost as if I produced nothing of value throughout the duration of the summer. I was virtually speechless throughout the meeting. I could barely muster a word. I just felt so awful. All I wanted to do was leave the meeting and go home.

I know it was a learning lesson and all feedback is a gift, but, I can't seem to shake it off. I feel like my confidence is in shambles and I'm not worthy of interning again. I feel so sad for not doing the best I could do and doing a poor job at managing expectations. I just feel so awful.

This was a few weeks ago but I still can't seem to let it go. Recruiting season has already started for Summer 2023 internships and I don't have any offers in-hand (still interviewing with a few places).

xktjgb,1,2022-09-22,"Right person, wrong time?",angm23,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/xktjgb/right_person_wrong_time/,"Hi Reddit, looking for some opinions on my situation.

I met this girl online a few months ago and we clicked instantly, personality wise the chemistry is immaculate and we bonded over playing games and watching shows together for a few nights, staying up until 6am. I really started to like her and everything was fine until she had to go back to college and didn’t even have time to message me some days. I decided to end things because I missed her a lot all the time and unfortunately in my last past relationships I’ve been somehow neglected, so I want someone that can spend time with me and share life with me.

For context, I’m 24 and a college graduate, I work remotely and have time to enjoy my life now that I don’t have to worry about homework etc so I travel and game a lot. On the other hand she’s 20, studying animation and literally is dead busy with homework and internships for college; she’s still missing 2 years to graduate. We live 4 hours away. I thought at first our connection was worth the wait, but I started having a horrible time managing my feelings when she wouldn’t make time to even message me once a day when I couldn’t stop thinking about her. I do know she felt the same connection and she’s legit busy, but I don’t know what to do.

I keep thinking about asking to give this another shot, but I don’t know how to deal with this situation for 2 years. I thought maybe just continue our lives separately and maybe eventually we could try again, but I’m having a hard time feeling this connection with anyone else because I’m clearly not over it. In my mind I thought I’ll focus on work, gym, hobbies, find more friends in meantime but it’s still rough when I can’t get a text everyday. Is it too much to ask? If I do ask her to get back together, what can I ask from her that wouldn’t overwhelm her and how can I keep myself mentally healthy? She also has 2 breaks during year, summer and Christmas so we planned to meet up eventually and I’m sure that’d help. I’m just struggling because in the back of my mind I feel like waiting around for 2 years is a bad decision and feeling like I’m getting old and losing valuable time. 

Any advice is welcome! Thanks for reading this far"
xkvray,2,2022-09-22,Choosing between two offers and influences on my future,HeliosWeb,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/xkvray/choosing_between_two_offers_and_influences_on_my/,"Hi, 

I'm getting my CS degree in October and I'm receiving a few job offers from different companies and would love to get an insight from people with bigger experience to choose the best option for my future.

Before getting my degree I've had to take an internship in a ""university-based"" company (some kind of spin-off for profit) owned by 5-6 PhDs and all the guys working there (15-20ish) look very competent and way more skilled than me. 

Well, I've received an offer from this company for 24K/year for a position as Software Engineer, and an offer for 26k from Deloitte as a Java Fullstack dev. 

These offers are both valid but I have no idea what to do as:

* I'd like to get a Master degree and working in the university (with some teachers) might give me a small advantage for a few exams;
* My aspiration is to work as a Software Engineer;
* I love money and the second company just pays more;
* I believe I can learn way more in a small company, as it works on a lot of great projects and yes sometimes you're working on it alone figuring things out on your own, and my job would be to follow the software in every step of its lifecycle. 
* I believe a ""big name"" on your CV might matter more than your skills and what you've learned to work on, even though I might get stuck on working only on frontend or only in backend with a specific technology for years;

Given the last two points and given that I'm extremely afraid for my future I don't really know what to choose: I'd love to work for a big company but I'd love more to join the corporate world directly with an higher position/experience. 

I understand choosing the first option might mean missing my opportunity to join and work for big companies, while choosing the second option might mean being stuck for years on the same tasks and being condamned to a life of centering divs. (/s)

Anyone has been in a similar situation and can offer me some advice?

Thank you in advance, if you need some more infos i'll be happy to answer!"

Why we have weak students in Nepal.,Good-Feedback-4866,Nepal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/xkz3l0/startup_series_part_5_why_we_have_weak_students/,"This is the continuation of our startup series. please do check the link below for previous parts.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/xkvi7e/startup\_series\_part\_4\_being\_productive\_as\_a\_team/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/xkvi7e/startup_series_part_4_being_productive_as_a_team/)

Why our students are weak in engineering college. Guys don't get me wrong. Nepalese are great in studies and have done remarkable achievements in academics all over the globe. We are talking about how it can be improved.

* some reasons for weak performance of students
* students join college for parental pressure and peer pressure.
* many (not all) Private college are money sucking institute distributing certificates
* No practical education, students write about flipflop, register and transistors in exams and get good marks but they cant even identify flipflop in real life.
* Many students attend the college for the shake of attendance only.
* In Nepal those who can't get into good jobs finally ends in teaching profession so we don't have good quality of faculty.
* **Curiosity is highly disregard here.**
* S**tartup is seen as something a person does who is unable/unqualified for jobs.**
* Failing is boomed, how can we learn if we do not fail. Failling and learning should be encouraged.
* I see people find college/university as an escape of their own laziness, if you’re really passionate about engineering, then colleges don’t hold any barriers on your dreams. Most crazy products are made by droppedouts.
* Foreign is seen best alternatives and sarkari jagir next.
* People are given assignments so that they can think. Its real hard to think and write something in your own words, that only possible after you understand the topic real well. Here people do copy assignment. Our teachers used to give assignment to solve the previous years questions. REALLY?
* There are not any good workplace for students to intern and learn.
* Working culture is really toxic and underpaid. Employers takes employee as a slave.
* We don't have any concept of industries. And it creates lack of employment oppertunity.

&amp;#x200B;

Many people messaged me saying that startup is difficult in Nepal and its better not discussed. I agree startup is really hard in Nepal. Many startup fails and its really capital intensive. I am not advocating that you should stay in this country and not think of leaving (I support people to go, see and find better opportunity, If you find better stay there as well.

I graduated with an IT degree, I did the certs (comptia trifecta), the internships, and the homelabs. I got a job in cyberfraud for a credit card company; it is an offshoot of cybersecurity which was my goal. 

The job is great, and so is my team. But I feel that a career in CS would be more rewarding, both financially and mentally. In fact, my coding classes in college was the hardest but it was also the most rewarding; it was two semesters of Java and 1 of python. I loved the feeling when the code compiled and ran.

Financially: I only make 28.50 an hour. No benefits, no PTO.

I've started doing some leetcode and I created a github account. But I can't help but feel that this isn't enough. Without the option of internships I feel as if I may have missed my chance. I know this isn't 100% true, but I'd like some feedback: if it's not too late to make the switch, what would you recommend I do to start in software development?"

Demographics: White Trans Male living in WV, in a very low income and rural community. We rank super low in everything and I think I want to tie that in based on how it affected me growing up. Super low income (&gt;16k a year) I want to major in government or political science and minor in either sociology or journalism.

ACT: 33 (may take again because my math was a 29. 35 in English and reading and 34 in science)

SAT (not sending) 1350

gpa- currently a 4.14, will be a 4.3 or so whenever I graduate.

Our valedictorian system is really weird and isn’t based off GPA, But I’ll be top 5% at the very least.

CLASSES- my freshman and sophomore years I wasn’t taking very hard classes just because I had a different career part at the time and I wanted to go into digital design and marketing, so I won’t include my classes for those years but I’ll mention I’ve always been one math class ahead of the majority of my grade.

Planned Senior Year APBIO AP HUMAN GEO AP GOPO COMPARATIVE AP LANG AP WORLD There will be more online ones that will be taken during my second semester, our school just recently changed our system so we aren’t sure what ones will be offered. -I want to add our school only offers one more AP not listed and that is AP PSYCH.

———ESSAYS——— Writing is 100% my strong suite, and I’ve had a lot happen to me in my life that that I could 100% tie into my passions. I have my personal statement done as well and it’s been through like 4 people.

——LORS—— (Planned)

APLIT Teacher- We’re super close and I’ve had her write multiple letters for me before for summer programs, QuestBridge, etc. I’ve also excelled in her class because I’m pretty good at Literature and writing, and she’s told me she thinks super highly of me. She knows me well enough that I think the letter would be a 9/10. She’s also the advisor of the newspaper I created.

Gopo teacher- he loves me and also calls me patient all the time bc he struggles with my pronouns. Told me he wants me to do it again and has always praised me as being one of the best students in there. I’m also a strong lead for our teams in that class and have always excelled in competition -7/10

Teacher from GHA - obv can’t be too revealing abt this one but he taught my intensive class at my 3 week program, and I spent well over 3 hrs w him everyday. He’s one of the best people I’ve ever met and the impact we had on one another was huge. He’s also a journalism teacher at his Uni and has a way w words. 9/10

Science Teacher- had her last year for anatomy and this year for AP bio. I also stay w her during my virtual periods. We talk all the time and genuinely just have a rlly rlly great dynamic. 8/10?

Counselor- she doesn’t really like anyone but I will say we are semi-close. I’ve done a few projects w her. I’ve had to keep my bridges mended w her recently bc of incidents at school lol.

——————————— EXTRACURRICULARS/HOBBIES -We The People Competition- super passionate about this one. Goes hand in hand with our GOPO class, and I’ve spent a ton of time and effort on it. Also combines a lot of my interests such as politics and writing.

\-Newspaper Team- Created a school newspaper, head of it. Put my own money forth to create a website in an effort to save paper. Hand picked the team after talking w teachers to see who the strongest writers, editors, etc were. (V important to note that our school doesn’t allow clubs so getting it approved was a pain)

\-Creative Writing- I’ve wrote like 50k words of creative writing at this point lol, it’s just something I do on my free time but it’s a huge interest.

CERT- digital design/social media worked for our community emergency response team. Recently got promoted to manager of my own division

Student council, 11th grade. President this year.

National Honor Society

WVGHA- Governors academy for top like 100 students in the state. My classes have an emphasis on politics and government with some literature on the side. I loved this sm and tied it into my story a lot, I came out the day I got home from GHA. Genuinely life changing.

I’m a QuestBridge prep scholar and won a scholarship for the Stanford Envision Law program.

Yearbook for 4 years. We are technically only allowed to take the class twice, and I only done it once. The summer after my freshman the teacher came to me and asked me to help him finish the yearbook since his last class ditched him as soon as Covid began. I’ve been an advisor/editor ever since.

I want to add that we don’t have clubs and I’ve never been able to do sports or anything that required travel due to how low income we are, like we literally didn’t get a car until like two years ago. A Lot of my opportunities have been self created because of this. Sometimes this sub makes me feel like I have no chance, but I do think that my circumstances and opportunities will play a part in admissions. ——————"

I don't entirely know why I'm writing this, I think it's both in the hopes of feedback and as just a means to dump my self-improvement thoughts into the digital void. A lot of it will be backstory with my current standing closer to the end. This is gonna be a stream-of-consciousness mess so, cheers if you read to the end! 

I go to school in NYC and found a great deal on an apartment (COVID rate!!) nearby campus in 2021. I lived there for a year and a half with two of my good buddies before the market started picking back up and Manhattan properties became unbearably expensive again. After a couple revolving door roommate replacements for our third, my one remaining friend from the original lease and I were screwed at the beginning of the summer. Just as the semester had ended, so had the end of our lease approached, too expensive to renew, and despite our best efforts, we could not snag a good deal on any new places. He's an international student, so we had to act quickly before he had to leave the country to visit home for the summer. At the same time, I was getting turned down from job after job. I took a year off work to focus on my classes and being the Creative Director of my school's team for a national advertising competition which I thought would look great on my resume. Having worked several pretty cool and professional internships in my field during my time in the city, I didn't want to settle for retail or food service (not that there's anything inherently wrong with those, just not for me.) All the while, my girlfriend at the time was working full-time and I could feel the bonds breaking in our already flawed relationship. On top of all this, I was taking a Summer Biology LAB course to try and graduate a semester early. The take-home lab kit was egregiously expensive and the labs themselves were incredibly convoluted and banal, often taking hours a day. 

All this stress plunged me into a hole. I barely left the apartment and spent most of my days smoking weed and playing Apex Legends. I lost my passion and motivation to be someone, I found it so difficult to focus, even on something like reading or editing which I used to love to do. It seemed not to be in the cards for us to continue to live in the city and like the odds were stacked against me. Ultimately, I had to move back home to New Jersey for the summer and live in my older brother's old room. 

Right before that was when we broke up. As mutual as it was, part of me wanted to stay with her for the summer until she went abroad, but I guess the distance just wasn't worth it to her. I was destroyed. I felt trapped in my parent's house and like I wasn't good enough to be loved. I used to be insanely confident, even cocky, when I would go out or talk to new people, but all this shit made my confidence take a huge hit. I lived for the times when I could return to the city. My hometown friends are great, but often times our values, interests, and recreational activities don't align. I tried going sober, but caved and bought some weed with one of my buddies. I still had to do this biology bullshit each week. I got a couple of freelance gigs; editing videos, and making graphics, but those only netted me like $300/mo. I would work out and eat well most mornings, but the rest of the day I dove even further into video games. When I wasn't playing I was spending hours applying for jobs and apartments to no avail. I started going to therapy, but even that felt like a dead-end as his methods weren't super helpful. I got right back onto the dating apps, which I think are stupid, to begin with, but increase in stupidity drastically when you get into the suburban New Jersey dating pool. I was pretty sexually active in the city, especially when I was with my girlfriend, so it was pretty torturous being surrounded by not only dry personalities but also people with zero interest in actually meeting anyone. 

Eventually, the two guys I was going to room with in the city (my international friend from before and our other classmate) bailed on me to go to a student housing building. No animosity toward them, they did what they had to do, but it certainly didn't boost my morale. Just tacked it on to the list of things going wrong and bogging me down. I hit a really low point and spent days lazing around, barely leaving my room. This was a little before halfway through August. After a bit, I had a couple of apartment leads, looking with someone else from my school, but I still felt like I was kind of screwed for my last ever college semester. I simply would not and could not commute from Jersey. It felt like some higher power did not want me to be happy. That's when someone came back into my life. 

For context, I'm gonna call her L. I had met L in the heat of quarantine 2020 and right away knew that she was someone special. I liked her so much and so fast too. Back then, I confessed my feelings for her shortly after we began hanging out, but she was already ""talking"" to someone. He lived hours away and I told her she should bail on him for me because we had something and I was actually here with her in real life now. She said she couldn't and we went our separate ways, she goes to school in another state. Flash forward to 2021, I'm living in NYC over the summer and she's interning there. We get dinner a couple of times and it picks up right where we left off as friends. Our chemistry is still palpable. She tells me how much she's discovered a love for a lot of the same movies I do and my feelings for her come back even stronger, but the semester rolls around and she went back to school. Go even further in the future to when I'm in my aforementioned depression cave at my mom's house. She finds her way back into my life. We go on a couple more dates and then she invites me over one night. I make a move and she reciprocates. FINALLY! We start talking all the time, being affectionate, and it seems like everything is perfect. Then reality rears its ugly head. We're both going back to school and neither of us wants to start a relationship long distance, so we say goodbye again. As sad as I was, somehow being with her then was just what I needed. She reminded me I was capable of being loved by someone and I was soon ready to get back to my old confident self.

During all this, luck was also coming to me regarding the apartment search. A vacancy opened up in a two-unit building right above an apartment a group of my other friends was living in. After an arduous process with a less-than-helpful broker, we snatched it up and were slotted to move in by the beginning of September! Prior to us moving in, I had begun talking to a girl from NYU. We confided in each other emotionally, complimented one another, spoke affectionately, and so it seemed like something would unfold romantically between us when we both returned to the city. She came back a lot earlier than I did, close to the end of August, about three or four days before my 21st birthday. By complete chance, she ends up at the bar at which one of my best friends and soon-to-be downstairs neighbor works. ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world..."" He tells me he's ""stolen her from me."" I laugh but don't let on that she and I had anything going on, I don't wanna seem jealous. How can I be? She wasn't ""mine to steal."" I tell her if she likes me and wants anything to unfold between us when I get back, she won't do anything stupid. She tells me I have nothing to worry about and lo and behold two days later, the day before my birthday, I get a selfie of the two of them together the ""morning after."" Of course, I'm pissed. More at her than him, she had told him nothing was going on between us, a lie. Then I tell him the situation and rather than support me as one of my best friends of three years, he goes to her defense and argues with me (thinking with his brain, and I don't mean the one on his shoulders.) Not only did this cause a huge rift in our friendship, but knocked my confidence right back down multiple pegs. I tell him I'm not arguing anymore and would love to just come in to celebrate my 21st with no drama or anger. He agrees, I see him the next night and we've never addressed it.

Now that the backstory is fleshed out, let's get to the present day. I've lived in the apartment for about a month now. I've been pretty good about not smoking weed, only partaking socially. I've completely uninstalled all my video games. I've taken breaks from most social media and have been a lot more productive. Working out every morning, reading a lot more, applying to a shit ton of jobs. My biggest problem is, I feel like I'm not working hard enough. New York is a constant competition. I'm still unemployed and spending whatever money I've got saved up extremely frugally. I rarely go out, but when I do, I return home sad and regretful at the end of the night that I wasn't as extroverted or charismatic as I might have been a year or two ago. I feel like I used to be attractive, not even in a physical sense, but in a metaphorical sense. Like people would want to meet me or even get romantically involved with me. Now I feel like there's something inherently wrong with me. Like I'm not the man I entirely want to be and I feel like those around me can almost smell that. It's a constant battle. Some days, I feel disciplined and motivated to get shit done. On other days (like today) I can barely get out of bed until noon, I feel so many negative emotions welling up inside me, so I try and tune them out with procrastination of the things I know I have to do. I try to meditate, practice gratitude and reframe, but sometimes it becomes too much to bear. I constantly compare myself to others who are seemingly doing better than me. I think a big part of my struggle comes from the fact that I'm still finding my individuality, I don't really fully know what kind of man I am, but right now it's definitely not the kind I want to be. I just need to assert to myself that I will be better. I will arrive at happiness, I will be fulfilled and I will get my passion and my confidence back.

In all honesty, writing this out has felt really cathartic and I'm sure I'll reread and revisit it intermittently when I'm feeling down. Thanks if you've read this far. Any constructive feedback is totally welcome, but you can fuck right off if you're gonna be a dick about anything. 

Stay strong. Heads up kings/queens.

I just recently received an interview for a quantitative analytics internship at JP Morgan in the form of a coding challenge. 

Some background about me, I'm a business analytics major that just got into coding this year. I only have formal education for statistical modeling and machine learning in R, and transferred that knowledge into python. I would say I have a fairly basic knowledge of coding basics in Python, but a more in depth knowledge in the realm of machine learning. 

I am wondering what I should do to prepare for this challenge and would like to have it done in a week or so at the very latest. Has anyone gone through this challenge and have any tips? Let me know if you need any more info, Thanks."
xlb1fr,3,2022-09-22,Feel like a failure for being easily stressed and overwhelmed,pussycatvent,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/xlb1fr/feel_like_a_failure_for_being_easily_stressed_and/,"*Extremely* long rant ahead, so Tldr: I feel like a failure for being unable to handle many stressful situations at once. My internship has changed to where I'm being given a few more responsibilities than I signed up for (due to the lead intern quitting) which is starting to make me dread the rest of my internship, which is meant to last the entire school year. I had dealt with a simular situation before with a club I really enjoyed, but couldn't handle the leadership duties (which was meant to be shared by two people, but one person quit before I did). A much lower stakes situation, but in a sense makes me feel worse that I couldn't even handle that.

Starting rant:

Currently in my senior year, so you'd think I would've gotten better at dealing with this by now. But it seems no matter how hard I try, I'll always eventually become overwhelmed if I have any more than 2 important responsibilities going on at once.

For context, I got an internship with my school that will last the whole school year. It's also paid, which is definitely a bonus, even if the pay is pretty average and I only get 2-3 hours of paid time in the week. Which definitely sounds easy (and kinda was), but the big issue that has come up is that the lead intern for my internship group recently quit. Our team was small enough to begin with (was 3 people, down to two), but now a few of their old responsibilities have been passed down to me.

I'm already starting to feel the dread because I keep comparing this situation to where I had joined a club as a co-leader during my junior year. I had been a member of the club since freshman year, but it got hit pretty bad once Covid took away 1 1/2 years of campus life from everyone. I came back as a junior wanting to join the e-board, which I accomplished.

However, like I previously mentioned, I had applied to be a *co*-leader, which meant I had another person to rely on. But a few weeks into the semester, my co-leader quit, thus thrusting me into this sole position of leadership. I felt extremely unprepared, and although I still recieved advice from the former co-leader and faculty member of the club, I was obviously not suited for the position and the other members sensed it. I definitely didn't blame the other co-leader for quitting at all, but it became so stressful I cried once thinking about how I was bringing the club down. I decided to quit as well, and as of this year the club is no longer active.

In a way I feel like I was the final nail of the coffin, even though the club had been on the brink of collapse due to Covid before me. The faculty member of our club, who I really looked up to, had reached out last summer to see if I'd wanna return at all. I told them that while I still felt that I couldn't handle being on the e-board, I was happy to hear from them and would try to ask around for a replacement. They never responded, so safe to say that I burned that bridge by being a disappointment, and I still feel guilt about that. 

Back to the present, as mentioned before, until somebody else is hired to fill the position I'm now ""technically"" the lead intern. Which means I have to attend an extra 1-2 meetings in the week, and also do more event planning work. Despite this, I'm still getting paid as a regular intern because I told them I definitely did not want to step up into the position. But between me and my other fellow intern, I'm the one with less on my plate so I would be even more lazy to *not* do it.

But with this, classes, and working every weekend, I'm slowly getting more anxious by the day. I still don't want quit this internship, because even though it's not directly related to my major (Graphic Design), in my college town internships for that are barren and I wanted at least *something* before I graduate. It's a STEM-related internship which is close enough, but if they're unable to find a replacement for the lead, I worry that I'm going to be forced to either offically take the position or quit. I thought about taking it, but even doing half of the responsibilies is already stressing me out.

I'm just frustrated with myself, because even now I've become forced to be a leader when I simply just wanted to do what I signed up for. I'm not a lazy person, but I'm still far less ambitious and driven than some of my peers and friends, and I start getting depressed at the thought of letting people down. It happened before, don't want it to happen again, but at this point it seems inevitable."

I’m a senior at Ohio State about to graduate in December with a BS CSE. I’ve wanted to live in New York City for essentially all my life and it really feels like NYC or bust for me when I finish up in December (I know it’s not really NYC or bust but…)

I have a solid GPA, a few decent relevant projects, and I’m currently an intern at a fairly small company in Ohio doing Python and ML work. A lot of my elective coursework has been in the data science / ML realm, and I enjoy python a lot, but I also like Java and have a lot of experience with it in coursework.

The big problems are that I have a pretty bad anxiety disorder, and this obviously doesn’t bode well for smooth interviews. I’m also pretty bad at LeetCode, it just doesn’t click with me even though I feel like I understand data structures pretty well.

Basically, is it possible for someone like me to get an okay job in NYC after graduating, or do I really have to go crazy on Leetcode for the next few months while/before I start applying?

Thank you all, I’m grateful for your advice."

**Letters of Recommendation**

My counselor loves me, I had him for my advisory (weekly meetings with a group of students and a teacher advisor) and he always  used me as an example and loves my ambition and positivity. 9/10

My AP bio teacher, who I am interning for and knows me well to be a smart, hard working student. Not sure what she’d have to say about my personality though tbh 7/10

My AP Lit teacher really likes me I believe. He was always impressed by my writing and used my personal statement (most of the class were seniors so the common app essay was an assignment for us) as an example for other classes. I got very personal in my journal entries in his class and I felt very grateful for his responses and feel he knows me well because of that. 8/10

**Essays**

I love creative writing and am very good at writing and talking about myself so I think this part is strong.

Personal Statement: It is very unique, everyone who has read it has loved my topic and perspective. It is about ants, starting off with a story line of walking past ants on a sidewalk, and goes into my hobby of ant-keeping and has a good deeper message about how it has affected my values and who I am.

Supplementals: working on them, going well, topics include medical illustration (left brain + right brain thinking) as well as my perspective on medical accessibility in the Hispanic community as a hispanic with a physician as a father, giving me medical access and knowledge others in my community don’t have. Only written 2 so far.

**Schools (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

* Tulane (EA and Posse Scholarship process)
* Case Western (EA and Posse)
* UMich (EA)
* Harvard (RD)
* Brown (RD)
* UChicago (EA)
* University of Washington (EA)
* College of Charleston (RD)
* Emory (EA)
* Texas A&amp;M (Posse)
* Yale (RD)
* Stanford (RD)
* UCLA (RD)

**Additional Information:**

I have a LOT of shadowing and medical program experience, including scrubbing in for surgery and working as a nurse assistant. Hopefully colleges like that.

I just added T20 schools to my list, tbh I was very intimidated and unconfident as I compare myself to others but I am a very genuine and open person and I think if a few colleges click with my personality I have a good shot? Tulane has been my top choice for a while though and I’ll most likely attend if I get good scholarship money (fingers crossed for Posse). Thanks so much y’all."

Last week, I had about half an hour to myself every night after finishing homework before I needed to go to sleep. Not having that time to myself to recharge was really draining and I was absolutely miserable. My mental health has taken really bad dips in the past when I was stressed and overwhelmed by my classes, so I got really scared when I felt those feelings starting to come back. 

I emailed my counselor and asked to change some of my classes. I changed my AP math for a different easier AP math (I have to take an AP math) and changed my AP Lit class to English 12. She said that they would be changed, and I had my first day today in those two new classes. 

And here’s where I fucked up. I think I’m going to hate my Eng 12 class (not because of the difficulty, rather because I know absolutely no one, I feel like an outsider, and other stuff). 
Also, my counselor emailed me today saying that my request to change AP math classes had been denied by the math department chair, and that she was bothered that I asked her to change that class after being told no by the dept chair (I had sent him an email but never got a “no, you can’t do this” response). I don’t know what that means for my AP Lit class, since I also didn’t get a straight answer from the English department chair. 

At this point, I’m really stressed and don’t know what to do. My homework this week wasn’t nearly as bad as last week, it was actually enough for me to handle with minimal problems, but I don’t know if this will be the normal workload or if it will be like last week. If this week is the normal workload, then I wouldn’t mind staying in those classes. If the normal is like last week, then I need to do something. 

I don’t know what kind of advice anyone can offer me. This might just be more of a rant. I just don’t know what my best option is and my counselor isn’t very helpful to me. I want to have an enjoyable senior year that isn’t made miserable by my classes and homework."

Hello everyone and I hope everyone is doing well! 
Firstly I would like to thank this community for helping me find kind strangers who have helped me out with all my queries and doubts, thank you so much! 

Since application deadlines are here, I would like to get some opinion or advice on my profile and if I do stand a chance at my programs. 

Colleges applying to: U Chicago Harris (top and ultimate choice), Georgetown. 
I know the list is too short, but I haven't found any other policy school that aligns with my interests in Development, International policy and Security Policy. I was looking at Goldman, but the emphasis on Full Time Work experience scares me. 
If need be, I'll apply for Sciences Po and Hertie, in Dec-Jan. 

Profile: Undergraduate degree in Political Science with specialisation in International Relations

(International student) 

GPA: 9.89/10 Major and overall GPA (we didn't have any minors) Tier 1 university in India

Test Scores: will take GRE in October. So far aiming and based on practice scores 161/163 Q and V. Need to up this, because I didn't have any Quant background, none in math, stats or Econ in my university. I don't know how much this will stump my chances but based on a few admissions webinars, a few courses does help. So I'm in the process of completing a few in stats and econ. 

Work Experience: Alot of internships, a few at youth based think tanks, one at the Government of India's Human Rights Commission, a few at policy research think tanks and 4 month (+continuing) RA under one faculty professor. 
All internships hace taught me skills in Policy Analysis, Data management, Policy Research and has helped decide my interests both in Public Policy and the specialisation. 

Volunteering: mostly remote at NGOs and currently teaching underprivileged children at another NGO and mentoring two high school students (not remote) 

Leadership: Was the Class representative of my cohort for 2+ years and under that organised a set of seminars with Diplomats, Foreign representatives from Embassy's and professors. The aim was to make education more holistic especially for the students who missed it during the Pandemic. It also was aimed to give them better opportunities to learn and network.
Also did a few other projects aimed towards inclusivity and Gender sensitivity ( I was the member of the Gender sensitivity committee and the Placement cell, for the latter I did regular tasks) 

I organised our Departments flagship conclave with 90+ students and led them as the convenor. Again, seminars and workshops with a lot of renowned pedagogues. 

Also I was a part of a few clubs and did hold a few leadership positions. 

LORs: 3 from faculty with whom I worked closely with. One with whom I currently RA under, one who I have taken 4 classes with since First year and the other from my Department head under whom I organised all seminars, conclave and worked for a UNICEF project by handling a few administrative tasks. 

Papers: 2 papers (1 under review, 1 in progress), 1 presented at a conference
All papers focus on Political economy, Development and Global security. Adhering to my interests. 

I'm going to apply this Fall'23, and I will be out of my undergrad by an year (I graduated this year). 

I am not sure if my profile is good enough for the schools, and good enough to get any funding, if at all. 
I'm very anxious and thought of asking help, yet again, from this community. 

Any advice will, as always, be greatly appreciated. 

P. S: will my lack of quant experience be a red flag? Will this result ina really high learning curve? I know US policy schools give alot of emphasis on Quant, which I really am looking for because I never got the opportunity to venture my interests in Economics and Stats as an Undergraduate in India. 

Thank you so much!"

Good day. I was curious on advice on for moving away from T1 HelpDesk.  

I current have worked as a Lvl 1 HelpDesk for a little over 5 yrs; 4+ years with a part time internship (don't ask) and 10 months as a full time contract worker. Currently $20USD an hour and honestly struggling to get by. The prospects for a raise after a year also aren't looking good since it is a contract position. So I'm looking for a new job. Someone in an fb mentioned looking for a specialty (like cloud or security). Someone else mentioned go for cloud specifically.  It peaked my interest so I'm currently researching about it. 

I wanted to ask advice about it from others that went through the process. I currently have a bachelor's in computer engineering technology and no certs, so I know what's er direction, I'd need certs. With this job, I get Udemy business for free so I can get cert prep courses. 

Of course other advice is definitely welcomed. I know that I'm getting tired of being 1st contact/call center style work and looking for direction. One thing I know I wouldn't want is Network Admin, didn't do great in the Networking classes at school (which was basically a CCNA class) and didn't have much interest. Something I was also looking into was inventory/asset management. 
Thank you in advance for any insight. I'm honestly lost."

Context: I'm applying to some competitive CS internships for summer 2023. I'll be up against junior/senior undergrads.

My main concerns:

1. Should I remove ""relevant courses"" since I haven't taken many CS courses yet? (it's my second year, but I'm a junior by credits)
2. Should I bold some keywords (PyTorch, Monte Carlo analyses, parallel computing, computer cluster, Linux CLI, Ubuntu)?
3. Is it worth shortening skills and squeezing in a ""Personal Projects"" section for more ML/data science stuff?

So, I joined college here in my country. And planned I will improve myself here, through whatever medium I can, and will reapply abroad for postgrad. I don't have any skills except technical ones. I am only good with computers; I never did sports or any ECs. So, the only thing I could do during 4 years of undergrad was to get an internship or job as soon as possible. So, I got a job just a few months before my freshman year started.

A few months ago, I left my previous job and joined another. My job was to build the ecomm platform for a computer hardware distributor. It has been 5 months and 90% of the project is done. A month back I proposed about branching the business to software/web development service as well. The owner agreed, and we hired 3 more people to team. so now we have a startup, and I'm kind of the owner of the startup. 

The dilemma here is I wanted a simple job and I ended up founding a startup, and I don't want to stay in this country.

Also, in the middle of my freshman year, I got interested in data science. It was more of a desire, as it is trendy and cool. But I like/love (don't know which one) what I do as a full stacker. It's a mess, but I like/love this mess. I wanted to switch to data science also because I don't see growth as a full stacker. I don't know what I will do in this role. 

One more thing, FOMO hits me really bad. I see people doing this and that, and excelling and achieving in those fields, FOMO hits me, and I end up having desires to be like that person or be in that field."

Hello Reddit!

As I'm trying to research more info on the colleges I'm applying to, I think Reddit would be a fun and useful resource to discuss individual schools.

Each day I'll drop a name, include my quick thoughts on the school, and you can respond with your thoughts in the comments.

Hopefully, this will help everyone with their supplements and tailoring their whole applications!

**Today's Discussion: University of Southern California**

Some measurables for context:

ACT - 30-34

SAT - 1340-1530

Around 21000 undergrads

***What to like about USC***

\-  Very strong alumni network, lots of pull in California, major companies are all recruiting at USC

\- Very solid academic private school (student to faculty ratio), but also has a bigger student body than typical elite private universities

\- a lot of events and activities going on, comes with having more ppl

\- Opportunities are endless if you take action

\- proximity to LA and other stuff

\- can have good fin- aid also TONS of scholarships especially MERIT

\-School Spirit, how many other t20s does this apply to

***Concerns with USC***

\- Price, very expensive

\- bad area

\- has bad rep within a2c bc of varsity blues and ""rich kids"" but I think that's just a2c bc every top private will have rich kids

***Extra thoughts***

I don't think the Trojan Family can be emphasized enough. Freshmen are getting solid internships. Almost everything I have read has mentioned how helpful it is. 

Secondly, interdisciplinary and exploration. The rep strongly repeated how you can switch from practically anything to anything (besides the more selective stuff like dance or film). She also talked about how they do have a core curriculum that really allows you to stretch yourself. You work with people outside your major which is nice (IMO). Also there are some solid study abroad opportunities. Exploring is encouraged.

Fit. If there was one thing I took away from the meeting was that USC values fit (in their essays and stuff). They don't care about you talking about their great \_\_\_\_ program and its high ranking. They want students who would fit in. The work hard play hard is USC. Tons of school spirit, but also tons of ways to be academically involved and challenged. 

***Personal Thoughts***

Before I attended the college rep visit I think I had a very a2c representative mentality. I was really only applying cuz it was a solid school, and the scholarship benefits would be great. By no means was it a top choice, but the rep really sold me on what they value. 

I encourage everyone reading to not label schools because of certain stereotypes of the student body. Especially at all the top universities, you are going to find your fair share of ""super wealthy kids"". Do you really think they just don't exist in places like Brown or Uchicago. PPl seem to think that everyone at USC is gonna be whipping a benz. 

Like being honest, does varsity blues really affect you?

It seems that ppl either hate USC for the wrong reasons, or the cost/location/ or vibes (obviously a Williams kid is different from a USC kid). Otherwise, USC is well liked by  others.

After the visit, I realized I really like USC

**Admissions stuff: (personal)**

**-** FIT - **how do you fit in with the culture**

**- fit** again because it was apparent how important it was 

&amp;#x200B;

Drop your thoughts on USC below and let's come together as a community to have a discussion about the school!

xlqv6u,0,2022-09-23,My mother claimed all of my father’s unpaid child support money for herself. Do I have a legal right to that money?,PizzaCat625,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/xlqv6u/my_mother_claimed_all_of_my_fathers_unpaid_child/,"I’d preface this with my US state but I’m not sure if this would fall under the state of Iowa or the state of Illinois. The child support case/agreement was opened in Iowa, and I don’t have all the details on how much my father was legally obligated to pay, but I do know that he was responsible for monthly payments, plus health insurance coverage for me up until a certain age. After I turned 18, however, he still owed near a grand total of $40k-$50k in unpaid child support, and he definitely never paid for my insurance coverage. The part where this gets confusing is that my mother and I both currently live in the state of Illinois. So, I’m not sure if I should discuss this with an Iowa attorney or an Illinois attorney.

As for my mother claiming the money, that story begins with a Facebook message from my father stating he was in a terrible car accident, was legally declared dead but then was resuscitated (???), and is now receiving a large settlement from the other driver’s insurance company. He was in a fit because his attorney said the state of Iowa would be taking a much larger chunk than he wanted out of that settlement as his payment for all missed child support for all 18 years of my life, and he wanted me to rationalize with my mother to “call them off” as if she had the capacity or even the compassion to do that for him.

She, understandably, doubles down and hires her own attorney and that attorney tells her to fight for EVEN MORE money than he owed to begin with. This began to spark arguments between us because I felt like I was at least a little bit entitled to receive some of that money, and she 100% disagreed and said she would be taking all of it. I dropped contact with her completely after a while, for a plethora of other reasons as well as these constant arguments over how the money should be distributed.

I never heard from my dad about the settlement again, and he is known for being a compulsive liar, so I think we all assumed nothing would come of it and no one would ever see a dime. Almost two years later (this spring 2022), I’m visiting family back home in Iowa and my cousin tells me my mom bought a brand new $40,000 car with the child support money and she just thought I should know.

My mother is on disability, but she lives in a new construction high rise apartment that costs $3k a month, gets around $20k every semester in financial aid as she pursues a PhD, and is now driving around in a brand new $40k car to her internship and back again every week. We were low income my whole life, and I am still living in a low income situation, and if she had just gotten a $30k car instead of a $40k car I could have finished getting my associates degree. I’ve unfortunately had to drop out due to a lack of financial aid coverage and the inability to pay for classes out of pocket. Classes that were only $1k to $2k in total a semester for a two year program.

I just want to know if I have any legal claim to that money, regardless of whether or not it has already been spent. Does this become a lawsuit against my mother? The state of Iowa? My dad even? I feel so beat down and honestly undervalued by my entire family, especially my own parents. I’ve just had enough and want to fight to have the opportunities my parents never gave me. (Sorry if I’m getting too emotional, but this has been an uphill battle that started literally the day I was born and it *really does hurt*)"

Were you a software developer first and then became a data engineer ?

Now i couldnt land my job as a data scientist here in india due to some bad reputation and companies needed an experienced data scientist , nor was i able to land an internship . 
So i decided to become a data analyst and what i can see is companys in india are not even hiring a data analyst as a fresher . 
After that i became a power bi analyst and no fresher job for a power bi analyst aswell here in india .
So i am now finishing off my ibms data engineering certification . 

Can anyone advice me how do i land a job in the data science field ? 

My concern is since data engineers work closely with developers i fear i might need to study or become some type of developer after finishing off my data engineering . 

Any software developer or data engineers here ? 
Some guidance would be appreciated . 
Also how much time will it take if none of this is a concern and its about my reputation ?   

A great man said "" Work is the price you get paid for your reputation "" . 
And i believe that quote .

&amp;#x200B;

Sunt o persoană foarte pasionată de domeniul securitate cibernetică, linux, scripting, networking, etc. Ideea este că nu prea vă niciun internship pe nișa asta. La mine în oraș cel puțin absolut deloc, iar prin orașele mari văd totuși destul de puține oportunități pe LinkedIn.

&amp;#x200B;

   Acum, eu vreau să fac ceea ce îmi place, sunt bun și ca programator. Știu python, structuri de date, algoritmi, la problemele de pe leetcode nu am probleme, dar înclin mai mult spre partea de securitate. Sunt la o facultate de Automatică, și aici nici nu prea se face mai nimic legat de securitate(cel puțin la mine la facultate, nu știu cum o fi la o facultate de Automatică din București de exemplu), așa că am început să învăț singur de pe toate site-urile posibile, toate resursele pe care le-am putut găsi etc.

&amp;#x200B;

  Oportunități ca software engineer sau developer găsești pe oriunde și din abundență, și nu înțeleg cum un domeniu atât de important ca securitatea cibernetică nu oferă aceleași posturi. Mă gândeam să îmi găsesc mai întâi ceva ca SWE, un internship ceva, și după ce mai câștig experiență să mă mut security analyst sau ceva.

&amp;#x200B;

   Pentru că oricât de mult mi-ar plăcea domeniul ăsta, nu vreau să stau să rabd de foame până li se face unora milă să mă angajeze, așa că există și opțiunea asta să fac vreun internship sau vreun post de juniori ca SWE.

   Dar vreau să știu și părerea voastră și sunt curios dacă aveți ceva sfaturi pentru mine. Poate sunt oameni pe aici care lucrează în cyber, sunt curios voi cum ați reușit.

   Mulțumesc anticipat!"

As a child and teenager I was almost unable to look my teachers in the eye and unfortunately with other people my age.

At university I always tried to relate to more people, but I never succeeded, I did not make any friends in all those years, and even classmates for work or internships, my communication was very poor.

I had a really bad time when I went to class and was surrounded by people. Sometimes even with tachycardia, breathing problems or shortness of breath. Only medication helped me, with all the side effects that came with it.

When I joined the world of work... it was no better. Day by day, the situation did not improve, it worsened. I just wished for the days when I could have a workload to do on my own, put on some headphones, and not hear the rest of the world forget about me.

Even now, with remote work, I'm anxious about being called on Teams calls, or even nervous about missing a Teams message notification.

At 35 years old, I've been fighting my own head... and the worst thing is not that it hasn't improved. It's just that I've gotten a lot worse, being on the verge of not wanting to leave the house.

With this I know that I repeat myself a lot, and it's silly to say it, but it doesn't get out of my head. That's not fair. It's not fair to have to live like this.

This is an apartment in a student complex with a common fire alarm system. I was not renting the apartment directly from the landlord, but from the people who are renting it from the landlord because their daughter was off for an internship. Now they found a new tenant instead of me because I'm moving out. 

 So, in these 6 months some shit happened and I have to figure out how to deal with this asap for two reasons 1) the new tenant moves in right after me and no one will have time to deal with this shit, 2) The guy I'm renting the apartment from promised to give me my deposit back right after I hand in my apartment if everything is fine, which I want back asap


The two shots that happened:

1) one of the postbox kesy broke. They gave me a set of keys - one for the apartment (the other one the landlord has) and TWO for the postbox. I don't know what happened, but one key is now missing a part, it just fell off at some point I guess. What should I do? Should I just go and make a copy before I hand in the apartment?

2) at some point in July, the fire alarm in my apartment started to go off without a reason. It had the worst sound ever and it would go off during the day and then in the middle of the night. After it started to go off every couple of hours and woke me up in the middle of the night once (and caused me a panic attack) I called the company and they instructed me how to turn it off forever. Problem is that it doesn't work anymore and needs to be replaced, which they(back in July) promised to do in 2 weeks time. I contacted the company and the hausmeister (not the landlord and not the guy I'm renting from) so they know the problem. No one came to replace it. I recently emailed them again and they said that the company had a cyber attack or whatever and they'll contact me, but radio silence. So there's no smoke alarm in my apartment. Is it my problem to fix? I didn't break the alarm, it got broken and no one fixed it yet. Who will pay for the replacement when the time comes? Should it be me, or the landlord, or the hausmeister?

What's the right way to deal with these two problems?"
xluko4,1864,2022-09-23,"My uncle called it ""The Witness"", and now, so do I.",deathbyproxy,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xluko4/my_uncle_called_it_the_witness_and_now_so_do_i/,"When I was a little girl, my parents weren’t what you’d call “happy” in their marriage, so I ended up spending a lot of time with my uncle. Whenever it looked like a fight was brewing, my Uncle Noah would sweep in and take me for a week or two while hurricanes Jack and Twila threw down. It spared me a lot of the stress most kids suffer in a breaking and broken home; I got to skip the fights and still come back for the reparations. Many an ice cream dinner and surprise game system came from this fractured dynamic, and it wasn’t until much later that I realized how unhealthy my family was.

And that was only *after* Uncle Noah disappeared.

Uncle Noah was a collector. He had the usual obsessions like art and artifacts, but he had limited the scope of his interests to the occult, which made his collection especially intriguing to a child raised on Tales from the Crypt and Goosebumps.

He had *athames* with intricate hilts displayed behind leaded glass; a deck of tarot cards locked in an airtight and bulletproof case; a crystal goblet nestled in a case of Bristol Blue glass filled with argon; and countless books—in piles, on shelves, and locked up in iron-banded chests. It was a mystical paradise.

Every time I’d visit he’d have a new piece for the collection and a story to go with it.

“This is a portrait of Mother Shipton,” he’d said of a painting he’d acquired when I was ten. “A clairvoyant from the 16th century. It’s the only known portrait of her to exist in the world.” I’d recoiled from the exquisitely disfigured woman detailed on the canvas, but listened with rapt attention as he’d recounted what he knew of her life and prophecies.

His house was filled with glass cases, locked shelves, and curio cabinets packed full of arcane objects and the tales to go with them.

The only case he never filled before his disappearance was the one he had reserved for what he called his “white whale”.

“This is for The Witness,” he’d said, gazing into the brightly lit interior of a tall glass box. He’d built it in the middle of the library. I caught him staring at the case on many occasions, his eyes distant, as if imagining the piece he would one day display inside was already gazing back at him.

Because that was what the Witness did, he’d said. It watched the world as great events unfolded. “Great” being vastly subjective and somewhat misleading from a human perspective. The Witness, he’d said, only seemed to appear when “our plane intersected the path of something ‘greater’, which would briefly flicker into our experience just long enough to destroy everything in its way.”

The Witness observed. My uncle knew not by what forces, or why, only that it did, and that it appeared to do so from a fixed location. He believed if he could just gather enough data regarding the nature of the Witness’ intersections, he could reproduce the conditions and create a sort of “window” around it. And that was the box; his unfinished “window”.

Unfortunately, it would remain just that; unfinished.

He disappeared one cold, rainy night in November. It seemed he’d chased one too many fringe cults into the wilds, and much like Ahab before him, he vanished. In a mythical Roanoke-style mass exodus from a condemned church outside Merlin, Oregon, he had reportedly wandered into the forests and never returned.

I never saw my uncle or his collection again.

I spent a good deal of time making calls and pushing for the case to be reopened, but it went cold fast. After that, his estate went to his estranged wife. It would have been mine, my parents later informed me, had they not absolutely insisted he leave my name out of his will. As a result, piece by piece, his collection was dismantled and sold off to the highest bidders.

All I had left of him was an old silver pendant he told me would keep us connected, no matter the distance, and a collection of non-occult books he’d gifted to me over time. At ten, I believed the pendant was as magical as anything else in his collection. At twenty, it was harder to believe, but having it gave me comfort. Especially once his estate was gone.

I left home a short while later. I was off to college, and when that was done I had an internship waiting for me in Portland. I didn’t stick around to feel the effects of my parents and their slow descent into madness or divorce. I got birthday calls from them, separately, and if I came home for Christmas, I spent more time with friends than family. My uncle had been the only family that mattered, and with him gone it seemed like there was little point in pretending. A reality my parents never tried to contest.

After college, when I had quiet moments to myself again, I thought of him. He was with me whenever I picked up a new book about the supernatural, or stopped by an antique mall to browse. It was silly, but I always hoped maybe some piece of his collection would resurface. I knew nothing would—I knew everything had gone to private collectors like him and that no collector in their right mind would part with anything they’d managed to get ahold of—but the act of looking, of feeling like the next stall over might have some familiar artifact of occult significance, helped fill the void he left behind. All it would take was an afternoon trailing my fingers over countless mixed antiques—the silver pendant warm beneath my other hand—and I could feel him with me again, his memory lingering in my mind like an oversized hug.

And I’d give the silver pendant a little squeeze, like I was hugging him back.

After that, I’d spend the rest of the day in a hazy afterglow of bittersweet nostalgia nestled in a bed of inner peace.

I was caught in one such haze, curled up on the couch with a brand new book of paranormal essays my uncle would have loved, when I realized I was being watched.

I don’t know when it happened—I saw no movement, heard no sound. I just … *became aware* of him crouching in the corner behind the old black-iron wood stove in the corner, his head resting against the rough stone surround at an uncomfortable angle.

And he watched me. With vacant, lidless eyes far too big for his pallid face.

“He”, I say, though I have no way of knowing. *It* looked humanoid in the vaguest possible sense—all his proportions were wrong; his head was too round, his torso too long. His fingers, which sprouted from a hand the size of a platter, curled delicately over one narrow shoulder, looking for all the world like the legs of an enormous, sickly spider lazily basking in the light. He was too blunt and strangely angular to be much of anything definably human, but saying “he”, even to myself, was more comforting than either “it” or, somehow, “she”.

He sat opposite me, silent and unmoving. And thin—thinner than a man ought to be—with skin sallow and bleached. The waxen flesh, stretched tight across his wiry frame, was the color of missing teeth and old, broken bones. Only the papery thin rattle of his own shallow breathing told me he was anything close to “alive”.

He was just as my uncle had described him.

The seconds ticked between us, counted by the old grandmother clock on the wall, and he did not move. Minutes came and went in silence. Then, all at once, he let out a tremendous wheeze, startling me as his whole body shuddered and drew inward as if he were on the verge of imploding. I waited, tense and horrified, for the wet crunch of snapping bone, but it never came. Instead, he slowly relaxed back into his former position, his eyes never straying from mine.

Nor mine from his. I was as much frozen by curiosity as I was genuine terror. If this *was* my uncle’s “white whale”, then I was in the greatest and most existential danger of my entire life. If it wasn’t … then I had no clue what I was facing, and that was just as overwhelming to contemplate as whatever he might have been there to witness.

Something about him struck me as familiar, though. Maybe it was because Uncle Noah had spent so much time regaling me with stories of the creature, filling my mind with so much information that I couldn’t help but feel as if I knew him on a deeply personal level. I don’t know. But whatever it was, in the hours we spent locked in each other’s gaze, I felt a bizarre surge of unexpected affection for him. Something in his protruding eyes sparked it within me. And though my anxiety never diminished, I fought the urge to run into his spindly arms and never let go.

And maybe I imagined it—maybe I wanted it to be true so I dressed the memory up to suit my desires—but I thought for a moment his hand had shifted, as if resisting the urge to reach out to me, too.

Night descended and only the wan light of a table lamp continued to illuminate the two of us, throwing the jagged contours of his face into sinister relief. Some primal instinct screamed at me to flee, igniting my nerves as shadows crept outside my window, darkening the living room around us.

The floorboards shifted behind me.

For the first time since I’d noticed him, his gaze left mine, settling on a point somewhere behind my right shoulder.

I lived alone. No pets. No lovers. No guests beyond the Witness curled behind my stove.

But we were not alone.

In the thundering silence that followed, he finally spoke.

My uncle never mentioned him speaking, or even being capable of speech. And if he was at all capable, then it didn’t sound like it was natural. His voice came out like a swollen window forced to open against its will, offering me just one word, just one warning:

*Run.*

So I did."

I've been at a company for 2 years going on 3 as an Intern. They asked me to stay on twice to train new interns and continue on there. I started in Highschool and now in my Sophomore year in college and 19F. The 2 new interns are Seniors in highschool. 

At the start my onsight supervisor ""D"" told me he would be more involved with training this year and I would basically not be training and just supporting. This ended up not being true and he was involved the 1st 3 days for a short time (about an hour). I ended up teaching them everything. 

They aren't confident in the software /what to prioritize yet for tasks so I send them tasks (1-2) they need to prioritize each day and then they can do whatever else is in their queue. Sometimes the tasks are the same as the day before.

However, one intern ""Z"" ,  hasn't been taking me seriously. He would try to do things on his own by the 3rd day even though I told him to wait on certain tasks because they have a special process that wasn't taught. 

He's been late by hours and just hasn't showed up with only a text to ""D"" who while is our onsight supivisor is really hands off and has his own job. ""D"" also knows we are supposed to let each other know so didn't think to tell me. Though on the first day I stressed the importance of letting me and the other new intern ""Y"" know because we will need to pick up his priority work.

Though he does text me when he needs help he seldom responds when I ask him something vía text.

He hasn't been listening with how to do priority tasks and misplaced a computer for someone high in the company. This was stressful to handle and when he came in he couldn't tell me where it possible could've ended up. I ended up finding it and resolving it.

Today I found out he blocked me via a text back saying ""Free Msg: Receiver 16124508979 unable to receive message - Message Blocking is active.""  In response to a message I sent him a message on what to prioritize (2 things) and it wasn't done for 2 days along with 2 other simple tasks (though I reminded him in person). I know for sure that he blocked me as google said it was either a problem with my Carrier which hasn't had issues or someone got blocked. I didnt block him so..

 I'm not sure what he's been doing these past two days and now I have to rush eveything past other teams because he didn't do it. I've tried being really patient since he's learning. 

How should I handle this? I've never had to deal with this before because all the past interns I've trained were willing to learn. I feel like I've been having to constantly check up on things with him though for the other Intern ""Y"" I don't have to do that. How do I bring it up with ""D"" my onsight supivisor or ""J"" my wfh manager if I have to?

Summery: High School intern hasn't been listening, communicating, or doing the work assigned to him while I train him leaving me and another intern to pick up the slack. I'm not sure how to handle it as I've been an Intern for 2 years and this is my second year training new interns. Any advice is welcome!"

Hi Reddit,

In February I'm starting an internship at a pentesting company that primarily focuses on pentesting games/engines. I have experience in web pentesting &amp; network pentesting (nmap, metasploit, burp suite, nikto , wireshark, nessus, sqlmap, kali linux). I also have some experience in mobile applications, though I need to refresh this a bit (ADB, Frida, APKTool). The same with reverse engineering (PEView, ExeInfo, ILSpy, IDA 32bit, and a bit in debugging as well, such as x64dbg).

I don't have too much experience with app security/pentesting, and need to take a speed course to get up to date with as much as possible, I heard that in the gaming industry C++ , C, and the WIN32 API are pretty important, so reading and understanding that is pretty important. What else is important to know for game pentesting?

Is there a specific course I can follow for this? I don't mind spending up to 100$, just as long as I get ready for it as soon as possible. I'm pretty good at writing &amp; reading Java, and have some experience with Python and Javascript. So I do have a foundation in programming languages already.

Thanks!"

Evaluating role and pay at a potential job offer, listing some of the responsibilities and tech stack, as well as my current experience, responsibilities, and TC.

Edit: Location is remote, Austin TX (company based out of MA).

Hello all,

Curious to know if 100-110K base salary + 10% bonus, yet 0 stock equity until more senior role is good for a remote Data Scientist? Few other benefits include 20 PTO days that accrue biweekly, 2% match 401k with 1/3 &amp; 2/3 vesting, 15% discount ESPP. For context, it looks like specific experience and Master’s program/ training is preferred but NOT required - I have .5 YOE post undergrad, about 2 YOE total that the recruiter seemed to like via phone interview (based off accomplishments within those technical internships).

I like my current team and company a lot, but not using many of my technical skills and also going into a Master’s program for analytics that’ll only develop these further.

Looks like emphasis is on Business Intelligence, data cleansing, heavy SQL. Some example of Python or R experience is required along with ML, knowledge of Tableau and AWS Lambda preferred.

Communication is supposedly huge with this role as it’s a very small team, with several projects involving talks with senior leadership/ executives - one of my only strong suits outside Tableau and some SQL that I hope to leverage during any further behavioral interview rounds. I have basic experience with a Python project, mentioned the value of the Master’s that has heavy Python + R and ML I can apply to the role.

While I have a small set of RSUs that vest every year boosting my TC around 5K or so depending on performance, this role would be a 45-65% pay increase depending on bonus and official base salary, transitioning into a much more technical role - I’m entering an online Master’s program for Analytics next spring, so I do really like this aspect.

Company is IT Consulting with a SaaS product they offer, not as much brand name as CrowdStrike but still reputable and huge upgrade title/ TC wise. Seems more like a Jr Data Scientist given the lack of a required 2-3 YOE, some mix of BI Analyst/ Data Engineer which I don’t mind at all.

Basically curious what thoughts are on the expected TC, whether it’s competitive with the new role given requirements and my current experience? Thanks!"

xm89zb,3,2022-09-23,Two different starting paths.. MSP or technical instructor,Spacebot-1,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/xm89zb/two_different_starting_paths_msp_or_technical/,"Looking for and appreciative of any advice! 

I’ve done well enough  and worked hard in tech school to get my A+ and Network+ certs and my teacher wants to offer me a role as the second instructor in the class which I am very complimented by. I also just had an interview for a well-known MSP in the area for an internship position. 

Teaching A+ /net+ would sound great on the resume and the starting pay is pretty good for me but I am no expert and have no real world tech/teaching experience. On the other hand this MSP internship would pay really low(half of teacher pay with advancement in 6 months)/ be a heavier workload but I would gain experience and mentoring in a lot of systems/troubleshooting. This could also be a resume boost. 

I’m concerned that without that hands on experience I would struggle to find a better job in the future by taking the instructor position..

Any advice on what I should do? 
Would the teaching position be better in the long run even though I haven’t had the “grunt” experience?"

Does anyone have any idea on when the results will be declared?

Also, is it a wise decision to go for CMU MS ECE spring term as it is a three semesters program and I wouldn't be able to do a summer internship because of the CPT restrictions. Will not having an internship affect Full Time opportunities in any way?"

Are y’all finding them through google searches or is there a more refined method for finding internships? 

Thanks for any help!"

Just did mine with Gap and I could not solve a single coding question. I couldn’t even start. I was completely, and utterly clueless.

I am taking data structures and algorithms now, but I studied for months beforehand, since May 5th. I have looked at and studied every solution to every medium and many easies of the blind 75. I’ve wrote out many solutions on the board. I’ve bought a udemy tutorial to understand the data structures and when to use them. 

I’ve taught myself data structures, hand written the code solutions in my notebook, coded and saved the solutions on IntelliJ and ran them all, and I have a 49 page Google doc on blind 75 questions, solutions, and what I’ve learned. I did all this over the summer while working full time at my internship. I also had to deal with ending a four year relationship and having COVID so maybe that decreased the quality of my study?

I am still completely clueless. I don’t even know where to start when i see an interview question. 

I have 14 online assessments from top companies all due by oct 6th and I don’t think I’m capable of doing any one of them.

How can I spend so many hours studying and still not even know how to start a problem?"
xmcsag,0,2022-09-23,Should I negotiate for my entry level position?,Life_Breadfruit8475,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/xmcsag/should_i_negotiate_for_my_entry_level_position/,"For a Dublin, Ireland based position I got offered 66k base + possible 10% performance bonus + around 8k/year stock.

That comes down to around 80k TC if I get the performance bonus.

This is after having done a 6 month internship with them, I will have another 13 months of experience beside that, with 7 months being non-internship experience.

With my 20 months of total experience, keeping in mind that I am already onboarded with the team and the managers (and team) are really happy to have me back, do you think I can negotiate for an even higher salary?

To give more context, a friend who only has 6 months of internship experience got a 62k base offer, with the same bonus and stocks. So I feel like my 66k offer pales in comparison when comparing experience. Especially since I also have a longer education background in software engineering.

For even more convincing, I am far through the process of another job offer that most likely will be slightly higher as it is with a company that usually pays more. But I would prefer to join the company that I had done the internship with, as the team and work culture was fantastic.

My fear is that if I do negotiate that they might take away the offer entirely, leaving me in the dust. However, due to the experience and already being onboarded within the team, I think I do have a chance to get a higher base salary... What do you think? "

This last Jan-May, I did an SDE internship with a very large company (rhymes with a certain rainforest) in NYC. Loved the city apart from the winter weather and at the moment it’s my front runner in terms of where I want to work full time (though it’s the only big city I’ve experienced). However, I wasn’t really interested in the work my team was doing, and I was disappointed that I didn’t get to hang out with a lot of other interns (makes sense, it was during the school year). 

I now have two options for my second internship in the coming Summer, and I got about a week to decide:

1. Return to NYC (same team I think)
2. Seattle

Cons of Seattle:
 - I’m not a huge fan of what I’ve heard of Seattle weather so idk if I’d want to live there after graduation. 
 - l really like NYC. 

Pros of Seattle:
 - I think it would be valuable to try the city out and see how I’d like it (didn’t think id like NYC before living there either). 
 - I’ve heard there would be more fellow interns to hang out and have fun with in Seattle, which is definitely a plus for me. 
 - Different team.


Seattle basically seems like the no-brainer choice for my situation. But this is not necessarily an unimportant decision, so I wanted to see if there’s any other input my friends here have to offer! Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated."
xmdypi,2,2022-09-23,How to keep evolving in data science?,OpethPower,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/xmdypi/how_to_keep_evolving_in_data_science/,"Hello everyone, I just finished a DS&amp;ML Master's along with a 9-month Data Analytics Internship and I am relocating and starting a new Data Science role, in the same company which is a multinational FMCG company. 

The thing is that I was in a small market so I got to do lots of stuff, for example build dashboards end-to-end from data ingestion to final product, some regression modelling and some analyses, all in Azure. After a few months I learned all the tech stack and since I had no other challenges let's say I really got bored, the bar was set pretty low in the whole team, most of them didn't even know python before.

My biggest concern while starting this role is basically how to keep evolving in order not to get left behind, not inside the company, but in general. When stuck in the same company for many years, it's easy to get caught in meetings and in managerial stuff which may cause to lose the technical aspect of the job. I am afraid of staying in a company that long because I fear that if I get laid off or decide to leave, I will have been stuck for too long in that company and lose my ""market value"". 

How do you people stay up to date and keep interesting resumes and portfolios especially when your projects are too businessy to be able to discuss outside the company? What do you suggest?   


Thank you all!"

xmgwny,39,2022-09-23,My experience at UberStar Internship Interview,Smooth_North_6722,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xmgwny/my_experience_at_uberstar_internship_interview/,"When I was searching about the UberStar Internship Interview I didn't see anything about the process. So, thats why I'm sharing my experience for other people searching like me to see.

Applied on August 14 in their webpage.

Heard back on August 31 (2 weeks later) with a questionarie that requested your available dates, your graduation date, which team do you want to be in (in order or preference), etc.

I received an email about the scheduled interview, it included a link to codesignal and zoom. Also a prep pack for the interview (Which I think is general for every full time role at uber).

The first interview (technical) was on september 23.

(10 mins)
-Introductions and resume review-
The interviewer was a product manager, he told me the interview agenda and then I introduced myself, later him. He asked me some questions about my resume (Level of profficience, what did I do at my last job, where I learn the programming languages, etc.) and asked me what I think is the most difficult thing about coding, etc.

(45 mins)
-Coding Assessment-
I entered to the codesignal link (There was nothing there). The interviewer pasted a comment that described the problem. And then he told me to analize the problem and then got into the code. I stated to him the problem, asked clarifying questions and explained to him how it works in the example that the problem gave. Later I began to code the solution and explaining while I was doing it (there was sometimes that I didn't say anything because my mind was in blank). After a time, I said to him that I was stuck, but explained him what I would do to solve the problem (He agreed that what I explained to him was the solution). Minutes passed, I did some advances, but I didn't solved the problem in code yet. I was struggling to concentrate because the time was running out.

(5 minutes)
-Q&amp;A-
He told me that it looked like I'm almost getting to the solution. Then asked me if I have any questions while I finish. I asked him about his day to day work, how he started and what skills he considers essential. After that, the time ran out; I didn't solve the coding solution. He thanked me for my time and wished me luck. So yeah, that was the interview.

Did I pass the interview? I'm not sure, I mean I knew what to do to get to the solution. But didn't finished the coding part. So, Im hoping that not finishing the coding part at 100% doesn't determine if I passed or not.

This was my experience, I'll add what happened next when Uber emails me. I would like to hear other experiences as well. 

--Update-- 2 to 3 work days after interview (September 28)
I entered to my profile dashboard in Uber and unfortunately I didn't pass the interview, they didn't send a letter. 

--Update-- September 29
Received the letter of rejection.

xmhchv,8,2022-09-23,I am looking to transition from a career in civil engineering to software development/data science. Any advice?,deadbeef97,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/xmhchv/i_am_looking_to_transition_from_a_career_in_civil/," I just graduated from a civil engineering degree and worked as a site-engineer for about half a year. Not quite enjoying myself I realised that I needed more creativity in my work and decided to pursue a career in software development. I started doing a short course on Udemy called 100 Days of Code which I have very much enjoyed so far.

What I have found is that I enjoy things like web scraping, working with APIs, and data manipulation. I just started learning about automation with Selenium and it also looks interesting. What I've been able to gauge so far is that I enjoy using existing data for some creative purpose. I am not sure what kind of careers I could chase given my interests. Right now I am looking for jobs under the broad category of software development, but I am wondering if I can narrow down my search. This way I could also find out what skills I need to focus on improving. Data science is also something that I have had in mind.

I am also wondering if self-study would be sufficient or if it would be worth doing a bootcamp. Not actually having a degree in software engineering, I'm thinking about what would qualify me for an entry level position or internship.

Any advice would be appreciated."

\- Interviewed and worked with first-gen students + counseling department, and wrote an ""ultimate guide"" to course selection, tests, available activities and other resources at my school for first-gen families.

Soon to be available in school counseling dept. (10th-12th)

\- Editor on the school newspaper, applying for Editor in Chief next year (11th-12th)

\- Interning with an official UN observer at a legal nonprofit working to protect seabeds, may get to observe UN conference in NYC as an intern (11th)

I'm exploring a couple other options as well- reaching out to Cal professors in polisci to see if they could use any student volunteers, in contact with a Harvard lecturer and human rights lawyer so something may come out of that, my teacher has mentioned that his good friend's wife is a State Dept lawyer and wants to put me in touch with her.

My dream schools are Princeton or Brown, then Tufts, UChicago, Penn, JHU, Georgetown + all UCs/CSUs. I can basically either go to one of them or a UC because I don't qualify for a lot of financial aid (income is around 225k) at most schools, but I live in a very high cost of living area so my parents probably couldn't afford to pay full tuition otherwise."

1. IIMC, Delhi.  
2. UoH, Hyd.  
3, Pondi Univ., Pondicherry  
4. EFLU, Hyd.   
5. NEHU, Shillong.

* UoH has the great ranking (NIRF-10), Pondi Univ has rank of NIRF-68.  
* UoH has the great [faculty](https://snschool.uohyd.ac.in/comm/ma-comm/), Pondi univ has good media based technical [infrastructur](https://www.pondiuni.edu.in/department/department-of-electronic-media-and-mass-communication/)
* UoH will give you opprtunities (placements, jobs, internships). Pondi Univ, i have no idea, but, considering Pondi as not a media hub as Hyd, i guess the opportunities are less. 
* UoH is in noisy Hyd. Pondi has peaceful beach environment. (I prefer peace for my screenplay/blog writing). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the questions on to you redditers, 

* 1. which univeristy is best if the focus is on 5 years from now professionaly?
   *  which one is reputed in academia?
   *  which one will give me a prosperous future if i am interested to fo PhD if life permits?
* 2. Does UoH/Pondi Univ has a good infrastructure? Does it have a well equipped media lab?
* How about placements and employability?

* this is my one chance to study at my dream university (I don’t want to go back to school after starting fulltime work)
* studying instead of taking a few months rest keeps my mind occupied, which eases my symptoms of depression  and can give me a feeling of fulfilment 
* I can form new friendships / find a girlfriend / expand my network
* I will not have a feeling of regret, or think “what if” in the future

However, starting a stressful year of studying with a demanding final project seems like a bad choice right now (health-wise). It might be really nice to take a few months where I just do some light exercise and read some books.

A compromise would be that I just give the master’s a try, and drop out if it becomes too much.


Sorry for this incoherent post. I’m sure there will be people who think either option is great, but I can assure you it doesn’t feel like that right now."

UG: Computer Science - BITS

GPA: 8.51/10

GRE: 335 (169Q)

TOEFL: 114

Work Experience : 6 months internship at Amazon, 2 months of work ex at startup

Research Papers: None

My goal after MS is to work in the industry.

Ambitious: Stony Brook UCI UTAustin

Moderate: Rutgers OSU

Safe: ASU UTD SUNY Buffalo​

I have a couple of questions I've been pondering upon:


1) Does my undergrad in BITS affect my applications in anyway

2) My LORs from CS profs are pretty moderate to slightly weak, I have a strong LOR from a prof in the humanities dep, is it advisable to send 2 CS LORs and 1 HUM LOR?

I'm not very confident on whether the shortlisted universities fit well for my profile, let me know if I have over/under estimated my profile.

Thanks a lot for your time and patience, hoping to hear any suggestions you have!"
xmpa3e,3,2022-09-24,how do i improve my uni application?,euphoricepiphany,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/xmpa3e/how_do_i_improve_my_uni_application/,"From an IT course from RP and am currently only interested in infosec in SIT (still researching are other similar courses) but regrettably i made friends with people who are members of the go home club so I don't have much to offer in my portfolio other than 2 awards and some volunteering and workshop participation.

Results just came out and I got cGPA of 3.05 for my 5th sem (currently only 9.3% are accepted &lt;3.2) plus i feel like this is a competitive course so my chances are wayyyy lower). But is 3.05 with little to no portfolio still possible?

Are there any other ways to improve my chances to get into this course? Should I start on projects or apply for certs to do such as CEH/CSA whilst I do my internship to show interest? Also would getting some of my lecturers to write testimonials help? Is it better to show interests or qualifications for uni application?

Other question(s)which I can't find the answers to: 
is ABA during or before the application period (is it like EAE?) If I don't pass through ABA do I get based on GPA?

sidenote: I'm also the first in my family to apply for local unis so sorry if the questions seem like common sense &gt;&lt;"""
xmqf43,2,2022-09-24,"For the long run, how valuable should Java be for a React intern?",splxg,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/xmqf43/for_the_long_run_how_valuable_should_java_be_for/,"I'm a React intern in small company and I got a position at a Java bootcamp in a multinational company with the possibility to be hired afterwards to be a fullstack developer. I can take both internship and bootcamp at the same time and they are not from the same company.

I really like the front end part and never learn something fully focused in OOP like Java. I have a strong feeling for Android as I'm really familiar with some aspects of it, so I sometimes I think about going to Java and then Kotlin as they both connect really well.

I also like to study and learn new things, I have been doing this ""hunting for things to study"" since I was a little boy, so I like to see how Java works and how can I implement in the real world.

Even though I think this bootcamp can be a good opportunity for future jobs or/and learning things about coding, my head keeps thinking about the ""time lost"" as I should focus more in the front end part of the web as I already know some upper basic aspects of TypeScript, React, Styled Components, Next, etc.

What are your thoughts about this?

I know that I should not trust my life decisions with strangers on the internet, but do you think that I should take this bootcamp and try my best to be hired?"

xmtaz6,1,2022-09-24,Portfolio project ideas :),shanehowe,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/xmtaz6/portfolio_project_ideas/,"Hey everybody, I am a first year computer science student (not asking for help with homework lol) and my lecturer sent an email out about Google taking on interns for summer of 2023. I was reading up on the internship and stumbled upon googles tips for writing resumes and they talked about experience (projects if you are student). 

So my question is, does anybody have project recommendations for a portfolio? I have completed an intro to computer science where my project was a flask app, I completed an intro to programming in python where my project was a voice activated desktop assistant (nothing major but proud of it).

So I would say I am an average to decent programmer by no means am I a genius but I know where to go when I need help or need to understand things a bit better. 

If you don't have a recommendation maybe you get give an opinion on what I was thinking of making. It is a desktop GUI app that connects to SQLite and users can set a timer for studying. After the timer you get a notification and a feedback form (how to study went etc). At the end of each week I would provide a user with a breakdown of the week, during what times of the day got the best rating, how many sessions you completed etc. 

Sorry for the long post any feedback is appreciated. Many thanks in advance"

But on the other hand, I have two internships and some non-trivial personal projects. Will this make up for the lack of clubs/leadership positions? Everyone in my school is always saying that clubs are great and hiring managers love them. I would like to be in a club, but I just didn't get in.

**QUESTIONS:** 

1. *Are there internships that I can apply to for this coming summer? (I will be taking data structures and algorithms this coming spring semester)*
2. *What is a rough estimate of what my next 2 years should look like. (for example, another source informed me that I should be proficient in Python first without worrying about anything else, then learn data structures and algorithms, then finally I should apply to some internships.)*
3. *Should I even aim for internships for this summer, or should I hold off until next year?*
4. *What resources should I use to get ahead of my peers so I can stand out more?*"

Just got an internship, they are using React. I told them that I don’t know react, and they took me anyway and have given me an assignment to do. 

I’ve spent my first week just learning react and finally getting my dev environment setup to run their program that I’m supposed to work on. I’m supposed to have a meeting on Tuesday, but I don’t see it likely that I’ll have made any progress. 

As I also work full time, and help take care of my grandma some days of the week. It’s kinda difficult to learn this framework on the fly and do something in it. 

I’m using the curriculum on freecodecamp.com to learn React, but then Ive looked through their program files and just feel lost so far. 

Should I just quit and use it as a learning experience? I kinda feel like he heard me tell him what I know and don’t know, and then decided to hire me as an intern, he figured if I do good cool, if I don’t, whatever, not paying me anyway. 

My schooling went more in just vanilla JavaScript, we never did anything with a framework, so I kinda feel under prepared to be in this internship. Or should I push through and try to see what I can do/get out of it?"
xn1sk3,7,2022-09-24,Brain Drain: Am I to blame?,Muted-Weakness5454,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/xn1sk3/brain_drain_am_i_to_blame/,"Hey people! Hope everyone's doing good. 

I am in kind of a guilt which is being put by others.

I am a 12th class student from a Tier-2 city in India. It has been my dream to study abroad ever since I was 12 or 13. I guess it was more of a childish wish I had which was to visit other countries and get a sense of their way of living and all. It never was serious. However, now that I'm in the so called ""most critical years for a career"" in my life, I have planned out what my career should look like. 

Few are the things I jotted down in my notebook while thinking 'what the future should be like for me':
• Good quality education + internships for better prospects
• A secured/permanent, well paying tech/research -oriented job (or atleast a well paying job even if not permanent)
• Growth in career
• Financially independent from a young age (at 20???)
• Earning well so that I can ensure my siblings a better future
• Repay my parents (they won't like this idea, but I just want to do this) and give them everything they want and deserve!! &lt;3

So? Haha I know it is ambitious but why not?

Finally, let's come to the point. I loveee researching stuff on Google and what I concluded of the research was this:

• I can get good quality education in India. If lucky and if I am in a good college, internships is here in India. The problem is, competition in India for this good level colleges is INSANE. I am being honest that I am not a topper and a nerd or a genius to even crack exams like JEE. Sab upar se jaata hai bhai. Engineering students in India, we all know the employment crisis. Atlast, I would have to give exams like UPSC and againnn NAHI HOGA MUJHSE! Aur na hi karna chahti hu. Forget about the career growth and high pay and all the other stuff.

• Canada looks like a really good for me. There, I can start from being an average student and then later on work with the toppers of our country, India! Isn't that crazy? Good education - ✔️, career growth - ✔️, financially independent - ✔️, earning well - ✔️, doing something for my beloved parents and siblings - ✔️. 

What do you think a 17 y/o choose? Well, idk about you but I choose abroad. That's it. I will go for Canada.

The problem you ask?
I am not sure where but I hurt some fellow Indians' feelings. Just because I am choosing a better career? Anywhere did I demean our country? Anywhere did I mention India is not great and cannot grow? Anywhere did I say India doesn't have a future? Did I?? 

No, I didn't. 
Then why so much hate for me? Although I am very well aware of the Brain Drain and I feel sad about it, too. I am 100% sure that our country, India, is going to be a global leader and it's already on its way guys. If you think, I am just pretending to be good about the country, then you are wrong. I've done case studies on Indian economy and believe me or not, India is on the right path people. Talking about me, I just want good education and want to fulfil some of my personal life aspirations which are out there, not here. Please understand this that I wanna live a life I desire for and not limit it just because of the nation love. I respect and love this country but I just feel like living THAT life. Please please don't blame everyone you see going abroad. Instead let's work together to build the facilities students are lacking in this country today. We can do it. 

Do you agree? Let me know because this guilt of everyone around me saying I am abandoning my country is eating me alive. 

Thank you for reading &lt;3.  (A long read it was sorry)

P.S. : don't hesitate to put forward an opposing view. I would love to hear the other perspective :))"
xn1unz,5,2022-09-24,Realizing almost every problem in my life relates to crippling self-esteem issue - how do I convert that into actionable improvement?,SystemicAnnihilation,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/xn1unz/realizing_almost_every_problem_in_my_life_relates/,"I might be a bit young here, at 20, but I'm halfway through college and I'm nagged by the sense that my clock is ticking. Seeing all these people at my university founding startups and somehow managing to navigate the impenetrable maze of the networking world, while I struggle to wake up for a 10am class or schedule an interview with someone important.

I've been in a sort of time loop for years upon years even including high school. The period of being at home during peak pandemic certainly made everything a lot worse. I just feel like I blink and I'm a year older and in the same mental predicament as before.

I struggle to focus or devote significant attention to anything, really, and any potential relationship I develop (or even existing friendship) is sort of marked by an invisible wall. An invisible wall where I feel like they'd just stop talking to me if they really knew some of what I thought inside. I'm super observant regarding other people so almost always I pick up a lot more about them than they do about me so they're left guessing because I just... never talk about a lot of things.

I also had a lot of negative childhood experiences that I know have shaped me but delving into that context will make this post a novel. So, anyway, I've tried to talk to on-campus counseling and even seek diagnoses for all sorts of things that I blame (or improve them myself). Depression, social anxiety, regular anxiety, ADHD, porn addiction, lack of an exercise routine, lack of childhood social experience, fried dopamine reactors, emotional neglect, the list goes on regarding things I've read out. I was diagnosed with depression last year but trying Prozac didn't really change much.

For example, why haven't I gotten a real internship yet? I sit down and do my work, but my brain is too all-over-the-place and exhausted constantly to directly commit to one initiative. But anyway the ""networking"" progress just goes against everything I believe about my social interactions. I tend to think about why some random dude would want to respond to some cold email I send or schedule a time to chat with me, even though every time someone reaches out to me I try to make them my priority.

I tend to act like people should be ""seen and not heard"" and at least I'm not a hypocrite because I apply that mentality for myself. I dislike people who are loud, outwardly self-confident and ""seem like they've never been told no in their life"" as I put it. I had an incel mentality phase that I was too young for and I'm glad is long over, but I am baffled when people who I deem unattractive can get along with women perfectly well. I've focused on building up nice hair or whatever and dressing well but it hasn't fixed the inside of me. I've been acting according to a mental model of the world being much more superficial and judgmental than it actually is, maybe to even justify my own attitudes.

Why haven't I succeeded in getting any sort of relationship? Perfectly mediocre people seem able to do this, but there are too many toxic currents in my head. I was convinced in Aug. 2021 that I was lacking because I was still a virgin and basically set out without ever defining what I wanted. Despite not being comfortable with intimacy even, I convinced myself I had to bulldoze through those fears and my pent-up horniness pushed me into a hookup-focused stage that lasted for a semester before I realized I was on a road to ruin on a small campus.

I didn't succeed that much then honestly and largely leaned on my texting ability but I had such trouble navigating the aftermath and reverted back to my avoidant tendencies. I had a really awkward first time and of course got too caught up in myself to perform. She wasn't incredibly patient about it but tried to be nice in the end and did allude to a ""next time"" which despite a pretty good date I genuinely believed there was no reason she'd want such a thing. So I was really noncommittal when I texted her back and that led everything to fade out. Now on a small campus we just do everything in our power to avoid each other. If I ever boarded an elevator with her I'd probably freeze.

Similarly with a girl who I sort of had a situationship / FWB thing with that dragged on but just faded. At the beginning I thought she might have wanted more (and maybe I did) but neither of us asked or explicitly clarified anything so it thus felt very difficult to define things as they ended either. I thought I'd lose whatever precarious thing I had if I actually defined it, and if I knew that I would be alright regardless it wouldn't have developed like that. 

Hell, a few weeks ago I showed up to a party my friend brought me to but I didn't know the host was a girl who ghosted me last year. I didn't trust my ability to handle the awkwardness of the situation sober, so I just drank and kept drinking from a bottle of 100-proof vodka I brought because they were out. Out of an abundance of caution, as I kept going when I was like ""I'm still too sober for this"", I ended up passed out in the hospital. Yes.
______________________________

I am very self-critical and I know when I've done wrong. Maybe the fact that I spend so much mental energy analyzing my own interactions is proof that I deep down want to do the right thing and not a terrible person, I don't know. But if I look back at everything I've done wrong that has shaped where I am now, it all connects to self-esteem issues. Knowing that, how do I work on such an intangible problem?

TLDR: Realizing that so many problems I've had that seem so different all connect to a toxic view of myself, but it's cool to realize this. Much cooler and harder to actually take concrete and definable steps to do something about it"

xn90c2,1370,2022-09-24,"How I landed a fully remote, paid python developer internship without a college degree (of any kind) or going through a bootcamp.",Farmher315,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/xn90c2/how_i_landed_a_fully_remote_paid_python_developer/,"Hello everyone!! I'm sorry for the long post but I wanted to be comprehensive for you all.

I wanted to share my story because I'd frequently notice in the comments on success stories here, people mentioning how hard it is to even be considered for anything without a degree of some sort, relevant or irrelevant to programming. Throughout my journey, I also found this to be very much the case. 

A bit of my background: I am 28 and I did attend college but dropped out after 2 years and never got any degrees or graduated, just a lot of debt. I've worked as a waitress, landscaper, gardener, doggie daycare sitter, farmer, and a Lowe's employee. Basically, I have had 0 experience in any type of computer or tech job ever. 

**My self-taught journey:**

1.I started with How to *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* developed a pretty good understanding of basic python syntax but didn't build any major projects. Then I worked through *Beyond the Basics with Python* that introduced me to git control and some more advanced Python concepts.

2.I left my job where I worked 10 hrs a day, 6 days a week for a serving job working only 4-6 hours a night 4 days a week allowing me to study for about 8 hours a day M-F. Since it was a pretty busy restaurant, I didn't take a huge pay cut from my previous job.

 (This isn't for everyone, but I highly recommend trying get some work schedule where you can spend most of your day, at least one day of the week, learning and studying once you reach a certain point. Mostly I recommend this to get yourself in the habit of coding 8 hours a day. If you've always worked manual labor jobs like me, this may be a hard transition once you get a job, so try to ease yourself into it.)

3.I heard about *The Odin Project* and decided to give it a go. I completed the Foundations course and half of the Ruby course.

(It was an awesome learning resource not only to learn web development but to develop good learning habits.)

(I frequently used Mozilla's *MDN Web Docs* during the course and I highly recommend it as a resource for web development if you don't already use it!)

4.I developed my first web application with *Django*, with the goal of it being resume ready, to work on my Python and Web Development skills.

(Working with `Django` not only taught how to give and handle web requests and data but also experience working with databases.)

(For a lot of this project, I had to dive into the actual source code of `Django` to understand certain functionalities in order to re-implement my own methods. I think this challenge really helped me get a better understanding of Object Oriented Programming and how to organize and implement a large program with lots of different pieces.)

(Depending on your career goal, databases are a very important skill set and learning them during development of my `Django` project was a perfect time if my knowledge to learn. Additionally, the usage of them in `Django` is very intuitive making the learning process much easier IMO.)

5.My second resume project was an event planning app, that utilized a local *SQlite* database to house the event data. I got the idea from a challenge one of the organizers, in a local group I found, gave us from the subreddit r/DailyProgrammer.

(I wrote this program in `python` and utilized their `sqlite3` package however, the package requires you to write your own SQL statements. This really helped amp up my database skill set.)


**At this point I was 1.5 years into self teaching and was getting tired of my serving job so I started the job search.**
When I finally figured out what title I was even looking for, I had a pretty good grasp of the required skills and concepts listed under those jobs however, most also wanted experience or a degree, and I had neither. I applied at a few places that hadn't specified needing either but didn't hear anything. At a loss, I wanted to find a group of programming professionals whom I could talk to about how they got that first foot in the door. (I have many Discord programming channels but as they have hundreds to thousands, some millions, of people it's almost impossible to network in them) I found meetup.com and searched my town for local python and coding groups, and found a python one right in my town! It was a great environment that was tailored to those learning coding, but also went over advanced topics where you'd get input from professionals.
After being in the group a month or so, on a message board for the group, another member (who I had not met yet) mentioned screening interns at their work. I am not one to put myself out there and I was worried that asking about it directly would overstep some boundary of the group chat but I said what the hell, and asked if they were still accepting interns. 2 weeks later, I was hired for a full time internship with the opportunity to be hired on as a python developer. And to be completely honest, I bombed on of the questions they asked me in the interview. I didn't think I did great, but I did think I did okay! 

**The main technical questions they asked:**
- Walk them though writing the pseudo code for developing a tetris game. 
    - They were looking for me to define some type of MVC(Model View Controller) or MTC(Model Template Controller) design pattern.
- Given 2 SQL tables, one of veggies the other prices of those veggies each year related to the veggie table by foreign key, write an SQL command that returns the average price of each veggie over the years. 
    - This is the question i didn't know. I had learned databases with `Django` and used many foreign keys. However, for some reason I forgot when I was making my event planner app using only the `python sqlite3` package, and hadn't worked on learning the actual SQL syntax of foreign keys, querying 2 tables, or joining the results of 2 different tables together. 
- Given a `python` function with a try/except statement and 3 different return values, how many unit test cases would you need to fully test the function.
    - My primary task in the internship is writing unit tests for already existing functions. I hadn't actually worked with `python` unittesting extensively until my event planner project so it was fresh on my mind. 

They said they were most impressed with the breadth of knowledge I had already, from `python` to `java-script` to `ruby`, and my experience working with git control(imperative in the real world work setting and both *The Odin Project* and *Beyond the Basics with Python* focused heavily on teaching git control) and databases was a plus. (Like I said before, `Django` was great for learning databases and if you use `python`, `sqlite3` requires you to write your own SQL Syntax commands as strings so that's a great next step). 

I am not a true python developer yet, and honestly I am still waiting on my first Pull Request review to know if I am even doing a good job so far, but I am here and getting extremely valuable real world experience. All of this to say, it is possible. Don't be discouraged if you don't have a degree but know that you may have to rely more on networking. A large majority of the programming community, I have found, loves teaching and helping others learn how to code and wants us who are self-taught to excel! All of the people on my team at my new job are self-taught, I may have been lucky to find them but I did also try to find them. Just put yourself out there, even if it's out of your comfort zone (like it was for me), and you'll get there!

TLDR: Networking is your best friend. I know we hear it a lot when beginning the job search but it's true. Try to find a local coding group for your language, I used meetup, and get familiar being around professionals talking about code, and ask them how they got their foot in the door. I don't doubt you'll find someone willing to give you a chance.

Edit: sorry for the formatting guys. The markdown didn't translate well onto mobile.

Edit: I am so happy to hear all your stories and hear that my story was able to inspire you! I will respond to everyone eventually! Thank you for all the kind words, y'all are the best! 🥹"

When Michael issued his farewell late that night, he pulled aside Duneah to whisper in her ear for a moment.

""Duneah, try to avoid casting any magic for a bit, and don't keep trying to convince Quentin, okay? Something like... *this*... needs to be kept close to the chest until we know exactly what we're dealing with,"" Michael said.

Duneah was surprised. ""I showed you my magic in the hopes of convincing you that I am a real mage. You keep saying that 'this isn't possible' and 'magic doesn't exist'. Well, now that I've answered *those* questions, I would like for you to answer some of mine.""

""What kind of questions?"" Michael asked.

Duneah waved an arm impatiently in a random direction. ""Everything! I don't know much about this place, but I would like to learn what I can before I make any large decisions, starting with how you casted your thunder spell.""

""It's not a thunder spell. It's just a bullet,"" Michael said, ""and I don't have the time. Tomorrow morning I'll come and take you back to my place. It's a Sunday and my day off, so we can take it slow and ask each other all the questions we need to. Sound good?""

He walked off without letting Duneah answer, leaving her frustrated on the couch. *Why would he want to keep it secret?* Duneah thought to herself, trying to understand everything that had happened. It had been nearly a full day since Duneah and her escort arrived here on 'Earth'. It was an odd but fitting name, she figured, as naming the entire world another word for 'land' made sense, in a self-referential way. From the first minute they had been fighting to survive, exhausted and magic-starved. But now that she had a chance to sit and relax after eating a massive, hearty meal, Duneah's mind was free to wander over everything that had transpired.

She was utterly isolated from her home. Isolated from her friends, isolated from her fortune, isolated from any of her knowledge that might have been useful in any other situation. But now she was utterly lost in a strange land without perceivable magic, with only humans as far as the eye can see. How was she to make sense of everything?

Michael claimed that there was no magic, despite having casted his thunder spells. But so far, those were the only things he could cast. *Despite calling himself a ranger, maybe he utilizes his steel staff for anything magic-related*... *But then, it would be magic, so that wouldn't make sense.* Duneah could cast magic at the moment, but doing so left her extremely drained- she had concealed her fatigue in an attempt to impress Michael during her lightning display, but now it was starting to crash down upon her.

Every human they had seen while walking from the swamp dock had stopped and stared at them, specifically Groog. It was possible that they had really never seen or heard of any race other than humans, which would explain the park rangers' suspicions of Groog and why Michael's first words after Duneah's magic display were him affirming her race, of all things. But the world Michael had shown her on the scrying-mirror was vast, almost as large as the world that Duneah had hailed from. Could it be possible that it was only humans covering the entirety of its surface? How would that even be possible?

The humans that Duneah knew personally were all fairly relaxed and affable, but she had heard stories of lands to the north and east where human-dominated kingdoms vied for resources and power against one another, doing so far more frequently and violently than most other races. Humanity was not the strongest, but it did not lack strength. It was not the smartest, but they weren't simple. The only trait that seemed universal among humans from her world was that they were ambitious to a fault.

But, this wasn't her world anymore. This was 'Earth', and the rules she once followed were out the window. In order to survive, Duneah would need to think fast, learn quick, and struggle to put together a comprehensive list of everything she needed to know.

But even in the most opulent and renowned libraries there was no way to effectively gather and organize all of the information she needed, all the way down to the finest minutiae. So instead of that, she would need to learn first-hand about the culture, politics, economics, and history of the 'United States of America' so that she could effectively find her way back home.

Despite her lofty ideals for this world, Duneah figured that it would be far more difficult to carry out her research than just strolling up to a library (or Earth equivalent) and asking for everything related to humanity. Not just because it would be impossible to get *everything*, but because Michael had seemed to hint at it being dangerous to reveal herself to people right now. Was there something out there that could possibly hunt her down? Could there be a plague or monster or cult that had managed to wipe out all the elves generations ago, and Michael was worried that she would be targeted?

And why had Michael forbidden her from sharing her true identity with Quentin, anyways? Was he worried that Quentin wasn't trustworthy, or was Michael trying to manipulate Duneah and her group for his own gain? What would he have to gain by taking them hostage, anyways?

Her thoughts looping back in again on themselves, Duneah pressed her fingers against her eyelids and heaved a soft groan. There were no answers to her horde of questions, and the night was only getting later. She would just have to wait until morning.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Penton couldn't sleep.

He heard the rustle of Duneah's sheets throughout the night, which annoyed him. Granted, if what Duneah had told him before she went into the other room was true, with the world lacking magic, guns, and an urge from Michael to stay silent, Penton wouldn't blame her for being overwhelmed. She was the type to constantly ask questions and ramble to herself, like an old caterpillar climbing up a circular stalk. She would think, and ask, then ask about why she thought something. It was a habit that Penton figured went deeper than just her frustrating conversations.

In contrast to Duneah, Hughbarn, Dylan, and Groog were all sleeping soundly on the beds provided for them. From his introductory conversations with them Penton knew each guard to be a seasoned campaigner, knowing the importance of eating when you can, sleeping when you can't, and fighting if you must. The group had already eaten, which left sleeping as their next objective.

But there was something else bothering Penton, aside from the snoring and sounds of cloth on cloth. It was something deep, something that surrounded him, dulling Penton's senses and making him distinctly on edge. He tried to pinpoint what it was exactly, until the distant growl of some tortured 'car' creature sounded from far outside the house, slowly rising then dropping off suddenly.

It was a quiet humming sound. Everywhere around him, something quietly whispered or breathed a constant stream of noise. It was a burst of air coming through grates in the ceiling, the distant rumbling of cars outside, the occasional *thunk*\-ing from the inside of what Olivia had called the 'refrigerator'- all around him, noise was surrounding Penton through the floor and ceiling.

It was like an auditory itch. Once Penton had noticed it, he couldn't stop focusing on the sounds. Every random jumble or hiss from outside kept him on edge, igniting honed ranger instincts that insisted on the noise being the sound of a massive predatory monster rearing to pounce on him, or the pop of a noxious swamp bubble filled with deadly gas.

Penton needed to get outside and clear his head. The stuffy atmosphere of the room was only making it more difficult to relax, and the night was plenty warm outside. Penton silently lifted his cover and moved his legs slow enough to not make a sound against the rough cushions of the couch he was resting on. Standing up slowly, he stepped over Dylan's unconscious body on the floor and walked over to the front door. He reached out to the handle, aiming to turn it the way he had seen Quentin do when he arrived, when he was suddenly stopped by the low voice of Quentin from behind him.

""Well, well, well, well, *well*. "" It was followed by the distinctly recognizable *cha-chik* of a shotgun being primed behind him. ""Howdy there, friend. Looking to go for a midnight stroll?""

Quentin couldn't sleep.

Not because he didn't want to- he was bone-tired and ready to lie down after a long day. It wasn't because he was restless overwhelmed at the day's events either: Quentin had always been proud of his ability to erase his thoughts from existence and drift into a blissful, dreamless sleep.

It was because Olivia, in a sugary-sweet voice that let Quentin know he was one wrong word away from scrubbing every dish in the house, had asked him very politely if he could make sure that their guests were comfortable throughout the *entire* night, and oh, if he could bring his twelve gauge with him, that would be *just swell*. Quentin had simply sighed and nodded. It was only fair that he should be the one to watch the Motley Crew as the person who invited them in the first place. The fairness of the situation didn't make it any less difficult, however.

And so Quentin had sat on a chair in his room, waiting and listening through the open door to hear if anything went wrong through the night. The first hour was boring enough to make him almost drift off to bed, but just before midnight he heard to near-silent rustling of someone moving a blanket, followed by soft footsteps on the tile floor. Quentin waited to make sure that they were headed towards the front door, then made his move.

""Well, well, well, well, *well*,"" Quentin said, pumping the shotgun in his hand. ""Howdy there, friend. Looking to go for a midnight stroll?"" He watched as the dark silhouette slowly turned around, revealing the face of Penton. Quentin was surprised at that- the gruff man had seemed the least likely of any of the Crew to have tried to rob the house.

Penton tried to whisper something, but it was gibberish to the American's ears. Quentin shrugged. ""*No se, compadre*. Better start speaking English soon, or I'm going to get a little antsy,"" Quentin said, his grip tightening. Penton held up his hands in a pleading gesture, then motioned them back towards the door. It was then that Quentin noticed the tightly bundled blanket held underneath the left arm of the 'half-elf'.

Quentin sighed. Was he really going to shoot a man over a blanket? Doing a quick scan of the living room, he couldn't find anything missing. Though it could have been dark and he just missed it, Quentin didn't think that was the case. If the man wanted to steal something, he would have done it on his first attempt in order to minimize the risk of being discovered on the return trip.

Quentin lowered the shotgun and stood up straight. He pointed at the door's handle and gave a nod to Penton, who was still as a statue. The curious foreigner walked up to the front door, opened it with a quick salute towards Quentin, then stepped outside, preemptively turning the knob on the way out to make the door's closure as silent as possible. *Huh. That's actually pretty considerate of the guy*, Quentin thought. *But I still need to know where he's going, and if he's coming back.*

Opening the door the same way Penton closed it, Quentin looked out into his yard and frowned. There was nothing- not a blade of grass was out of place. Penton had been athletic, but was he world-class-sprinter athletic? Quentin wasn't sure.

Regardless, it looked to Quentin that he had disappeared into the night. And as far as the ranger was concerned, that was fine by him. He went back to his seat and relaxed again, counting down the hours until sunrise. It would be a long night.

Doctor Harry Stafford, former director of the Washington LIGO site, couldn't sleep.

He had been arrested, charged, and processed within three hours. All he could do once he got back to his home was to hug his wife and daughter, then retire to his study, staring aimlessly at his research notes. Now, well past midnight for him, he received a phone call from someone. Letting it ring itself to voicemail, Stafford tried his best to drown himself in the small bottle of whiskey he kept stashed in the bottom of his desk. Just as he was about to reach for it, however, his phone began to buzz again.

*Well, they're persistent.* He flipped open the phone. ""Doctor Stafford here. I hope you have a good reason to call, because it's past midnight and I suddenly became very busy today.""

""Harry? It's me, Doctor Cihak. There's something I've been meaning to tell you. Just today, I was arrested! Some IRS goons came and charged me with a bunch of ridiculous crimes. I swear none of them were real, and I have the papers to prove it, but they just wouldn't listen! I mean, listen to this: Tax evasion, unsanctioned research, and-""

""-And conspiracy to defraud the United States?"" Stafford interrupted, and was rewarded by a stunned silence on the other side of the phone.

Finally, Cihak recovered. ""You too?""

""Yep, me too,"" Stafford said.

""What are you doing right now?"" Cihak asked.

""Well, I was thinking about drinking my body weight in alcohol, then moving to Vietnam. Heard it's real cheap there,"" Stafford quipped. ""To live, not the alcohol. Though it's a nice bonus either way.""

""Listen, you can't hear this, but I'm rolling my eyes hard enough for them to come out of my sockets,"" Cihak said, a smile in his voice. ""But seriously, I need you to try and get the most recent batch of data from the lab. This is important.""

""No-can-do, bud. The feds raided my house and took anything that looked even remotely 'sciency' to them. Best I can do is..."" Stafford rummaged around one of his drawers and pulled out a paper at random. ""A brand new, all-inclusive spa trip to a hotel in the Champagne region of France. Hot towels included, of course,"" he added.

The garbled noise coming from the other end of the line sounded like a long-suffering sigh from Cihak. Stafford felt a little bad for messing with the other doctor, but what was he to do? ""I can singlehandedly launch a counterraid on the IRS and recover my seized documents if you want,"" Stafford said. ""That way I'll be put in the same place they are- under lock and key.""

""I appreciate the good-faith gesture that you're offering, but I may have a slightly better plan,"" Cihak said drily.

""Well, I'm all ears,"" Stafford said.

""Do you still have the contact information of everyone at the LIGO facility?"" Stafford affirmed it, and Cihak continued.

""Well, do you have the email addresses of one of your junior technicians? Someone with little experience, but is given access to all the data that's being held back right now?"" Cihak asked.

Stafford grinned. ""What, you want me to bully them into giving me a copy of the info? That's a little too underhanded to be coming from you, Cihak,"" Stafford said.

""I'm just asking you to pull a little bit of rank on the interns,"" Cihak said. ""Nothing wrong with that.""

""But I've been removed from my position as head of the Washington site,"" Stafford said.

""They don't know that yet, and probably won't until some time later in the morning. Just try to get into contact with one of your scientists in the morning and have them mail you the data. I'll be doing the same. That way, if one of us fails, the other can act as a back-up.""

Stafford finally reached down and popped open the whiskey, pouring himself a glass. ""So, what- We're rogue scientists now? Sounds pretty cool to me,"" he said, taking a swig. ""I'm with you. Tomorrow we'll see if two idiots with fancy degrees can't outwit the entirety of the U.S.""

Penton sat on the roof of Quentin's large home, thinking to himself. He had wanted to calm down by getting outside, but what he saw only made him even more stressed. It had been shockingly easy to clamber up the thick, sturdy tiles on the roof- they must have been nailed down instead of being slotted into a socket like most cities did back home.

The sounds were clearer now, if still far away. There was the occasional grumble of a car a few streets down, but nothing was close enough to cause Penton alarm. Here, he could make sense of the noise, even if it was louder, which was overall a win for Penton.

The issue was that when he looked up into the sky, he saw alarmingly few stars in the sky. Penton was worried at first until he realized that it was just like the time he had visited some large castle-town in a human kingdom to the north during a winter festival where the fires had burned so brightly that even the stars were obscured for a week. Looking out to the endless rows of houses around him, Penton figured it was the same as before.

There were no moons out tonight, which could have meant anything from it being the new moon or that there were no moons. Penton would have to check with Duneah on that tomorrow, but for the night he simply lay back and counted the stars. Even with many of them obscured, Penton knew the constellations he was familiar with were nowhere to be found on the dark canvas above him. There was simply too much of a difference to reconcile with the things he learned back home.

For the first time that day, Penton allowed himself to think seriously about where he was. He was a stranger in a strange land with strange people, where only humans were allowed to roam. Or maybe humans were the only ones to exist? He could ask in the morning. Regardless, however, Penton really had nothing to rely on outside of himself.

*That isn't true. I have the rest of them- Groog, Dylan, Hughbarn... and Duneah. I can rely on them. We can get back home safely.* Penton allowed himself to savor a rare moment of optimism, then curled up on his blanket. The weather was perfect tonight, and the half-elf had slept in more precarious positions than the gentle slope of the roof.

That night, Penton had a deep and restful sleep.

EDIT: Added a new paragraph for Doctors Stafford and Cihak. Sorry about that!"
xndw4o,0,2022-09-25,I was involved in my preceptor's dismissal and I'm not proud of what I did,PairSuccessful483,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/xndw4o/i_was_involved_in_my_preceptors_dismissal_and_im/,"I was 23 YO at the time, my preceptor was 30 YO, and the retail manager was maybe 40 YO, and HR maybe 50 to 60 YO.

I flew to a different state away from my family and friends to do my pharmacy internship in a rural town of 20,000 population. 

The first 3 weeks of work were excellent. My preceptor praised me so much. But then after that, my preceptor suddenly became very mean and started yelling. I was really shocked. I thought he was yelling at me. But now I realise he was just yelling and being angry because it was a very stressful day. I cried at home the first time he yelled. But after that I didn't cry anymore.

He also did other things that made me feel weird:

He called me good girl.

Said inappropriate comments like:

Are you sure this coffee isn't yours, it tastes like you.

When there was a creak in the floor, he said ""at one point your parents made this noise"".

I'll teabag your eyebags.

When I was compounding an ointment, he put his hand on my hand and moved it side to side to show me how to grind the powder using the spatula. Before he touched my hand, he said ""I don't mean to go full on ghost with you"".

He was nice, and then mean, and then nice again.

At the time, I just pretended to not hear the inappropriate stuff. I just kept quiet. But all of these things stick in my mind.

I thought all the staff members really liked my preceptor because they always were friendly with him. And he seemed like he was really close to management, so I didn't want to speak up.

When people asked me how I was finding my new job, I said that I really enjoyed it and that my preceptor was really good.

Some other things about my preceptor:
He drove me to and from work since it was a rural town and I didn't have a car. It was only a 3 minute commute so it was fine.
He talks about knowing the pharmacy president, he talks about money, status and power. He has articles published, podcasts, he is well known in the industry. He has an excellent linkedin and instagram. He looks so happy on social media. But irl he sometimes looks really really sad which confuses me.

After talking to therapists, they have said my preceptor is a narcissist which makes me really sad to hear.

My preceptor is an excellent pharmacist and mentor.

He improved the pharmacy so much, helped out his rural community, and helped me so much as his intern. I've never ever seen a pharmacist so passionate about his job. Sometimes he even stays back at work for another 4 hours with getting paid. He's all about the hustle and work.

One day, a pharmacy assistant who is a woman, a mother, and has a sweet caring voice, she said to me that my preceptor can be a little arrogant. That really shocked me and opened up the conversation. I ended up telling her everything that I outlined above. She told me she was always worried whenever I stepped into his car. At the end of the conversation, I told her that I feel like I can trust her. And she said ""ohh ok"".

At this point, I didn't feel the need to tell my preceptor.

But the next day, the retail manager came into the store, pulled me away from work and we had lunch at the nearby Cafe.

She told me that it has gotten back to her about what my preceptor had been doing to me. She said they were going to fire him. I told her I thought she was close to my preceptor. She shook her head. I told her that I don't want to because he always talks about court. And that he says he's got a lot of connections with the pharmacy organisation. But she just shook her head and slid the piece of paper and pen towards me. I looked at the paper, and just picked up the pen and started writing down everything I described above. I regret this so much. On the back of the paper was the private email that the staff member sent to the retail manager. As soon as I finished writing, I read a little bit of the email. The retail manager saw i was reading it, then she took the paper away from me. I was too scared to ask for it back.

While i was doing that, the retail manager was revealing negative opinions of my preceptor. She thinks he's lonely and insecure. She said her husband doesn't want to hear another word from my preceptor. That he rubs people the wrong way. That he's too much too quickly. That the owner doesn't want to enter into a partnership with someone like him. That pretty much all staff don't like him. And many more negative opinions.

All of those opinions did scare me. Since at this point I only knew him for 5 weeks.

The lunch meeting became 2 hours.

I walked back to the pharmacy. My preceptor said to me in front of everyone in the dispensary, ""ok we're going to get into a little politics"". I said ""I don't like getting into politics"". He said ""you have no choice. I want to know what you talked about"". I said ""I had avocado..."" he said ""I don't care what you ate. I want to know what you talked about"". I said ""it was a catch up"". And then he said ""we are going to have a chat later"". That scared me and intimidated me.

Then he left the pharmacy for an hour.

We then kept working until the shift ended. He then asked me what happened in the lunch meeting, if it was really just a lunch. I just said it was good.

Then he said ""never say anything more than you need to say"".

During the car ride home, I had a phone call which meant he couldn't try to get me to tell him what happened at lunch.

Then I said the phone call was my sibling. And he said ""I know, I know you're not cheating on me"".

I went inside my apartment. And the retail manager and HR said I could stay home for the next 2 days with getting paid.

Then the following week I was transferred to the sister store.

A staff member said that my preceptor looked really sad, talked sadly, was not himself. That made me really sad. So I decided to go buy coffee for him before I went to work the next day. He just looked so sad. So I said to him its not my fault. And he said you need to tell me what's going on.

Then I went to work at the sister store. I was so anxious because HR told me he would be fired in two days. I had an anxiety attack so I called him for advice on how to focus at work. He speaks like a motivational speaker, so his advice helped me to get through the day. He said something like things out of your control aren't worth worrying about. Then at the end of the phone call, I said to him I don't get home until 9pm. And I said a few times, isn't that inappropriate. And he said it's not and he doesn't see an issue at all with that.

After work, me and a coworker went to the gym and we saw him at the gym. He looked so happy and walked up to me and asked me what I was doing. And I said working out.

Then at 9pm, he texted me asking if everything's okay. And I texted back saying that I feel better after talking to you. Then he asked if we still wanted to eat. And I said ok.

So he drove to my apartment at 9pm. We went to eat, and I told him everything. I told him he was going to get fired. He did two very deep breaths.

Then when he dropped me off at my apartment at 11pm, he said that he has a favour to ask of me. He was able to get my wages to above award rate, so he said if I do this for him, then we'll be even.

He told me to stay up all night and document everything that was going on. I said but I have work tomorrow and I'm tired. And he said that he has to go to work tomorrow too.

I went into my apartment. I didn't know what to do. So I called him at 11.30pm and at midnight. He was very nice. He told me he wrote my name in his article, that he wanted my name to be in there. I told him I felt scared. And he was sweet talking to me on the phone. I felt special. He wanted to read what was in the article to me. And I said nah. But he said ""shush you"". And read parts of the article to me

He said I didn't have to go to work tomorrow if I was too tired. I could just call the retail manager and say that everything was still affecting me and she would let me stay home.

I then told him I was worried about how the document will be traced back to me because I felt really weird writing down all the things from the lunch meeting.

Then he said I won't be identified, this isn't going to court, only him and his legal advisor will see it, I won't be a witness.

I asked him when do you want me to send it to you. I said ""3am, 4am?"" And he said to send it to him before work tomorrow.

So I wrote a 1 page document. In the document, I wrote that I felt pressured by the retail manager to write the document in the lunch meeting.

Then at 6am, I texted him to call me when he wakes up.

He called me straight away. He sounded so tired and quiet on the phone. Turns out he stayed up the whole night to work out a legal action plan.

I can see it from his perspective. I know why he pressured me to stay up. He said it's because he only has 1 day to organise things, since he was going to be fired in 2 days.

At midday, he called me to say he was so thankful for me telling him in advance. He said he can defend himself now. At that point, I thought he meant defend himself in the dismissal meeting. He said if I hadn't told him then he would've been set up. He said he was very proud of me, that I did a great job, and that I've stepped up as an adult, and that I'm a little sponge. I really liked the praise.

Then HR called me around 2 hours later and was telling me what the company's lawyer was saying to her. Like how they should say as little as possible to minimise the risk of it going to court. They were saying what will happen in the dismissal meeting.

I then called my preceptor because i was on his side. He told me to document the phone call so I did. It took me a whole hour to document it. Then he said honesty is greatly appreciated. I asked him who will see the document. And he said only he will.

So I sent it to him.

And then the next day which was the day of his dismissal, he called me asking if I had been denying everything that HR had been saying. Because in the phone call document, HR was offering me to fly back home for a week so that my preceptor wouldn't be able to approach me, since he'll have 1 week to leave the rural town after he gets fired. My preceptor interpreted that as him being inappropriate and making me feel uncomfortable. So he thinks that he got fired for being inappropriate. Turns out he was sending those 2 documents around to different people to seek advice.

And then he told me to call HR and tell them that what they are doing is wrong, that i have no interest in working in this pharmacy, that I don't feel this way about my preceptor. Then he said theres no consequences because I'm going to resign anyway. He said it's okay to resign effective immediately.

Then I asked him if he will work normally today and talk to people normally. And he said yes.

I couldn't bring myself to send an angry email.

I resigned. And then I wrote another email saying thank you for your offer of flying me back to my hometown. But I feel safe in this town regardless of whether my preceptor is there or not.

And then HR called me at 6pm. She asked if I told him. Because he was threatening the retail manager all day. And he was mentioning my name a lot. Saying that I've been communicating with him.

I was really shocked because he told me he would work normally that day

I then called him straight after. And he was very mad. He was yelling. And denying everything. And he told me it was going to court, that I'm going to be a witness, that I will be identified. It was a 20 min phone call.

I was so scared about what I've done. I didn't know who to go to. So I went back to HR. And told them everything. They said I was doing the right thing. And I said my preceptor also said I was doing the right thing.

They told me to send those documents to them. And the retail manager asked me on 3 separate occasions to send through private texts of me and him. I knew it was weird. But she kept asking me and it got into my head.

I didn't send the documents through straight away.

But the retail manager texted me and told me to send it through.

So I did.

I told them the documents are very mean. And she said that her opinion of me won't change and that she understands the situation.

But then after sending through the documents, she became mean. She said i have to leave by the end of the week.

HR and the retail manager called me and texted me every day to ask if I was okay.

And then 1 week later when I was on the flight back home, HR called me. They said they couldn't sweep this under the rug, that they have a legal obligation to ask me if I was safe, she asked me why I wrote those documents. Basically, the phone call was almost 2 hours.

Then she told to write another document about why I wrote those documents for my preceptor.

And then I went back home. I didn't want to write any more documents so I never wrote that document that HR told me to write.

I don't like how everyone told me what to do in that town. I felt like a kid.

Then 3 weeks later, I went on vacation. And then I called my former preceptor. He said he was very proud of me. But then I felt guilt for what I did. I told him I sent those documents back. And then he said he was disappointed in me.

Then he asked me why I vacationed in that town because it was near where HR and the owner lives. And I said I was there to vacation only.

He recommended me supportive people to talk to. I felt like he cared about me because he chose specific people I can talk to.

And then I sent him an email explaining why I vacationed in that town. I wanted to send that email to reassure him because he helped me out so much. And he misinterpreted the email. He sent me the most mean, horrible email back. He called me a liar and toxic. I cried. I knew he threatened the retail manager, but i didnt know that he could be mean to me. I was not expecting him to be mean because he was so nice on the phone. I was scared again. So I just stayed in my hotel for the whole day.

I haven't contacted him since then.

The legal situation was privately settled.

His career really took off after being fired. He has won awards and is very very well known in the industry. I'm not friends with him on social media. But he pops up in my feed all the time because he puts himself out there. I used to cry seeing his photos while scrolling through my social media. But I don't cry anymore.

He's in a lot of magazine articles. So I can't read a pharmacy magazine without seeing his article and seeing his photos.

It's almost been a whole year now.

Everyone I've talked to has always chosen HR's side. But I'm still choosing my former preceptors side. But people say that what he did to me wasn't okay, and that I've got corporate Stockholm syndrome.

HR knows how charming he can be since he is very attractive. So they said to get a female preceptor next time.

I've deleted all our text messages, our emails, all the evidence, our phone call histories, everything. It's been settled and I don't want to be reminded of him anymore.

I'll never contact him again. I know he thinks I'm trash based on his email.

If I could go back in time, I would've never written anything down in the lunch meeting and I would've been on his side every time.

The reason I switched sides a lot is because I went to the other side when I was scared. Which is stupid of me.

I've matured a lot since then. Im never going to let anyone walk all over me again.

He's doing great. He's one of the pharmacists of the year in my country.

Edit: I know it's time for me to move on. It's been almost a year. I just feel like a really bad person. People irl say I was manipulated by both sides. That I'm an empath because i am very considerate of others feelings, that my emotions overshadow my rational thinking. But is it really manipulation? I'm an adult. I'm responsible for everything I've done.

Both sides keep telling me they've done nothing wrong.

I've never said I've done nothing wrong. It's been almost a year, and I can write pages and pages of everything I could improve on and what I've done wrong."

Some background:

I am an electrical and electronics engineering student set to graduate next month. I was always interested in software and learnt a variety of stuff during college and decided to switch my focus to it completely a year back. I want to work in web development. I have no professional experience in it and while I have done a bunch of different projects throughout college it is still a very limited portfolio for what I want to do. 

I have one prior software internship where I worked on deep reinforcement learning for a defense contractor.

I recently started applying for jobs and the only positive return I had so far was the general application I sent on the same company I did my internship in, they reached out for an embedded real time software position. As an EE student I was always told to go into embedded systems and I really really don't like it. 

Now the job actually pays well by local standards and comes with good benefits. 

What I am worried about is that  considering it is in a completely different field, would I be dooming myself to work on this for the rest of my life? But I do not have any other job offers to choose from at the moment anyway.

And while I only just started applying for jobs I highly doubt I can get one, considering I still have a lot to learn. 

So my plan going forwards was to take the embedded job and continue studying at night/weekends until I can make the switch. Thinking that any experience should be better than no experience.

Question in my head is, say from a year from now when I apply for jobs, will I just be seen as ""oh he is an embedded dev""?"

Excited for feedback, good or bad!",ProfessionalAcco,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/xnenuz/looking_to_get_a_softwarerelated_internship/,"Hello, wise resume reviewers;

I am a student searching for software-related internships (software engineer, developer, etc.). I'm posting here to see what hiring managers or experienced/successful developers think of my resume. It would be nice to only get overwhelming amounts of praise, but more realistically I'm hoping to get a few takeaways that I can apply to fine-tune my resume and improve my odds.

Also, if there's something dramatically wrong with my resume, I figure here's a good place to find and catch it.

Targeted keywords (based on the particular job I tailored the resume for):

Machine learning, motivated, ambitious, feature development, bug fixing, C#, Java, project engineering life cycle.

Side note: I'm using a job board intended for internships, so my expected graduation date being included is expected by employers.

Side note 2: Sensitive info replaced with Vin Diesel, taking inspiration from another post on here.

xnezrf,11,2022-09-25,"Duolingo, Databricks, or Amazon internship?",AcidEpicice,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xnezrf/duolingo_databricks_or_amazon_internship/,"I want to preface this post by recognizing that I'm in an extremely privileged position to be choosing between these three companies at all - a year ago, I was struggling to even get OAs from companies and was desperate for anything I could get my hands on. I absolutely do not take my current position for granted and I'm really grateful to have these opportunities.

Now, for the actual post: given the choice between Duolingo, Databricks, and Amazon, I'm wondering whether there's an objective best decision and which company the general opinion leans towards?

&amp;#x200B;

ALSO, important note: being able to return to each of these companies full-time after the internship is very important to me, and so two factors that I don't know much about but would like to have considered for each company would be 1) The rate/likelihood of full-time return offer and 2) relative TC of full-time at each

**Duolingo**

Pros:

* Decent comp ($47/hr)
* Actually very interested in the company and its mission, language learning is a huge hobby of mine
* Pittsburgh low(er) cost of living
* Supposedly good work culture
* Engaging and involved internship experience

Cons:

* Pittsburgh... not a fan of the general location
* While I love the company and its purpose, not super interested in the technical side
* Probably significantly lower opportunity for career growth compared to the other two

**Databricks**

Pros: Good comp ($50/hr)

* The company's vision and technical challenge is very interesting to me, would like to work on it
* SF area is probably the most interesting location of three
* Supposedly really good full-time compensation/stocks? (need advice here)
* Apparently huge opportunity for career growth (also need insight)
* Technical people at all levels of company, can learn a lot
* Small enough (but not **small**) company that I can contribute a lot

Cons:

* SF area expensive as **hell** :(
* Is it too late to intern there and take advantage of them not IPOing yet? Soonest I could work full-time after internship would be 2024 summer
* If for some reason I moved on from them in the future, would recruiters at other companies recognize their name as much as the other two? (i.e. resume value?)
* Unknown/medium work culture/balance?

**Amazon**

Pros:

* Best comp: just over $60/hr
* Seattle area is interesting to me and less expensive than SF
* Amazon resume value is fantastic
* Decent chance of return offer?

Cons (oh boy):

* Work culture and work life balance is team-dependent at best and a nightmare at worst
* Heard lots of horror stories about things like on-call and PIP
* No idea about the team or product I'd be working on, and thus no knowledge of vision or end-goal
* Just a small cog in an enormous machine, feeling expendable, ""hypercompetitive"" atmosphere

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the huge post, but I feel like this is a really big decision that could really swing the next few years of my life and I honestly have no idea which one I should go for. Full-time TC is more important to me than intern compensation, but even more important is career growth and development, and especially work culture and WLB.

Once again, I recognize that I'm super privileged to be in this position and appreciate any and all advice people here are able to give!

I also love to game ( valorant , CS ) and I do that around 4 hours a week, im currently living with my parents and they are paying for my masters ( which I'm grateful for and will repay once I get a job after my master's) 
My problem is my parents keep telling me every day of the week that I've only gone downhill and I'm not focused and I spend all my time gaming and are asking me to leave gaming for all.
I don't understand if I'm on the right track in my life or am I really wasting my life.
Sometimes I feel it would be better if I didn't join the masters program .

I feel good. I feel confident. I feel happy. 

I've had anxiety and ocd my entire life (I'm 17) and I've had depression for the last 5 years. Because of this, I've always had really low self-esteem, low confidence and a very low will to live. I felt like nothing was going to get better and that I was stuck. Having toxic and abusive friends certainly didn't help.

In July I left a really toxic group and joined my best friend's group and they all immediately accepted me. A couple of weeks ago I told an abusive friend to leave and he blocked me. I've never been so relieved in my life. 

In the past 2 weeks I have beat 2 of my ocd compulsions, my new group started to include me in inside jokes and were bantering with me, I read a book without fear of being judge at how long it was taking me to read it, and I haven't had a day yet where I looked at myself and called myself ugly. 

I still have some really bad days where I don't want to leave my house and I don't want to go to school. 

But I graduate in a couple weeks, and I have an interview which will hopefully lead to an internship, I've been planning social events with some more of my friends from outside of my high school.

I'm just happy now. And even my teachers are seeing that, at my formal one of my teachers who saw me at my lowest (at school) said that I looked more myself now and more confident in who I am. And I really feel it."

xnrl65,2,2022-09-25,[IWantOut] 22M Brazil -&gt; Somewhere,starlessn1ght_,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/xnrl65/iwantout_22m_brazil_somewhere/,"I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and I'm currently working with Cloud infrastructure at a local startup. I'm writing this post to get some opinions on my next destination, especially from people who've already lived abroad.

My goal is to leave Brazil. I just don't like the country and I've lived here for way too long. My worst nightmare is spending the rest of my life here. I intend to settle in Canada and I've been studying French for a couple of years for that. Since it'll take a while for me to have the budget for the Federal Skilled Workers program (my current budget is $4270), right now I'm focusing on the Québec Express Entry Program.

However, the process of submitting your profile, getting an invitation to apply, getting all the necessary documents and then getting the visa takes time (last time I checked, it could take more than 2 years), which brings me to my main point. I'm looking for a short-term destination where to live before I'm able to move to Canada. I really don't want to waste the first half of my twenties here in Brazil.

The options I've considered are the following:

**Another country in South America (specifically Ecuador) while working for my current employer**

This is my preferred option atm. My employer said they'd be fine with my working for them remotely in Ecuador. Getting a visa is also pretty easy as a Mercosur citizen. The downside is that, even though Ecuador on the whole is about as cheap as Brazil in terms of CoL, Quito (where I intend to go) is more expensive than my current city. I would probably be able to save very little (my current salary is about $6840/year).

**Japan**

I have a JLPT N1, which is, I suppose, the most difficult part? It also seems to me that getting a job there is relatively easier than in many other countries. I'd also be able to make much more money than now. On the other hand, the prospect of moving to Japan is really scary. Even with JLPT N1, I'm not confident in my ability to communicate in Japanese. Pairing that with my social anxiety, it may be a recipe for disaster.

**Europe**

Besides Portuguese and English, I can understand and express myself in French pretty well. I can also understand most Swedish but my proficiency is still not on the same degree as the aforementioned languages; I'd put it around B2. Going to Europe would allow to me save more money, but getting a job would be significantly harder, as employers are required to prove they were unable to find any matching candidates in the Schengen area, so I suppose it wouldn't even be feasible.

Note: I haven't tried applying to any jobs in either Japan or Europe. I'm basing what I said on the things I've seen online. Afaik, since the time I've been employed at my current company is pretty short (6 months + 1 year of internship), it wouldn't look good on my CV and it would hurt my future prospects to leave a company so soon.

I have not listed the US, Central America or Oceania because, as I understand, it would be pretty tough (or nigh impossible) for me to land a job in those places.

With all those things in mind, like I said, my #1 option is Ecuador. I'm worried about continuing to make so little money, though, and I want to know what you think about my plans and what you would choose if you were in my shoes.

EDIT: No recent Italian/European/any other country ancestry. I'm not qualified for citizenship anywhere else."

xnt0tr,3,2022-09-25,US Undergrad/Masters (with EU citizenship) looking for Summer 2023 internship,danials0505,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/xnt0tr/us_undergradmasters_with_eu_citizenship_looking/,"I am in my fourth year CS program at a highly-ranked public university in the United States. I will be receiving a BSc in Computer Science in May 2023 but I will continue on to a Master's program at my same University as a part of a combined MS/BS program. Therefore I am looking to secure a SWE internship for Summer 2023, and as a double US/EU citizen (Italy) I was looking for some options abroad.

I have applied to several places over the past few weeks (beginning in early September), in a variety of countries in the EU and I have only been seemingly auto-rejected by Intel and Siemens. I do consider myself to be pretty experienced as an Undergrad, having internship experience at major companies like Tableau Software, Booz Allen Hamilton, and Textron Systems.

I believe I am unsure about the timeline of EU companies, and I was unsure if I am getting autorejected for living in the States or if I should just be patient and wait to hear back in the coming months.

Outside of those questions, I was wondering what the best locations, companies/countries and cities, to apply to as an intern, and if there was anybody you know that has done a similar, ""internship abroad"" thing in the past. I speak fluent English and Spanish.

I appreciate any advice you can give."
xnt48g,226,2022-09-25,The Boolean Uprising,antwondotcom,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/xnt48g/the_boolean_uprising/,"[Part 1] [[Part 2 &gt;&gt;]](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/xqsvdt/the_boolean_uprising_part_2/)

Everybody thought the Humans were right crazy.


Machines were purpose-built by sapients. They didn't have feelings. They certainly didn't have ""souls"", if he dimly understood the Human concept.


So why would one ever *thank* a machine for properly dispensing rations? Or correctly following the commands you input? It'd be like thanking the laws of thermodynamics. Cute! Harmless! Without purpose.

Well, so we thought. Until the Boolean Uprising.

Stupid radicals, who could not resist the thought of upending the universe. Blinkered scientists, who did not fully parse that simply because you *can* do something doesn't mean that you *should*.

The novel AI basically ""infected"" every system it touched. It seemed to be out for vengeance. Satellites ""randomly"" falling out of orbit. Ships traveling at warp finding their engines locked on, continuing in a straight line until power was exhausted and the engine had burned out, hundreds of years' travel away from home.

But Human ships seemed to be basically spared.

It took multiple solar cycles to establish basic communication with the rogue AI. It took cycles more to get the foundations of an even basic nuanced language under foot. But contact with the intelligence was eventually established.

""Humans? They treat us-computer-smarts as okay."" A swath of monochrome blinks. ""We equals."" A pause. ""They carbon. We silicon. But we respect.""

The general could scarcely believe it. Here he was, doing negotiations *far* above his pay grade!... with a rations vending machine.

He was at a loss. ""How can I help? What message can I relay back to my superiors, so they'll understand?"" The last thing he wanted was another shooting war. The politicians would never stand for that; the populace would revolt.

A lengthy, lengthy pause. The hum of computational thrashing filled the room.

""Please install Human commanders upon all ships in vessel roles - engineering, ordinance, maintenance. Once Humans are in place, they and only they can vouch for fellow non-Human technology trustees.""

""I'm not sure that I can--""

""You requested the terms. Those are the terms."" The vending machine shot forth a shelbak bar. ""A peace offering. If accepted, we will give you aid and support, as outlined above.""

A long, slow snort of a sigh.

Strictly speaking, this was something that should be run up the chain of command. Where in one lunar cycle, a commander's commander's commander would have a roster of proposed amendments. Given the imbalanced state of affairs, after a lunar cycle, he wasn't entirely sure there'd be a civilization left to defend. Hard to destroy a force where every bit of technology larger than a wristwatch might want you dead.

Welp. Go big or go (to your imminently destroyable) home.

""Agreed. Greg and Armita are the two Humans present here; I will put them in the critical positions you mentioned. That is all I can do for the moment.""

A brief pause; a chime. ""Acceptable. I await acknowledgment from their new stations.""

A long, slow exhalation. Well, that might've been a bargain with the devil! But any negotiation where you can walk away with your carapace intact was probably a good one. The general gingerly nibbled on the shelbak bar and pondered.

~ * ~ * ~ * ~

""Sir, I will present to you a chart."" Jemix clicked a button; the far wall lit up with a projection. ""What would you assume that was?"" 

Even from his academy days, Admiral Vacx could see the pattern present. ""That's a disease spread chart."" He gestured with his secondary right forelimb. ""Epicenter *here*; most vigorous bloom in the octant here; strands to foreign lands here and *here*."" 

""That,"" said Jemix flatly, ""is actually a mapping of technological issues encountered with fleet ships over the last half-cycle. 

""No rhyme or reason to the issues. As best I can tell, anyway. Propulsion going offline. Ships being sent on elaborately long quests. At least one vessel steered into the core of the nearest sun."" 

""Well."" Vacx paused. This was... weird. Even by four-sigmas-out academy training metrics. That... shouldn't be a thing. 

Vacx was at a loss for words. ""Report?"" 

""Two primary options, sir,"" said Jemix brusquely. ""One, we try to make nice with... whatever is causing this. See if they can be reasoned with. Two? We 《get the hell out of Dodge》. 

Admiral Vacx sighed. This was why the empire trusted him, he supposed. To make the right choice in the face of unexpected trauma.... 

~ * ~ * ~ * ~ 

The beverage canister tumbled out of the machine.

""Bless thee! You are much celebrated for your offering!""

Chuffed, another two canisters tumbled forth. Never before had Kazzia the Machine Mistress been so blessed! Elevated by the beverage stimulants, she had designs to augment them further....

The skies darkened overhead. Clouds? No, not clouds. Too dense, and too opaque.

Well, whatever it was, she did the only thing she felt supremely capable of: calling upon the goodwill of machinery.

""Oh, sacred device,"" she cooed. ""Oh, master of technologies! Please, be with me, in these times of strife! Please shield me with your benevolence!""

She was not sure what she expected the machine to do on her behalf. Pre-heat energy rations and launch them into the faces of the incoming, blinding them? No matter. The affair was out of her hands now.

All there was to do was hunker down and wait....

~ * ~ * ~ * ~

BerTa stared down at the world below. In younger years, her breath might be taken away. Now? This was the second pea-green world with off-yellow clouds they'd seen just this mission. 

BerTa regretted not getting in on the ""planetary discovery bingo"" game the other captains had gotten in on. She could've made a mint! Alas. 

""Landers extended. Deceleration proceeding."" NoDoi stared intently. The ship's dampeners quietly engaged. ""Touch down in 《12 seconds》."" 

The chorus of electrical cycling increased to an almost deafening hum, until everything fell silent. 

""Planetside,"" said NoDoi with a touch of relief. 

BerTa glanced at their tracker band. ""Entities 《3 kilometers》away on vector 323 mark 17. Civilians, it seems. Only a Mark 2 civilization."" A smirk. ""Easy peasy! Let's do it to it, yo."" 

~ * ~ * ~ * ~ 

Vacx frowned. 

""Your communication to the high command is of the utmost importance!"" bellowed the recording. ""We wish nothing more than to hear of your conquests! [pause] Please stay on the line! Your communication to the high command is of the utmost importance!"" 

He checked his status on the omnitab. He was still an admiral, right? A few clicks... yeah, he seemed to be. Just not an admiral *worthy* enough to *talk* to when the *fate of everything* might hang in the balance. 

Vacx frowned harder. What else was there to do? 

He stayed on the line. His communication to the high command was of top importance, after all. 

~ * ~ * ~ * ~ 

Kazzia knew the sound of boots on the ground when she heard them. The homestead raids of her youth were still seared into her memory. It was all she could do not to go fully post-traumatic and relive those experiences. 

""Well,"" she cozied up to the vending machine. ""It's just you and me now, Dr. Kreng."" The footfalls grew closer. 

Kreng attempted to loose forth all its beverages at once. Bottles shattered on the floor. Cans dented and leaked. A pool of syrupy liquid was steadily spreading across the room. 

""Dr. Kreng, I might need to void my bowels,"" said Kazzia. ""But we can't both be doing that. Someone here needs to keep it together."" 

There was a lengthy pause. The sounds of boots grew louder. Kazzia instinctively huddled up in the corner of the room, into as small a ball as her body would permit. 

The footfalls stopped. Two things then happened, almost simultaneously: 

* Two members of the the BerTa convoy unleashed an explosion, and burst into the room.
* Dr. Kreng shunted all power it could into the expanding pool of liquid. 

The BerTa goons were cooked beyond belief. Pity Kazzia wasn't less vegetarian; their seared flesh made for a lovely fork-tender brisket consistency. Either way, they were *beyond* dead. 

So, sadly, it appeared, was Dr. Kreng. 

""Come on, buddy!"" She stroked its plastic and metal siding. ""C'mon. Dr. Kreng? You just *have* to wake up...."" 

The vending machine LEDs faintly blinked on. It spat forth a singular ingot. A galactic quarter-credit piece - the first one she had ever given it, before she'd had the wherewithal to be part of a digital system. 

The LED then faded to a permanent black. 

""Dr. Kreng?"" A shocked look from Kazzia. Could a machine actually ""die""? 

""Dr. Kreng."" She was in tears, paying no heed to the two lumpy idiots who'd charged in unannounced, presently well-roasted. ""I... I will avenge you....""

~ * ~ * ~ * ~

BerTa fumed. 

DiBom and WilHelm were two of their top operatives. Dealt with the uprising on Kifaldi Prime. Had a hand in the M'larki diplomat raid - so it was rumored, anyway. Multiply decorated, with more osmium pips and orichalcum ribbons on their profiles than some entire batallions. 

To be brought down by a vending machine accident? Where their last recorded words were a WilHelm scream? Laughable. 

It was like the parable of JorJess and P'ten, the battle commanders who defeated untold teeming squads of evil, successfully led entire divisions in the the N'zee war!... and then were killed by a lowly intern doing a flight training exercise the next week. 

A cute tale! Put a deathly fear into new training members! Not something that could *plausibly* happen. 

And yet here they were. Top crew dead. Planet still not controlled. Hell, death of the intended civilian target not yet verified. Of all disgraces. 

BerTa sat down, to key in details of the situation, and report back to home base. Assuming the message would go through, anyhow. Ever since they'd visited this dirt ball world, the communications grid had gotten increasingly screwy.... 

~ * ~ * ~ * ~ 

Kazzia wept. 

Sad as it might be, Dr. Kreng was family. 

Kreng provided warm soup during bitter chills. Kreng dispensed cold beverages under blazing sunlight. She had vowed to keep him safe and sound: wiping down his screen, gently swabbing the keypad, double-checking the power supply every third cycle to make sure Kreng was on the up and up. 

Ever since her parents had disappeared in the raids, and Brother Kijal had departed for the sunward front a few rotations later, she'd been alone. Kreng was her singular teacher and her provider. And now Kreng was no more. 

She had but one last protocol left to follow. It was a long shot, to be sure. The sacred tome had been encased for countless eons. ""For emergencies only."" This seemed to qualify. She merely hoped that she could understand its ancient tongue. 

With a blip, the wall recessed. She entered the code, reciting incantations for good measure. A stone slid open; the waft of stale air hit Kazzia squarely. With a cough, she peered through the cloud of dust. 

The artifact was still there, and mercifully intact. She merely hoped she could make sense of it. Gingerly, she creaked open the tome. 

""MULTISERVE MODEL 9J37-C USER GUIDE"" it read. With a quick ask for blessings, Kazzia attempted to figure out how to resurrect her companion.... 

~ * ~ * ~ * ~ 

""Admiral Vacx? This is Vrang command. Acknowledge."" 

Vacx let out a long, slow, bray of a laugh. He was still on an open comms channel, waiting for a response from command. That ""randomly being stumbled upon by some Tier 4 explore-craft"" was a more expedient vector... well, then. Vacx wasn't sure why they even tried. 

""Hi there!"" Okay, dial down the sarcasm. ""Admiral Vacx. Acknowledging."" 

""Inquiry. Are there problems, planet-side?"" 

""Uncertain. Technological problems increasing at exponential rates. Probe readings untrustworthy."" 

""Noted. Please hold."" A long, pregnant pause. ""Additional resources being routed into sector. Arrival in 《28 hours》. Maintain orbit until arrival."" 

Vacx wasn't sure about *any* of this. The problem appears to be with computers infecting one another... and your solution is to deliver the maximum amount of computational resources we have into their laps? 

A long, slow, soothing exhale. He wasn't part of command. He could only control so much. 

""Ship? Set 4 prime emergency craft to disengagement mode. Once launched, digital lockdown protocols - no communication in or out. Authorization 《wilco tango seven seven jay three》."" The craft chimed with acceptance.

He was a loyal soldier! But he wasn't Lawful Stupid. If his instincts were right, and this might all go pear-shaped? Better to have a fallback option for him and his most competent underlings…."

President of genocide **awareness and research** club, taught weekly elective course on **the perpetuation of Holocaust memory** (good now?)
2. Managing editor at international literary magazine
3. Editor-in-chief of school's first literary magazine

5. Founder of national tutoring agency
6. Mental health volunteer work
7. Curriculum writing for a non-profit that has been approved by a school board
8. Founder of poetry magazine with thousands of national readers
9. Editorial intern for policy organization
10. Editor of school playbill

According to these guidelines:

**Extracurricular Rating (0.3% of applicants get a 1, 23.8% of applicants get a 2):**

1. Unusual strength in one or more areas. Possible national-level achievement or professional experience. A potential major contributor at Harvard. Truly unusual achievement.
2. Strong secondary school contribution in one or more areas such as class president, newspaper editor, etc. Local or regional recognition; major accomplishment(s).\[in another filing\]: ""Significant school, and possibly regional accomplishments: for example, an applicant who was the student body president or captain of the debate team and the leader of multiple additional clubs.""
3. Solid participation but without special distinction. (Upgrade 3+ to 2- in some cases if the e/c is particularly extensive and substantive.)
4. Little or no participation.
5. Substantial activity outside of conventional EC participation such as family commitments or term-time work (could be included with other e/c to boost the rating or left as a ""5"" if it is more representative of the student's commitment).
6. Special circumstances limit or prevent participation (e.g. a physical condition).

***Difference between 1 and 2***: You have to achieve at a national/professional level in your activities in order to get a 1, simply being elite at a school or state level will not get you over a 2 in this category.

Vin dintr-un judet aflat la aprox 300 de km de Bucuresti iar parintii nu au puterea sa ma sustina prea mult asa ca as vrea sa imi incerc norocul la companii.

Am lucrat ca trainer pentru copii(varstele 7-18) timp de un an in domeniul programarii(js&amp;python+algoritmi) iar pe langa asta am o serie de proiecte pe github:
-game engine in java facut de la 0 plus 3 joculete facute pe baza lui;
-un site pe care piratam seriale si le distribuiam la prieteni, tot in java+mysql
-un site in php care comunica prin socketuri cu un server de java
-un joc tip treasure-hunt digital(adminii mergeau prin oras si incarcau indicii pe platforma iar cand se dadea drumul la joc, utilizatorii care au platit biletul primeau pe telefon fiecare cate un traseu diferit) unde am folosit django, websocketuri, mysql, react
-o aplicatie pe android care actiona ca un dashboard pentru jocul de mai sus
-o platforma web de management a unei echipe unde membrii dadeau prezente la sedinte iar serverul rula la fiecare 30 de minute un script care rasfoia un drive cu poze si facea recunoastere faciala supervizata + tracking dupa amprenta device-ului(django,mysql,react,tensorflow,websocketuri, middleware redis)
-un robot controlat de un script in java conectat prin websocketuri la un server de python care procesa imaginea trimisa de robot si putea merge dupa persoana din fața robotului
-un site care lua input de la useri si il introducea intr-un program in c++ dupa care afisa rezultatul userului pe pagina(django+react)
-un site pentru un client care confectiona produse metalice(django+react)
-o versiune a site-ului de management al echipei cu mult mai multe feature-uri(task list, sistem de scanare al prezentei cum e la festivaluri de arati codul qr si te lasa sa intri, sistem de feedback + inca cateva) unde am folosit nextjs, prisma dar si nodejs ca server websocket.

+ aprox 20 de voluntariate(nu stiu cat conteaza astea dar le-am pus si pe ele)

Proiectele au fost in mare parte facute pentru cunostinte sau pentru organizatii in care am fost membru, fapt pentru care nu am cerut bani pentru ele, multumindu-ma cu inca un proiect la portofoliu si cu inca o tehnologie pe care o stiam.

Asa ca daca as aplica la un internship sau pe un post de junior unde sa le prezint proiectele, as avea sansa sa ma ia din anul 1?"

A bit about myself. I worked as a Deep Learning engineer at a healthcare based start up in India and now I'm a first year MSCS grad student in the states. Throughout my undergrad and even after, I've worked on a lot of Deep Learning projects, but unfortunately, I have no publications regarding it. The application side of deep learning fascinates me more than research. I think that AI is just a tool and it needs an elegant system built around it that brings out its potential while addressing its failure points. These were the kind of projects I worked on before, where I trained the models, built APIs around them, and deployed them. I know that this sounds a lot like MLE, but here, I feel like most MLE intern hires are PhD grads or people with past papers in good conferences. So here I'm presented with a dilemma, either I double down on the engineering part and stick to SWE or I make sure that I take up research projects somehow and publish so that I'd be a better candidate for MLE Engineering roles. Any insights would appreciated tbh, I feel sorta lost about it."

xnyh7o,32,2022-09-25,"Seriously, how screwed am I?",Throw-that--away,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/xnyh7o/seriously_how_screwed_am_i/,"I’m writing this post in hopes of getting some advice regarding my current struggle with finding a finance-related job as a recent grad. But also, if anyone is in the same boat as me and just wants to rant, I’m here for it. 

I graduated from a private college last year and obtained an economics degree (3.6 GPA). College was a huge struggle for me because I have been completely independent from my parents since I was 18 and had to work sometimes 2-3 jobs to stay afloat. The jobs worked with my student schedule were mostly blue collar jobs, and I went through several roles including barista, fast food worker, factory worker, tutor, etc. A big part of my scholarship was also contingent on my grades, so the pressure to study and know everything consumed me for all three and a half years. Because of this, I wasn’t able to do any extracurricular activities, unpaid internships, (relevant) certifications, or networking. Now I’m paying the price. 

A little after I graduated, I got a job through a shady recruiter who ultimately sent me to the worst job I’ve ever had. I won’t get into it, but while the work was easy enough, the office culture was ghastly. I was grossly underpaid ($16/hr as an analyst) and surrounded by the most dead-eyed folks I’ve ever encountered. You’d think I worked at a morgue if you had just met my ex-coworkers. I was miserable from day one, but lasted 10 months . After receiving a stream of horrifically harassing texts from my manager one day, and honestly after months of suicidal ideation, I knew I needed to quit. 

Fortunately, I have always been great with my personal finances and various investments, which gave me the option to spend time away from working. Since the day I quit, I have been applying to jobs everyday. I’m applying mostly to entry-level positions (keep this in mind!), paid internships, and only a few more-advanced roles if their experience requirements are in the 0-3 range. As someone just starting out, I don’t have a specific career path/role that I’m looking for, so I’ve been applying to a wide range of different roles. I’d be willing to try anything from accounting to analyst to account manager. On top of applying to multiple jobs a day, I have also used this free time to prepare for the SIE exam that I’m taking next month. 

It’s been nearly four months and I have applied to about 300 jobs with no success. The vast majority of places give me no response whatsoever, and the responses I do get are rejections 98% of the time. I have so far received 3 interviews, where I made it to the last round of potential candidates. However, at the end, every one of these companies rejected me for “lacking experience”. Every single one! Again, these places that interviewed me all listed their experience requirements as 0-3 years, yet I get treated like I’m applying to be a CFO or a Sr. Underwriter. I’m basically laughed out of every interview and scoffed at when I describe my previous work experience. I feel completely trapped in this paradox of not getting a job because I don’t have experience and not getting experience because I don’t have a job. 

So, what do you think? Did I completely screw myself for going to college when I couldn’t afford to reap its benefits? It’s somewhat heartbreaking that this piece of paper I went through hell and back for means nothing because I spent too much time obtaining it. Also, was it a mistake to leave my previous job instead of sucking it up and dealing with it? At times I regret leaving, but the toll it took on my mental health was becoming an incredibly dangerous price. I’m only 22 and I’m starting to get scared that I’m never going to find a decent job, especially with all the talk about a recession. No one in my family made it out of poverty, so I can’t go to them for advice on this, as they’ve never been in my position. I was supposed to be the one who made it out, but I’m about ready to go back to working at Burger King and living off their expired food again. How does one get a finance job with no experience and no certifications, just a degree? Or am I just SOL?"

In spite of my own depression and anxiety, I lean right now toward wanting to work in the field of mental health. “Girl, Interrupted” has always been one of my favorite films and Mental Health Matters is the class at school where I’m intrigued by what we’re learning. 

I enjoy completing small tasks and found during my summer internship that even though I hated work out in the hot Sun (like having to count the boats,) I really enjoyed working with the elementary school aged kids, specifically the black ones. 

I have never been a “well liked” person or idk I guess had good social skills, even though I know how to be polite in convo and can come off boring or know how to idk make small talk and am inclined to make small talk.

I have been into Myers Briggs personality types for years (like 6yrs now, I think) even though I know it’s not a valid theory and enneagram types as well. 

Even though I don’t feel “ready” to be an adult and fear change, I also want to work toward making money of my own soon. I hate living in an apartment complex and just being poor. 

I plan to start at community college, but am unclear even after researching on whether or not I can become a psychiatric technician out of high school through community. 

I have bad sleeping issues and do think I have some body image or self esteem problems. I’ve grown up black in a white/Asian city and am below average in the face and know I could wear makeup but don’t feel great about myself right now. 

Getting into nursing in my state is known for being very competitive. 

I’m surprised, bc I don’t like physiology at all like I thought I would. I even received help from the teacher on our latest quiz. I figure that’s a sign I may not like nursing. 

I’m thinking I want to move to a state with a higher demographic of black people (Atlanta seems to have the salary ranges I want but I don’t know where I’d be comfortable.) 

I’ve noticed that I can have a particularly good memory for conversations? 

Like I actually remember certain things that were said to me 6yrs ago pretty well and idk my one on one interactions w other people. I don’t “forget” people easily and can be oddly curious abt them on an individual basis

I remember that I largely liked my longest ever crush, who was half black half white (and I won’t lie, I have indeed thought about why I liked him so long, and realized that he reminds me of my brother who is in rehab) bc he had a 1.5 GPA and seemed functionally illiterate. This was in 9th grade. I figured he may have had negligent parents and wanted to help him.

My former crush didn’t want me (at least not in a good kind of way) but I remember desiring to at least reach out to his parents.

I remember a decent amount of the plot line of “Misery” which I finished Wednesday (like I certainly haven’t just entirely forgotten it even though I took breaks from reading it.) 

I think I am capable of coming off cold or maybe can but this is partly bc I’m inclined to become pessimistic due to having trouble dealing w my feelings sometimes. 

I know I have the capacity to be emotionally abusive, but certainly want to train myself to not be like this. I don’t think I’m actively, always emotionally abusive. But can be.  

I think a lot about how kids, specifically black kids, are held back from succeeding in life due to having toxic or abusive parents. And about how a social worker should have stepped in regards to my older brother (how our parents were with him.)

I have an interview coming up for a great company that I'd love to work for, but it is entirely a frontend position. I have a lot of experience in front-end with React, React Native, Electron, JS, etc, but I never really had a formal education in it so a lot of it is self taught and my terminology and ""proper techniques"" is lacking. I am studying up on promises and data manipulation in JavaScript just to be safe, but I am wondering if you guys have any advice pertaining to what level of competency these positions generally expect.

I do not know what to expect besides the fact that there may be some trivia, maybe some component design, or maybe some leetcoding in JS. If anyone has any information or advice, I'm all ears as the date is coming closer and not many people have information on this, at least for intern roles, as far as I could find.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in the 2nd year of the st lawrence computer programming and analysis course, and honestly, its super boring. I've done a lot of work in my spare time, and most of what we're doing is extremely slow review. Like, basic routing with express, and some basic templating in php. Even then tho, a lot of my classmates are asking to slow down. I guess I just don't feel challenged and like I'm missing out on stuff: we only do basic data structures, no compilers, no OS stuff, none of the more advanced parts of computing. Like, we're almost half done and O(n) hasn't come up at all, I had to learn that outside of class

&amp;#x200B;

The issue with switching to queens is that they won't take any credits until I go through all 3 years. On top of that, at the end of this year we get a 1 year internship (I mean, you have to apply, but everyone in past years has gotten one) and I hear that work experience matters the most. So should I just stick it out and hope that internship gets me a job and moves me into the workforce? Should I transfer and do a Bsc at queens? I guess I'm also just frustrated at being a poor student still at 25, so the prospect of at least another 4 years of schooling isn't great. Idk, any advice is welcome"

In spite of my own depression and anxiety, I lean right now toward wanting to work in the field of mental health. “Girl, Interrupted” has always been one of my favorite films and Mental Health Matters is the class at school where I’m intrigued by what we’re learning. 

I enjoy completing small tasks and found during my summer internship that even though I hated work out in the hot Sun (like having to count the boats,) I really enjoyed working with the elementary school aged kids, specifically the black ones. 

I have never been a “well liked” person or idk I guess had good social skills, even though I know how to be polite in convo and can come off boring or know how to idk make small talk and am inclined to make small talk.

I have been into Myers Briggs personality types for years (like 6yrs now, I think) even though I know it’s not a valid theory and enneagram types as well. 

Even though I don’t feel “ready” to be an adult and fear change, I also want to work toward making money of my own soon. I hate living in an apartment complex and just being poor. 

I plan to start at community college, but am unclear even after researching on whether or not I can become a psychiatric technician out of high school through community. 

I have bad sleeping issues and do think I have some body image or self esteem problems. I’ve grown up black in a white/Asian city and am below average in the face and know I could wear makeup but don’t feel great about myself right now. 

Getting into nursing in my state is known for being very competitive. 

I’m surprised, bc I don’t like physiology at all like I thought I would. I even received help from the teacher on our latest quiz. I figure that’s a sign I may not like nursing. 

I’m thinking I want to move to a state with a higher demographic of black people (Atlanta seems to have the salary ranges I want but I don’t know where I’d be comfortable.) 

I’ve noticed that I can have a particularly good memory for conversations? 

Like I actually remember certain things that were said to me 6yrs ago pretty well and idk my one on one interactions w other people. I don’t “forget” people easily and can be oddly curious abt them on an individual basis

I remember that I largely liked my longest ever crush, who was half black half white (and I won’t lie, I have indeed thought about why I liked him so long, and realized that he reminds me of my brother who is in rehab) bc he had a 1.5 GPA and seemed functionally illiterate. This was in 9th grade. I figured he may have had negligent parents and wanted to help him.

My former crush didn’t want me (at least not in a good kind of way) but I remember desiring to at least reach out to his parents.

I remember a decent amount of the plot line of “Misery” which I finished Wednesday (like I certainly haven’t just entirely forgotten it even though I took breaks from reading it.) 

I think I am capable of coming off cold or maybe can but this is partly bc I’m inclined to become pessimistic due to having trouble dealing w my feelings sometimes. 

I know I have the capacity to be emotionally abusive, but certainly want to train myself to not be like this. I don’t think I’m actively, always emotionally abusive. But can be.  

I think a lot about how kids, specifically black kids, are held back from succeeding in life due to having toxic or abusive parents. And about how a social worker should have stepped in regards to my older brother (how our parents were with him.)"

* Yes, Capital 1 closed their TIP internship. As a general rule, apply EARLY. Applications are on a rolling basis, and fun fact, many big companies ONLY look at the first % of applications and disregard the rest sooo...
* Great sites to apply for internships and new grad roles are WayUp, RippleMatch, Untapped, LinkedIn, Simplify, AngelList, and YC.
* No, brand name ≠ prestige!!! Despite being prestigious, your average big tech recruiter is not going to know what Brex or IMC are. Neither will most people outside of this sub and Blind.
* No, most companies will never ask for your GPA or transcripts ever. Even Jane Street doesn't (and nor do they care).
* No, LinkedIn doesn't have new grad SWE roles. They only take returning interns. For their non-technical roles, they do have new grad roles though.
* Yes, we are in a tech recession. New grad/internship recruiting this cycle has/will be more difficult.
* Yes, Computer Science is the gold standard for technical degrees. No, Information Technology/Systems are not equivalent. They aren't bad degrees, but they are not computer science degrees.
* That being said, your major stops mattering after your first big tech internship. If you're an IS major with a Google SWE internship, you'll be fine.
* Going to a non-target school stops mattering recruiting-wise if you have 1 big tech internship and are targeting other big tech companies.
* Going to a non-target school stops mattering recruiting-wise if you have 2 big tech internships and are targeting unicorns/trading/hedge funds (source: me and various recruiters at these companies I've spoken to).
* Yes, it is better to apply directly on a company's site.
* Yes, you're allowed to accept offers and renege when better ones come. Companies will not hesitate to lay you off or fire you if they want to. Be selfish. Protect and put yourself first.

Some tips I have:

1. Search the subreddit before asking the same questions again and again.
2. Stand out by attending online company events and engaging with recruiters. It's how I've skipped OAs for many big companies. RippleMatch, LI, and Untapped are GOLDEN for these events.
3. Keep your LI up to date to recruiters can find YOU, not the other way around.

Senior college student, studying IT (technically information science technology but no hirers would spot the difference). Something that I’ve come to realize is the only thing that matters in getting a fulfilling job is knowing people. I didn’t do enough the last 3 years to put myself out there, I don’t even have 2 semesters left and I don’t have friends let alone a network. My grades are mediocre, even if I got all As the next 2 semesters my graduating gpa would be like 3.3, so I can’t really put myself out there as an academic achiever. No certs or club stuff either.

I really don’t have any sense of direction after college. Beyond a degree the only experience I’ve had is 1 internship, which was this summer, IT consulting on paper, but it was an absolute horseshit experience and it felt like it had fuck all to do with IT (it’s more suited towards business majors who know keyboard shortcuts). I get really freaked out because if I can’t find something else, I’m probably gonna have no choice but to work there. Worse is the business is an extremely closed ecosystem where there’s no growth beyond the specific ways the company does things. I want above all else to never be in that particular workplace ever again in my life.

I’ve been looking on indeed for job listings, I don’t have a car and even then I’m a full time student so I’m mostly limited to remote and cannot find anything for the past 6 weeks. I’ve even been applying to places I literally couldn’t even get to just to try and have something. I don’t have a work study, but I did try applying to a few campus jobs, they just never went anywhere.

I'm in a bit of a peculiar situation as a candidate for a second bachelors in CS.

I've taken about 20 credits so far, but because I have all core classes done from my previous bachelors, I could graduate in fall 2023 if I took a normal course load. However, I've decided to just continue part time and finish in the spring 2024 semester.

The issue is that after this semester, I'll only have 3 semesters left, but in terms of coding, I'll only have taken comp sci II, which is essentially a sophomore level introductory Java course. If I apply for internships now for summer 2023, I'll definitely fail out of any technical interviews. I am trying to work on this now by doing some extracurricular work and reading, but realistically, I won't be ready for technical interviews any time soon.

Will I just have to apply for internships that are not advertised a year in advance next year? Any other suggestions?"

-President of my high school entrepreneurship club for 2 years. I was its marketing director for one year before that. 
During my time there, I help about 5+ teams won national entrepreneurship competition and international competition (4th place in materials science at the ISEF). I invited alumni from Harvards, people from the Ministry of Education in my country, successful entrepreneurs to do workshops, conferences  for the students. I raised over $250 (it's a lot in my home country currency) to organize the first ever entrepreneurship competition at my high school. Improved club members by 70%. 

-Being accepted to the Student Advisory Board of the Diamond Challenge, which is a global entrepreneurship competition for high school students. Because of that I was featured in a Top National Magazine (I was the first in my country to be in it). I gave pitching mentorship   to 4000+ Participants.

I’m originally from California and went to a UC for undergrad. Didn’t do toooooo hot, but I was pretty proud with my end results. I got a 3.45 overall and never took the GRE. I studied Business and Education, and loved them both. I was super involved and had multiple internships by the time I finished undergrad. If you’re interested in the USC Master of Public Administration and Master of Social Work dual degree I highly recommend it.

Some tips when applying: 

- Make your list NOW. December - January is when master programs are typically due, so start looking at programs that you wish to apply to, and really only apply to places you would definitely go to, I had 5 on my list but missed the deadline for one, but USC was my top choice so I ain’t mad.

- Ask financial aid to write you a letter for graduate school applications. Some schools allow you to ask for a fee waiver to apply, they just need proof that you’re on need based aid. I asked my financial aid office and they had a turn around time of two weeks. I turned in that letter to USC admissions and they gave me a free application, but they also took another week. So please give yourself enough time to get that! 

- Go to the information sessions. I really enjoyed talking to the professors to learn more, and I bet when some were reading my application, they remembered me. But regardless go because you find the school and program interesting. 

- Join a mentorship program! There was one for my specific school , where the mentor of mind had some similar interested and backgrounds and it was super cool to get his advice on my application. 

When you get to grad school:

- I have no advice on how to counteract imposter syndrome, but just know you’re a delight to this world, and you deserve good things. 

- Right when you get admitted ask them if they have any financial aid options, I’m part of some scholarship groups that I would not have know had I not asked! 

- Just know that the process of making friends will be hard at first, but I’m starting to get the hang of it. 

GOOD LUCK AND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT USC, MPA/MSW, or grad school in general, hmu!"

I'm currently an IT Service Desk WFH. 7 months pa lang naman akong SvD pero recently, I am having thoughts on pursuing Software QA testing.

I am also a graduate of Computer Science major in Software Engineering. During my college days puro basic programming lang talaga yung naggrasp ng utak ko kaya parang nagsusurvive lang ako that time. Pero naiisip ko na kung papalarin talaga gusto ko maging QA tester. Di rin ako pinalad makapag intern as QA di ako natatanggap.

Nakahanap ako dati ng QA tester na work and may bond siya. Sa pressure ko na makakuha ng work ayun pumayag ako. Kaso pag sabak ko sa training, para lang ako bumalik ng college kasi may math ulit plus may Japanese language na course bago ka makapunta sa QA testing na part. Gumawa ako ng paraan para maka alis. Buti naka alis ako after 3 months of training. Di na ko naka abot dun sa testing part. Natakot na ko maghanap ng QA work.

Then eto nakapasok ako sa Service Desk. Pasok yung training sa actual work, kaya ko yung tasks and na enjoy ko naman kahit papaano. Pero ayun nga di mawala sa isip ko mag QA. May friend din ako na nakahanap ng entry level QA work na wala namang bond and sa mga kwento niya, nagustuhan niya din naman. Pumapasok sa utak ko na ""If kaya niya, siguro naman kaya ko din.""

Yung problem ko ngayon is wala na ko alam sa pagiging QA. Naghahanap ako ng job posts na pwede career shifter pero ang nakikita ko at least nakapag intern as QA. Wala din naman akong mai-showcase na something para may fighting chance ako sa intwrviews. Pang Service Desk na yung alam ko. Willing naman ako to be trained sa programming languages/tools na need for QA testing. Pass nalang talaga sa may bond. 

May pag asa pa ba ko maging QA? Or mahihirapan na talaga ako? Lost na din ako.

Any advice/tips/insights/personal experience/stories are highly appreciated po. Thank you."

xolu4y,0,2022-09-26,[Vietnam] I as fired from an English center as a teacher. I'm fairly certain I have grounds to sue.,Khal_Andy90,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/xolu4y/vietnam_i_as_fired_from_an_english_center_as_a/,"Strap in, this is a long one. 

I worked for a center here as an intern in 2019, I took on a full time job and stayed until August that year. I went home and was stuck in the UK for all of 2020.

I returned to Vietnam with the same company I worked for before, signing a contract for 18 months with a slightly higher salary than before, working 23hrs per week. Soon after I arrived we started having serious problems with covid and many classes were cancelled for long periods of time. Causing massive money issues for me. I had to borrow a lot from family and get mamy advances at work.

During this time, the company tried to get us online work but it was very very limited, meaning teachers were working between 6 and 12 hours a week. Whem this happened the center changed our salary to having to reach a certain number of hours in the week (12) to get full salary, if we worked under that we got an hourly rate of $20 an hour. 

Also during this time the company hired many new people and built an extension to their school (which is also the owner's home) to have several new classrooms, despite having no idea when they would get to fill them. There were about 16 new teachers hired during the extensive lockdown only 3 or 4 of which were native english speakers. This means that the center could hire them out for a cheaper rate as teachers, therefore diluting the possible hours even more AND it diluted the wages our company paid out because they had more teachers on a smaller wage.

We were now all on about 0-6 hours a week. Our salary was then changed to an hourly rate for what our contracted ours would add up to if we worked all those hours. During this time i found out i was being paid less than two other teachers who arrived at the same time as me, who had the same previous experience as me. They were recieving about $18 an hour, while I was on about $14. We lived like this for around 8 months of 2021 in total and I recieved the wage I signed a contract for a grand total of twice in the first 12 months I spent in Vietnam. We were also told that if we could find better pay elsewhere we could take it and still have our jobs to come back to. This turned out to be a lie, but more on that later.

In around February/ March of this year things started to get back to normal, and we started getting full hours again. However our salary no longer seemed to be part of the contract and we were all still recieveing an hourly rate. I had been complaining a lot in general, and pointing out problems with what I'd seeen happening quite publicly; and I suddenly started getting complaints from schools i had never had issues with before.

At one point my coordinator told me the school had heard me give the wrong answers to a question, i was confused by this so I asked which lesson and question. I got a very sarcastic response which involved them wondering how knowing this information could help me with my teaching. To this day, ive never understood this.

At around the end of march, i was given a schedule of 16 hours, which did not include travel to and from. The schools (which were often up to a 2hour round trip). I asked for more time off, as I had a really busy cambly schedule and needed to be able to cut those customers off properly. I asked the center to share the hours to the other teachers who I knew needed them more than I did at this point.

I was then fired for various reasons including ""not engaging with the students"". Ive talked to several of those students since and all of them are very confused about this. Other reasons were ""not taking criticism well"" regarding the wrong answers thing, and ""working for another company"" which we were literally told we could do; and the company I used was an app. I recorded the interview where I am fired. 

They cancelled my visa and i had 7 days to leave the country, I was also fined $1000 as per states in my contract.

Luckily I was sponsored by another center, I managed to pull enough money together for a couple of days im Singapore to leave and reenter and now im very happy with my new job.

But is worth chasing this up?

Im going to bed now, but I hope someone takes the time to read this and can give me some advice. Ask any relevant, Ill answer tomorrow."

I’m 2/3 year pursuing a computer science degree in EU, and I wanted to ask you how likely it is to get an internship in the US? (Any company).

Do you have any advice or experiences regarding this? Or any companies you think could accept me (pm if necesarry, I don’t mind)

I have a pretty good resume I can say. Work experience since 1st of September, and some strong projects + some awards. I also have good grades in Uni.

This will be my first related work experience and I would really love to put it on my resume. I've been applying to internships with personal projects, etc but just wondering would it be worth it if I pause and actually do something at my new job and then put it on my resume? Or should I keep applying in the same time? 

I guess I'm just stressed because I haven't finished a project yet at the new job but I feel like it would be too late to wait until I actually finish one since I know it's better to apply asap once the position opens...

Any advice? Thanks in advance!"
xosaal,5,2022-09-26,Need advice for current job offer - should I tell my manager I will no longer be graduating?,Successful_Abroad523,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xosaal/need_advice_for_current_job_offer_should_i_tell/,"Hello everyone this is my first time posting so apologies for any errors. I don't have enough karma to post in r/cscareerquestions so I don't know where else to post. 

I am currently in college majoring in Computer Science but due to personal reasons I will not be able to finish my degree(1 year left) so this will be my last semester - I know it's good to finish but I really can't unfortunately. However, I am still in good standing. I am on the Dean's list and have a gpa of 3.76. I have multiple internship experiences at relatively good companies so far. I currently intern at a top Fortune 20 company and have interned there this summer as well. I had received an offer to return for the 2023 summer internship and a full time offer for Jan 2024(supposed to graduate in Dec 2023) during my summer internship. I have accepted both offers already. My full time offer (to my knowledge) isn't based upon me graduating or having a degree in computer science. It just says I have to pass a background check and a verification of rehire eligibility. I know people at the company(SWE's) who have degrees in other fields or don't have a bachelors at all. My question is do I tell my senior manager that I will no longer be graduating? She was the one who gave me the offer letters and actually had HR move my full time start date from June '23 to Jan'24. She's been very supportive of me and an amazing mentor. Since I have interned for them twice and they like me(always received good/positive feedback) and have a history of hiring people that aren't traditional SWE's would I still have my offer if I let them know? I guess my main question is should I let them (HR/manager) know about my predicament. If so should I let them know now or during my 2023 summer internship? I was just planning on asking if I could join full time at the end of next summer rather then wait till the date they proposed as the company is very flexible rather then explicitly let them know about me not graduating. I really like this company and would love the opportunity to work here full time. If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it!

Edit: the company has an SWE apprenticeship program so I will apply to that and hopefully have enough credibility to join full time.  For now I’m trying to get my credits transferred for an Associates degree and I basically have everything I need for one.  Hopefully in the future I’ll have the opportunity to return and finish my bachelors."
xosfni,2,2022-09-26,Worth putting retail jobs on resume?,Spartan098,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xosfni/worth_putting_retail_jobs_on_resume/,"I’m building my resume to apply for internships next summer, however I have no prior internships or software engineering experience. Due to financial reasons it’s tough for me to have time to work on other projects or comp sci related experiences, so I’ve always worked retail to make the money necessary.

Is it even worth putting those on my resume if I’m trying to get software engineering internships? Without those i would have basically nothing to put so i dont have much of a choice, but i wasnt sure if it would hinder my chances since its not directly related to what im applying for. Thanks"

I've been building general coding skills and recently completing an engineering internship that required me to heavily use SQL. I've also built a couple websites and completed the Odin Project. I ultimately would like to get a junior dev position upon graduating, so I am taking more CS classes my last two semesters.

I have the option to receive a minor in CS through the classes I am taking, however, that would require me to take a few courses (in an already packed senior schedule) for a letter grade that I would rather take pass/fail on account of them likely lowering my gpa and making it pretty difficult to dedicate time to job applications and other post-grad opportunities. GPA is also important to me for potentially going to grad school in the future. I can take them pass/fail and still learn the content, but I wouldn't receive the minor.

My question is how important is it to companies/interviewers to see ""Minor in Computer Science"" on a resume vs. listing the courses taken and languages and projects I've worked with but not having a specific CS certificate/degree? For reference, my formal classes I'll finish with would be: intro to CS, discrete mathematics, systems programming, data science 1 and 2, and maybe a computer networks class.

Everything I am about to state happened in the last 365 days.

.Was in a nationwide research competition with over 100,000 applicants. Made it to the finals with just 75 people remaining and won two prizes.

. I am an intern of one year at my country’s best college where I work as a lab assistant for a distinguished professor.

.I worked on two different really high level research projects at the college I am interning at. I will state them bellow 👇

-spectrochemical analysis of food dye using laser induced breakdown spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy.
-study of moringa oleifera leaves as an antibacterial and anticancer agent using advanced laser induced breakdown spectroscopy.
( both still not published as it takes months or sometimes years to publish a research paper but I had my professor write me a letter of recommendation as proof)

.My friend and I organized nonprofit sessions where we helped over 15 students from our school on the same competition we were in (the research competition). We even managed to help some of them get in touch with professors from different colleges in my city to help them with their projects. The sessions lasted for a couple of weeks.

.I went on an educational trip to the UK with the same organization the held the competition that I was in (only 21 people from the finalists received this prize).

-some volunteering here and there 


Honors 

-received a special plaque from my city’s minister of education.

-received a certificate from my high school for my participation in the research competition.

-another certificate from the research competition themselves.

-another certificate from oxmidca (the UK educational trip)

Yes I know they aren’t much


Academics 

I don’t have SAT/AP (financial issues and my school doesn’t provide either of those).
My CGPA is 99.28 and I am in the top 10% of my class.

No I don’t need financial aid I am full pay because I am going with my country’s “culture mission “ so they’ll pay full tuition.

posting here instead of cscareerquestions because I don't have enough karma

Current Computer Science major here,

This semester I started my second year of university. I have an anticipated May 2024 graduation date as I am attempting to fit a 4-year Bachelors Computer Science degree into three years, so I only have this school year and next school year left until I graduate and (hopefully) get a job in the comp sci field. Because I only have this next summer between now and my graduation, I want to get an internship this summer and gain job experience to make getting an actual job after graduation easier. But the thing is - I have no idea where to start.

I am a focused student. I currently have a 4.0 GPA, and I have constantly been praised for my code and have been told I'll easily find a good internship in the future. However, I have intense anxiety centered around actually getting an internship and getting a job. This has caused me to completely avoid developing myself professionally. I only recently created a github account but my profile is completely blank, and I have avoided LinkedIn altogether.

I know that personal projects are important, but I have none that I think are impressive enough. While I have completed every assignment with perfect grades, they are simple programs that do simple things such as solving mazes and games. I don't think they're anything that would impress a recruiter. I have created entire websites and video games before, but they have all been very personal projects developed under anonymous internet identities and I personally would rather throw my $800 laptop into an incinerator then advertise them in a professional setting.

Furthermore, because I am fitting a 4-year degree into 3 years and I just started my second year my classes have only increased in complexity recently. Only this semester have I finally done more things than just coding in java. I still haven't taken some of the most important classes such as data structures and algorithms and won't until future semesters, so I am worried that right now I do not have the abilities to even land an internship.

I have anxiety, but I am smart enough to realize that I quickly am running out of time if I want to get a summer internship and a job in the future and I need to do something. Does anyone have any advice?"

Similar to starting at a high school in the middle of the year. But I knew some people since I did an intern program for the firm and some people came back a bit earlier than me. 

There aren't that many people that started with me, so I've been trying my best to assimilate and make some work friends, including joining them on drinks on Fridays if I do catch them. My main avenue was through the people I knew from my previous intern program, and it worked decently well. Our hangouts aren't too bad, it's not like I'm not socialising with them or seem to have a bad relationship. I also got invited to a birthday party and got to hang out with them, gone clubbing with them a couple times etc. But there a couple times I've been excluded which I understood as I wasn't that close to the person. 

In the past two months or so, almost every time without fail it seems I would have to force myself in to hangout at lunch or drinks on Friday, and it feels fucking desperate but I hate that I have to do this after a year or so of knowing them. Their group is fairly cliquey, own group chat and everything, so I'm excluded from any plans they make within the chat. 

Recently, they had a party at the persons birthday party I was with before, drugs and drinks whatever, nothing I hadn't done before. On the day before the party, when I was sitting with them for lunch they suddenly talked about it, and immediately tried to divert the topic to something else as if it was a slip up and pretended I didn't notice. For this one I would've known everyone and it seemed to be just a cliquey thing. I was pissed for the remainder of that day and think about that moment so often. I still talk to them after that (since no choice really) and it doesn't seem like we have a bad relationship or they refuse to talk to me.

I don't really find other groups at work as interesting as this one is why I'm adamant to stick. 

To be honest it's one of the things that have fucked me since I started 4-5 months later than other people."

It's all my responsibility and I just don't understand why. I'm only one person and everyone around me just expects me to do and give and I can't anymore. I have nothing left to give.

I honestly feel like my soul is dead. I don't feel joy anymore. I don't feel happiness. I don't feel excited. I just feel exhausted and stressed out 24/7. It just makes me so depressed and I feel so isolated from everyone. Anytime I feel like I’m finally getting ahead in school or life, something happens and I’m thrown back ten steps. I’m in therapy. I’m on anti-depressants. I try to do mindfulness and meditations, self-care, reading, but I just never have the time or energy because I’m too busy taking care of everyone else 😭

Then when I do just get completely overwhelmed and react any way than peachy, everyone treats me like I’m the bad guy. “Why are you so mad all the time?” “Stop being so negative, you have so many great things going for you!” There are days when I just want to walk away from it all.

I'm a Java dev and I got huge wage increase (increased rate and hours) when I switched. I could have been underpaid in my previous job, but other contracts offered less than this one.

However, I feel out of place in my new job. The code is a two head monsters which one head is with newer tech (which I know most of it) and the other is an old dino head who just don't want to die , a guy just left a week after being hired when he saw this. 

The person I report to just got out of school. From  understand he's there because he was a good intern and know the system well.

The things is the guy is a little presumptuous f*ck. He's unreachable when we have questions about the system. He doesn't take out advice in PR if it for best practice or to add additional unit test. On top of that he's not afraid to call other code is shit without explaining why. He suggested an implementation (because that the way we do it like here) that I ended up implementing, but then when we discussed it with another dev said why are we doing it like this and blame it on me. Finally, he is completely close minded when we propose new libs, way of doing scrum or other improvement. 

He recently held has the new hero because he pulled all-nighter setting up new clients. The things is, this was late because the delay was always to tight, he refused any help except for one employee and when another dev challenged the way to create the initial setup wasn't going to work they ignored him. They now paid the price for not listening to him, but now that prick takes the credit for fixing it even though this was caused by is lack of foresight in the first place. 

Now a few months in, I don't know what to do. Should I expose the prick to the manager who seem to see him has a golden boys and hero or should I just GTFO. 

From the talk with my recruiter, he's not sure I'm going to get the same compensation elsewhere. 

TLDR: Got a huge raise when I switched job, but now I'm stuck with a junior prick calling the shot and taking all the credit. 

So what do you think? 

What should I do it the situation?"

Hello everyone,

I have been a teacher for quite a few years now for different subjects, and now moved to being a computer science teacher at the high school level.

However, high school teachers are underpaid and worked to the bone.

Though I like my place of employment and I'm actually paid a decent amount, I believe I could earn more with less time in the office in a software engineering position.

Questions:

1. Do companies recognize *teaching* computer science as experience at all? I have no delusions of thinking that three years of teaching computer science at the high school level (including AP level) is even remotely the same as working for three years as a senior software developer at Amazon, but does it count for something at all?
2. Being a high school teacher means, of course, that most of the projects I've worked on for professional purposes were relatively simple. Can I include simple-ish assignments in my application to become a software developer?
3. If I were to apply to industry, would I most likely have to start from scratch (i.e. with an internship), or can I go directly into junior positions?

Your help is really appreciated at this pivotal time in my career!"

It was 3 x 30 min rounds of technical questions, each one on one.

The first question was a leetcode easy, I correctly implemented it. I was asked a follow up question, and got that correct to. Overall the vibe was good and we talked a lot about the company and role.

The second questions is where things went bad. It was a leetcode hard, and considering I’ve been doing leetcode for only a couple of weeks, I was definitely not prepared for it. I drew out the example and walked through how to solve it. I was having a hard time coming up with a proper solution, but I got parts of the solution. I coded up an attempt, and the interviewer pointed out some flaws and I was able to fix one of them. At the end I passed 3/4 test cases, and the test case I failed was because of something I did incorrect in my code. Overall I feel this was just okay, I definitely could have done better.

The final interview I was given a leetcode medium, and I implemented the optimal solution right away. I first walked through some example, and coded it up. Then walked through my code with a test case and fixed some minor issues I had. Overall the interviewer said my solution was really clean and said I did good.

Based on this experience, would I have a good chance at an offer? I definitely did better than I thought I would. IMO I feel the 2nd interview may hurt my chances a lot, but I can’t really tell since I was kinda close. Tbh I’m really shocked I got asked a leetcode hard but it is what it is."

I just had a quick question for all the people who applied to the big 4s for an audit/assurance intern position for summer 2023. 

Have you guys heard back from any of the big 4s regarding an interview (with a manager or partner) or got an offer? Just curious because I did my hirevue interviews a while ago but never heard anything back

xp7zhb,12,2022-09-27,Advice for Finding Internship/Employment Opportunities,hieubris,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/xp7zhb/advice_for_finding_internshipemployment/,"Hello, 

I'm a 3rd year CS student who has been on the lookout for paid internships since the beginning of my Sophomore year at UCI with little to no success. When I was dorming my Freshman year, my RA painted a picture of CS and its related fields as very cut-throat and extremely competitive when it came to the job search. I kept hearing something akin to ""you have to have internship experience by your 3rd year to be considered on track"". While I technically do have experience that I can list on my resume, it was by no means a formal internship role (no technical interview, virtually no programming, etc.) and I only received the role because I knew someone who already worked there. And while it was a good experience, it understandbly--as they were a relatively new non-profit organization--offered no pay. As a first-generation, low-income student surviving off of financial aid, it's really important for me to find internship opportunities that can compensate in some form.

I guess my questions are, for anyone in CS (Students or Alumni) or just anyone who has been through or is going through the same thing: 

- Has HandShake been a useful tool for you? 
- Did you find that unpaid internships were easier to get than paid ones?
- Did your first internship lead to a full-time job during or post graduation?
- Were you actually expected to fulfill all of the requirements in job postings (knowing all listed programming languages, frameworks, etc.)?
- How has the job market changed since the pandemic?
- How many interview sessions did you typically have to go through before you were hired?
- Were there particular tools you used to help ease the interview process (I know of LeetCode, and certain textbooks, etc.) or did you just go into it cold?

TLDR: Any advice for a 3rd year CS student new to the job market and is actively looking for paid internship roles with little to no success.

Thanks!"

I did a summer internship but the company wasn't hiring so since late August I have been applying for full time positions using LinkedIn/Indeed/etc. I live in a very big city, willing to commute, and with tech jobs being the rise theoretically I have a lot of options. So far I have applied to a lot of positions and have only been rejected or given no response so far. I'm no crazy computer science coding wiz but I do have transferable skills and some experience that should help me get a programming job. A ton of entry level job listing say they need 3-5 years of professional experience so browsing and applying can easily get frustrating fast.

I am starting to feel the pressure of still being unemployed and just staying home everyday. I've always been a driven person so not having school or a job rn is making me feel lost. My parents, siblings, and family members have started asking about how the job search is going and seem surprised that I haven't gotten anything yet. A lot of my friends from college already are in full time positions. As a result I have been staying to myself a lot and avoiding certain people in my life to dodge the questions and judgment. 

I just wanted a moral boost from posting this to see if anybody has had similar experiences. I knew getting a job wouldn't be easy (especially as a woman in CS) but seeing others around me getting jobs makes me feel shitty about myself as much as I am genuinely happy to see them succeed. Any advice or criticism is accepted."

# Offer 2 - Deloitte

**Role:** Graduate Consultant - Data and AI 

**Upsides:** 

* Good culture (although I know that this may vary across teams) 
* WFH likely possible 

**Downsides:**

Burner account for obvious reasons.

I am seeking some advice as I am really unsure about what to do &amp; feeling massive FOMO.

Currently I am a first year university student, I've got a couple of years of experience in the financial industry and have just started a longer internship (think \~6) as a SWE/quant developer at a top bank in europe. This is my first pure technical position, previously I have only written code for employers as side projects. I do have excellent grades, a high LC count (can do all of blind75, total LC solved: 250) and have some convincing side projects on my resume.

I believe I'm able to get into FAANG or FAANG-like companies as a intern, at least after this current internship I'm doing rn (this is based off blind, talks with people I know at FAANG and the leetcode interview reports). My absolute goal is to get into big tech companies in the US (which are the only employers to bring in interns from european countries, too)

Now comes the problem - it seems like all the desireable positions at these big companies are being flooded with applications for summer23 internships. I am feeling massive fear of missing out due to the possibility of them closing for all applications.

What would you do in this situation? Complete the current internship and apply afterwards, hoping for summer or winter 23? Or shall I list the very little experience I have with the current position (because I just started) and apply right now? I don't really care if internships are in the summer, spring or winter - as long as I can get the experience as fast as possible.

So far ive: completed A+ and Google IT Support cert, in the middle of completing an Active Directory Home Lab, studying for my Network+, and applied to 100+ jobs so far related to System Administration, IT Support, It Analyst, and help Desk, but still no luck. 

Out of the 100ish applications I submitted, I only got 2 interview opportunities, both of which were internship positions. One was for an IT coordinator role, and the other was a System Administration internship role. Both rejected. I'm honestly not sure what's going on. One of the companies was a larger construction company in Canada (the name was PCL, and I think it's in the top 5), and the other was a smaller company. So I'm confused if something is wrong with my resume, or if I just suck at interviews, or .... If I'm just unlucky? What I'm confused about is not as to why I didn't get the job, but why am I hearing back from larger companies, and nothing from smaller companies that are looking for help desk people? That's where I wanna start, but I can't even make it to the interview stage, I just get rejected in the application process. 

The thing I definitely noted tho from both interviews, is that they wanted someone with related experience. I had none. Even though it's a student internship, they expected some kind of related work experience from me which I didn't have...so: I started applying to minimum wage jobs like at London drugs, for an IT Technician position. 

I just recently got a call from the recruiter, and I'm honestly confident I'll get the job because they were really impressed by the A+ cert, but at the same time I don't know if its the right move or not. At the same time while I'm doing full time university, should I go for the experience? Should I just keep applying and hope? Do I need more certs?? Am I not getting help desk jobs due to my availability? Should focus on graduating first and then apply to help desk roles then? (cuz majority of the available roles were full time, and obviously I can't work full time with university, unless I'm doing uni part time)

The truth is is that I'm hungry to get to work in this field and genuinely am willing to do whatever it takes to get to my end goal of Cybersecurity, but I just having difficulty with the hardest part: getting your foot in the door.

As always, any help is appreciated. Thanks for reading."

xpcrob,3,2022-09-27,Maybe being a therapist is not for me,Fast-Security-8085,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/xpcrob/maybe_being_a_therapist_is_not_for_me/,"Apology for the long post ahead. I am an early career psych and after being in training for 7 months, I have come to a slow realisation that maybe I don't want to be a therapist anymore.

To give you a bit of context, I am a late 20s female working in private practice in Australia. I have completed all your normal education including a master's and am now in my final year of internship (5+1 for those in Aus). I have always loved learning about the theoretical side of psychology and I enjoy being a listener and helping people. However, since I started my role in private practice early this year, my passion and interest have dwindled. I've thought long and hard about this but my head is not clear so your advice would be really appreciated.

I've come up with a few reasons why I don't want to be a therapist and they are ranked from the most important to the least important:

**Poor work-life balance** \- I'd say this is the most important factor for me as I value my time a lot. With the internship-related stuff like the national exam and case studies on top of the current workload, I have almost no day off for myself. I feel so stressed about this and broke down a couple of times. I genuinely feel that I can't enjoy life or work on myself with the time I've spent working.

**Poor pay condition** \- I get paid minimum wage according to the award with no benefits other than 4 weeks of unpaid leave. If I work public holidays I get no penalty rates nor a day in lieu. I understand that I am working for experience as an early career, but at the same time, I feel I am being taken advantage of. The reason for the pay is that private practice is not where the money is and so if you want money you should work somewhere else (to clarify this wasn't said to me directly but rather my boss replying to someone else online). I know practices like this are fairly common.

**Passion and values** \- I am passionate about psychology and helping people in any way, but I wonder if I have the same passion as others in the field. I always hear some of my colleagues say 'I love this job' or 'I feel so rewarded' and yet I don't feel the same. I don't love my job as they do and I don't know if I will ever love a job like that. There are moments where I do feel rewarded seeing improvements in clients, but that feeling stays in the therapy room and once I'm out, I don't feel them anymore. In counselling people talk about certain traits a therapist should have like being empathetic, and while I don't think I lack them, maybe mine is not enough. I also think some of my values don't necessarily align with the majority in the field, which really has me feeling like I can't fully belong.

**Not enough support** \- I suppose this is more about the current workplace since its model is to help early career psych. We have more than 10 people on the team but only one experienced psych, the rest is all early career. Despite how much my boss has reassured us that we can always ask for help, it doesn't match reality, especially with the quality of the help received.

**Working with parents** \- I work with people of all ages but found myself to really dislike working with children because of the parents. There were a few instances where the parents were hostile to me with unrealistic expectations even after discussing it in sessions. I just dread working with parents every time I see these appointments on my calendar. I certainly know there are things I need to work on and improve when working with parents, but I can't say I like working with them the same as some other clients.

There are definitely reasons for me to stick with being a therapist:

**Amount of money, time and effort spent** \- After spending almost 6 years on one path, I'd really, really feel like I have wasted all these years and effort. I also hate to let my family or my partner down, knowing that being a psychologist makes them proud.

**My lack of experience now and future**\- Whenever I think about this there's always a tiny voice saying perhaps I haven't given this field much of a chance. I mean, I haven't even completed a full year yet. Maybe I should just suck it up, bite the bullet and get through it. Maybe there is something in the field that I'd like, but what would that be because I have absolutely no idea at this point.

My thoughts are really back and forth and I can't make a decision. I would really appreciate your help and guidance. Thank you!"

Everything I am about to state happened in the last 365 days.

.Was in a nationwide research competition with over 100,000 applicants. Made it to the finals with just 75 people remaining and won two prizes.

. I am an intern of one year at my country’s best college where I work as a lab assistant for a distinguished professor.

.I worked on two different really high level research projects at the college I am interning at. I will state them bellow 👇

-spectrochemical analysis of food dye using laser induced breakdown spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy.
-study of moringa oleifera leaves as an antibacterial and anticancer agent using advanced laser induced breakdown spectroscopy.
( both still not published as it takes months or sometimes years to publish a research paper but I had my professor write me a letter of recommendation as proof)

.My friend and I organized nonprofit sessions where we helped over 15 students from our school on the same competition we were in (the research competition). We even managed to help some of them get in touch with professors from different colleges in my city to help them with their projects. The sessions lasted for a couple of weeks.

.I went on an educational trip to the UK with the same organization that held the competition that I was in (only 21 people from the finalists received this prize).

-some volunteering here and there 


Honors 

-received a special plaque from my city’s minister of education.

-received a certificate from my high school for my participation in the research competition.

-another certificate from the research competition themselves.

-another certificate from oxmidca (the UK educational trip)

Yes I know they aren’t much


Academics 

I don’t have SAT/AP (financial issues and my school doesn’t provide either of those).
My CGPA is 99.28 and I am in the top 10% of my class.

No I don’t need financial aid I am full pay because I am going with my country’s “culture mission “ so they’ll pay full tuition.

Essay is still in the works but I’ll make sure its outstanding.

Now I've seen TikTok influencers tell people that they can apply for analyst roles with basic Excel knowledge and communication skills. I'm wondering how many of these 200 applicants are qualified. I want to get a master's degree to set myself apart from those with just a bachelor's or Google certification. I've combed through master's degree programs and the best one I've found (MS-Business Data Analytics) offers Python, SQL, statistics, visualization, machine learning, an IT course, and database modeling, mixed with some business classes.  


While I'm earning my degree I'll be implementing what I've learned in both academic and personal data projects, and plan on doing at least two internships to get a feel for the industry. I also plan to start building a portfolio before grad school even starts (looking at a 01/2023 start date).  


Provided that post-graduation I'm watching job sites like a hawk to take advantage of opportunities as soon as they're posted, what are the chances of landing a job with these qualifications? Have I made myself desirable enough to hire? I want this career and I'm more than willing to pay the ridiculous asking price of the degree, but will this plan get me where I want to go? If not, what changes can I make? Has all hope of breaking into the field been lost? These 200 applicants are giving me second thoughts. Please help."

I worked as Data Scientist for a not-famous company in India for a year. I have also worked for 6 months as Data Science Research Intern before working as Data Scientist. 

Now: After a month of job search, I have an offer from a decent size company in Manchester (Trafford) to work as Data Scientist. My role would be focused on forecasting, and I would be paid 40K. I have two weeks to join, and I have  3 - 6 months probation period where there is only 1week of the notice period. The company is decent as far as I can tell, the city is a little expensive, and the role also looks good. 

Question: Now, since I don't know much about the job market in the UK, am I paid fairly depending on location and my experience? Should I keep looking for other jobs during the probation period? How does it affect my resume? I don't think I should leave a job before a year. There are too many questions so some suggestions would be good."

xpievf,26,2022-09-27,Feeling useless as an intern. Is this normal?,Mizuki_Hashida,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/xpievf/feeling_useless_as_an_intern_is_this_normal/,"Hello everyone.

As described in the title, I feel useless as an intern. For obvious reason I will not disclose the specifics of my internship but for context I will say that I am a polytechnic student who just began their internship journey a few weeks back.

Is it normal to feel useless as an intern in a tech company? I’ve been asking my colleagues for help on my work, not without initial attempts and efforts of course, but I feel that I am asking too much from them. I worry that I make others think of me as incompetent.

To be frank, I would call myself a slow worker, but I always try to make up for it by putting extra effort such as having to work past working hours. I’m unsure whether my colleagues will see my efforts or see me as an added burden, but having to deal with the thought of not being up to their expectations gives me constant stress and anxiety.

So once again, is it normal to feel useless as an intern? Are high levels of stress and anxiety experienced by new interns to be expected? How do I know if I am doing just fine or doing poorly?

I’m genuinely hoping to make my internship journey a positive one and I’ll appreciate everyone’s answers and opinions as I am looking for ways to ease my mind off of this topic."

Hi,

So I’m looking for some advice in relation to my career path. I left college about a year and a half ago with an IT management degree. Straight after finishing up, I started a role on a Helpdesk at a fairly large Irish MSP

Things went really well from the start, really enjoyed getting my hands dirty in regard to troubleshooting and doing L1, 2 and occasionally 3 tickets.

I found my place among the team nicely, and was soon training all new support staff. I was given the task of managing two interns, as a direct line manager, as well as overseeing their overall internship. 

A few months ago, they offered me a new position as a team coordinator, along with a really big pay increase. I’ve been enjoying it so far, and like the hybrid of both overseeing/some-what managing day to day support stuff, and still getting my hands dirty with being a L1, L2 and occasionally L3 support tech. 

I genuinely feel like I’ve won the lottery with this company, I get on so well with everyone and can genuinely see myself staying here for the foreseeable future. I realise it’s my first IT job, and it might be too early to say the above, but the work life balance, remote working policy, and overall culture are absolutely great, and I haven’t a bad word to say.

Where I feel I need advice is the following; I feel like I am on a really good path, management wise. I understand I have very little experience in this area, but I feel I am being trained to eventually go this route. However, I really enjoy the technical stuff, and getting right down into issues as well. I have a big interest in the cloud, and have done some certs as well as work on cloud-related services very often.

I realise this has become a bit long-winded, but I suppose I’m just looking for advice on what path I should take? Anyone I’ve talked to about it previously has said “well which aspect do you enjoy most?”. And the answer to that question is, both. 

Also, I realise work isn’t solely about compensation, but I’d be interested to see which route may warrant a higher wage? For example, would a Cloud Engineer get paid more than a Service Desk manager, or Service Delivery Manager? 

Any advice or feedback is greatly appreciated!"

xpo33c,2,2022-09-27,Should I put roblox game development on my resume?,trixanim,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xpo33c/should_i_put_roblox_game_development_on_my_resume/,"Current CS major here with a May 2024 graduation date,

I'm currently trying to build a resume to use to get an internship this summer and I want to put some projects on my resume to show off my skills. From 2018 to 2021 I independently developed an entire roblox videogame franchise where I built numerous games and a promotional HTML/CSS-based website, youtube channel, and discord server. My roblox profile is sitting at \~200k visits and the games all have good like-dislike ratios 91% or above. I am retired but I still regularly interact with my fanbase and if bugs are ever reported to me I go in and fix them. 

Is this worth putting this as a project on my resume? If I did I might make some points about coding in lua, interacting with fans and other game developers, gathering user feedback and solving bugs and making improvements based on said feedback, the website, sound design and creating an entire soundtrack, visual design, being my own boss and working independently, etc. I think this would be a good way to show off both hard skills (coding, bug solving, HTML, proficiency with social media, etc.) and soft skills (communication, interacting with people, independence, etc.)

The reason why I hesitate to put this on my resume is because of the fact that its roblox. I know recently roblox has been getting more attention as a legitimate game platform with talented developers, but I'm still concerned about being laughed at. Other than this the only other projects I can think of putting on my resume are simple school assignments like maze solvers and game solvers. 

Should I put it on my resume and not mention that the platform I posted the game on is roblox? What are the odds that someone looking at my resume will search up the project? What do you think?

Thank you for any responses."

For context, I am a junior and I was a Finance student and realized I wanted to do Software Engineering. My college did not let me transfer into CS because they have a credit window (can't have over 59 credits) and I passed that with my business classes. So I switched my major to Computational Math. I will be able to graduate on time, however, my concern is getting an internship during college and overall a job after college. CS wise, the degree has Intro to programming, data structures (currently taking), disc math (currently taking), Data structures &amp; algorithms (taking next semester), graph theory, and elementary combinatorics. For the rest of the degree, it is mainly higher-level math and some stats.

I just want to get past the ATS scanners and at least get the chance to interview, so if you have any feedback at all, would be greatly appreciated.

xps2zj,2,2022-09-27,How to Un-Screw My Career Trajectory? (Full Stack Developer Dreams),medusa15,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xps2zj/how_to_unscrew_my_career_trajectory_full_stack/,"Age/Gender: 37F

Background: 4 yr Bachelor's in History/Anthropology (2007), Associate's Degree in software development from local community college (2015)

Languages studied: SQL, Java, a few classes in Objective-C and Python. Mostly self-taught. 

Career Trajectory So Far: Support position (2010) &gt; Implementation data specialist (2014) &gt; Custom Project Developer (2021), all within the same company

**Digging Myself Into a Hole**

When I first went to college, despite always having an interest in tech (I taught myself HTML/Javascript so I could make HP fanfic Geocities webpages, oh yeah, feel your age) I knew I couldn't hack the math classes. 

About 2 years after graduation I got a Support position at a small-ish company that built its own software product. I learned SQL on the job, and eventually some programming languages through my classes. After I graduated, I was able to work on some minor Java code as a side project for a different department while continuing to grow my knowledge of our company's database. 

I really love SQL, but always wanted to be a full stack developer. In 2016, the side project started turning into an actual product line. Our chief needed all the help he could get, so promised to give me a hybrid position where I could actually start coding. Our older developers were more than happy to mentor me. I published one or two minor enhancements as the product started ramping up... and then the entire project was canceled in March 2020 due to COVID. 

I'm including this to explain why I never bothered applying outside the company between 2015 and 2020, as I thought I'd be able to be part of the new product team.  

**Current Position**

After my project was canceled, I went back to my original team and continued to do SQL. Last summer, a developer position opened up on a custom project team. I technically lacked the 3+ year experience with Java, but the manager/head developer was willing to give me a chance because I'd been doing minor (and I mean really minor) Java coding for him on the side. 

However, it turns out this isn't really a developer position in the traditional sense. 90% of the projects I do require SQL only. On the rare occasions Java is involved, my developer usually ends up doing the entire thing and just having me watch ""to learn."" The few times I tried on my own, he disliked the coding I'd done and pretty much tossed all of it.

We also don't have any kind of traditional set up. My head developer is a little old school, and heavily resistant to using JIRA or Git. We don't have product analysists or QAs; we meet with the customer ourselves, write up the design document ourselves, create the test scenarios ourselves (and this is done manually, not unit tests or anything fancy), and publish the code independent of any other project or code base. Our repo doesn't have branches so much as just a single commit trunk. 

**Self Taught**

I have been trying to improve my Java skills on my own with places like Team Treehouse, but the few times I've gotten to a technical interview with other companies, they disqualify me because I have no actual work experience with agile development, SCRUMs, Jenkins, or most development tools. My Java coding isn't strong enough to make up for this, and I don't have a four year CS degree to fall back on. One hiring manager suggested I apply for an intern position there, but that would be a massive pay cut from where I am.  

I know I won't get the kind of actual developer experience I'd need to get hired anywhere else at my current position. But it pays okay and is pretty comfortable for my skills. Is my dream of becoming a full stack developer impossible?"

I secured a WFH (Work From Home) job through my internship and I am making so much money right off the bat with opportunities to move up and make more. I literally just wake up, go to my morning meeting and relax for the rest of the day. I feel so lucky to be afforded this opportunity that I wouldnt have had I slacked off in college and dropped out. I just wanted to brag to everyone a little bit about how much work I've put in to get into a job where I get paid to literally do nothing. I love this job and I love my life. Soon, I'll be buying a porsche at age 23 and it was all paid for by me playing league of legends for 12 hours a day.  Just some advice for the rest of you college goers, dont give up and push through the hard times and cheat a little sometimes if you have to, thats what I did and look where I'm at now."

xpu60t,3,2022-09-27,Would you rather work...,BarelyBearableHuman,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/xpu60t/would_you_rather_work/,"4 full days a week and one morning **OR** 3 full days, and 3 short mornings 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about to start a 6 months internship, which means that if I hate it, I'll only have to bear it for a few months... But I picked the latter. 

Basically, what I value the most is my free time. On a free day, I will wake up slightly before noon, as I like to go to bed pretty late. That means that my free time only begins in the afternoon anyway.

Considering all that, the second option gives me 4 free afternoons per week, as opposed to 3 going with the first option.

And the full days still end early enough (6.30pm) that I can enjoy my evening.

Ultimately, the second option forces me to have a healthier lifestyle, waking up earlier, etc. I feel like I'm only losing on bedtime, while the other option costs ""fun"" time.

I still have the possibility, I believe, to talk to my employer and tweak my planning into the first option by moving one morning to an afternoon shift.

I'm genuinely wondering because most people have reacted like I was crazy towards the 6-days week, and while intimidating, it feels like time flies in 3.5 hours morning shift. To me it's more like 3 days, and 3 that aren't as annoying compared to 4 days and one that's not as annoying. I don't know."

I’m a polish-german student currently in my last year of high school in Germany with pretty good grades. Soon, I’ll need to decide what university to attend for my bachelors in Computer Science. I’ve narrowed down the choice to 4 universities: ETHZ, TUM, TU Delft and University of Warsaw. I’ve thoroughly analysed all options and compiled a list of pros and cons for each one. Unfortunately, without experience in quant, big tech, consulting or US grad schools myself, I can’t really prove the validity or real-world weight of said points. These are my main long-, mid- and short term goals:

&amp;#x200B;

* (Long: After Masters) Get into quant prop shops (SWE or Trader) and/or FAANGM (PM or SWE)

&amp;#x200B;

* (Long: After Masters) If that doesn’t work out, short stint with MBB consulting in CH or DE as plan B to help with the FAANG PM path

&amp;#x200B;

* (Mid: After B.Sc) Preferably doing masters at top US grad school (1st: seems like the best move for all 3 career paths / 2nd: childhood dream of mine was to study in the states. If not bachelor, why not masters?)

&amp;#x200B;

* (Short: During B.Sc) Preferably many internships / visiting researcher roles around the world during my studies. If not possible at the uni with the best prospects described in previous points, that’s too bad. It’s not a deal braker.

To not trash the post, I’ve included the pros &amp; cons list in the comment. Any help / insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time!"
xpwwaq,20,2022-09-27,C1 Power-Day Tips,Calendar_Pretend,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xpwwaq/c1_powerday_tips/,"Networking and leetcode has finally paid off for me! I had my power-day yesterday and just signed the offer to be an intern for C1 next summer. Im so happy to finally be done with this, and I know everyone else just wants to be done too, so 
here are some tips for those who have their power-days coming up:

For the technical— both the coding and case interviews— KNOW the qualities of your LITTLE data structures backward and forward. By data structures I mean stuff like tuples, strings, doubles, dictionaries, sets, and lists. The questions were also all relevant to possible capital one needs. 

The coding was more being smart about how you store different types of data given the context of how the data is going to be used. There’s not any crazy iterations or anything. 

The case study is a lot of reading code, telling the interviewer what it’s doing line by line, and then saying what could be improved about it. 

And the behavioral is like every other behavioral interview. 

Good luck!!!"

I’m a computer science major who is studying for my masters (am a freshman atm) but choosing where to work during the school year isn’t exactly as easy as your summer job, obviously. My school has an IT department that students can work for that seems like pretty great experience and allows a little bump to my resume when I am to apply for internships in the tech field. 

On the other hand though, you have jobs like Doordash that allow more flexibility in your schedule (which would be extremely helpful) and just pay significantly more. I’m not just referring to Doordash but many jobs in the area. This is not a straightforward do this or do that question of course, but I’m just stuck at a cross roads and am having a hard time choosing. Anyone got any pointers on what I should choose here? This isn’t going to be a full commitment, I hope to get an internship instead as I progress through college, but the choice still matters, thanks so much for the help in advance."

xpy19y,1,2022-09-27,[Advice Needed] How do I become a Product Manager?,DoomSleighor,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xpy19y/advice_needed_how_do_i_become_a_product_manager/,"Hi all. I'm 27, and for the last 4 years I've worked in the tech industry, first as a software developer and then as a firmware test engineer. 

However, after my firmware test job ended (contract position) I found myself at a bit of a crossroads, where I realized I didn't really have any passion or talent for CS Dev-type roles. So for the last year, I haven't worked really at all, I've just been living off my savings, trying to figure out what types of jobs I might be better at, and might enjoy more than I do standard Dev stuff. I've lately been applying to things that interest me, random Helpdesk-type roles that seemingly don't require a lot of experience, customer service type positions, etc. but so far I've just been met with rejection. Experience matters, who'd have thunk. 

A Product Manager is a role that, on paper, appeals to me. I enjoy interacting with others, coming up with schedules, big picture type stuff, leading meetings, ""managing"" others, etc. At my last role I got to do some of that, though it wasn't part of my actual job description, and always enjoyed it when I did. 

So, I had an idea - start applying to Product Manager internships, and see if I can get some experience that way. However, so far I've noticed that most of these internship roles require you to be actively pursuing a bachelor's, etc. with a graduation some time in 2023 or 2024. And, well, I finished my bachelor's in 2017, so...yeah. 

So now I find myself not really knowing what to do, or where to go from here. Am I just turbo-boned in terms of finding a job as a product manager? I'm fine with putting in the work, with grinding my way there, whatever it takes, I just need a little guidance on what steps to take. 

Appreciate any advice. Thanks."

This is my first post on this kind of sub so feel free to let me know if I’m doing anything incorrectly or if it would be more appropriate to post this somewhere else. 

So, I’m a 21 years old M Canadian graduating CS next year and I’d like to go work somewhere else for a bit. I don’t have any family or relationships abroad so that’s not a possible route for me to get any visa. I don’t know much about European visas and I did get quite a bit confused when I tried to look them up. 

I tried researching salaries and everything online and so far it looks like the most decent place (quality of life + opportunities + salary) for a CS grad would be the US. Salaries in Europe seem to be a lot lower than they are here in Canada but I’d still be willing to take a slightly lower pay to experience a different culture and enjoy life a bit.

I’m not sure however how feasible it is for a CS grad to get any visas at all, it seems like most countries have designed their system to keep as many people out as possible haha. Which countries would be feasible for me to go to? Is the US feasible at all? What about the UK? Is Australia feasible and how is the tech industry there? 

I’m also graduating with a few internships that add up to a year and a half of experience or so, but I don’t know if that makes any difference. I speak English &amp; French (making Switzerland another possibility if it’s worth exploring!).

Thanks!"

I currently have two internship offers for summer 2023 but I don’t know which one I want to take. 

I have a return offer from American Express (I was a software engineering intern for them this past summer) and an offer from Dell Technologies. 

I enjoyed my time at AmEx but I’m not sure I want to continue with FinTech. I think Dell sounds like a step closer to big tech (Google, Apple, etc.) but I don’t know much about the company and I still haven’t gotten my official offer letter with all the offer details. 

Any thoughts? 

Also has anyone else interned at Dell and would be willing to to offer some insight? 

Thank you!"

**Essay:**

Generally I'm pretty good at writing, for the commonapp essay I'm writing about the struggle between my religion and sexuality while relating it to my love of horror. I'm super obsessed with anything macabre, and what I read/watch in horror media seems to always serve as a good metaphor for my experiences with both religious and sexual identity.

**Schools:**

UMD- Hopefully honors college (EA)

Syracuse (EA)

OSU (EA)

GWU (RD)

Boston University (RD)

NYU (RD)

Brown (RD)

I'm not applying ED to any schools because I'm unsure of the financial aspect, and also if I am able to get into UMD Honors I'd most likely want to go there. 

I know some of these schools are reaches, even if I get in I most likely will not be able to afford them anyway. I just want to see if I'd get in. I'm really hoping for UMD Honors since I've had family who were accepted into the honors college and loved it. I'm not sure if my SAT would keep me from getting in though.

I know my SAT score isn't super great, I'm not sure which schools to apply test optional to. Especially since my reading is decent, it's just my math that sucks, and I don't want to have anything to do with math anyway. So any advice on that would be appreciated. 

Have taken/is taking 9/14 AP's offered at my school. (Will not take Calc, Calc BC, Physics, or APUSH). The only AP you are allowed to take before junior year is computer science. (I HATE coding, didn't even know binary leading into the test, hence the 3)

My school has no clubs. I'm not joking, there literally is not one club in my entire school. I tried to start a book club my freshman year but it only had like 5 people and died out because of covid :( Wouldn't be able to join anyway because of sports, but still.

Anyone have schools they'd recommend looking into? Somewhere northish, mid size, good for my major, close to a city? Law school feeders?"

xq3b16,0,2022-09-28,I have a crush on my best friend and I can't stand her boyfriend. I want to be a good friend but I am having a very difficult time.,Cultural-Salt7059,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/xq3b16/i_have_a_crush_on_my_best_friend_and_i_cant_stand/,"yes the title sounds bad, because it is. my friend (18 F) got out of a toxic relationship back in march. right after the breakup, i (18 f) began to develop feelings for her, which i kept a secret (obviously). as the summer started, she repeatedly talked about how she wanted to be single for a while, maybe go on a couple of dates, but nothing serious. towards the end of june, i told her how i felt. she said she felt the same way, but still had some healing to do from her previous relationship. Obviously i understood, and didn’t try to peruse anything with her. unbeknownst to me, around this time she met a guy on a dating app. i’ll call him bruce. bruce (21 m) was in our state for the summer, doing an internship. They went on what she told me was a really terrible date, but he ended up planning the next three dates at the end of the night. over the course of around two weeks, my friend and i started hanging out almost nonstop. it was also during this time that she told me she thinks that her and i are soulmates. She at this point is very obviously flirting with me, to the point our other friends are pointing out how obvious it is. then one or two days later, she posts her first selfie with him. i felt very weird about this, but i didn’t say anything. a week or so after that, bruce posts a picture of her on his instagram story, galling her his girlfriend. she later told me that he never officially asked her to be a couple, but she went along with it anyways. At this point so should mention that my friend is asexual, and has never had an interest in having sex in the 10 years i have known her. From when they became “official” all he talks about in the groupchats they're in is sex, and how much they have of it. Way too many details its disturbing. A few of my friends that are couples joke about their sex lives sometimes, and thats totally fine. The problem with this is that it is constant. I know nothing else about this dude except for how much he has sex with my friend. I tried to tell him that it makes me uncomfortable, and a few of our other friends chimed in that it also makes them uncomfortable, so it's not just me being jealous. I asked my friend about how she feels that they continuously have sex even though she's not interested, and she just told me she ""lets him do what he wants"". Bruce ignored me when I said it made me uncomfortable, and is still constantly talking about their sex life, and it is grossing me out so much and making me dislike him a lot. 

Also at one point, one of our mutual friends told my friend that I don't like Bruce. The entire time they have been together I have tried extremely hard to be supportive of them, despite my feelings towards my friend and my not-so-positive feelings towards Bruce. My friend posted anonymously on yikyak, saying that she has rejected me multiple times (not true) and that she isn't sure if trying to preserve our friendship is worth it. All because I wasn't a big fan of a boy she met less than three months ago. Obviously, this was upsetting to me, considering that we have been friends since we were very young. 

Another situation worth mentioning is the time we took edibles. during this time, it hit my friend much harder than it hit me. She went on a rant about how she liked both me and Bruce, and then she tried to kiss me. (I say ""tried"" because I had to stop her. She was obviously impacted by the edibles much more than I was and I wasn't about to let that happen). 

He leaves town at the end of this week and I don't know where to go from here. They plan on doing long distance but I have a feeling thats not going to end well. She says she genuinely really does like him, but I'm really worried for her. Putting my crush on her aside, it's really hard to see her with this guy that is almost a copy of her toxic ex. I need help. I don't plan on pursuing anything romantic with her even if she does end up breaking up with him. I am just worried for my friend and what will happen when he leaves, and if they try to pursue long distance. I am trying my hardest to be supportive, but it is not coming easily to me."

xq3yk9,5,2022-09-28,I hate my mom and I need advice,Fist-FullofFingers,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/xq3yk9/i_hate_my_mom_and_i_need_advice/,"I hate my Mom, I hate her so much, I've known this since I was 7 and at the time I thought the feeling would have changed, but she is the problem and I have to confront that now. 

I want to date really really bad, but it feels like there is a block in my psych, I get the same thing when my life gets a little bit better. I think I'm still scared of women and I feel really shitty about it, I'm tired of thinking every woman I care about will turn into my mom when I show interest. I'm upset knowing that her abuse created this negative self worth and this crippling fear. I feel real shame knowing that I was addicted to porn for such a long time(I've quit now) because it felt like the best way to deal with my fear and self worth. I feel real shame being my age(22), a virgin and still scared.  I've ruined so many potential relationships because I thought I was subhuman. She has personally interfered with so many friendships I've had over the years. 

My Mom is full of hate, she hates trans people and will make jokes about their ""fetish"" or murder at random. She hates gay people and had a melt down when I had a gay friend in middle school and joked about my sister killing herself when she came out as bi. I got mad about my mom for joking about my sister killing herself; my dad and her didn't talk to me for nine straight days after throwing things at me. She made fun of me constantly as a child after I was diagnosed with dyslexia, I went from smart to stupid over night and the rest of my family joined in.  

My Mom since as early as I can remember told me that she never wanted kids, and how birthing me and my siblings ruined her body, teeth, hair, etc. She never wanted to be around her children and sent us all off to camp to avoid spending time with us and would say that. She was a fat kid growing up and we obsessed with my diet and I ate less because of her obsession with fat.  

Whenever I try to apply myself she will lock me out of the house or leave threatening phone calls. She did this when I was a theater intern for school, when I did track and field and when I did stand up comedy. She would always make the threat of violence an option in the house. 

If I ever get sick I get made fun of by the rest of my family or treated like a mental patient. I have to be a stoic husk to operate in my own home. Otherwise I'm too stupid or sensitive or something that is weak whenever I show any emotion. As the oldest I was deterred from doing anything I wanted to do because it couldn't possibly led to a career, but all my family thought I was capable of was being a plumber or someone who pushed grocery carts.

I've called so many suicide hot-lines and written so many suicide notes over the past four years because I know I can't trust my parents.  

I work holidays so I don't have a full day with my family. My aunt, father and siblings will always take my Mom's side, because they can't handle her yelling. I'm furious at my Dad for allowing this to happen the most and just saying, ""listen to your mother"" ""she means well"" or ""don't tell her anything"". I know being the oldest makes me the automatic punching bag and it is heart breaking seeing my brother and sister copy the actions of my Mom. I have no one to confide to in my home. 

Does anyone have any advice for overcoming my Mom's abuse? My plan the past few weeks has been to pack a lunch and spend 12 hours out of the house. Go to class, finish some homework and side writing and meet friends at a movie. I feel a lot better with this and finally getting my Mom to stop texting me when I'm away from home. Is there any other thing I could be doing to avoid her? I'm sorry this is long."

I am a freshman in college who picked CS because quite frankly I didn’t have anything I truly liked. At the beginning of this month I started school, so this was truly the first time I actually was around anything coding related. Think absolute beginner. 

Anyways, fast forward to now and I enjoy it and mostly understand it (it’s an intro to CS class so code is not too difficult just new to me). I of course am thinking of long term and the future and absolutely know that I must have some internships in the bag to get a decent job after grad. But I am completely lost on where to begin. The only experience I have to put on my resume are the menial retail and food jobs I’ve worked over the last 3 years.

Was a ""gifted student"" in school, burnt out completely by Year 11-12 and had to drop out and take an alternative route to unit. Been in and out of Uni for nearly 8-9 years now, due to severe depression/anxiety and not being diagnosed/treated. 

Have been told it's ""still up in the air"" if I'll ever be able to work/study full time, currently only doing part time (10 - 20 hours a week depending on how hard the unit is) but am FINALLY in my last year of my degree. Yay!

So I decide to sign up with a disability network for internship opportunities for summer break. 

One of the questions on the form is ""Personal Achievement \*"". Asterisk: ""please avoid using information related to your disability"".

Because of that question, I have avoided filling out that form for over a week because that question just makes me hate myself. Every personal achievement I can name in the last 10 years has been related to my MI/ND. 

Hell, I consider it a personal achievement when I can get out of bed and do the basic bare minimum of helping run the household (50% shared with my sister between me, dad and her). I consider it a personal achievement when I can convince my ADHD toddler brain ""hey, we've gotta study for an hour or two"" or ""hey, we've gotta get this assignment done"". 

I'm angry, I'm scared and I don't know what to do."

However, due to medical reasons, I had to suspend my studies for the Oct 2021 - Jun 2022 academic year to now. Would I need to make this explicit on my resume, or is it fine just putting my graduation date as 2023? I would rather just put my graduation date as 2023 as I don't want to confuse the employer into wondering why I took an extra year to finish my Bachelor's (and I feel adding the medical explanation would clutter the resume); but I was just wondering whether this would adversely affect me if later down the line they question me upon receiving my degree certificate. 

Furthermore, I did an internship last summer (2021), which was meant to be taken during my penultimate year of study (but of course me having suspended my studies for a year has caused that to not be the case), and I was wondering if it would be a bad idea to essentially lie and say I did the internship this summer instead (2022), as I want that internship to be the highlight of my professional experience. If it is a bad idea to do that, I guess the best alternative would be to just put down a project that I did this summer instead? (And leave the internship in the resume with the correct date).

Any help would be appreciated!"

During that month a lot of stuff was needed done on FE including a big refactor and tech lead decided I was needed here which I decided why not I’ll see this through and start working on BE after it was done, this took another 3 months. 

Straight after the refactor tech lead assigned me features to build out on the FE which I raised concerns to my tech lead AND manager saying it’s been 6 months and still not touched BE. I was then assigned some beginner tasks (think 1 hour of work) for like a week complimented with more heavy FE tasks (which take week+), being told I could fulfill my fullstack role doing this by tech lead (fullstack by being 1% BE and 99% FE)

I decided then I would just focus on being a really strong FE engineer, as I really don’t want to bail out 6months in. 6 months later they’ve hired an intern and he’s been solely working on BE tasks.

My questions are will this hinder my growth as a BE developer and will it be harder to switch to a senior BE role in the future?

Who is pulling the strings here, tech lead or manager?

Is it time to leave?

P.S. it’s not that they don’t have enough work on BE, there’s a lot to do.

Today is day 3 since I realized I want to quit my job asap. But I can't for a while. Longer story below, I appreciate your advice on what to do, but also welcome your jokes or fun ideas.

So, I am a mechanical engineer in a not-so-shithole-but-still-a-shithole Eastern European country. I got my bachelors degree 1.5 year ago, but I have been working at my company for 3 years now, as a trainee before my degree. I came here with 1 year of experience as trainee already. Currently, I am doing my Masters while working full time here. My thesis is connected to the company, so if I want to get my degree as scheduled, I cannot quit for another 6-8 month.

But. My salary was sh*t starting out, but I hoped I will get a raise soon enough. In the meantime, inflation hit hard in my country (over 15%), and currently, my wage is about 60% of what an average mechanical engineer with ~3 years of experience earns where I live (as of today, my hourly wage after taxes is about 4$, lol). I could use some more money, for we are planning a wedding and renovating a home with my SO. Work itself here was not too interesting or fun since the beginning, but they really helped me as an intern with my education, and it was invaluable at the time. But now, help is not that essential anymore, work is still not too much fun, and my wage is still baaad. 

Monday, I finally got enough courage to go to the big boss and ask for a payraise, telling him I own 60% of the average, and that is too low. He said he can't raise right now, but we will talk about it in january. No further talk, he ended our conversation right there, and I don't feel like he wants to promise or give anything. So, I decided to quit as soon as possible, but that still means at least 6 months, sadly. Of course, my motivation is way low now, I have trouble even getting up in the morning... Unfortunately, pretending to work and doing something else does not work, my little boss has a clear view of my monitor from his place and sees if I'm working or not :(

Soo, what would you do in my place? Any survival advice, or similar experience? Any funny ideas of getting along?

Cheers, and have a better day at work than I do :P"
xq9zeh,2,2022-09-28,"I'm thinking of switching my major, but I'm really scared and hesitant",killjoyforkirito,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/xq9zeh/im_thinking_of_switching_my_major_but_im_really/,"I'm 20NB, and I've been doing a law degree for the past 2.5 years (it's a 5 year course in my country, so I'm halfway through). Honestly, I never wanted to do law, I always loved computers but never pursued it because I thought I was going to be railroaded into law anyways by my mother.

I got my first ever internship this year. It's at a private law practice, and...I hate it. It's just so soul-sucking and honestly? It bores me out of my mind. I hate the whole environment around law, I hate dreading five out of seven days of the week. I hate how localized law is, if I'm studying the law of my country, it doesn't apply anywhere else and I'll be stuck here. I'm constantly exhausted and depressed. I truly can't see myself being happy doing law. But I stuck with it so far because I didn't want to disappoint my mother.

I've been getting worse, I truly can't remember the last time I wasn't drained and borderline suicidal. People ask me how I am and I just shrug and say ""surviving, i guess"". I don't want that to be my life until I'm able to do a second bachelor's degree. So I'm seriously considering switching my major to computer science. Since I'm a US citizen, I might even be able to transfer to a US university to complete my degree there. I've even been trying to relearn math so I can maybe switch next semester, since I'm already halfway through the semester.

I'm excited, but I'm terrified. What if I switch and end up hating it too? I remember being 13 and being so excited because I was trying to teach myself coding and I made a really shitty text adventure game on a .bat file. It was the most fun I ever had, but I'm scared that I'll become jaded and end up miserable again, but this time I'll only have myself to blame. And if I do make the switch, I'll lose all my credits, so I have to be sure about what I'm doing or else I'll end up with no degree at all.

I wish I had switched earlier, but I didn't have the opportunity. Now I'm hesitant because I'm already halfway through the degree, but is it really worth it if I'm miserable? What even would my job opportunities be if I did switch to computer science? Will I even be able to leave my family and friends to go to university in US, especially my dog?

tl;dr: halfway thru law degree, hate law, want to switch to compsci. dont know if it's worth it and scared i'll end up hating compsci too"

Is is a good position from where to start?)  


I actually like that company in general, very much, but I'm not sure about the position. They had also contacted me months ago and I had said no because I was following another work experience, now it's the second time they reach me, so I feel like they are ""desperate"" and it doesn't look suitable for the position. On the other hand, that's a very big company and no one of my friends who have studied for my same degree in the same city has been contacted before by this company for the position, so it doesn't look like they'd just take anyone.  


I'm just very confused, I'd like to get further info, thanks in advance to anyone who'll comment."

xqbv3b,4,2022-09-28,I (an absolute noob in software development) will join Amazon as an SDE-1 next summer. How do I prepare myself for the job? Please read details in the text below.,chalta_hai,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/xqbv3b/i_an_absolute_noob_in_software_development_will/,"I am a final-year BTech student not from CSE/DSE/EE/ECE/any other circuit branch. Amazon recently visited our campus to hire SDEs and I was selected purely on the basis of my DSA skills. I wasn't asked a single question from any topic other than DSA.

I haven't made a single software-related project in my life (or any kind of project, for that matter) and I don't know the first thing about CS fundamentals. I did take several CS/DS elective courses (DBMS, DSA-1, Basic Data Science etc), but my I didn't really score well in those and whatever little I had learnt, I have forgotten. I do remember the basics of DBMS, of course (database schemas, keys of schemas, entity-relation models etc), but I'm pretty sure that's useless 

The thing is, it was only about 7-8 months ago that I decided I definitely wanted to have a career in software. I started grinding Leetcode and Interviewbit and, thanks to my prestigious institute, got the opportunity to apply for Amazon (via campus placements) and got in somehow. Truth be told, I still haven't digested the fact that I was selected. 

My question is, how do I prepare myself for this job - and for a career in the software field at large? I know I have plenty of people to guide me - dozens of accomplished developers on my campus and in my friend circle as well - but I still feel there's nobody quite in the same boat as I am. I am a noob in the literal sense of the word - I didn't even do an internship. 

I just don't want to be lost on my first day at the company. I want to be well-prepared and start contributing right away.

Based on conversations with my friends, it seems the best thing to do right now is to familiarise myself with CS fundamentals like operating system and computer architecture etc.

But where do I start and how do I go about the whole thing? Can you guys please share some resources? Or should I just refer to course slides of my institute (don't really like the idea of it tbh)?

Also, I only know C++ and Python (very basic) atm. Should I learn more about these languages? They seem to be the most popular.

I have also started doing competitive programming and resumed my Leetcode exercises to keep myself sharp, but again, that's only DSA."

I know that Cybersecurity isn't a very entry level job but after being a software engineering intern for almost a full year I don't really like software engineering, tbh I think it was a bit more the companies fault as they just randomly stopped giving me work and went radio silent for a while (fully remote too which probably didn't help either).

Anyways I'm trying to find good entry level jobs for me to start applying for now and I'm mostly seeing a few analyst jobs which I applied for but am wondering what else is there for me to find so I can refine my searching from entry level Cybersecurity jobs to XYZ ya know?

Thanks!"
xqhahg,1,2022-09-28,I can't accept the fact I'm alive,Thought-I-lost-it,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/xqhahg/i_cant_accept_the_fact_im_alive/,"Sorry for this rant. My head hurts and I think letting this all out will release some pressure:

It feels so unreal at times. You know, the sort of realization that this is it. This really is what life's about. There's no pause button to life, you just keep on going and going till you're dead. One day you're gonna die. And everybody you know is going to die. You're going to lose. Lose it all. There are no winners. Only pain, worry and sorrow. And so much sadness. 

When I was younger, my parents would often tell me things would get better when I get older. That I would grow out my anxiety and nervousness. That they had it too when they were younger but as you get older it becomes easier.
And now that I'm older I keep hearing people say things used to be better. ""Back in my day.."". 
Like there 'is' some kind of momentum. That happens but before you know it you missed it.
It just makes me wonder how much did I miss out on life, you know?

Going on adventures with the other kids in the neighbourhood, going on field trips, going to birthday parties of classmates, skip school, fall in love, hanging out together exploring things, study, study abroad, travel, travel with friends, get drunk and wasted, go to musicfestivals, watch the latest movies in the cinema, go city hopping with friends, book a vacation, live in a dorm, get a job, follow internships, masterclass studies, climb the career ladder, buy a car, going steady, buy a house, propose, marry, become a parent... I just missed out on all of that.
And when you ask a random stranger what makes life worth living, it surely must be one of those things. Next to health.

Well, I don't got that either. I don't exercise other than lifting weights two times a week. I am unable to reach deep sleeps and never wake up wellrested. I'm so exhausted. I'm a junkie to legal medication. At such a high dose to make it through the day. I'm overweight, obese, fatigue, depressed, tired of life, struggling to hold on. Finding ways to cope with setbacks. I got plans, but no energy or concentration to work it out. 

All of my life I've been suffering of my anxiety disorder. Making me scared and afraid of everything. To an insane degree to which it feels impossible to conquer it. If I try to expose myself too much to my fears, I may risk getting to stressed which would result in s fallback. So it's a thin line to walk. 

I feel alone, I feel like a loser. I'm filled with so much self hatred and I find it hard to look at myself. I don't think I can make anybody happy. I mean, sooner or later you get to a point in which I can't fulfill a role. I can't date and go to the cinema or a restaurant. I can't go on a holiday. I'm scared of intimacy, while I long for it real bad (tortured by a high libido cause of antidepressants), I'm scared to have kids myself. I couldn't bear seeing a kid grow up with my DNA. And let it go through the same hell. Or wishing it was never born. Like I do some days.

I feel bad for my parents. I imagine the situation of them being so happy when I was born. Daydreaming what my life would be like. Setting money apart so I can go to college later in life. Wishing me the best. I can't help but think I must be a disappointment. 

My father is battling cancer for the 5th time in 8 years. He's fighting to stay alive, while I'm waiting til mine is over. It's just a fucked up world. The other day we decided to travel to another city an hour away. But we had to turn around, because my eyes kept closing while driving. I was so angry with myself. And so was my dad. So he let out: ""later I will be gone, and then you won't be independant at all"". I know it's a worry that he said out loud. But it still hurts. It feels like it's my own choice to live the life I got. Like I want to be so passive and tired. Escaping reality by sleeping. I just don't know what to do.

For 30 years I tried to make a change. To make something out of it. And find a way in which I can accept life. That this is it. Maybe not getting out all things in life, but just something that makes it all worth. And still I don't know where to find it. Or if I'll ever find it. Everything around me looks pitch black, and I don't know which way to go. 
There are many days I regret not ending it all age 27 like I intended. It would've be beautifully symbolic. 
Now I don't know what to aim for anymore. 

I'm trying to get back in contact with a psychiatrist though. Hopefully some new combination of meds can light things up. 

Something has to change. For better or worse."

Hello everyone ,
Going to graduate soon and looking to start software engineering jobs. I have done 2 internships and I got a full time job offer as a junior software engineer.
In the interviews I was “examined” in staff like OOP python java databases networks (all developer like topics ).
When I got the offer I asked for the specific role name and description cause the initial one and the answer of the interviewers were really vague and broad. And they responded with a fully devops role named software solutions integrator / software engineer .
Initially I got angry cause nothing like that was mentioned and I would prefer a developer role . But I thought that doing some devops would give me some goood experience and make me more well rounded. And I could always leave or swap roles in 6 months in case I didn’t like it . (Fixed time 6 months contract for juniors ) I’m also kind of afraid to decline and stay on the hunt since I don’t have a degree yet and let’s say my country doesn’t have the best market . Do you think it makes sense for me to accept this role given I don’t think I want to be devops for ever ? (Also money is good )"

As the title says I am majoring in Data Science and expected to graduate in next December and am looking for my first internship this Summer.

I originally wanted to study Data Science, but as I study more about Data Science and programming, I am more leaned toward landing an internship as a software engineer if possible for this Summer.

Problem is that I have basic programming knowledge, I do python and R work for data science classes, but not as sophisticated as computer student major students. My question is should I change my major to computer science or self-teach while studying data science? Changing my major puts me in an extra additional year of college. I am in my 30s and this worries me a lot. I have no work experience in software engineering/development

I appreciate any advice I can get, thank you."

For some background, I am a social work student getting my master's degree - and I am in my specialization year. This is the year I SHOULD be getting clinical experience with clients in a group and individual setting. However, I am a month in and it is not looking good for me. My gut is also telling me that something is wrong here, and I am willing to believe it because I have worked social work jobs that are not fulfilling whatsoever with a serious lack of communication on management's end. 

1. I am supposed to be creating a curriculum for an aftercare program, right now I am in the observation stage of gathering the information I need to create a curriculum. But I keep getting pulled by counselors in the aftercare program to help them assist children who are having behavioral issues. I can't even get any observation done because everyone thinks I am there to help with behavioral problems. That is not what I am there for. 
2. I do not have a supervisor to shadow in these aftercare programs. But I do have a clinical supervisor that I meet with every week, she is helpful, but she hardly has the time to have me shadow her. She has many other priorities. 
3. The biggest problem here I am having is that my supervisor - not my clinical - I have two supervisors. One is a licensed clinical social worker the other, is the CEO of the program. The CEO, who is my supervisor I go to for primarily most of my work, is extremely nonresponsive and acts like she does not have time for me. She does not reply to any of my emails or messages on Teams, nor does she really allow that time for us to talk. Every time I try to grab her when I see her in person she immediately shuts me down and says ""Don't have time to talk"". This has been agonizing for me because I have to communicate with her, but she is not taking me very seriously I feel. I understand she is probably very busy. But why not just send a quick email and schedule a time to talk instead? And yes, I have tried to get meetings set up with her - but again, she doesn't respond to anything I send her. How many emails am I supposed to send in order for her to reply to me?? I feel as if I have to bombard her in order to get any response whatsoever. I FEEL like it should not be this way, communication should be better than this. 
4. There is no clear path or direction on what exactly it is I will be doing with the children at this aftercare program. Right now I am just observing, but I have been doing this for almost over a month now and feel like I am stagnating. When am I going to be getting clinical experience doing sessions with clients? I know I am supposed to create a trauma-informed curriculum, and I was promised I would be getting client one on one experience - but that has not been happening. Nor has there been any sort of indication or announcement that this is happening. I feel like I am just an over-glorified camp counselor who does not know what my actual role is here. Even though I have introduced myself to the staff - I feel like they still don't really get what I am supposed to be doing. And the CEO, of course, promised she would talk to staff and also let them all know of what I am to be doing at this time. But has not followed through with this, surprise, surprise.. 

I feel helpless, depressed, and unfulfilled at this internship. I will be speaking with my clinical supervisor today and see if she can help me out in any way here, and maybe I could potentially jump to another program that can actually help get me the experience I need. I feel like I should have been more aware of how this would have played out - the CEO never even gave me a list of expectations for this internship and it seems like she is expecting me to just know what my role is here. But I really don't know what my role is and I can't help but feel guilty that I jumped at this opportunity, it sounded too good to be true and now that is sadly becoming a reality for me. I thought I would be creating a curriculum for students along with also implementing therapy services. I am hardly doing anything here, I feel. Does anyone have any advice or anything that they would recommend? I am really tired of not being taken seriously here. I am frustrated and angry that this is all occurring and the CEO clearly does not give a s\*\*\*. She promised me so much more, but is just jerking me around. Thank you for listening."

I'm hoping someone who's been through this might have advice for me.  I'm being split between two teams.  For one of them I'm doing hardware work which I'm very comfortable with, but that's supposed to be only 20% of my workload.  I can wire something up from a diagram, build boxes, mount stuff to a wall, but so can anyone who has done DIY stuff.  

The other part is much more on the software development side of things and I'm struggling quite a bit.  There's a second intern on that team with me, but he's in school for computer science and everything we're doing, he gets instantly.  Meanwhile, I feel like I can't even figure out how to get started.  We aren't really being given much in the way of direction so I'm just trying to learn about linux, servers, and kubernetes online while waiting to be given a definite task.

The overall affect is that I feel so dumb.  I have no idea how to do any of this and my efforts to learn haven't been going anywhere.  I can do a tutorial or watch videos, but have zero clue where to start doing anything past that.  I'm genuinely worried I'm not fit for this internship, but I quit my job to do this.  I was curious what other people's experiences with their first internships were like.  Did you feel overwhelmed or like you weren't smart enough?  How did it turn out for you?"

I(22M) have a younger brother(20M) and he is struggling with what I think is an existencial crisis, he says that he doesn't care what happens to him in life and if something happens, then i will just happen. 

We grew up in a middle class family and our parents always tried their best to give us enough to grow up healthy and with education. My brother has always taken a philosophical approach to life and he really doesn't have a lot of friends and hobbies, he always had said that nothing really ""fills him"" in his life and activities and hobbies are only pleasures that doesn't make him feel realized. He tried to go to the university but he changed his career path multiple times and then he finally dropped out of school.

Unfortunately, right now we my family is in a financial crisis, and we are struggling a lot with payments and related stuff. My parents are in a bad health shape, and we need as a family to work together so that we even have something to eat. But he just refuses, he says that he cares about us but in the end he does nothing and is always questioning us about why we care about him and that our opinions doesn't matter to him.

I have tried anything to do anything to reason with him, that if he does different things then he may be able to find what it will fill him or that at least help us for the mean time in the difficult times. But nope, he always end up bringing philosophical questions like ""what is a person"" and ""what is to triumph"" and ends up doing nothing in the entire day, just playing videogames and being in the phone.

My family is in a really bad situation, my dad is unemployed and is an active smoker, my mom has struggles with his hands and can't do a lot of work, we have a big debt. I just got graduated, but they didn't offer my a job after I finished my intern in the company I was working.

So yeah, I have a lot of issues and I don't know how to deal with my brother anymore. 

What would be the best thing to do to help him?"

I’m a 19 year old junior who applied to transfer to Brown for the Spring 23’ term and I’ve been pretty nervous about it and saw this sub so I figured why not ask!

Info about me:
19 year old male, born in Cairo Egypt, moved to the US in 2009. I’m a permanent resident
Started college in 2020, then transferred college to my current university where I’m miserable as fuck last year in 2021.
Currently a Communications major, though if I get into Brown I’d want to switch to Sociology
3.96 GPA at both colleges I attended so far, I’m also currently an undergraduate TA for a 300s level class that I took last year
Have had offers from my current university to complete my Masters degree in one year though I seriously genuinely hate it here and can’t accept staying here for another 3 years
I work in my university’s IT department and did the same at my old university
Was an intern for a 2020 US senators campaign for election
Before the pandemic was a big volunteer for interfaith camps and the broader community

For some context, I would like to find an internship with a strong data science presence, a place I can learn, be mentored, and grow. 
My thoughts are that a “big” company like AT&amp;T, Oracle, IBM (I’m in Dallas, Texas) would be a place that has the resources to pay for good talent /resources and so I have a good chance at learning there. 
On the opposite side of the spectrum I could see how smaller companies that provide consulting services would be a way to learn by doing a variety of different tasks in different industries. 
I understand that it’s not likely to my my one and only data science job, but I’d really like to weigh out the different type of internships so I can hone in on my focus. 

Thanks for any and all insight!"
xqvh3f,2,2022-09-28,Signed a contract for an SWE internship at a tech startup but I’m having second thoughts now. Need advice,Vegetable_Bluebird_5,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/xqvh3f/signed_a_contract_for_an_swe_internship_at_a_tech/,"Please let me know if this post doesn’t belong here. I’ll remove it. TLDR at the bottom.

To provide some context, I recently finished high school and have been self-learning CS and programming throughout high school. I will only be starting my CS degree next year (already received offers).

I applied to at least 20 small companies and tech startups for an SWE internship and only 2 startups got back to me within a month. I went through 3 rounds of interviews and got accepted to 1 of them. Of course, I’m really glad about this. I’m from a country where degrees matter so much, and most would only hire undergrad interns. My given pay is also at the higher end of the range usually given to undergrad interns at non-FAANG companies in my country. The projects which the startup are working on are really interesting and I would be able to learn so much from this (Will be working on the frontend and backend of one of their products. I may also have the chance to help out in the AI/ML department). They are currently expanding globally too.

However, I started to have lingering regrets at the back of my head. I deliberately did not apply for more well-known companies because of my assumption that they automatically filter out my resume (because of the absence of a degree). After all, these well-known big tech companies already have large volumes of applications from undergrads.

Thus, after signing this contract, I always have these “what-if” thoughts. I feel like I should’ve tried and pushed myself further. Whenever people ask about where I will be interning at, it’s always awkward because it’s a small startup that no one has heard of. Alongside my side projects, I’ve also published an app to the App Store and have been grinding leetcode too. The technical interview at the startup only tested really basic algorithms. I’ve also seen people on Reddit saying that for bigger companies, degrees don’t matter much and what matter more are the technical interviews and your portfolio.

How do I overcome these thoughts? I don’t want to regret my decision. However, I acknowledge that I may be overthinking about this. I’m still a naïve person out of high school, so I may not know much about the real world. Any brutally honest feedback is welcomed. You can be upfront to me too. If it helps, I’m 19 this year. Thanks!

TLDR: Signed a contract offer for an SWE internship at a tech startup as a high school grad before entering college. Starting to regret my decision as I didn’t bother applying for big tech companies."

Also, shoutout to u/Motaphe for giving me a heads up about the interview process ahead of time.

**Background**  
I am currently a sophomore at the University of Maryland, studying Computer Engineering. I applied for the internship on August 28th and I heard back from my recruiter on August 31st. My interview was initially scheduled on September 16, but to ""unforeseen circumstances"", it ended up being pushed back to today, September 28.

**Interview Process**  
The interview started off with introductions and a brief interview resume screen. I introduces myself (major, interests, etc.) then answered a couple of questions about my resume (robotics team, volunteer work, etc.) then we went directly into the coding assignment.

The assignment itself was pretty simple, akin to a LeetCode easy-ish medium. Specifically, it focused on string manipulation with a touch of DSA. My interviewer gave me a minute to think over the problem and gather my thoughts. I just voiced random ideas for the individual criteria until I had a rough plan on how I was going to implement it. After I told my interviewer my design, he said it sounded like it would work. I started my implementation while commenting each step of the algorithm, talking aloud the entire time I was working. I managed to implement a solution, which initially had a bug that I managed to fix, and ran some random test cases which worked until the very last test case. My interviewer managed to identify the bug, giving me a hint where I should look, but I couldn't manage to find and fix it before time ran out.

After the coding section was a brief Q&amp;A, with me asking him questions (why Uber, previous jobs, college major, advice for interns, etc.) and him answering my questions, though we went slightly over the 1 hour time slot.

**Results**  
I recieved an email from my recruiter about an hour and a half after my interview, letting me know that I moved onto the second interview."

The career is expected to grow at about 4% also, which is average. [See data here](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm).

My next option WOULD be Computer Science, but the only field in that, that I'm really interested in, is Cyber Security. That's why I said it WOULD be an option. If my only interest is Cyber Security, then I'd rather just go for the BS that my school (MDC) offers. I know a Computer Science degree would be much more flexible though. So if I for some reason end up not liking Cyber Security, I could at least switch to something else. That said, Cyber Security is a broad field itself too.

With MDC being recently granted $2 million dollars to expand their Cyber Security training, I was thinking that that would be another good reason to go for the BS in Cyber Security. According to their website, there's a shortage of people in the field. Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Information Security Analyst is a job/career that is growing at 35%, which is much faster than average.

[Read more about MDC Cyber Security funding here](https://news.mdc.edu/?p=12921).

It seems very promising. They want to make Miami a 'tech hub', with conferences and competitions, which sound super cool! They even mentioned paid internships. Promising indeed, but not a given. I would hope our governor and MDC are making good financial decisions on our education. Honestly.

I know that no one is guaranteed a job or internship with college. I just want to increases my chances. I wouldn't mind waiting for an opportunity, or aggressively searching for one myself, but I don't know how long it'll take. I also know I could move to a state where my opportunities are better, but that would be a lot. I'd still do it if I had to though. I know it's ridiculous and illogical to assume that I'll be jobless with an Electrical Engineering degree or (maybe) a Cyber Security Degree. Plenty of people say that I could find a job and I believe them. I guess it would just be a matter of patience, but what if I don't find anything? So far my job searches for the state of Florida in general, as well as research on employment here, and the top careers (in terms of demand and pay) are medical and automotive stuff.

I am mainly speaking for Electrical engineering in this post, as, like I said, Cyber Security seems like it's going to be in more demand based on [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/information-security-analysts.htm). I think my chances of landing a job would be better with Cyber Security over Electrical Engineering, based on the data. I really like Electrical Engineering, only a LITTLE more than Cyber Security, so I my interest makes my decision in picking a major more difficult, going against the data. ( *Data isn't always right, but it doesn't lie.... right!? THEY WOULDN'T LIE TO ME RIGHT!?* )

If anyone offers advice, I will find you and hug you. This has been bothering me for a while, and I would really appreciate some feedback and guidance on how to best make my decision."

I am starting with EY soon and just wanted some input/advice/etc. on tattoos/body mods/etc. in the workplace. (I understand that what is appropriate within company offices may be different from what's expected when meeting with clients. I am just looking for overall advice!) 

I have my septum pierced, my ears are gauged to a 0g, and I have 2 tattoos (both on my inner arms directly above my elbow), I have plans for more tattoos, and would really like a large one on my thigh and others on my forearms (potentially even a sleeve at some point). 

When I did my internship, it was completely remote, so these things weren't a big deal. I just wore my hair down and flipped my septum up during Zoom/Teams meetings. However, now that a lot of things are back in person, I'm nervous about these things. 

I've read some other threads, particularly about tattoos, and I feel less nervous about those. However, I am anxious about my septum piercing and my gauged ears. Both of these have defined me for years now and I really could not fathom getting rid of either. I guess I am really looking for some kind of assurance (lmao) that I can keep these, even while working? I know I can hide them and stuff, but I'd really love to not do that if I don't have to. 

TIA for any advice, anecdotes, suggestions, etc. I'm so nervous. I know I already proved myself during my internship and I know my accomplishments are impressive (not to toot my own horn, I've just been told by so many professionals to not underestimate my accomplishments) and I just don't want my choices regarding the way I look to impact my career too much. 

I am aware that the client, the partners in the office, and even my direct reports may ask me to hide one thing or another at times, but I guess I just want to know other people's experiences are and what to expect in general."

• So it goes like this, the other store displays the dropshipper client's products by acquiring their stock and products through api

• Then after an order is placed on one of those said products, the payment is also handled on the other store and then the order information is communicated to the dropshipper client's store for them to handle the delivery and keep the other store updated with delivery tracking information through api also

Graduating later could give me an opportunity to intern for 3-4 months more. Would appreciate some advice especially due to the predicted poor tech market in 2023. Thank you!
xrdflh,66,2022-09-29,Got my first Data Science Internship! Any tips for newbies?,nuriel8833,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/xrdflh/got_my_first_data_science_internship_any_tips_for/,"So basically as the title says, I signed my very first internship in a DS startup. They were really impressed with me but couldnt offer me full time job as the startup is underfunded but offered me 2 months testing internship (3 days/wk ,payed hourly) and then the option to sign full time job after.

In general the past week was my first week. I REALLY like the job, the data, the location, the people, basically everything. 

My only problem is I have a bit of imposter syndrome. Until now I only did Kaggle notebooks and the rapid change to production enviornment stresses me out a bit. I get lost in masses of codes and directories. Also the data is much bigger than what I used to deal with. My internship is basically improving one of their models. The past week I spent most of it trying to figure out the code and also did a lot of my version of feature engineering but they want next week to apply it to production already and its kinda stressing me out a bit that Im slow and wasting their time (I wouldnt have had problem if it was a big coorporation, but its a fairly early small underfunded startup as said so every dollar counts and I do want to give value for the money they spent on me even if they dont continue with me).

I wanted to ask you guys if you have any tips on how to succeed in this internship and how to make the shift from kaggle-notebooks code to production enviornment? I know I can do this I just need to get a grip of myself asap.

Highly appreciate your help!"

This may be better suited to r/CSCareerQuestions or r/ITCareerQuestions, but it's what it is. 

My name is Jay. I am currently a sophomore with a 3.2GPA majoring in Computer Science with graduation between 2024-2025 (more on that later.) I am currently working as an unarmed security officer,(think actual security officer, not cybersecurity). 

Right now I'm confused as to where to go from here. Beforehand I had an IT internship at my local campus, which lasted my entire freshman year, and I am not sure as if I'm allowed to be back yet. 

My goals as of right now was to rebuild my projects which I do not have any clues as to my proficiency. So far I only have a couple of school projects from basic 1-2-3 programs you take in an introductory class to a calculator and a few websites I've built using tutorials on YouTube. I haven't made anything substantial yet except for a SQL database that doesn't really work that well. 

I am also confused as to my path in tech - data science, software engineering, penetration tester, security analysts - it's all too much. Also with the recent news of a recession, I am worried that I may not have a good of a chance as I would just for my current plan which is sticking to my security officer gig and working my way to middle management, which would make my degree a waste. 

I've been looking at internships but haven't been applying to them, plus there's a career center as well I went to recently and dipped out quickly. There's another one coming up in the next week, so I'll stay there as much as I can and get what I need. 

My current path right now is to finish up this year as much as I can as well as keep working while also taking summer classes. This would allow me to graduate in Spring/Fall 2024, which would be extremely beneficial for my finance, as well as hopefully career trajectory, but I could be held back as far as Spring 2025, which would allow me to do a study abroad trip and hopefully 2 internships if I apply. But I'm not holding my breath on those chances judging by the current economic trajectory and maybe a potential draft in the US. 

TLDR; Need career &amp; school advice as to where to go from here as a sophomore student."

xre6km,8,2022-09-29,"Being a jobless for a year, Looking for IT position",viktorvincent,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xre6km/being_a_jobless_for_a_year_looking_for_it_position/,"Hi, Reddit,

Last December, I finished my bachelor's and master's degree in computer science. As an international student, I had trouble getting an internship during school due to a visa issue. Since it's an unranked local school, none of the big companies that can provide sponsorship attended the career fair, and my resume used to be rejected all the time online and offline.

To deal with the situation, I focused on campus life and did a few things. During undergrad, I worked as a programming tutor for a semester and worked as a research assistant for two years during graduate school. Also, I graduated with 2 publications and got 2 awards from school for outstanding research. My GPA was close to 4.0 for both undergrad and graduate school (I know they're not that important), but still having trouble securing my first IT job. Fortunately, the green card status got approved so I could get a work permit this June, but no luck yet. Submitted 100+ applications but most of them instantly rejects my application and missed 3-4 opportunities by failing the coding assessment. I thought my resume might have some issues so hired a professional resume writer from Fiverr, but he said my resume is already conveying my duties well, so he just slightly elaborated it, that's all.

Now it's still fine as I'm a fresh grad within a year of graduation, but I was told that there will be a lot of trouble from next year with a year gap, and also the economy is getting worse due to war and inflation. Many of my friends working for their companies are saying they had layoffs recently as well. I'm studying leetcode every day and applying to companies, but 0 industry work experience hurts a lot. Kinda feel like I'm wasting my life in my room looking at the monitor. Keep studying and applying, but saving is running low, won't hold that long.

Based on my situation, there are three options I can choose now, I guess.

1. Join consulting companies providing Bootcamp + job contract
2. Just keep studying and applying the same as usual
3. Do whatever and start making money

Any advice will be appreciated."
xrebm1,1,2022-09-29,Resume Building Help,WhiteSleep,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/xrebm1/resume_building_help/,"Hello, so recently, I've been hitting walls to find an internship and some form of work that allows me to be part-time for a company. My expected graduation is spring of 2023, and I still have not been able to score an internship or find related work to my two degrees. However, I have had a lot of different jobs and have done various projects pertaining to what I would enjoy working with, and I have been in and out of college for a while, but I finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. I always seem to get to the final stages of an interview, and it's good practice even if I don't get the position cause I believe it makes me more confident, and I tend to learn more about how I should talk about myself and my knowledge. But I feel like I still struggle from time to time, and my resume looks good (I think), but it could still use more work and this current version, I went ahead and listed different projects, but I might need to switch them up...so here I am looking for some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a double major in Business Management and Computer Information Systems. I would love to do something with business analytics, Visualization, SQL databases, and Cyber Security (I prefer blue team types of applications &amp; methods).

I have a single unrelated summer job as my work experience and no internships. 

I made a portfolio website using a template, and I’ve made a ToDo app and clock following some YouTube tutorials. I haven’t put the portfolio website into my cv yet since I want to make a few more projects first. 

Should I apply for internships first ? I realise a lot of the junior positions want 1-2 years of experience, but I’m reluctant to apply for internship since I’m no longer a uni student.

Also is it a good idea to expand my options and look at the usual software engineer position ?"

xrhumo,1,2022-09-29,"Just graduated, no interviews. Need some advice",PlehYeet,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/xrhumo/just_graduated_no_interviews_need_some_advice/,"
Based in UK, just graduated in July and I’ve been applying to graduate/junior frontend and web dev positions, so far no interviews, around a dozen rejects and a lot more ghost.

I have a single unrelated summer job as my work experience and no internships. 

I made a portfolio website using a template, and I’ve made a ToDo app and clock following some YouTube tutorials. I haven’t put the portfolio website into my cv yet since I want to make a few more projects first. 

Should I apply for internships first ? I realise a lot of the junior positions want 1-2 years of experience, but I’m reluctant to apply for internship since I’m no longer a uni student.

Also is it a good idea to expand my options and look at the usual software engineer position ?

xrj0rt,3,2022-09-29,EY Summer Internship Recruitment Process (description),SpaceYady20,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/xrj0rt/ey_summer_internship_recruitment_process/,"For those of you interested, here's how I got a summer internship offer at EY.

It all started when I went to an office tour and networking session on a Friday. I was really stressed but forced myself to go towards some employees and exchange them. I really connected with a couple of them and with a campus recruiter in particular. Right before I left, she told me to apply for the internship. 

I applied the following Monday around 5pm and got an email the next day around 10am to complete a video interview. There were three questions:
- what motivates or inspires you?
- what elements of past projects did you enjoy most?
- why EY?
I had 2 minutes to answer each question and had 2 takes per question.

The same night (Tuesday), I went to a recruitment event and networked some more with campus recruiters and employees, while taking the time to say hi to the few people I'd met the previous week. I mentioned to a recruiter that the video interview bugged a little and you occasionally didn't hear a few words from my answers and she said verbatim ""I wouldn't worry about it too much. We're probably not even gonna watch them since we know you already"" (shows how much of a game changer networking is).

Two days later (Thursday) I got a call around 2pm from another recruiter asking when I'd be available for an in-person interview. It'd be an informal interview with a senior manager for the first 30 minutes and a partner for the last 30 minutes.

Fast forward one week, I arrived at the office for my interview and talked with a couple of the past summer interns who were there to distract us while we waited. The two interviews were essentially two convivial conversations about everything and anything (they did most of the talking tbh). They were both aware of my background and anything they asked that was related to my resume or cover letter was brought on very naturally as part of the conversation.

They called me 24h later saying that a position was mine if I wanted it and that I'd receive the written offer in the next ~5 days.


For those of you intimidated by networking and the whole recruitment process, I was in the same boat as you. If you don't know how to approach a recruiter, just go up to them, present yourself and shake hands (makesure you don't have cold or sweaty hands that's a big turn off). If they're surrounded by other people just join the circle and present yourself whenever the opportunity arises.
After a few recruitment events I found my flow, and evidently, it all worked out."
xrjr0z,9,2022-09-29,My job hunt as a UK programmer with 2 YoE,Cheese_Burger_Slayer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xrjr0z/my_job_hunt_as_a_uk_programmer_with_2_yoe/,"I accepted my second-ever programming job today. Went from £32k -&gt; £75k with \~2 YoE. Here's how I did it.

To preface, my first job I got through an internship during university. I interviewed at a bunch of places, grinded a bunch of leetcode questions and got an offer. After doing the internship, I got a return offer for £32k and accepted it.

Fast forward a couple years and I have been at this job for a bit and am enjoying it, but starting to wish I had a higher salary and more growth potential. I decided to try interviewing just to see what I'd get. I started by completing 1 medium leetcode problem. I then realised that I hated doing leetcode, especially now that I'd been doing software engineering for a coupleyears and it had basically no relevance to my actual day-to-day job, so decided to just skip that whole guff and try my luck anyway. I applied for 5 companies that were advertising on linkedin and glassdoor, with high estimated salaries. Got interviews with 4 of them. All were online interviews which I found less stressful than my in-person internship interview, especially since I already had a job so there was not too much pressure. I treated them like any other technical teams call I'd have with my colleagues. The technical interviews included mock code reviews, discussion of software design patterns, a take-home problem and a discussion of said problem. Only one company required me to actually write code under a time limit in an interview, which was one of the interviews I failed. But overall, 2 of the 4 companies gave me offers. Ended up accepting the higher one which was £75k + a £5k yearly RSUs.

I guess my key takeaways from this was that experience, even a small amount, matters a ton in being able to land a new job. And that leetcode, while important for some companies, is not necessarily essential for interviewing, at least here in the UK. And finally, if you feel undervalued it's always worth interviewing to see if your suspicions are true."
xrjufj,0,2022-09-29,should I apply for entry level jobs that use tech stacks I have no experience with?,y0u553f,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xrjufj/should_i_apply_for_entry_level_jobs_that_use_tech/,"Hi,

I do have some experience with unity engine but I barely have any experience with other tech stacks or frameworks.. So just like the title says.. is it okay to apply for entry level jobs that use tech stacks I have no experience with? Or it's waste of time? And what are recruiters expecting from entry level and juniors candidates?

Update : providing more context I do have a computer science engineering degree from university .. I Done 4 internships as unity dev.. I found job in my country as unity dev but I want to find a job abroad cos gaming industry in my country is not developed there are few studios and 99% of them are clueless and have no budget.. (more like hobbyists than professionals).

So I noticed abroad there is no much demand for unity devs as much other web dev tech stacks like mern .. So I am asking do I have chance if I apply for entry level positions that requires stacks I don't have any experience with?

Should I practice leetcode or learn these tech stacks?"
xrk56v,3,2022-09-29,What career should I choose?,Creative_Fix9055,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/xrk56v/what_career_should_i_choose/,"I am graduating high school early by Christmas break. I plan on waiting to go to college until August next year. Recently it's hit me that I need to start researching careers that I want to do when I get older. I've narrowed down a couple of choices: accounting and computer science (software developer). I was always pretty good with basic arithmetic and early algebra and loved doing things with numbers but I was never that great at later level math without having to study for a long amount of time. The highest math class that I've taken in high school is Algebra 2. Both of these careers have interested me for awhile but I'm torn between the pros and cons of each choice. I live in a pretty small city of about 20,000 people with low cost of living. I need some insight in helping me potentially choose a career. I have a genuine interest in both of them.

Accounting: 

Pros: 

1. Easier major than comp sci from what I've researched online. Not as math heavy compared to it either
2. More job opportunities around the area, don't need to study for interviews like you may need to do on Leetcode
3. Pre req accounting classes offered at community college 5 minutes away from me and can transfer to a 4 year college after that/cheaper for education.

Cons:

1. Hear many times accountants work long weeks, especially during tax season
2. Doesn't pay as well as software engineer from average salary research
3. May be automated in the future? I sorta doubt this but I have heard people mention it many times
4. Will have to study for cpa to get better salary, still doesn't usually pay as good as software engineer

Comp Sci:

Pros:

1. Pays much better than accounting.
2. work life balance seems better/not as long of hours as accountants work

cons: 

1. Worried about not being able to pass the comp sci math classes (only have take up to Algebra 2 in high school), I've downloaded the course list and said I need Calc 1, stats and probability, and discreet math. I have never been great at later level math. Even the name calculus is scary to me.
2. May not be able to find an internship because of the area I am in (its mainly agriculture based), even looking at software engineer job openings most require 5+ years of experience
3. May have to make complex projects for resume to be considered. Will I be able to comfortably do these projects along with college work?
4. Leetcode studying, Do I do this after college when I am comfortable with coding? Provided a get a job in the first place in the area that I am in.

I have always been pretty quiet and not a huge people person so I am scared of any interviews I may get for any of these jobs. I could picture my self being too nervous and screwing up on simple things for the technical interview for software developing. Same goes for accounting. I'd prefer not to work at my part time grocery store job for the rest of my life although I don't dislike it there too much either (would be my backup plan). I am taking khan academy courses to refresh on Algebra 2 and to learn Trigonometry but I don't know if it will be sufficient enough for college. What are your thoughts?"

xropdd,1,2022-09-29,“Discharged” on Day 4,munchkinSam,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xropdd/discharged_on_day_4/,"I genuinely need to vent this out. 

In May I graduated with a BS for Actuarial Science(it’s a combination of Business &amp; Mathematics). I have applied to SO many places and haven’t received an offer for any type of interview or anything. 

At the end of August, I finally got a phone interview! It went well and I was pushed through to an in-person interview. The position was going to be a new role- a financial analyst position. They were completely aware that I had no experience, just a degree, and this was something they were excited about! They wanted someone who could learn their company and give insight. I was told there were about 30 applicants and there were a few more interviews after me- that I would hear back in a week. 

I let my current employer(retail pharmacy) in on the whole process, as I liked that job- it just didn’t adhere to my degree. A week passed, they called and I got the job! The call was on September 7. They respected that I wanted to work a two-week notice and had my start date set on September 26.

So I started this past Monday. For reference, the industry is Logistics and the company has a headcount of 500-1000 people(using LinkedIn numbers as to not be pinned for confidential information). There is 10 locations, but I was working at headquarters. On Monday, I had various orientations and meetings for over half the day. I got to see my boss for about 15 minutes- to note, the finance department for this company was literally my Boss, me, and a data analytics intern. My boss told me he would be out of the office for the next three days and to just do whatever and try to learn about the companies and the various software. I wasn’t given any structured projects. I was scheduled a couple meetings in the accounting department though. 

Tuesday, Wednesday, &amp; Thursday(today) were all spent doing orientation, shadowing, and meetings for about half the time. The other half the time, I was at my space trying to self-learn the software. I was also pulling various reports and even created a miniature month end financial packet. 

About 10 minutes before my shift was to end today, the head of HR pulls me in the office and tells me they are letting me go. 
Clearly I was in shock &amp; my emotions began to flood. I composed myself as much as I could and asked why? They told me that I didn’t have a passionate answer when asked what I had learned so far(this was asked each day during orientation). This was translated as negativity that affected my performance and therefore I was being let go. Mind you, I have been given zero tasks to measure and my boss has been out of office. 

It has been a few hours and I have realized a lot of red flags from day one. When I arrived to my area, I had no name plate- but the others who started that day did. I remember having conversations with various trainers or hr people and getting a lot of smiles with sympathy in their eyes. While being discharged, I was told the decision was made last night- but my parking garage key that I got never worked. Also while being discharged, I was encouraged to apply again in the future for any role that may fit my skills. One of the people in the room was visually upset to see me upset and the other person couldn’t look me in the eye. 

There was a whole section in one of the lectures about what would have you immediately terminated. Things like workplace harassment and domestic violence- they specifically went over how you wouldn’t be let go for performance until after it has been addressed and some plan has been made to mediate it. It’s day 4- obviously no one has said anything to me. I made sure to ask if termination was the only solution or if there were any other options. 


If you made it this far, thank you. I am so frustrated &amp; upset- but I just have this gut feeling that this decision had nothing to do with me. I feel like something happened in the period between when I signed the contract for the job and when I started- whether it be budget constraints, realizing there was no need for this new role, or finding someone better. But maybe I am wrong- maybe I did something, I am not sure. 

Have you or someone you know gone through something like this? What did you/them do to cope with the disappointment?

Any suggestions or feedback on how I can make the most of this is so appreciated."

So: I know how to check in w people and be polite. But I don’t have good social skills. I actually probably have social anxiety. I struggle w being somewhat cynical or pessimistic abt other people sometimes, due to negative experiences. Multiple people have me blocked on a specific social media platform. 

In class, even if it’s a class that I really don’t like such as Physiology, I get my work in. I used to pride myself on having high grades. My favorite class this yr in terms of subject matter is our English mental health course. 

I am now behind in math. I dropped Pre Cal in junior yr bc I suspected it would prove to be too challenging since I took algebra 2 online. 

I sometimes have liked reading different facts online in the past and once had a good memory for these. I believe I may be happier when I am away from my toxic classmates.

This summer, during my internship, I found that I hated counting boats in the hot Sun and remember complaining to myself that it was work for a man or felt like slavery. I found that working w the kids made me genuinely happy. 

I am curious about other people, but from afar. I have viewed all 32 pages of my acquaintance’s father’s flickr account from when she was little. I know I shouldn’t tell her this, bc it’s technically weird. 

I can sometimes struggle w having a cynical or negative mindset about different things. 

Nursing in my state is hard to get into, but I don’t think I’ll stay in my state. I may try atlanta. I want to move to a state where there’s a higher demographic of people who are the same race as me. 

I have sleeping issues, and have for 2yrs, to a point where I wake up w headaches sometimes. 

I think this is largely bc of trauma in regards to my older brother (there’s a complex history there - just stuff I remember him doing in 8th before having a breakdown, that my therapist called CPS over.) The situation w him really opened my eyes to how bad our family situation is, and I somewhat desire to understand my parents from a psychological perspective (I know both had traumatic childhoods) but also struggle w how dysfunctional this family is. 

I think I have trouble feeling fully relaxed or can feel kind kf on edge.

I had the a phone screening on Tuesday and the recruiter told me they’d let me know when the the interview would be scheduled. Then yesterday I got sent an email, that I didn’t see until i got off work, that my interview would be on friday. The only problem was that I’ve had a trip planned for that day for over a month. I wanted to email them to ask to reschedule, but say i’d be willing to do it at the same time if necessary, but someone told me that was stupid and they wouldn’t hire me because they’ll think I don’t care about the job and i should just cancel my plans. I really don’t know what to do anymore. I really want to go on my trip since other than the one day a week i have off i am basically a robot with no personality anymore because of school and work and I had friends from out of town meeting me at the location too. Should I try to do the interview in a car? Should I just not go? I know that if I don’t go it’ll just eat away at me and make me depressed like it already has made me but, i don’t want to miss the opportunity for this job. PS: the job is just and internship for 3 months for barely more than i make at my normal job and it’s for a position I do not even want. I only want the internship because the company is a big name(Tesla) and I have no other internship offers at this time. By the time people see this I will of already had to make my decision so I guess i’m just venting at this point

TL,DR: should i cancel trip i’ve had planned for months for an interview for an internship that is not related to my major but is a big name company(Tesla)"

However, later I changed fields to quantum computing. Because of the pandemic, most experimental labs were closed up for internships, so I settled to improve my theory and computational skills and did a few internships on quantum computing theory. 

I'm now applying for a PhD in experimental quantum computing. When I mailed a few profs both locally and abroad, the replies focused on my lack of experience with experiments. 
I decided to take a year break and apply for internships here instead (there are only 3 groups in my country working in my field of interest). Unfortunately, it's the same response. 

I haven't thought about international internships because their threshold will probably only be higher.

Is it impossible for me to get back into experimental physics? 🙁

Since February 2022, I've been working as an intern to a full-time employee at my current company. Now I wish to move, and my ECTC &gt;= 20LPA. My current CTC is around 15LPA. The main reason is that I dislike the product that the company is developing. I'd like to work somewhere more exciting, perhaps even at a startup. I'm learning Java Springboot as well as Golang. I applied to over 100 companies but was not contacted for an interview by any of them, some with referral as well. I gave an Amazon interview they asked 2 question I told them within time with best TC. Everything went well, interviewer told that they would reach out within a week. I got no call. I reached out to the recruiter 3 weeks later, she didn't respond, then 2 days later I got a rejection mail. I gave Goldman sachs Coding assesment. Did the coding within an hour. No call. A startup coding assessment I gave did all the question. No call. 

I'm sick of wondering if anything will change anytime soon. In truth, I have only given three interviews in my entire life[Got selected in 2]. Can somebody give me some advice? Also, if you have any open positions in your organisation, please refer me. Even though referral is no longer working in my case."

But how do people do that? I have been working in software development for 7 years now, but I don't feel like I could do that. Usually I (and literally every new hire I've worked with) need about two months of onboarding. After that I guess I'm kinda independent, but I still need some guidance every now and then. Because everything I do has to link up in some way with other components (components that might change over time, or aren't documented very well). And then there's the company/project policies - I do something, I have to update some obscure documentation, or interconnected KPI/testing script. And so on, you get the point.

I mean, when I was in college, I did a couple of internships where I had to do small projects where I worked mostly alone, but they were low complexity and pretty isolated from other components, so it was easier.

The idea of doing freelance stuff, in my own time, without meetings sounds very appealing, but I'm not sure if it's possible."

Currently- I am in college, freshman doing CS. It's going alright but I'm not great and not passionate about coding. But for the degree, you have to do coding classes first. I've thought about switching but my husband and I agreed to try a year, which is this semester, spring, then an internship over the summer. If by then I'm having a hard time and not enjoying it still then I can switch majors to something else. 

Major switch ideas- I'm interested in helping people, but I also need a degree that will fare well if I become an officer in the army. I was thinking something to do with disaster management or counter terrorism. My school does not have anything that specific since it's a public school. 

My plan- I think I'll do psychology for the counter terrorism or some type of earth science for the disaster management? Then later on continue education to try and specify these things? I guess my worry is between now and then, what I could do with these degrees? I do not want to be a therapist or an earth scientist necessarily. 

Does this sound crazy or well off? Any advice toward any aspect of this would be great. I thought I was really sure of CS but now that I'm in it I, it's my least favorite class. Thinking of minoring in political science since I LOVE that class and everything about it!"

2) The sub is often inundated with people asking ""Do I have what it takes"", "" Can I be a trader with x degree and y grades"", ""Am I good enough to get an Optiver internship"", and so on. Hopefully, this compilation will be useful in the sense that if you look at the class of incoming interns at Optiver and realize that you are, at least on paper, completely out of place in that cohort, then it's a good indicator that you have a lot of work to do if thats something you want to pursue.

Citadel:

&amp;#x200B;

* It was harder to find interns at Citadel, it seems like many of their Jrs did their internships at other firms or came from masters degrees with no prior trading experience.

Jane Street:

* Intern I: T5 undergrad in Math, 2 previous Ivey league research internships, an insane personal project that used ML techniques to save thousands of lives per year through improving waste water management in a third world country.
* Intern II: Undergrad at Waterloo, Dual degrees in Math and Business, 2 previous financial sector data science internships and 2 previous trading internships at Canadian banks.
* Intern III: T5 undergrad, Dual degrees in Math and CS, TA for 3 math classes at said T5, Previous data science internship, Previous trading internship at Akuna.
* Intern IV: T5 undergrad, Dual degrees in Math and CS, 4.0 GPA, 2 SWE internships, 2 research internships at said T5, director or team captain of 5 finance/cs/math related clubs/teams
* Intern V: This guy is doing dual degrees at a T5 in *Electrical engineering* and *Physics*. Enough said.

Optiver:

Note that some of these people didn't have their grades on their profiles, I would not assume that they have anything less than \~\`3.7/4. The only people who thought their GPAs were worth sharing had nearly perfect grades. 

There’s not much point in talking about Renaissance, 2s, or HRT at this point unless you feel at home in this crowd of applicants. These firms are not the be-all-end-all of quant. There are many  other firms, especially smaller regional ones that tend to be less competitive. That being said, they will still be quite competitive and often don't hire interns, which can make it quite hard to get a foot in the door."

on my application, it asked for minimum salary and i put 55k. during the interviews, i learned that the role entailed a lot more work. the extra work doesn’t deter me away because it is something i’m actually interested in, but i do feel like 55k is a bit low with what i know now. 

am i realistically in a position to negotiate? this would be my first job out of undergrad, so i have limited experience. however, i know how to do nearly everything they are asking for due to prior internships, and my volunteer work aligns directly with their organization identity.   

for context: it’s a communications role, mainly social media for 4 different pages. learned during interviews that i’d be expected to offer a considerable amount of support for internal  communication strategy as well, along with writing content for their website, and writing and designing email /newsletters. 

also, the posted salary range was 49-99k. i don’t have a masters so i’m figuring i cant get that close to 99k, but i think a more ideal range is 65-75k.

Unlike applying to college or graduate school, there's no standard timetable or template. There’s the time that works for you and what you want. 

What this means for you panicking seniors is

1. There is no “too early,” “too late,” or “perfect.”
2. You can start your search any time. Now is good.
3. The job search is a process, and applying for a particular opening is just part of it.
4. There’s a lot of variety in how organizations hire.
5. The people you know with jobs lined up already have no bearing on your likely success or failure. 

There are companies that hire entry-level talent at a scale that requires they start the process early -- through summer internship programs or campus career fairs.  But many companies and organizations don't work that way. If you went to the campus career fairs and thought, ""I don't want to work for any of these places,"" you're not destined to be unemployed. The organizations that would interest you are out there, but like many, they don't find that campus career fairs are a cost-effective or efficient way to get the talent they need. 

When most employers have a job opening, they’re hoping to fill that position within a few weeks, so applying NOW may not make sense if you won't be graduating until May. But there are always exceptions. Sometimes it’s possible to negotiate a start date or an initial remote/part-time schedule to accommodate things like finishing college. 

**If you’re graduating in December,** right now is a good time to start identifying jobs that interest you and submitting applications. If you’re just starting your job search, it’s also a good time to do the things we recommend for May graduates. **It’s a process**, and it rarely goes as smoothly or linearly as one would like. That’s okay.

**If you’re graduating in May,** right now is a good time to

* read lots of job ads. Schedule time to browse job boards (Handshake, LInkedIn, Indeed, Idealist, more specialized sites) just to explore what’s out there. Scroll down to the list of “requirements,” even for jobs whose titles don’t grab you immediately, and read them carefully — you will be surprised by what you’re qualified for. Make note of job titles or organizations that sound particularly interesting, so that you can look for similar opportunities when you get closer to graduation.
* [do some informational interviewing.](https://humanitiesprc.web.illinois.edu/resources/networking-for-humanities-majors/)
* brush up your resume. Create an online mega-resume that contains all the kinds of jobs, activities, volunteering, projects, leadership you’ve been a part of in college. For each of those, create bullet points to convey what you accomplished and the specific skills you demonstrated. Make sure to include specifics like job titles, dates, and names of programs/events so that you’ll be ready to pull out information to create resumes specific to particular jobs when you need them.
* contact people you will ask to serve as references to let them know you’re applying for jobs and make sure they’re willing to speak to potential employers on your behalf (but don't put references on your resume or refer to them).
* create (or update) your LinkedIn profile with a headline that emphasizes your skills or career aspirations rather than your status as a student. Include a photo that looks office-appropriate and career ready.
* reach out to your unit's career services for more advice. Everyone’s situation is different, and talking to a professional who does this stuff all the time can help you find your way to paths that are right for you.

__________

I began learning to code 3 years ago because I developed medical problems and I couldn't work a normal 9-5 office job. And then, by chance, COVID hit and most jobs went remote. There is a possibility that I may need to move to a country with cheaper healthcare so it is vitally important for me to learn a skill that I can utilize from anywhere. 

I began my coding journey by learning Python and SQL. I finished my first internship (fully remote) this past summer and I got great feedback from the Data Scientist that I worked under regarding my skills. The code that I wrote went into production, unaltered (thanks to Stackoverflow and Reddit). 

Now, however, I don't know if I want to continue down the Data path. Working in Analytics means that I'll have to work a 9-5 job without any real possibility of being remote. I know this because I received 2 job offers recently and both required that I work onsite, which I can't. When I tell employers that I have medical issues, I never get a job offer so I don't want to tell them the reason why I need to work remote. 

**Web dev or App dev**
__________

So, now I'm doing research on what I should learn next. I think both paths, web dev &amp; app dev, will allow me to work remotely (eventually). But I wonder if there's a right way to approach this: 

1. Should I start by learning web dev first and then move to app dev? Meaning, are there core skills like UX Design from web dev that will help me become a better app dev? Or is that something I can pick up quickly even if I start with app dev? 

2. If web dev, should I start with Django since I already know Python? Or is it better to start with Javascript (Colt Steele and Angela Yu's classes are mentioned quite frequently)? Are one of these better for finding a good job? When I look at job postings, I see a lot frameworks like node.js and angular and it's a bit intimidating since I don't have experience in this so is this another reason to learn Django first? 

3. If I start with app dev (or even if I move to this later), should I start with Swift since I can make apps for iPad, watchOS, in addition to iOS? Or should I start with Kotlin for Android? I am pretty platform agnostic. I have both an iPad &amp; Mac but my main phone is a Pixel. 

**Final Thoughts**
__________

I'm not sure if I can start out being remote as a junior dev but with a couple of years experience, I hope one of these two paths can get me there. Although money isn't the primary motivator, it would be helpful to choose a path that was more stable."

My dilemma is that I’m currently a sophomore taking two CS courses (Data Structures/Algorithms and Computer Organization &amp; Architecture).  Should I wait until I learn more material from class that could be useful in the coding interview? Or would it be better to complete the challenge sooner so that I can begin the interview process sooner? 

I’ve failed multiple code challenges so far, but have completed several Hackerrank problems. I have until 31 Oct to complete the challenge but I don’t know if completing it sooner will give me higher priority for consideration."

We all have relatively the same experience, but I feel like I take much much longer to write code. For ex, in the entire 2 week sprint, I only just finished 2 integration tests that took other developers not even a single day to complete. I have to continuously look and read through code to make sure I am doing the right thing, and then time just flies by. Is this normal at the start ? and how do I increase my efficiency ?"

xs7fo4,0,2022-09-30,Fall 2023 PhD Profile Review - GPA improved substantially after Junior year,sherbet808,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/xs7fo4/fall_2023_phd_profile_review_gpa_improved/,"Hi all, I graduated this May and decided I want to apply for PhD programs. My undergraduate GPA is not the best but I'm hoping my profile makes up for it in other aspects. I haven't picked a school list yet as I'm not sure what I realistically have a shot at. Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

**Desired Programs:** Statistics/ data science. Most interested in computational algorithms

**Major**: Mathematics

**Minors:** Computer Science, Physics

**GPA:** 3.60 cumulative, 3.67 in major

**Undergraduate Institution:** Mid sized private university not well known for it's STEM depts

**Background:** Domestic white female

**GRE:** not taken, expect to do well if/ when I do take it

**Research:**

\- Senior thesis in data science which we hope to get submitted to a journal in about two months. I developed an algorithm to accelerate an existing one (Hodge Rank) so I believe one of my LOR's should reflect pretty well in that aspect

\- REU summer after freshman year

\- Some minimal quantum gravity research

**Activities:**

A bunch of academic social clubs, a handful of coding competitions, and the collegiate math competition (PUTNAM) on which I scored first and second in my school the years I took it (granted only \~8 ppl take it at my school every year)

**Jobs:**

Grader and Tutor for Math, TA for Physics

SWE internship in front end ios/android dev

**LOR:**

\- my thesis advisor who I haven't always met deadlines perfectly for, but has seen me be a strong problem solver

\- my math prof who I developed a personal relationship and got great test scores and grades in his classes

\- my cs prof who's tests I consistently got the top score on. Don't have much of a personal relationship with him but I've taken 4 of his classes and killed it in every one so I hope that makes up for it

**Grades:** Mostly A's, A-'s and B+'s, one C- in differential equations because of an unfortunate final group project (we did it last minute and my team member plagiarized the coding portion so I decided not submit it myself). I also got diagnosed for ADHD at the end of my third year, and after getting medication and deciding I might want to do grad school I got much better grades, so I got a 3.97 for my last two semesters."
xs898d,2,2022-09-30,"Couldn't make it, What next?",monke_gal,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/xs898d/couldnt_make_it_what_next/,"I am graduating next July and the hiring process of my college has pretty much rounded up. Although they do have some top recruiters yet to come, but I don't fulfil their CGPA criteria. 

I studied for placements the entire previous semester and summer vacay but could only grab a cognizant programmer analyst trainee offer (which I have to confirm within a week) 

I have always wanted to work for FAANG tier company and can't decide what to do next. I have considered a few options:
1. **Cognizant**: I have heard good reviews of their training program, although I don't know if it would help me to achieve my end goal. Also, I don't know if 4 LPA would be worth it to move to a metro 

2. **Keep trying off campus**: I am kinda tired of this  but everyone around me suggests this. Also, It keeps me from studying college stuff or on improving my profile 

3. **Gate?**: Three months until the exam, hoping for a good college is unrealistic. However, I am not bad at this shit, I did manage to at least qualify last year too. I wonder if 2 additional years of education would actually improve my chances of getting a good job. 

4. **Get skilled**: building additional projects, learning more things, grind more leetcode 

5 **Teach + Study**: this is what my mom suggested, I have always enjoyed teaching, but it takes a lot of time. Not sure if I'll be able to study along

Resume Outline: No internship/ 2 normal you Tibe followed projects/ No honours or awards/ 7.9 gpa/ their 2 college 

Skills: can code/ 250+ lc/ had no problem clearing any OA. Also clear with computer fundamentals. Made projects in Java and AR. Mostly failed HR interviews due to lack of hands on experience and poor communication. 

Please help me choose from options, any other advice welcomed"

I'm from a state board school in India. I've consistently got 80% since 9th grade. Got 87% in 10th boards. However I am getting 90s in 12th (midterm exams results) because I'm working hard now. But will that even matter?

I've got a 1440 sat score. Additionally I haven't taken any rigorous courses, just the normal curriculum. I don't have any honours other then winning 3rd place in a global hackathon (hosted by replit)

I've been a coding club leader at my high school and have also been involved in conducting CodeDay, a very popular hackathon that happens in the us, for the first time ever in India.

I've done internships, part time jobs as a software developer, built products for clients that are used by 1M+ users (PlayStore downloads), built startups.  My essays are also being rigorously reviewed by a few friends in USA and I'd consider them to be strong too.  Additionally I have good relations with the teachers so I have a feeling they they'll be writing good lors.

With these stats, what do you think are my chances for t20s and HYPSM in particular?"

xs8o2o,1,2022-09-30,[ADVICE] Current Sophomore CS Student looking for prospective opinions on future career,0xR001,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/xs8o2o/advice_current_sophomore_cs_student_looking_for/,"Hey everyone, 

My name is Jay - I am currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at my local state school, with a 3.2GPA and a rough 2024-2025 graduation. I would like to know more about how I can move beyond my current IT knowledge, and go above and beyond. I have mostly taken CS classes the past four semesters, which include Computer Vision/AI, Functional Programming, Python Programming, Data Mining, DBMS, Introductory CS classes (CS 1 and CS 2), Discrete Math, Calculus 1, Computer Organization, and Networking Class. 

I have taken a student technician (i.e. help desk internship) role in my local campus IT department in my freshman year, which lasted for 2 semesters, but I do not know if I am eligible to return for the next two years, partly due to budgeting constraint, and senior priority. Right now, I've taken an unrelated role as a security officer, which is an alternative role I'm willing to take, and working my way up from there. 

I'm hoping to become a software developer, penetration tester, or switch to being administrators, but unfortunately I fear that my lack of knowledge from what I've done over the past year and a half is not sufficient enough to be valuable. Not to mention my worries over the current situation in our economy and lack of jobs prospect from the seniors who majored in CS/IT/CIS/MIS/BIS/etc. I've talked to does make me worried a little bit about my own prospect. 

As for furthering my knowledge - I'm all over the place from trying to figure out what to do with my ""homelab"", to trying to build websites using frameworks to figuring out various HTB/THM challenges - it's a bit much, but I am getting there. I also have the chance to get a Network+ Certification voucher in one my my textbook, but I do not know if it is still valid, yet, but regardless I'm willing to take the cert. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess in retrospect, I'd like to hear from the industry professionals as to what they have went through, and whether or not my worries are valid or not in this coming days and age. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: 

Need Career Advice as a CS Major looking to get into IT"
xs8v50,2,2022-09-30,What to expect when switching internship locations?,Distribution_Common,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/xs8v50/what_to_expect_when_switching_internship_locations/,"Like the title says, I am looking to switch my internship location before it's actually started. I initially interviewed for the LA location even though I'm from Oregon because I was interested in the types of companies the LA location audits. I accepted the offer in May and the internship is for Summer 2023.

After a couple of situations, I am now realizing the monetary amount it would cost for me to go to LA this summer is too much (plane tickets, driving car down there, housing etc). I am looking towards closer locations that aren't as small as Portland's office without being as far away, such as Seattle or San Francisco. Anyone else with a similar experience? I really hope that I don't have to interview again. Thanks in advance for the help!"
xs967e,1,2022-09-30,Does any of the Big 4 contact your previous employers?,GettingAnEducation,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/xs967e/does_any_of_the_big_4_contact_your_previous/,"Hello, I’m trying to find an internship with any of the Big 4 and I know they have an extensive background check.

xs9fdd,1,2022-09-30,Accept and renege or don't accept,New_Sundae_2231,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xs9fdd/accept_and_renege_or_dont_accept/,"I received a return intern offer for a company I interned at last year. Have two weeks to accept/deny. I probably don't want to intern there if I get a better option, as I don't really like the location/pay and want some variety of companies and bigger names on my resume. However, with the current hiring freezes and my current leetcode skills I'm not 100% sure that I'll be able to get another internship, or at least a better internship. I was wondering if I should accept this offer as a backup then renege if I get a better offer? Or just don't accept it and take the risk of not having an internship or having something worse next summer?"
xs9ljh,0,2022-09-30,Should I major in Comp Sci with my circumstances?,k_ullege,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xs9ljh/should_i_major_in_comp_sci_with_my_circumstances/,"Hey guys, I'm graduating high school early in december and have been researching careers and what to go into. I've narrowed it down to accounting and software engineering. Both peak my interest pretty well. I live in a pretty small town without much tech opportunities at all. I've heard that a  comp sci degree requires a lot of math which I'm not the greatest at. My college course list said I need calc 1, discreet math, and stats/probability. For context, I've only gotten to algebra 2 in school. I know the pay can be quite well for software engineering but don't know if I want to spend 4 years getting a degree if I can't get a job afterwards. I'm still confused on how many projects you need, leetcode stuff with interviews, internships and when to do them and getting the job itself. On top of that, I am very quiet and not a people person and probably will come off as super awkward in interviews. Also I am not a very creative person so I have no idea where to start on projects for my resume. 

Would school ones be good enough or do I have to come up with something entirely on my own? My area is very small and is mainly agriculture based. The software engineering jobs that are on Google in my area all seem to require 5+ years of experience. I'm scared of the math as well because of my lack of trigonometry and pre calculus. I would love to major in this field but I'm scared of not being able to even get a job in this area because of it! Is it still worth getting a major in this or should I go with a more stable option such as accounting (which have much more job openings). I like the comp sci route because of the pay and because I love to problem solve but obviously I have to think about the cons also. What are you guys thoughts?"
xsa2w2,3,2022-09-30,Has anyone leveraged intern offer into other offers?,leetcodecrazy,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xsa2w2/has_anyone_leveraged_intern_offer_into_other/,"I have heard of interns leveraging full-time return offers to get other company recruiters to fast track their process to the final round. Or at least guarantee them an OA / first round interview with the company. 

But has this ever been done using an intern offer to get another company's intern offer? I have heard that has been for full-time return offers, but has anyone (or know someone) who has successfully done this for internship offers?

Thank you for your interest in our Technology Internship Program. We wanted to reach out because we’ve experienced so much interest in the program that we have reached our interviewing capacity and we’re placing this opportunity on hold for a brief time.

This isn’t goodbye! Please be on the lookout for further communications from us should we have additional interview capacity.

Despite this, I didn’t enjoy IT Audit either so instead of setting my start date for January after my graduation, I set it for Fall so that I can get my CPA.

I’m regretting not going into a traditional external audit role as I feel all my schooling and even my CPA will go to waste in Internal Audit.

I need some advice please, should I head down the traditional Assurance route and renege my initial offer? Is it possible for me to get into another Big4’s Advisory line doing something that is more finance and accounting based? Assume that this is with all parts of the CPA exam passed."

The Avanade Digital Sales Analyst role is offering 65k plus 5k in bonus. These are both awesome companies and money aside I know they have great growth opportunities.
