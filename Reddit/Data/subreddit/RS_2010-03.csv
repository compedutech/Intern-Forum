I tend to see a commonality between them all, a focus on data structures and algorithms, and the Big Oh. Does the reddit community have any other ideas on how I should prepare for the interviews?

By the way this is my first post here, been a lurker for a long time. Thanks for the help :)"

I do not want to turn this into a resume/cover letter post, but I should fill in a little about myself.  I am in my junior year at University of California San Diego (UCSD).  I have an overall GPA ~ 3.4, with a major specific GPA of 3.47.  I have a ton of work experience as an electronic technician in the military working on electromechanical naval weapon systems, and nearly two years experience working as a test engineer for a semi-conductor manufacturing company.  I have already taken courses in fluid mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, experimental techniques, and solid mechanics.  

I am looking for an internship where I would get to work in the design, optimization or manufacturing of mechanical or electromechanical systems.  In general, I would be happy working on a project where I get to use what I have learned in school on something physical.

Any advice?,dfyz,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bepwe/im_thinking_of_doing_a_masters_degree_in/,"I'm currently in my junior year at the [Ural State University](http://www.usu.ru/usu/opencms/), pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science. I've been fascinated by linguistics lately and read a couple of introductory books on the subject. In particular, Computational Linguistics seems like a very interesing field to get into if I want to go to grad school, and seeing that we don't have any graduate CL programs here in Russia, I decided to try and apply for one in the US. I think I would like to enroll into something [like this](http://www.brandeis.edu/gsas/programs/comp_ling.html).

I'm taking a course in Information Retrieval taught by [Pavel Braslavski](http://kansas.ru/pb/index_en.html), which is as close to Computational Linguistics as I could find at the undergraduate level at my University. I will also try to come up with something linguistics-related for my bachelor's thesis.

The problem is, I'm not exactly the brightest student in the class when it comes to doing actual research. My GPA is not too high, I don't have any papers published nor attend any scientific conferences. Probably the only thing I can be proud of is that I am well versed in programming; I had a bunch of internships, including one at Google Moscow, worked as a software developer part-time and participated in various programming contests such as TopCoder and ACM ICPC. I'm not sure, though, if that matters much.

What can I do to increase my odds of applying successfully? What will a typical American university look for: GPA, cool research projects, published papers, something else entirely? Do I have any chances at all, or should I forget about it?"
bf45f,0,2010-03-18,"What would you do if you just started a temporary job at a company A and then an even better, company B calls you at work asking if you're interested?",jiceo,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bf45f/what_would_you_do_if_you_just_started_a_temporary/,"Alright, this is my first Askreddit submission, but I've been a user for over 1 year.
So, currently I am taking a break from college (only did my 1st year in computer engineering), and decided to go back to my country. I've been looking for internships to get some actual experience in a corporate environment. I ended up turning down several offers from small local companies because their internship durations didn't fit my personal plans of going back to resume my study. My ideal internship is 3 to 6 months max. So, one day, I'm sitting at home browsing reddit, and this guy calls me to know if I'm interested in a temp job as a Development Analyst at a pretty big internet content company (it's as big as Yahoo in my country, but more local, just as a reference). The pay is better than any internship, since it's considered an entry-level. I will even get the opportunity to travel later to their headquarters for meetings and stuff.
Today it's my 4th day at work, signed the contracts and everything. I haven't done any work really, just been sitting at my desk and experimenting with their cms. They still need to formally introduce me to the rest of their team and I need to go through some short training and video conference with people from the headquarters. From what I saw, the system here is all running very smooth and most of the stuff my team does is automation, site maintenance, making new channels for news, etc.

Yesterday, I was at my desk and another company calls me because they saw my resume in an online database and were very interested. I've always wanted to work there, but I made the mistake by saying ""I currently have a job, but I'm still interested, will you e-mail me further info?"" I didn't even get the person's name or extension number and the guy didn't e-mail me. I called the number back and the lady couldn't help me since their HR department is huge with sub departments and since I didn't have the guy's name, she couldn't do anything.
I don't know specifics about what the internship at this company will be like (pay, hrs, what type of programming), but I am sure that it's more computer science related, it has like 10x the annual profit and it's multinational, with headquarters in Silicon Valley, and people who intern there always say it was a blast.
Should I call them back again and try to find out who contacted me?

So what woud you do in my situation?"

Do you know any car rental companies near San Jose that will rent to people under 21?",errbody,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/bfxt6/hey_reddit_do_you_know_any_car_rental_companies/,"I was lucky enough to find an internship for the summer, but I'm going to have to relocate for it.  (Actually, I don't really mind.  San Jose sounds awesome.)

I think I found a decent apartment where I could stay for the three months I'll be there, but I'm having lots of trouble coming up with a way to acquire a car.  Most of the large chains don't rent to people under 25, and I found a few local places where the age restriction is 21-and-above.  Unfortunately, I'll only be 20...

Any ideas, Reddit?  Maybe there are some local places that I haven't been able to find, or perhaps there is an entirely different option.  In any case, any help would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: My apartment would be about thirty minutes from the office, so biking would be infeasible.  And I'm actually not sure how good the public transportation is in San Jose, but I imagine it must be decent.  Maybe a San Jose resident can comment on the quality of public transportation there.  I do agree with what AnnArchist and coolmrbrady had to say: renting for three months would be too expensive.  However, I think purchasing a vehicle is unfortunately out of the question."
bg3gj,1,2010-03-21,How should I prepare before starting a business?,chalks777,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bg3gj/how_should_i_prepare_before_starting_a_business/,"**tldr;** *I'm planning on starting a business developing websites for small companies this summer.  If you have general business advice or advice specifically in the area of web development, I would greatly appreciate hearing it.*
    
    
**A little background:**

I am a student (age 23) at Purdue University studying Computer Science.  I have done quite a bit of work with the standard web development suite outside of school (i.e. xhtml, css, javascript, php, mysql, etc).  I also enjoy my classes.  Algorithms, databases, heck even compilers gets my heart racing.  Let me make this clear: I **love** what I do.

I've done some planning already, and have been thinking about this a great deal.  My father owns a small print shop in Indianapolis and is willing to let me use part of the building for whatever I need.  I will do the majority of my work there, and it's perfect for meeting any clients.  It's also close to my desired market: small business owners.

The product I would like to offer is essentially a website that looks sharp with a small content management system (CMS) on the back end customized to each client's particular needs.  I've already created the backbone of the CMS and can easily extend and modify it.  My goal is to be able to create a website that the client can modify to a fairly broad extent without having to know any programming language.  The main issue that I have with this is that it eliminates recurring income... a client doesn't need to pay me (or bother me) to make changes!  I can't decide if that's a good thing or not.

As for technical ability, my strong point is code.  I can program all day long without breaking a sweat and have fun doing it.  If someone wants something I haven't done before, I have no problem learning how to do it (rapidly too).  My weakness is design.  I can recognize good design, but _creating_ a good design is much more difficult.  Additionally, I've found that the designs I enjoy are a little bit too minimalist for most people's taste.

Last but not least, I know this will be a LOT of work.  I'm ok with that.  In fact, I relish the prospect of spending all my time slaving away at this.  _I even quit playing TF2 O.o_



**Questions** (most of these are heavily subjective):

* What questions should I be able to answer before I start?

* What pricing is reasonable for this kind of work?

* I could conceivably do an internship this summer instead of starting a business.  In your opinion, is entrepreneurship more or less rewarding?

* If I have a more design oriented friend working with me, what sort of employee/partner/co-worker laws are there concerning taxes and whatnot?

* What's your favorite color?  Mine's green.


Thank you!"

I know, people mostly have family, but I'm not particularly close to mine.  I've had a few childhood friends in grade school but never found them to be anybody I could really connect with.  High school, I did to myself...actively placed myself as a loner, but really felt I couldn't develop any real friendship with anybody.  I tried to befriend some one who could have been a good friend but this person was a bit aloof.  College, I faired a bit better, found a few people who I at least had similar attitudes and interests, but never really connected on a deeper level. 

But, near the end of college, I did an internship.  Met somebody who went to the same college as I, same major as well.  I think we really connect very well.  I've joked that I'm the boy version of her.  And she thinks so as well (she's mentioned that she only says that to me too).   Problem is that she had a boyfriend at the time and we both think we knew we had a crush on each other at the time....sooo ::restraint::  We get back to school after the internship, we share classes, but I think she restrains herself from really connecting with me (out of *fear*?) because she had that boyfriend who eventually has become her husband... :\  (i still talk with her, almost daily)

Anyway...so now I'm working, increasingly becoming disinterested in my career choice, at a (engineering) firm with a large age gap between the experienced and the (few) new comers...so haven't really found many coworkers I could potentially befriend.  
...blah....   -_-;

Opinions? Experiences? Tips? you know the drill.

I got in with some help from athletics and throughout my four years hear I've been beaten down in almost every class. I don't feel like I've learned any practical knowledge because of the liberal education method they employ here with the saying ""well you're smart enough to learn anything you need to"" but this doesn't hold any weight with employers.

I had small internship with a startup company that bombed, I volunteered to work in Africa one summer, and I ran a student-run business on campus that did pretty well but I never got a great internship because I never had great grades compared to my classmates (I don't think I should have gotten in/gone here). I feel (and have been told by many people) that I'm more socially intelligent and I have strong interpersonal skills, than I am book smart and that doesn't translate very well into gpa, especially when your school is the only one int he country deflating grades and turning As into Bs to create the most competitive academic environment imaginable. Now I'm trying to figure out where I fit in when I graduate and I feel like I'm so behind.

I wish more than anything that had a practical degree like marketing, business management, etc but I don't and I don't have the money to go to grad school to pursue one. I really want to find a job that I like but my ideas seem to change every day and I always seem to be overlooked because anyone who recruits from the ivys only wants the best and if they don't recruit from the ivys then they want a practical degree.

How did you figure out what you wanted to do after college? What's the best way to get your foot in the door besides luck and family contacts (I have none neither of my parents went to college)? How do I sell myself to a company (figuratively not literally) when I only have very little experience to offer but a lot of motivation and confidence that I can be good at anything I'm involved in? Any advice would be greatly appreciated..."

I am 22, do design work and have ridden a wave of congratulatory compliments for my work throughout school. My work was always held high by both my teachers and other students. I lived with my girlfriend throughout college, we got along amazing, and she was my best friend. My parents constantly talked about how independent I was, and how hard I worked. 

I really have poured my heart into my work, and put myself out there. I obtained an internship very early on in college, my sophomore year. I was the last person working for the company the day it closed late last year. I have also freelanced throughout college, and have kept clients for years, I assume because they liked working with me. The freelance was never steady, just “every other week” kind of work.

I moved to a bigger city (I lived there shortly once before) with very big plans. I knew the bad economy would make things tough, but I was actually excited to fight the good fight. I had made it through college very frugally saving up a nice lump of money to allow myself time to settle in. I picked the best priced studio apartment, with all access to public transportation, and a great set of neighbors. I sold my car, and moved in. Like I said, I planned big, and I like to think I planned it out well.

I moved there in November. Since then, my world has literally come crashing down.

My girlfriend moved in with her family here in the city, so we were separated but visited as much as we could. Things went south quickly. She ended up not being able to stick it through with me, she upset me one too many times, and we began to fight. I broke up with her a month ago, she only seemed happy when some kind of money was being spent and that doesn’t fit my description right now.

I have yet to find a job even worthy of paying any bills. My savings is dwindling down. I read job posting websites all day long, look for new posts in my related field, and even non-related. I apply to them all. I have been told I am over-qualified, and under-qualified. I have had very few interviews, the ones I did get, I did very well at. They still never lead to anything besides freelance work. Worst of all is, most the time I apply for a position; I never hear a word back. I may have a job here later this week, but the excitement wore off when I did a quick calculation and found out it will not be enough to pay rent and student loans let alone buy me food. I will take it, but I can’t see any long term anymore. If I can’t find something, anything, I will end up having to move back to the small town life with my parents, which is career suicide for my field.

I feel so worthless, my heart is broken. I cannot find a job and I am begging to think it is simply because I am not good enough. I have tried to start running; I have lost weight, gained muscle, I look better, and feel better physically. I just can’t get myself out of this depression. I am usually such an optimistic person.  I find myself getting waves of depression so strong that I feel like throwing up. I usually just lie down and cry until 
I am numb. I just have the overwhelming sense of failure and its inevitability. I have never felt like this before in my life.

I read reddit and all the posts of people in similar situations and try all of the given advice, but I feel as though I haven’t taken a single step forward.

I have some safeties, some fits, and some reaches in mind, but I wanted to check over with all of you.

&gt; I'm White, but was born and lived half of my life in Russia so I'm hoping I can play that card somewhere during the application process; I live in Chicago

Comp. Sci or Financial Math in mind

4.8/5 GPA (weighted, unweighted is like 4.4 or 4.3 iirc)

So far I have taken one real SAT:
2010 composite  (710 math, rest were sub 700 I forgot exact scores)

&gt; I am expecting to score 2100 or 2100 equivalent as I take more ACT/SATs

Extracurricular Activities:

* math team 4 years (attended state once so far, projecting one more time this year and another time senior year)
* JETS (junior engineering something something) 2nd place in regionals, going to be co-captain of comp sci next year
* water polo, one year during sophomore year
* some swimming club
* internship at UIC (local uni in chicago) - I built a timesheet application over the course of 2 months and helped at the toxicology research lab
* working on rosetta-stone clone like program with a friend, expecting to get it online and functioning
* expecting to get internship at a big Chicago company this summer
* expecting to attend an engineering camp (WYSE) at a univ this summer
* worked as a private math tutor during the summer

&gt; I'm planning on taking the SAT subject tests as well; not sure which to take atm ( thinking Math II, physics, something else )

&gt; Number wise my application is fairly weak, but I am hoping some of my real world experience will give me an edge when applying to reach and uber-reach ( MIT in mind ) schools.

&gt; Some schools I had in mind: 

* Rensallear (not sure about spelling)
* Carnegie Melon
* U of I ( Urbana )
* Rose-Hulman
* Madison
* Univ of Michigan


&gt; Thanks reddit!"
