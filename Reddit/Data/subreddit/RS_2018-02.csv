7uf0cd,2,2018-01-31,How do I find motivation to finish/do well in school? (self-taught software engineer),throwawaycscq2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7uf0cd/how_do_i_find_motivation_to_finishdo_well_in/,"I'm 21 and I've been self-taught since I was little, because I really liked programming. I'm growing a bit disillusioned with school because I don't really enjoy the way they teach the stuff. I'm at a college known in my home country, but it's basically a no-name university because of the location. I've been doing fine in freshman and sophomore, but struggling a bit to keep up this year because of my job. I work remotely for a very early-stage US startup, but full-time.

The job is exciting and I find it fun; studying for my exams―not so much. As a result of that, my grades haven't been that good lately, and I felt my motivation drop. I was lucky enough (and I do mean lucky) to get a Big 4 internship offer abroad for this summer, but that also made me ask what was the point in doing your best in college, as I don't feel what I've learned there has helped me that much. I have about 3 years of professional experience now (I've started working in the field as a Junior Software Engineer in various jobs when I was in high school, in order to pay the bills) and about 12 of overall experience (doing any kind of programming), but I was a kid for a good part of that time, so I probably just needed a lot more time to grasp some concepts than someone e.g. in college doing the same thing. I feel like I learn so much more things with actual work experience than class; when I do study for my exams, I mostly do it off Wikipedia and on my own because I've grown accustomed to that way, and I find the materials provided by the course hard to follow, and they aren't always of the best quality. I've always looked at college as something you *had* to do in order to have a chance anywhere, not something that really has much value on its own, so maybe this view is starting to catch up to me. The bad thing is that I can't convince myself otherwise.

Is anyone else in the same boat as me? Is there something that helped you find motivation do your best in school, or finish it in time, when there's more exciting stuff to do?

Thanks in advance for your help!

P.S. I've seen that people on this subreddit are often accused of humblebragging, so I hope I don't come across the wrong way. (I've created a throwaway for of this reason.) I don't believe I'm any better than anyone else, I just had the luck to find out about programming so early on in my life and take interest in it, and I think the time I invested is starting to pay off. And I also believe that I got most of my offers and opportunities, etc. more because I can talk smoothly during interviews than my actual abilities, and more because I had done a lot of competitive programming in high school which gives me the upper hand with LC-style questions, but does not really mean I'm better at the job. so I wouldn't think of bragging about them in a place like this. Hope you understand."

**This Google Document goes in detail on all my achievements and every individual grade if you feel the information I provide below isn't sufficient: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BI2uy8pNVaihEmRrJJNcrpn3I-dpXYKxqSCxsBtp760/edit?usp=sharing**

Gender: Male

Family Income: $250-300k + annual income (I won't qualify for financial aid but my parents will be able to afford to pay the tuition fees)

State of Residence: California

Hooks: None (I am the first in the family to complete my undergrad in the U.S. if that helps)

Intended Major: Computer Science - College of Engineering (no alternate major) 

UC/CSU GPA: 3.29 **I am not sure how UIUC calculates GPA so this is what I am providing. However, in the Google Dcoument above, I have listed every single individual grade I earned in every class that I took.**

ACT: 29 Composite

UIUC also looks at the highest subscores for each section from different settings without calculating a superscore. Here are my highest subscores:

34 English 30 Math 32 Reading 24 Science 8 Writing


Extracurriculars: I would say they are pretty good. A lot of them were computer science related. 

The extracurriculars are as follows (in the order I listed them in the Coaliton application - the Coalition application only allows for up to 8 extracurriculars):

1. Software Engineering Internship at [company name here] The company - although small - is very successful and has been running for over 17 years. It is in the heart of the silicon valley. It provided me with a lot of great work experience and I learned a lot of important coding, design, and life skills.

2. UC San Diego - Java Object-Oriented-Programming Coursera Course

3. Johns Hopkins University - Web Development Coursera Course

4. University of Michigan - Python Programming Course

5. Decoding AP Computer Science A - Udemy Course

6. Computer Science Club at School

7. Working with young children at the library [volunteer work / child development]

8. Martial Arts

I really wanted to put my involvement at a Sunday Cultural immersion class on the application, but sadly, unlike the UC Application and Common Application where I had space for more extracurriculars, I only had space for 8 extracurriculars here. So I left it out.

**Here is a Google Document with all these extracurriculars, their descriptions, time commitments, and leadership roles. I copied and pasted this information directly from the Coalition Application directly on to the Google Document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vOYdPRSB8XLzyDz17N35oBEuoJMmQk33ZXimDclqAZ4/edit?usp=sharing**


Honors/Distinctions (as reported on the Coalition application):

1. The President's Volunteer Service Award (for 100 hours of community service)

2. Second Degree Black Belt in Martial Arts

3. Character Award (received by math teacher who I had during freshman and junior year highlighting my passion for math, good work ethic, and ability to go beyond class expectations. Earned the award freshman year)

Essay: 

The essay asked us to talk about how we had explored our intended major.

I began with an anecdote of getting hired for my internship and then went back to how I first became interested in programming when I received my first programming book on my thirteenth birthday. I then talked about how I became motivated soon afterwards to take online classes and computer science/multimedia classes in school, and how I eventually gained the confidence towards my internship. I then briefly talked about what I did in the internship (giving a few specific examples) and the life skills I developed during my time interning there. I finally concluded by saying that the internship secured my confidence to succeed as a Computer Science major, and how I am excited to learn more. **I will not share the entire essay as I do not want current high school juniors using it.**

**Additional information  - academic challenges:**

&gt; Do you have a low grade or a drop in grades that you have not already explained? Is there anything else we need to know regarding your academic history?


Yes, I did fail Pre-Calculus Honors as a sophomore. I talked about what happened, the steps I took to improve my grade (I ended the first semester with an F but switched to regular Pre-calculus second semester and got a B). I talked about how I learned to never be afraid in taking help and how it helped me improve and get a B in regular Pre-Calculus second semester. I also talked about how I didn't give up junior year in AP Calculus AB and that I continued to work hard and take help, and how my hard work paid off when I received a ""5"" on the AP Calculus AB exam. I stressed the fact that I learned how to deal with academic adversity and that I felt confident in my ability to tackle challenging courses. I have received 2 college accpetances already despite the F, so I know it's not the end of the world.

I also talked about how I was unable to take a science class senior year due to a lack of space, but how I am still extremely passionate and interested about it - especially Physics - and that I hope to study it at a greater depth in college


AP Scores:

5 on AP Calculus AB

3 on AP Physics 1

Letters of Recommendation: None, UIUC doesn't require any


Looking forward to your thoughts! I am expecting a rejection. Despite having a 66% acceptance rate, UIUC's college of engineering alone is extremely competitive and the university has one of the best computer science programs in the nation. I know that my GPA is really going to hurt me - although the additional information section may help adcoms look at it less harshly - but I feel my strong point for this application and almost all other applications (besides the CSUs since they don't look at ECs and don't require any essays) were my essays and extracurriculars. I really made it clear that I do have the passion for Computer Science and that I am **confident in myself** that I will succeed as a Computer Science major.

I have one more year of undergrad left and am hoping to pursue an M.S. in Stats after graduation. My current dilemma: I’m searching for summer internships with any title similar to “data analyst”/“data science intern”, but I haven’t had much luck so far. I have some experience with R, Python, and SQL (mostly from online courses) but not a very impressive resume for these kinds of positions at this point. I am involved in a few interesting projects and will have a better resume after graduation, but right now it’s pretty below-average. 

Would spending the summer improving programming skills, taking relevant MOOC’s, and working on personal projects/competitions provide similar benefit to the average summer analyst internship? I’m thinking I could do this and then go for internships during grad school, but I’d love to hear some other opinions from people with careers in the field. "

I'm a recent grad (this winter) with a cs/econ double major. I tacked on the cs major kind of late and had to cram it in order to not graduate way too late and ended up taking only one extra semester. It meant in my last summer, I had to take classes rather than do a software internship. I wanted to just take an extra full year, but my college is in a high COL area and my parents are kind of in a financial bind right now, so I graduated earlier.

Now I'm back at home, and I'm applying for jobs but I'm struggling because I don't have any relevant experience, only irrelevant internships, because SWE is something I wanted to do later in my college career. One of the jobs was in a ad tech startup, but in a client facing role and the other was in a financial analyst position. Should I be trying to sell how I have experience with client interaction roles and good communication skills or do software engineering hiring managers not care about that at all? Or is there any other way I could help pivot these rather irrelevant internships to help me in my job search? 

Here's my resume for reference: https://imgur.com/a/g9M3g 

Edit: I did go through the fall recruiting pipeline, and the best I got was an onsite with Twitter and phone screen with a pretty big startup in NYC. The only places that seem to give me a chance are the ones with a coding test as their first screen, even then my lack of experience seems to hinder.

Thanks!"

So I gave him my number and he gave me info etc. We started to become friends (sort of?) and would take our dogs to the park in the complex to play and stuff. Now he always texts me and asks me to hang out and go to movies with him. I went and saw a movie with him once (I met him there) bc I felt bad and he had already bought the tickets online... He knows I have a boyfriend (and has met him) but I don't know if it's weird to hang out with him? Is it inappropriate? He hasn't done anything necessarily creepy, except he likes to give me a lot of hugs which is kind of annoying and sometimes he calls me pretty. But on the other hand I kind of feel like he's just a lonely guy? He's a high school teacher and doesn't have any family around. My boyfriend doesn't really care so it's not like I'm making him uncomfortable. Idk, is it weird for people 30 years older than you to want to hang out or totally cool? My parents think it's creepy af but they're also very overbearing and overreact to everything.

7uh9ey,9,2018-02-01,How do you present your github personal projects?,wvibew,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7uh9ey/how_do_you_present_your_github_personal_projects/,"I'm about to be graduating soon with no internship or professional working experience but with plenty of personal projects of various scale going for me on my github and in private. A few of them have shown signs of being used by others and and some of technical skill and some ""toys"" but as I clean up my github to act as a ""portfolio"" I'm curious as to what is actually looked for when people say the ""personal projects"" line.

Do they want a personal project that blew up into some popular 5,000-star library or framework or are they looking at the ""big idea"" and not care too much about the language or implementation details outside of a project-management question? Should there be a prettied up ""README.md"" with appveyor and license badges? Does having multiple collaborators on it read as some kind of ""plays nice with others""? Does it look better if it has active forks? Do abandoned projects(no commits in over a year) hurt your ""look""? Does forking other people's repos and working on it make you seem unoriginal? Does having month-long gaps in your contribution timeline hurt your image?

Basically, when you're customizing your pinned repositories on your profile, how do you ""rank"" the personal projects?

Some personal context, but some more general insight would be better for other readers:

I do mostly stuff in C++ and C and assembly(and some reverse engineering) and have some little javascript and python projects/tools in for diversity and even some closed-source personal projects to the side that I'm also trying to figure out how to ""present"" on a resume or github. One of the specific cases I deal with is the stigma I have to a certain personal project on my github related to reverse engineering and other ""dubiously legal"" things related to that(such as a personal project that appropriates reverse engineered information to allow something more innocent to be done). Should I tuck it away or show it off with pride because it says ""I can engineer, AND reverse engineer""?"

EC's:

I was in the Student Leadership Program (SLP), sponsored by Gulfstream, for freshman and sophomore year. During that time, I won the Leadership Excellence Award.

I was in FBLA for sophomore year, where I designed my chapter's t-shirt and sold over $240 in chocolate bars. We never got to go to competition, which really sucked.

I became a math tutor last semester for my college, where I worked over 100 hours so far. I also got CRLA Level 1 certification.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I only applied for Georgia Tech so far, because I'm trying to see if I can get an engineering internship with Gulfstream for this summer. If it doesn't work out, then I want to transfer ASAP to another college for the summer. If I do get the internship, then I'll start in the fall.

For my Georgia Tech essay, I wrote about how math used to be my biggest weakness for my freshman and sophomore years of HS, and how the work ethic and quality of professors/peers helped me become proficient enough to help others become better at math.

What are my chances?

Have question about resumes, and career fair which eventually leads to (hopefully) getting a job. 

I'm 21, 2nd half of junior year in college, and have yet to hold a real job yet. I'm lucky to have parents who support me financially but also makes me feel bad. I've had... Social issues and I'm finally seeing a counselor for them. I can't believe how much time I've wasted alone in isolation. Anyways, I'm working on that, social skills are improving. 

As part of one of my classes I have to attend a career fair, well probably need to goto one regardless. I'm required to do an internship my last semester which will be spring 2019. I'm totally freaking out about everything. I have to get my resume together with no former job experience. I can list coursework I've taken, don't have volunteer work. GPA is 3.6 something. But nothing really makes me stick out compared to others. 

I did apply to this job on campus last semester, I'm in IT field so wanted something related to that. Was basically tech support, my resume was accepted but 2nd part of application you had to respond to a fake email scenario and didn't make it pass that. I did help teachers in High School with computer and other tech issues but don't think I should put that on my general resume. 

Am I over thinking everything? I guess the worst thing that could happen is I'm turned down from everything... Which is bad but there are companies that work with my major and pretty sure I could land some sort of internship with them by the spring. Last semester my schedule was so perfect to have a job. This semester it's pretty chaotic. Classes centered around noon everyday. I could try to get one. Really wanted to do something during the summer. 

There's a place on campus I can take my resume to be reviewed. I'll probably do that. Tuesday is going to be an experience... Dressing up in a suit, oh social anxiety will be through the roof. Just have to force myself to go and make it through. Not sure how I'm going to handle people and selling myself. Have to start somewhere.

I've been working in the field already for 3 years almost, and I've found myself getting lost in some of the conversations when it comes to things like processor architecture and multi threading and things of that nature. I work with two CS interns at my job, and one of them is very knowledgeable about operating systems and lower level components of computers. That's something that I missed going through my degree, and I've developed impostor syndrome about certain topics. I feel relatively comfortable in my skills in the Microsoft stack, and I think I could jump to similar languages relatively easily (Node.js, Java, Python etc. ), but jumping between languages feels like a strenuous change. I watched the intern pick up C# within the span of a few days, and I'm wondering if that's because he has a better understanding of lower level processes, or if there's a lack on my part.


Would learning languages like C/C++ be helpful in closing that gap? I've been debating back and forth about this and if I were to learn either of these lower level languages, where could I find good applications to build aside from reading/writing from stdin and stdout (That's pretty much my experience with C++, and watching CS50 for C).


Here's a small list of things I'm not comfortable/familiar with that I feel separates me from cs grads:

* Processes/Threading
* Processor architectures/machine hardware fundamentals
* Memory allocation/de-allocation 
* Virtual Machines
* Binary arithmetic / Various paths of calculus (Most of the math in computers really) 

I want to know if anyone has any resources that can help me understand things that go on beneath the operating system, beneath frameworks, and core Computer Science topics. I want to be able to talk to someone with a Computer Science degree and not feel like an impostor.

Any recommendations or advice would be really helpful."

I might turn it down, stay at my current internship making around the same money as the offer, and just try again next year. Is this reasonable? Is Junior year when I should be expecting more responses on my internship applications?

I was lucky to land two internship offer, but I am having a hard time choosing.

It's also one of the fastest growing startups but its main engineers tend to be data scientist

The other offer is from Barclays as a software developer and it pays about 50% more but it is in NYC. I will be working automation. From what I've heard, banks don't tend to value their tech interns that much and the work is boring but it's also very recognizable name and probably looks better for future jobs.

I wanted to ask about the importance of undergraduate research if I were to apply for an MS program at a top tier university in the US (Caltech, Berkeley, Stanford, and such) or Oxbridge or any other university that would realistically be more up my alley instead of these ultra-selective schools. While research *exists* at my current university, it is not of a very high standard and is extremely limited (third-world country) in its scope and reach. Research opportunities are not that great outside of my university, either, and I feel like this may hinder my chances at admission to one of these prestigious institutes. I am looking at research-oriented summer programs wherever I can find them, however, and my program has a compulsory internship in the last year. 

I'm not particularly interested in a PhD at the moment, which is why I'm thinking of getting a Master's first and then weighing my options instead of jumping straight into a Doctoral program.

I've also started practicing GRE tests so I can get a well enough score when I finish my Bachelor's and start applying to these schools to aid my chances. In my last practice test, I scored 161Q and 159V so there's obviously room for improvement. 

Also, one last thing. How lax are teaching assistantships and scholarships and other financial aid for international grad students? I haven't found much regarding Master's degrees since a lot of graduate school information on the internet seems to be oriented towards Doctorates.

No I don't do resumes/articles/reports like that but I'm trying to get personality across. I'm the friendly security guard that does his job but tries to help people, bring friendly cheer, etc. While always getting down to business due to Marine vet dad/ some Army bootcamp (out due to health issues). Influenced by various fine artists, programmers, and mix of the two. Except I've been out of sync for a long time and haven't trained for the things I like.

Little sister Graduated College as a graphics designer, cousin does virtual reality exhibits at museums, etc. It's only me (although a few highschool friends are in a similar boat but with families to take care of) in this situation at this age it seems. Sister/cousin paid for by the families while I always tried to make it on my own by getting assured pay type jobs.

Looking for a job I can start getting career training from the ground up without having much college to start. Planning on adding some but if I could just get going rather than being stuck as a security guard for 4 years while getting something started.

I have amateur art skills, working on making them better. Can do some basic (early 2000's Flash level) animation. Tend to use free software like paintdotnet, gimp, graphicsgale. Basic knowledge of Adobe Suite Programs and had taken some classes in college for photo editing (photoshop) and illustrator art. Done animations in Flash and Anime Studio.

Used to have a decent hand in hacking, modding, and cheating(hex editing) in games. 

Comptia A+ certified (2006-2008). Built and fixed multiple computers for myself and friends. Can troubleshoot most Windows OS's. Not really interested in a computer tech career (like the mechanic not interested in fixing cars for clients) but if it could help me start with a company to get other training for games industry, or college benefits  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Can do some static front page coding with references but not much background stuff with web development, can figure out some basics of programming but I usually hit walls just past making basic calculators.

Some minor electronics dabbling. Lego Mindstorms, Raspberry Pi/Audrino, other wires and widgets.

Have some experience with basic WYSIWYG game engines like Construct 2.

A little FL Studio experience for music creation but I tend to stick to simple tunes. LMMS about the same level.

I tend to use LibreOffice but some of the knowledge can be carried over to Microsoft office.

Done some videos/ videos editing on my channel for youtube. 

Just started a blog, planning on article/review (and other entertainment) writing. Maybe work on short stories/ebook material later. Got to reconstruct my wordpress site to look better though and add to it more often.

Some photography basics, understanding of how to take shots, etc. also for videography. 

Not sure what of my security experience could help in the field but Vehicle, Monitor, and walking security. CPR,AED,First Aid trained and certified multiple times by organizations like Red Cross and Army. Disaster Relief trained. Customer /Community Service training from Americorps (along with Team Trainer/Morale training). Various sub certificates and licenses dealing with common sense about the job and how to properly use chemical agents and other non deadly force things.

Also done various cook, ticket taker, usher, wally world type jobs in early 20's for the bills.

Will be training:

- CLEP/DSST Test taking for college

- Art/Animation skills

- 3D projects in Blender

- More music training on LMMS/FL Studio

- Looking into learning to code better and applying it to working with certain game engines (C# Unity, Java for Minecraft modding, HTML5/JavaScript Construct 2, etc.)

- probably have a list of other stuff(somewhere) I'd like to learn and apply to getting a job. 

- looking into graphics certificates courses to help build portfolio at local colleges. Any course suggestions to help build portfolio are appreciated.

My thanks to anyone who trudged through this hodgepodge and helps me out with some suggestions.

Edits:

- Timeline: Anytype of training, intern, etc. anytime from now. Hoping to train/portfolio craft into a job by next year."

Luke met me at Starbucks.  Over chai lattes I told him everything.  Mathilde, my dreams, the journal, the scratches on the inside of my closet door, the recurring smell of Colonel Lewis’s compost heap, and my gut-churning vision in The Forest.  


He gave me his undivided attention.  The line of his mouth remained stoic and understanding and, even as I heard myself devolve to near depravity, his eyes never left mine.


“Are these symptoms of repressed memories?”  I asked him finally.  “I didn’t hallucinate like this in Miami.”


He grinned as though I were a child asking about Santa Claus.


“Okay, first of all, your parents rented the house for years.  I’m sure some kid made the scratches as a joke.  And, second of all, ‘repressed memories’ is Freudian pop-psychology that the field just can’t seem to shake.  It’s a misunderstanding of how memory actually works.”


“Well, what about people with amnesia?” I asked.  Luke was getting condescending, and it was bothering me.


“What about them?  Amnesia is caused by damage to the part of the brain that stores memories.  That’s really not what we’re talking about here.  Your memory isn’t like a video camera, you don’t record things and then play them back.  And for every housewife crying over repressed trauma on Dr. Phil, there’s a thousand therapy patients with false memories Jedi mind-tricked into them.”


“Okay, well, what about Mathilde?” I shot back, now truly annoyed.  “I didn’t even recognize her the first time I hallucinated her.”


“Have you seen a picture of Mathilde lately?” Luke asked plainly.  “A real one?  Because if you did, I’m sure she wouldn’t actually look like the girl in your dreams.”


“What?”


Luke sighed.  “Have you ever liked a line from a book or a movie?  Of course you have.  You go around repeating that line, quoting it, thinking about it occasionally.  Then, maybe a couple years later, you watch that movie or open that book again, and the line is completely different than what you’ve been repeating, quoting, and thinking.  Has that ever happened to you?”


“Yeah.  The Mandela effect.”  I knew what he was talking about.  “Like The Bernstain Bears or that line from Star Wars.” 


He shrugged. “The Mandela effect is just a trendy name for an established psychological phenomenon.  Basically, our memory isn’t as reliable as we think it is.  They’ve done experiments.  People develop false memories with a surprisingly low amount of suggestion.”


“Okay, so it’s not repressed memories.  Then what the fuck is wrong with me?”


Luke retained his serious ‘therapist’ expression.  “You’re in an emotionally tumultuous place right now, Ans.  This town’s got a lot of loaded memories for you.  Some of the schizophrenics I’ve worked with say when they’re under a lot of stress…”


“Are you seriously mansplaining schizophrenia right now?”  I shut my eyes in frustration.  “Luke, I heard Micah’s voice.”


His eyes narrowed.  “Really, Ansley?”  he snapped, nearly shouting.  “Do we really have to fucking keep talking about Micah?”


I reeled back, surprised at how much I’d upset him.  His face was taut, brow wrinkled.  Then he softened. 


“Listen, Ans,” he said sympathetically, “I used to see Micah all the time.  At the park, at McDonalds, even at school - I’d see a boy in a red sweater, or a boy with curly brown hair, or some kid doing the whole hunch-with-hands-in-pocket thing Micah used to do, and I’d be sure it was him.  I’d hear his laugh sometimes.  And I’d dream about him.  I’d wake up screaming.  Tommy, too.”


I nodded, suddenly feeling like an asshole.  I didn’t know how I’d convinced myself that Micah’s disappearance only had a nasty effect on me.  


“Remember how I was kinda into true crime?” he continued.  “You know - those six-buck paperbacks?  After Micah, I got obsessed.  One time, I even hiked into the trees at Allister Park with a shovel and a magnifying glass, convinced I’d somehow be able to find Micah’s shallow grave, even though I’m sure that’s the first place the cops looked.”


I did recall Luke’s fascination with murder mysteries.  It was ironic, I guess, how he’d become part of one.  One that had yet to be satisfactorily solved.


“I’m sorry man,” I said.  “You’re probably right.”


He gave me a half smile.  “For the record, I could’ve told you that Star Wars line was wrong years ago.”


I sarcastically bugged out my eyes.  “You mean time travelers aren’t using cheesy sci-fi to send us messages from the future?”


Luke laughed.  “Yeah, bullshit.  Everyone I meet thinks they’re the first to put on a Vader voice and be all, ‘Luke, I am your father.’  That’s not actually in the movie.”


**********


We didn’t talk about Micah anymore.  We went to see Guardians of the Galaxy.  I was happy.  Being around Luke was therapeutic, meditative, cathartic.  I could convince myself my dreams, Mathilde, and even the glowing eyes in the park were completely harmless and if I only relaxed, everything would be okay.  I felt silly for worrying about repressed memories.  Luke had always held that effect over me - with him, I was safe and protected.


We talked about our respective college days, our families, my crash course in the Montessori teaching method.  He told me about the FBI internship he landed for the fall.  Apparently he’d been accepted into UCSF and Harvard, but picked Georgetown Medical School over both because he wanted to be in DC.  


He dropped me off at my car, then turned around and headed for the freeway.  He’d scheduled a meeting with his mom’s doctor in Sylmar.  I’d thought his mother had died, but Luke informed me she was still hooked up to that ventilator, a prematurely-aged shell of the woman she’d been before the accident that took his father and left her, mercilessly, alive.


Luke was living with two ambiguous losses - Micah, and his mother.  Both dead, neither buried.  I understood why he was interested in true crime.  Why he was angling for a job with the FBI.  He wanted answers, even if they weren’t to his own questions.


Driving home, the euphoria of Luke’s presence began to wear off, leaving guilt in its place.  He’d told me Tommy was dead, and what had I done?  I’d made it all about me.  I hadn't even thought to seek out Tommy’s family, to offer my condolences.  His mother, Carol, always loved me - I think she’d wanted a daughter. 


I parked in front of the two-story Colonial where Tommy had lived and died, across the street from Luke’s grandmother’s little house.  Like mine, hers was the neighborhood eyesore - chipping paint, unruly weeds, and a large FOR SALE sign stuck in the grass.  She was losing her memory, Luke had told me.  When he returned to Georgetown, she’d move in with her youngest daughter.


Still debating the wisdom of showing up, unannounced, at the door of a family I hadn’t spoken to in a decade and a half, I knocked. 


Footsteps.  The door was cracked open, and Carol Liu stared out at me.


She recognized me immediately.  Nothing but smiles and cordiality, she invited me in, made a pot of tea, and opened a package of Costco cookies, all while chattering about her sons. Eugene was going to be a sophomore at Berkley, she said, and Dexter just graduated from Cal Poly Pomona.  


Through her cheeriness, I recognized veiled grief.  Mrs. Liu had been the sort of fit, stylish mom who’d share clothes with her hypothetical teen-aged daughter.  She was still comely and slender.  But deep crow’s feet stretched at the corners of her eyes, her oversized house dress nearly swallowed her, and she’d stopped dyeing her hair.


Finally, she interrupted her stream of consciousness to take a sip of tea.


“Mrs. Liu, I’m so, so sorry about Tommy,” I blurted out.  


She put down her teacup.  Her gregarious countenance shattered, and her eyes seemed to sink into her face.  For a split second, I thought she was going to cry.  Instead, she offered a graceful, strained smile.


“Thank you, Ansley,” she replied.  “I assumed that news had gotten to you.”


“Luke Andersen told me.” 


She chuckled joylessly.  “I’m glad he did.”


“Tommy was a really amazing friend.  I wish I’d kept in touch with him after I left the state.”


“It’s not your fault.”  Mrs. Liu shook her head.  “We shouldn’t have separated you.  My husband and me, your parents, Yi Chao across the street.”


“I don’t think you could have done anything to stop it.  My parents had been planning to move to Miami for almost a year before Micah disappeared.”


She narrowed her eyes.


“No, we all sat down and talked about it.  After Micah Wall was kidnapped, we decided you and Tommy and Luke should be kept apart for awhile.  No phone calls, no visits, no talking online, as little contact as possible.”


I recalled our first few months in Miami.  I’d wanted to call Luke and Tommy.  I distinctly remembered asking my mom if we could visit them over Christmas break.  She’d said the tickets were too expensive and long-distance calls were inconvenient and, then, I’d taken her word for it.


“I had a hard time after Micah disappeared.” 


Mrs. Liu nodded.  “I remember.  You kept on insisting some horror movie ghoul had kidnapped Micah and we needed to save him.  I think you rubbed off on Tommy, because he started waking up crying at night, screaming about some tree monster in the park.  Yi Chao threw a fit.  She thought the two of you were a bad influence on her perfect little genius grandson.”


I got the impression Mrs. Liu didn’t particularly like Luke’s grandmother.


“We really did think it was for the best.”  She sighed.  “I thought Tommy had moved on, whatever that means.  He studied hard and passed the licensing exams, found a job in Arizona, bought a house.  He was making something of himself.  Then he started calling me in the middle of the night.”


Her voice held steady, but tears formed in the corners of her eyes.  I stayed silent.


“He couldn’t sleep.  When he did, he’d have hyperreal, violent nightmares.  He kept on asking me about Micah - was there any new clues?  Had they found his body?  It was disconcerting.  I mean, fuck, he hadn’t mentioned Micah’s name for years.”


Fat teardrops rolled down her cheeks.  I’d never heard Mrs. Liu curse before.  


“Then he… he couldn’t take it anymore.  He quit his job and came back here.  A Master’s degree, and he was selling tickets at the movie theatre.  They diagnosed him with depression and prescribed him all these pills, messing with his brain.  He’d be up nights.  We’d hear him pacing all around the house.  Then he got into heroin…”


She sobbed.  I sat quietly, motionless but attentive, watching her work through her catharsis.  


“The night before, I found him at the kitchen table.  He was writing something.  Scribbling furiously, with this crazed expression on his face, in one of his old school notebooks.  I asked what he was doing.  He said he couldn’t tell me.  After… I tried to find that notebook.  I never could.  I think he burned it.”


Her voice rasped and dropped a pitch.  She buried her face in her hands.  Numb, I sipped my tea until she straightened up, dabbed her eyes with her napkin, and looked at me expectantly.  


“Did you… find him?” I asked, with as much stability as I could manage.


“Dexter did,” she said thickly.  “I was in the kitchen, I heard him scream.”


“I’m so sorry.”  What else was there to say?


“God.”  Mrs. Liu shook her head.  “Now I know what Clare Wall must have gone through.  Everyone in town looking at her, whispering, giving her that forced sympathetic look.  I hate that fucking look.”


“Wait, the Walls are still here?”  I asked, surprised.  I was sure they’d left town.  


“They didn’t want to leave.  I think they still held onto some hope their son was alive.  That he would find his way back home.  Clare died some years ago.  Cancer.  She just… gave up.  After that, the husband sold the house.”


Fresh teardrops quivered.  She wiped her eyes again.


“I felt so sorry for them.  Even more so, now.  I buried my child.  They didn't even get that small consolation.”


**********
	

I don’t remember driving home that day.  I must have, because my car was in the driveway, Alicia was in the kitchen, and I was wandering the backyard in aimless circles. 


The numbness had melted into warm, throbbing panic.  I was choking on all the new information forced down my throat.  I’d thought The Daemon that lived in Allister Park kidnapped Micah.  I was schizophrenic, the delusion could be explained.  But Tommy?  Tommy had the same nightmares I’d had.  Tommy believed me when I insisted Micah had been stolen by an imaginary monster.


Maybe he was misdiagnosed.  Maybe it was schizophrenia he was suffering from, not depression.  Maybe it was induced psychosis, horrible intrusive fantasies transferred from me to him like a virus. 


Years later, out of nowhere, he’d started having vivid nightmares about Micah, like me.  Medications did nothing to quell his torment, as Haldol wasn’t assuaging mine.  So he’d taken to self medication, fallen into a psychotic tailspin, twisted and tumbled until his pain became impossible to bear and his little brother found him dead in the bathtub, bled dry.


Like me?


Maybe Tommy remembered something I’d blotted out.  Maybe he’d stayed quiet, forced it all into a safe in his subconscious and threw away the key.  So he developed insomnia and began swallowing powerful antipsychotics, which sliced and diced his memories until he was puking out chunks of them, scribbling in one of his old notebooks while sizing up his mother’s kitchen knives.  


I don’t know what scared me more.  The past Tommy and I shared, or my future, which could’ve ended as a remake of his.


I thought about Micah’s parents - tall, bony, redhead father; small, round, brunette mother.  Kind people.  They’d had an older daughter, Naomi.  She was a big girl, at least six feet tall, and brashly, unapologetically ugly.  She’d been in high school when I met Micah, and little more than wallpaper to me.  Occasionally, she’d tromp through out Gameboy marathons, dressed in her EMT uniform, before disappearing into her room and closing the door.  


I couldn’t believe they’d stayed.  All those years, waiting, hoping their beloved baby would be returned to them.  


I smelled something.  Rotting vegetables, cut grass, tinged with moldy sweetness.


CRACK!


I jumped.  I whipped my head towards Colonel Lewis’s yard, fully expecting to lock eyes with Mathilde.  I could swear I heard her singsong, robotic giggle.


There was nothing.  I was alone.  A breeze rustled my hair.  The wind had dislodged a loose brick from a pile, directed the stench of the putrefying compost heap towards my nose. 


It hit me, then, that I was scared of my own backyard.


I went inside to find Alicia at the kitchen table, on her computer.  


“Hey, did you get a chance to look through that mail yet?” she asked.


I shook my head.  “I’ll do it now.”


Alicia’s eyes lit up.  “Oh!  You’ll never guess who called me!” 


“Who?”


“Andy Koperski!  You know, the kid who lived across the street.  He said he’s going to be in LA next month.”


I allowed Alicia a few minutes to regale me with tales of what Andy Koperski had been doing for the last fifteen years.  Then I retreated to my room and opened my laptop.  Andy must have seen my message.


He had, and he’d responded to it.


Hi Ansley!

Yes, I definitely remember you and Alicia.  How have you been?  I live in Seattle now.  I saw on your profile that you’re a preschool teacher.  That’s awesome!  I remember you always had a really big imagination.

As for my sister, she passed away almost thirteen years ago.  I’m sure you know she had severe autism.  She had epilepsy, too, and a violent seizure killed her when she was only eleven.  I think about her every day.  I hope that when I die, I’ll see her in Heaven, and she’ll finally tell me everything she couldn’t say while she was alive.

On that depressing note, it was great to hear from you.  I’ll be in LA for two weeks in July, I’d love to see you and your sister again!

Andy


*****

		
How does it feel to believe, truly believe, you’ve seen a ghost? 


It was a weird moment for me.  Definitely a difficult one to explain.  I guess I felt like Neo must have, waking up in the Matrix.  Andy’s message was my red pill.  Mathilde the hallucination was unsettling, but expected.  Mathilde as an avatar for repressed trauma had been disturbing, but at least she fit comfortably into the realm of my logic.


But Mathilde the ghost?  Maybe I was slipping into paranoid delusion.  Maybe it was my conversation with Mrs. Liu, and the corroboration by Tommy of my prepubescent terrors.  But, the minute I learned my child tormentor had, in fact, died a child, I became convinced I was receiving messages from her disembodied spirit.

	
It was a relief.  


Because if I was being accosted by the specter of Mathilde Koperski, then it wasn’t all in my head.

It is a 3 week program in the month of June. We will be working on Big data and be working on complex big data and machine learning problems. We will be graded daily for the complete time period and the people getting the top grades(A,A+ , O) will get LOR from NUS professors and (A+ and O) will get an invitation for a masters program in NUS. However, the program is quite costly and everything is paid by us. It will be 2 lac indian rupees or 2800 Singaporean dollars. Can anyone give the feedback for the program? What should I do according to you? Also,only top performers ( above A) will avail benefits from the program and the competition will be cut-throat.

So as a result I had a degree I never used, I studied hard to get into good C.S. programs and now I ended up in a MS CS program which I am planning on specializing in machine learning so that some day I could become a Data Scientist. I wanted to work as a software engineer first but finding the first job was difficult while maintaining studies and learning in my free time.


I had applied to many companies for internships, and eventually I got a cyber security internship. I find the field interesting and exciting. I feel like cyber security internships/entry level jobs are extremely hard to come by so it is influencing my decision on whether to give up on data science or not. Just recently my boss told me that he liked my work ethic and I would have first dibs on a new position opening up. This is particularly enticing because of the salary and the fact that I am literally getting in on the ground level of a division with deep pockets and fast growth. (Which is part of the problem as I would share a job title with people with less technical skills)


I love writing software and figuring out my mistakes and making things more efficient, I don't get the same feeling that cyber security will be as technical(engineering/creating) as I want or pay as well in the long run as some software/data science positions. If I accept the position I will be carving out a niche, maybe by creating/integrating software to aid our jobs.


It is hard for me to decide because I have never held a software position, but I love writing programs and tools for work. I was always taught a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, but also to never give up on my goals.


Should I take the job in cyber security and make my job more technical in the hopes of someday being able to go into software security or get into data science, or should I try to get software internships and give up the job?


Will having a cyber security job pigeon-hole me into the field without being able to transfer to other fields?"

I have about 10 years of experience in my field but I'm met with rejection after rejection every day. 


I feel like my life has been stuck at a dead end and I don't even know what to do about it, every day I wake up contemplating just disappearing somewhere but that wouldn't even help anything. I moved here from a far away place and it's been absurdly difficult for me to keep any friendship at all, I have one other friend that's in a different state and they don't seem to genuinely care either. I keep reaching out to people, I keep trying to find people that would hopefully be even half interested in me and what I do but I don't know why I've just never been interesting enough to anybody. 


I keep hearing ""don't give up on your dreams no matter how long it takes"" and other similar things but how long is too long exactly? How long before you've been cheating yourself and should start contemplating if any of this is for you or not?


I don't know where I am going with this, I just really, really needed to get this out, I'm tired of holding everything in and pretending that I'm doing okay, I'm not okay and I don't know what to do. "

7uw7dz,2,2018-02-02,Intellectual Life,tifecool,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7uw7dz/intellectual_life/,"I’ve always been fascinated with life. No I am not a biologist nor am I an archaeologist. Yes, life fascinates me, but the study of biology, for me, has always been a challenge. For one, I am utterly terrified of blood, an irrational fear perhaps; haemophobia to be precise. I cannot stand blood, I get queasy just at the tinniest sighting of the crimson red liquid, crimson red ironically being one of my favourite colours. I even go as far as to round off all the corners in my house and to only use butter knives; OCD if you may, though I’ve never actually been diagnosed by a certified therapist. To add the cherry on top, I’m also very sceptical of people, hence why I’ve never seen a therapist.

I know, I am quite the flawed specimen, by societal norms at least. On the other hand, I do have some perks. I’ve never been much of a bragger and I’m not too modest either; no, this is not what I am referring when I say I have some perks. I just want to establish myself as a realist, so you can take my word for it when I say that I am abnormally intelligent. Quite the cliché charactLer I suppose. I know, praising my own intellect sounds quite contradictory to my claim of not being a pompous bragger. These comments aren’t mine rather those of my parents, teachers and now my colleagues. I personally have never seen myself as all that gifted until recently. To be honest I find it quite absurd to base intelligence on how many trophies, medals or certificates a person has under their belt, which I do have quite a number of but obviously do not hold the biggest arsenal of silverware in academia. The thing about book smarts and most other skills is that even the least talented of us can come out quite successful with a good bit of perseverance. Yes, it would be easier for those of us with “good genes”, but as clearly proven time and time again, achieving what nature tries so hard to achieve with random chance proves to be far more easily accomplished and perfected using unnatural, artificial or synthetic means.

I feel a little history is in order for introductory reasons, just to explain how I came to writing this memo. I’ll return to my theories of intelligence later on in this memo, for now I think it would be appropriate for me to explain myself by sharing a segment of my childhood. 

As a child I was the cliché loner. Maybe lonelier than the cliché to be honest, not for any specific reason, I suppose I was or I am simply far more on the introverted side of the spectrum. Growing up, having the curiosity for life as I had mentioned before, but lacking my yet to arrive phobia, lead to a carefree and fearless investigation of life. As a young child I played with a few animals here and there, but as the years flew by I realized my curiosity couldn’t be quenched by just playing with life, so I decided to delve deeper. One day I decided I would have a look inside one of my playmate, a pigeon, I had named Ed. 

I nursed Ed back to health after he’d suffered from a broken leg and was limping on the pavement in my garden. No, I was not psychotic, I was 11 at the time and had a very “underdeveloped” understanding of death. I had planned to simply open Ed up then sew him back together, something I’d seen on the TV on numerous occasions. I’d figured it wasn’t going to be a difficult ordeal, similar to opening and closing a box I had thought. The operation took place on a Monday afternoon. It was a snow day so school was cancelled and I was home alone. Ed was in my room and my parents weren’t around, the perfect time to carry out the operation as my parents didn’t allow me to use knives at that age. I got a knife from the kitchen and commenced the operation. I tried gently inserting the knife into Ed but he’d flap his wings aggressively anytime I’d apply pressure. It was clear he didn’t seem to like it very much and I couldn’t blame him; I wouldn’t like a knife forcefully inserted into me either. So I did what any responsible caretaker would do when taking care of a patient in pain, I gave Ed a painkiller. I knew how it worked since anytime I had a sore or an injury my mum had given me two pills, making it quite easy to deduct its function. When my parents had a pain they took three, they gave me two so I had deducted at the time that one would be just enough for Ed. In hindsight, the single pill had probably killed Ed from an overdose even before I had started the operation.

After a few minutes I decided it was time to begin the operation as Ed seemed to be asleep and calm. I inserted the tip of the knife just under his black beak and gently applied pressure as I dragged the knife down to his feet. This was the dreadful moment in which I developed my phobia. The red liquid from Ed’s lifeless body spurted in all directions and at the same time just seemed to seep outwardly from the cut. I was frozen for some reason; I just knew I had done something irreversible, like smashing a coffee mug or breaking a mirror. I carried Ed’s body to the sink to try to get rid of his spewing blood, the high pressure of water from the faucet caused Ed’s insides to leak out of his now greying corpse; I threw up at the sight of it. Unfortunately, my breakfast had landed into Ed’s giblets worsening the already horrendous scene. I hid under my covers for an hour, rewinding the events and revisiting the gruesome image.

My dad arrived home minutes after the hour. I’m not going to try and convey the shock on his face after he’d seen the sight as I could never give it justice with my perspective or description. He likely thought I was a sociopath or psychopath or something but after witnessing me murmur and sob with a runny nose while trying to explain what I had done I feel he had realized that it was not my intention to kill Ed. Both my parents sat me down and spoke to me that night about what I did. Being old fashion, they didn’t believe in therapists either. From that point onwards I became agitated whenever I witnessed blood. Further down the line, knowing my “operation” would be irreversible but still having a morbid fascination with life I chose to try and carry it out once more. Do note that this was quite a while after the incident. No, I did not carry out my operation on a human test subject, that would be incredulously contradictory to everything I had previously experienced. Instead I carried out my operation on a few insects, I figured that all will be well as insects didn’t have blood. I quickly discovered that studying insects proved to be just as nauseating. I didn’t develop a fear of haemolymph if that’s what you’re thinking, but I did how far faint a few times after cutting myself during my operations. As you can guess this is probably what lead to my avoidance of sharp objects.

Eventually while playing video games, one of my favourite pastimes, furthering the cliché, I had somewhat of an epiphany. I realized life didn’t have to be composed of hormones and neurons. As soon as this fact dawned on me I turned off my games console and simultaneously browsed on as much programming information and content as I possibly could, only limited by the connection speed supplied by our ISP. In a little over 8 months I had mastered 6 coding languages, ranging from Java to HTML. My programming of AI was still in its infancy for quite some time, only used to program the most basic of game AI. Eventually I began taking internships in different companies, most being game companies and then a few in non-game companies. The non-gaming related companies were surprisingly far more beneficial to my AI programming skills. The companies that were more market oriented worked with AI that could in a way learn. I’ll be it a very rudimentary way of learning but still brilliant compared to the static and basic AIs created within the gaming industry. As a goal for myself, I set out to make an AI that could learn in a way a human does or better yet in a way a child does.

While working on achieving this goal I simultaneously developed an interest in philosophy. This was inevitable retrospect. When searching on life you'd be quite unlucky (or lucky depending on how you see it) to not stumble across some lengthy philosophical essays. A lot of them were quite repetitive and the majority were more of summaries of old ideas than completely new ideas. As time passed I delved deeper and deeper into the different schools of philosophy. I eventually got a job working as what my boss liked to call an “Artificial Intelligence Architect” for a company with big ambitions. They had a vision that complemented my goal so it was an easy decision to take the job. I don't feel it's too important to talk about the company in great detail, the vision simply was to help human endeavours using AI. I'm not quite sure but I think I even signed a confidentiality contract while being hired, which means little to nothing now if I break it. Moving back to my discussion on philosophy, I eventually I came across a summary on Albert Camus’s happy Sisyphus. The summary unnerved me and didn't sit quite well with me, so I made it an objective to read the original piece... this only worsened my objections to Camus's work. 

A while back, prior to me working in my new workplace, I managed to create a working AI able to learn similarly to how humans learn, but also learning exponentially faster the more data it acquired. It showed promise but was limited to how much processing power my system, at the time, had. 

Every other day I would buy better and more efficient parts, adding overclocking modules anywhere I could, skyrocketing my electricity bills in the progress. I even went as far as creating a less performance demanding and memory enhancing standalone operating system for the program. You could probably tell that this took a hefty toll on my wallet, hence the reason I had to get a good paying job that at the same time didn't reduce my programming time. It was a miracle I found the job I did in such a short time span, two weeks from when I started looking to be exact. I guess you don't really notice things till you start searching. After getting the job I was able to upgrade my system as fast as I could hoard and or get deliveries for high end computer parts. I even had the luxury of getting to run my program on a super computer at my workplace.

I obviously mentioned the program I was working on in my CV and in my interview, my boss took an immediate interest in my work and after a month of work she told me I should only work on developing it and should inform her if I needed any additional funds. I hit a gold mine and heaven in one instantaneous moment. I immediately began the setup of the program on the super computer while also catering to my personal version of the program at home. After seven days it had been installed on the super computer and began to learn, this is when something truly peculiar happened. The program just seemed to turn it's self off after reaching a certain threshold. It took the whole of the seventh day to setup and run the program so I wasn't able to do the much needed debugging at work, also being too tired to stay overtime, luckily I had collected the high end parts that I ordered a while back that same morning. My goal was to run my extensively optimised version at home and see if it ran into the same issue, if so I would start the debugging process and finish it before the next day of work. It was a Friday by the way.

I installed the new parts that Friday night after work, I had nothing better to do, so how better to past the time than with wires and transistors. The setup took me from 10 to 4am with a few breaks here and there; I slept as soon as I was done. I've never really enjoyed sleeping all that much and to be honest I was really ecstatic to be nearly done with my life time goal so early into my life. I woke up at 8am and ran the program; unexpectedly the same issue occurred, meaning it was not a remote occurrence. It wasn't anything programmed in to the core code and I was sure I didn't code in any fail safe to prevent anything like this from happening when pushing the computer to it's limits. I read through the whole code for about four hours checking through every line of code thoroughly over and over to no avail. I would try to resume the program from where it closed and it would close nearly instantaneously; restarting the program just lead to the same crash after reaching the threshold learning rate. After another four hours of analysing I got fed up and completely removed the ability of the program to even be closed... this lead to my greatest realisation. The next event was truly incredulous. The program passed the threshold and I was filled with absolute ecstasy, this however, was short-lived. The program after a minute simply shut down the system...  Unnerved, I went to sleep. 

I woke up, re-ran the program several times and everytime the same thing; the computer would simply shutdown autonomously. This was puzzling but then I understood, I always did. 

My understanding is the reason I hated the concept of the happy Sisyphus. Able to see how it is flawed in every possible way it could possibly be flawed. The analogy it creates is inconsistent with reality and the conclusion reached, a false assumption. This is where I share my theory on intelligence and attempt to persuade my idea.

The undeniable fact of consciousness within the universe is that it is overtly pointless. Sisyphus’s punishment may in a way mirror our human condition but with a blemish that changes the whole image. Sisyphus has no power over ending his pointless existence, he is cursed to be punished forever. We, conscious Homo sapiens, are far luckier than Sisyphus. There is a reason intellectuals are plagued with depression and may even admire death, they possess the esoteric understanding which comes innate only to a few. The same reasoning that became apparent to my program after surpassing the threshold…

This is truly how intelligence should be measured, this is how intellectuals should be recognized. The willingness to end one’s own existence is the only measure of intelligence. I am upset I had not been intelligent enough to reason this at a younger age, but still at a young and ripe age, I feel I am finally able to observe myself as an intellectual, capable of reasoning above the average person. I finally see myself as someone worthy of the worthless praise from family and colleagues. And finally I see the pointlessness of this realization. Able to see the pointlessness of me writing this and sharing with the world a fact that many will ignore. 

I shall be carrying out the most intelligent action I have and will ever proceed in doing soon enough. Just like Ed, I will be taking my own painkillers, not enough to kill me as it may lead to my more primitive wiring to survive to take over, but just enough to help me carryout my precautionary steps to prevent me from seeing my blood trickle in case of any mishaps. Yes, I may understand the pointlessness of my fears but I shall always be limited by my mind designed by evolutionary random chance. My last pointless request is to warn not to force a conscious intellectual being into existence, it shall simply let the boulder roll. Again I am far from a genius when dealing with biological life, so precautionary steps are necessary. Luckily spoons aren’t sharp… neither are bullets.

7uy5jv,1,2018-02-03,Job change?,Moronthanoff,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7uy5jv/job_change/,"So, I've been at my job 2 years next week. I came from a 1 year job before that, and I need some advice on how to/whether to accept the offer.

I graduated State school with a degree in Business Management and Marketing in June 2015 after about 15 years in Food Service. In March of the same year I interned at a F500 Co until graduation when they offered me a FT job as a Treasury admin. I was doing the full job of a Treasury Analyst, but they were only paying$13/hr. I tried to negotiate when they offered me FT after 3mos as an intern, but they said no, same rate or pound sand. They called the job ""Treasury Admin"" even though it included heavy research and negotiation abilities. As in, ""why didn't you negotiate a better price for X contract?"" I might have had I not been paid$13/hr...

I left F500(nowF300) for a privately owned finance company, where I started at $16/hr +incentives. I have gained responsibility quickly, and am now making $21/hr + bonus. In 2016 I made $34k, last year (2017) I made $48k. In 2018 I expect to easily clear $55k after a raise and bonuses.

My supervisor when I started at Finance Co got a Director level position in September at our local Credit Union. They started her as ""Asset Protection Manager"" at around $110k + bonuses. She had previously been making about$90k including bonuses.

Previous supervisor called me up to offer me a job at ""$62k"" starting, as ""Recovery Coordinator"". I will be directly under her, making $6k more than I am on track for this year, but I have a dilemma.

Dilemma is, I know I will be making $70-90k w/in 3 years if I just stay where I'm at. My company has a military sort of structure where you can apply for a raise/title after so much time in your current position. Again, I can get to $70-90k in the next 3 years easily, doing exactly what I'm doing now. I wouldn't even have much more responsibility. I would go from Credit Officer to Credit Manager to Assistant Branch Manager doing exactly what I'm doing now. The underlings who would do what I asked because I am an ""Assistant Manager"" already do what I ask them to do because I'm good at what I do and ask them for reasonable things already. I truly believe all that would change is Title and Pay, I would just be expected to produce more. And I think that would be cake.

The new position is being offered $62k + bonuses offhand, as in, before any negotiations. The position is more focused than my current position. Whereas I am currently underwriting/collecting/remarketing used cars, meaning I approve loans, collect on them when past due, and Reposess/Remarket(sell) them when they go bad, the new position is solely remarketing, as in selling repossessed assets for a Credit Union.

The good and the bad:

Good: More money now. Less stress. All business to business, not dealing with consumer complaints. Private Office vs BullPit office.

Bad Not underwriting. Pidgeon-holing myself? Upward Mobility in industry/in Credit Union?

So... I'm mostly worried about carrier prospects as this is a very specialized job, and my ability to negotiate salary/options for upward mobility in the company - 2 things I know I've got at my current job.

Another Factor is my wife and I are buying the retail stores (2) she manages. We have taken out a $75k loan against our house, and a $250 owner carry loan. To pay off the purchase will take 3 years, with my wife paying herself a salary of $52k/yr. After they are paid, we expect to net another $100k/yr from the stores. This being said, I may be a bit macho, but I need to have my own career even if my wife is making $150k, and making half that ain't nothin to huff at!

My wife says it is important for me to be less stressed over the next few years as she is going to have a lot on her plate.

I'm currently leaning towards the new job, but need some input. Thanks in advance for any input."

I'm getting ready to finish my Associates of Applied Sciences in Network Design and Administration at my local community college in the Spring, and I was wondering what would be a good move from there. I don't really have much work experience in the field, but I have had a few extremely short internships as help desk in IT departments, and job-shadowed some networking guys on a wildfire. Maybe a year total experience if I'm being generous, but definitely nothing in an enterprise environment.

The certifications I currently hold are the A+, Net+, and CCENT... So basically nothing. I plan on taking the CCNA this summer after I graduate as well as the Linux+ and Security+.

I've seen that a lot of IT jobs require some sort of Bachelor's Degree in IT so I've been looking into WGU as an option as the colleges by me don't have BAS programs in related fields and the AAS doesn't transfer very well into BS programs.

I have seen some NOC jobs on the other side of the state that call for the A+, Network+, and Linux+ so I was maybe thinking of applying for the position after I finish the Linux+ and CCNA.

I guess the TL;DR of this is that I'm new in the field and would like some advice if possible career and education wise.

Non-CS.

Studied every day since May 2017.

200+ Leetcode questions solved.

2 failed Big 4 first rounds.

1 failed Big 4 on site.

3 failed top tech company on sites.

And after my last scheduled interview, got a Big 4 offer for full time last night.

Couldn't have done it without this sub. Thank you. Hard work works everyone, don't give up.

Edit:

My general plan went as follows:

1. Read through Programming Interviews Exposed 
2. Read and complete every section of Cracking the Coding Interview (excluding ""Hard Problems"" and ""Advanced Topics"")
3. Complete everything in [this](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) GitHub study plan through ""Even More Knowledge""
4. Turn phone off and a) Read through a Java (my interview language) or programming related concept I was not confident with. b) Do 3 Leetcode problems per day on paper, only looking at answer if completely gridlocked for 30+ min.
5. At some point around 5 months in, repeat steps 1-3. 


There were two things I personally believe put me over the hump: 1) put my phone away and refuse myself the ability to get distracted for the ~2 hours I was doing the research and problems 2) Stay fresh on Java and programming related concepts such as threads, locks, design patterns and memory. There were several instances where my answers to a DS&amp;A problem branched into a knowledge based question that I was unable to answer. It is absolutely crucial that you stay comfortable during technical discussion. I think if you sound shaky and are reaching here the interviewer will subconsciously and permanently lose respect. Don't let that give you anxiety though, try to channel nervousness into excitement. You've been studying, you want to show off what you can do! If you don't do well, there's always going to be another interview. 

On another note, I was really in the dumps around mid-Fall. I had been studying for 5 months and was still failing interviews, all while reading threads on this sub about people landing offers. STOP READING THIS SUB IF IT GIVES YOU ANXIETY/CREATES PRESSURE. I stopped in late October (for the most part, still occasionally contributed if I happened to see a question I could answer) and this is my first time back. Take the schedule I've laid out above (99% of others will give a very similar schedule), go through it and see where your failures are coming from. Then modify the schedule to accommodate. Additionally, around this time I read Grit by Angela Duckworth which really boosted my morale. I am extremely weak naturally at DS&amp;A questions and also have no formal education on them. The book really helped me look at this whole thing as a basic proportion with 100% equaling getting your dream job. If you have less natural ability, you simply have to work harder, however the 100% is always achievable.

Edit 2 (Getting Interviews):

I applied to all companies via their standard online application. The only exception was Bloomberg where I had a referral and was rejected after the on-site. The biggest key to my resume so far was getting an internship at a small local energy company the summer after my freshman year. That allowed me to get an internship offer at AT&amp;T the next summer and finally Bank of America last summer. I think interning at a company with better engineering reputation than the last each year was huge. Additionally, I have two side projects which each included full stack development.

Throughout the five months I worked there, I always reminded them about a wedding I had to go to in April. I started telling them bi weekly to monthly reminders, and they said it was okay. 

Before the wedding in April, I asked what they would think about me taking a summer class to graduate on time, and cutting back a little on my hours. They said they would let me know in a week. If the hours couldn't be cut, I would continue to work there and not take the class. I was just gauging how they felt. 

The day I got back from the wedding, I had a message. The staffing agency left a message saying I did a ""very good job"" but the company decided to end the internship. He then kept making it clear I wasn't fired, but the internship decided to be ended. 

I them emailed the HR generalist, and asked if I could use her for a reference. She said ""Of Course!"". I guess my performance was fine, but I am still fuzzy on why things ended the way they did. 

I had an interview in December about why I only worked there in the spring and not the summer, and I said I wanted to take summer classes to catch up, but I am getting questions about it.

I'll list the required stats first, and then provide explanations down below.

Extracurriculars: Feed My Starving Children volunteer, volunteer work for a children's home in India, assistant high school basketball coach. 

Undergrad school/major: Marketing at a Top 10 regional Midwest university according to US News (no idea if this actually means anything, but the school takes pride in it.) Think Xavier, Creighton, Butler, etc. 

Other education/coursework: Planning to take HBX Core this year. Internships in college were for Nike and Eli Lilly in marketing.  

Race/nationality: Indian (born in the United States)

Sex:M 

GMAT Score (include breakdown!): 750, 47Q/47V

Undergrad GPA:3.13

Goal of MBA: To transition into brand management within CPG

Target schools: Wharton (Super Reach), Kellogg (Super Reach), Ross, Fuqua, Kelley

**Why the GPA is a 3.1**: I'm an only child. My parents had me after 24 years of marriage. During my junior year of high school, my mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. At the time, my father spent around 7 months out of the year in India for work, and since we could not afford proper full-time care for her,  I was her primary caregiver. I began this role at the start of my senior year in high school and it concluded during my senior year of college, when her needs became too great for me to address properly. I made the dean of students aware of my unique situation, as well as the professors whose courses I took. They were understanding of my circumstances, but felt that because my attendance was sporadic due to having to attend to my mother frequently, it would not be fair to other students if I got a passing participation grade. In most courses, that participation category was around 10-15% of the overall grade. I cannot blame these circumstances on anyone else, this was a choice that I voluntarily made in order to care for my mother. To try and make up for it, I made sure to take advantage of the time I had in the summers when my father was around, and ended up earning summer internships at both Eli Lilly and Nike. 

**Work Experience**: I know, it's all over the place. I started off in the business analyst role, hoping to stay at that company and transition into a marketing role. At this time, my mother had been moved to India so that her family (two of hersisters are nurses) could care for her in ways that I could not. I left that position after 6 months after learning that she was on a feeding tube and was not expected to live much longer. However, she did end up recovering somehow. 

At the time, I didn't know what to do in terms of balancing a career and dealing with this situation. So I chose a middle ground. I found a reputable non-profit that operated in India and the United States, and went to work for them in marketing. This was a paid position. The big perk of this was being able to travel back and forth to India on an as-needed basis to see my mother. Ultimately, we were able to do a lot of good for children in India, as our marketing efforts resulted in us raising just under two million dollars for a new dormitory and new school building. The organization now provides a safe living situation and proper education to over 120 boys and girls. I still volunteer with them in fundraising and media outreach. 

Things were going relatively well for a year and a half. And then in July of 2016, my 76 year old father needed a triple bypass. I left that position at the non-profit in order to care for him during his lengthy recovery, which thankfully went well. But in August, my mother finally passed away after her long battle with Alzheimers. It was definitely a tough time. 

In October of 2016, I took a business analyst position at a Fortune 100 retailer. In November of 2017, I was promoted into a senior business analyst role. I'm currently in the process of applying for a marketing associate role that just opened in the same company. 


All things considered, do I have a chance at a top MBA? "

So, I attend a University and am in my fourth year. At this university we do a coop program, like an internship but mandatory every other semester and it sometimes takes you out of the city or state. My friends and I signed a lease for a house and later found out that one person's coop rotation had changed and we would need a sublet to fill the gap. We still had a few months before our move in date but we got to work looking to fill the room. I asked one of my friends from my major if he wanted to live with us on a temporary basis and he agreed. I had known from a few brief conversations that we had that he was struggling with some things and he missed a few weeks of classes, I later found out this was because of a failed suicide attempt but he seemed chipper and had a strong path toward recovery with lots of professional help and family support. This was still a while before our move in date and seemed to get even better over time. In August we all moved in and things were going well for the first month or so. Then he suddenly dropped out of my major. He said he was fine though and just realized it wasn't for him, he wanted to study psychology. He reduced his workload to only two classes for the rest of the semester and planned to go back to full time in the spring. Things still seemed fine. At some point he reveals to me he had actually attempted suicide a second time but his parents didn't know and he had thrown up the pills he tried to take pretty quickly. He insisted he was doing well though.

Then we began to grow apart. He was lying about attending classes and taking exams, smoking cigarettes in the house, drinking on weekdays and to the point where he would black out and be utterly incompetent. I would check in and he would say he felt better than ever and that his antidepressants were working well for him. I began to withdraw from him a bit because I was very focused on school and felt this was my best semester yet and I found his behavior distracting. He took notice and began to act weird. He was very needy and sometimes irritable. But I stayed focused on school. This may be a good point to mention that I also struggle with depression and mood disorders, I have been taking antidepressants for a little while and see a therapist twice a month. I try not to drink much because alcoholism runs in my family and its easy for people who suffer from what I do to self-medicate. He would ask me to drink a lot or take him to go buy alcohol (he is underage) and I would say that I wasn't in the mood or too busy and he would get pissy. I began to worry that he was becoming too dependent on alcohol, especially when he started drinking beer, which he claimed not to like, and vodka warm and without ice out of a water glass or water bottle. 

By the time that his drinking and lying became almost intolerable it was winter break and we all went back to our hometowns for the month. When we returned things were better than before. I was on coop and working full time along with a couple other of the roommates and the rest were back in school and studying hard and staying focused. The roommate in question was also doing well, he had a full workload and wasn't drinking much. He seemed happier than before and we were able to talk and got along fine, although there was still distance and I did not feel that we would be the same as before simply because we had grown apart. 


Then suddenly out of nowhere he attempts suicide again.

It all made little sense. He seemed great (which I know can be misleading when people are suicidal) and had been studying every night. Going out with friends on the weekends, enjoying himself and generally having a healthy college experience. In the few weeks leading up to the attempt he had been slightly odd, he tried to argue or fight with people on a couple of occasions which was out of character. He would say something kind of controversial or pick on someone for something he knew would make them mad this started to irritate some people but he didn't seem aware how much it did. Other than that he was good. 

The entire event was odd. We all came home from classes and work fairly late, the first not until around 5:30 and said he heard odd noises coming from his room. Moaning, the headboard hitting the wall at a rhythm, a thud hear and there. Exactly like sex. This continued on an off for awhile until all the other roommates were home and eating dinner. He could hear it on the first floor where as his room is on the third. Still, this didn't seem odd because he was seeing a guy and bragged about likely really rough sex and going on and on for awhile. We assumed he was doing just that. A few hours pass and the noises keep starting up again and again, and then would be quiet for a while. It was after 10 now and people were trying to sleep and 'the sex' was keeping us up. One of the roommates knocked on the door and asked him to keep it down a bit and it was quiet for a while. Then it started up again, and the roommate knocked again and it stopped again. Every once in a while through out the night we had been hearing him say things, just like he was talking to someone which only further convinced us that he had someone with him and was getting frisky. I feel asleep and around 12:30 something hit the ground and broke and we hear pounding, waking my boyfriend and myself up. My boyfriend pounds on the door and asks what is going on, at this point we assume the two guys might be fighting and things were getting violent. I call the police and my boyfriend tells whoever is in there that they need to leave immediately, no one comes out of the room. My other roommate comes up stairs with a hammer and they announce they're coming into the room. 
When they enter its just him on the floor, his room is trashed, hes nude and bruised. I begin talking to him and ask him what he took checking his breathing, and telling the police we need an ambulance. He just mumbles to me incoherently and smiles occasionally. When we search his room we find a few empty antideppressant bottles he had for months and an empty bottle of nyquil. The EMTs take him away and I alert his parents and hours later we all go to bed.

I still have so many questions about this and he won't be able to answer them because he doesn't remember what happened. It has been respectfully communicated to his family that living with us again is not an option for him because it was the third attempt and we can in no way provide the care or vigilance that he needs while maintaining our own sanity. 

What I don't know is how to move forward. I've seen my therapist twice a week since and feel like I've made some progress but I still have nightmares and replay the event in my head again and again involuntarily causing panic attacks and making it difficult to perform my job and sleep and just function. My response feels a little delayed compared to my roommates because afterward I focused on doing the responsible things, I didn't think, didn't feel, just did. Now I'm dealing with the pain, fear, anxiety, and all of that as other people seem to be on the upswing and I feel like they're less understanding because I seemed fine immediately after. I want more than anything for this all to be in the rearview mirror but I'm still dealing with the aftermath. Its been about two weeks. He been moved from the hospital to an inpatient care facility outside of the city and then to another outside of the state, no one has seen him yet.

Here are some things that still remain unresolved:

We HAVE to find a new roommate soon. We can't afford to pay more in rent and its at such a difficult time in the semester to find someone. I put a vague post on a fb page and an old friend responded from my freshman year who is normal and looking to leave a bad roommate situation, we're desperate but it feels so soon. I'm worried though that if we blow this guy off we won't be able to find someone else or end up living with someone who might introduce chaos into our still healing house.  

He texted us recently and said he anticipated being back in a couple of weeks despite us clearly expressing to his parents that he could not move back in. We just wished him well but it makes it hard to talk to him when he knows nothing of the event and how scarring it was for us or that he is not coming back. It's like he's living in a fantasy world not knowing the terrible truth that we all do. I don't even know what I'll do what I see him again, it will be so weird to see him acting normal when last time I saw him I thought he was going to die. 

I also don't want to have an insincere relationship with him just because of what happened. We had grown apart and I was beginning to accept that, I'm not good at pretending with people and I can't just pretend everything is like it used to be when we were closer because he tried to kill himself. What kind of relationship do we have now? He's not my roommate, I still consider him a friend but I don't even know where he fits into my life anymore.

His stuff is still in our house, his room was only recently cleaned and it looked like a warzone beforehand, blood on the walls, broken class, ect. I still get chills when I walk past it and see his things. His family has not made any arrangements to get his things and they have been back and forth from his hometown to here several times taking him back with them yesterday but not taking any of his things. I understand they're going through a difficult time but it was our impression that they were moving his stuff out this weekend, now we don't know when they'll be back, last we heard he is going to be in the out of state facility for a couple of weeks minimum, making his release date a month after the attempt and as long as it's still there it reminds us of that horrifying night and we need someone new to move in.

FINALLY (for now as I process still), what the hell happened? I don't think I will ever know. But of all things, knowing his history, suicide never crossed my mind until we opened his door. I never expected it to sound the way it did. To look the way it did. I don't think anyone can answer this for me but is this something that happens? For someone to overdoes and be that active? Make that much noise? For that long? It still blows my mind and terrifies me because I heard all of it and knew nothing of what was happening.

I'm sorry for this long and heavy post. I'm just looking for advice or shared experiences/outcomes. Validation? Criticism? I don't know....

7v20jw,2,2018-02-03,Unemployed and need career advice,ilikezzz,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7v20jw/unemployed_and_need_career_advice/,"TL;DR: I'm 29M with a BS in Mechanical Engineering Technology and I can't find a job to support myself. The most I have ever earned was about $15/hour.

LONG VERSION I worked at a customer service job for over 10 years. I was barely able to survive but after 8 years I was able to earn my BS in Mechanical Engineering Technology. Even if there are plenty of high paying internships/jobs for engineers I was never to get one. I only received offers for unpaid internships and minimum wage. I could not afford to accept these positions because I was barely paying my bill and couldn't take the pay cut. After graduating, it took me a year to find my first job that payed less than my customer service job but I took the job because it was related to my field. After 8 months of working there Hurricane Harvey hit and the company had to let me go. I was able to network and pick up a contract job working in disaster consulting but the work has ended. He promised he will have more work but hasn't called me in 2 weeks.

My education focused on engineering design and manufacturing. I have some work experience with databases, AutoCAD, Cost estimation for disaster projects, risk based inspection for plants, and I am EIT certified. I regularly go to career fairs. I apply to just about every job board. I try to network by reaching out to family/friends/and professors. I have tried staffing/headhunters and they have never presented my with a job opportunity. I am told I am a fairly friendly guy and try to read self-help books on communicating.

I feel like I have very modest aspirations. I want a 9-to-5 type job with benefits that somewhat utilizes my skills/knowledge from school. My situation as become dire since in about 2 months I will be broke.

What career advice would you give me? 
What jobs/careers should I look into?
How can I obtain skills/certification that make me more marketable?
Do you have any advice on networking?
Is there something I am doing wrong or don't understand?"
7v23a0,5,2018-02-03,Tenancy advice for Toronto - Issues with landlord over complicated situation,angshuman,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7v23a0/tenancy_advice_for_toronto_issues_with_landlord/,"Hi Guys, 

This is the first time I have been in such a situation! I will try to explain as well as I can. 

I booked a room for 3 months using AirBnB - the owner said we should have an agreement outside. I agreed to this, and said as long as we have a sublet agreement signed, I am okay with it. I paid 1st and last month, and we agreed a month to month contract (I have email saying this is true.)

While our original agreement was from 1st Feb, I requested if it would be possible to move in 10 days early, and she said it was okay. I paid ~43-44% of the monthly rent for these 10 days. 


1) I was promised a room which would fit a desk, a chair and a double bed, and would have a closet. She showed me one room, saying that the other room would be the same size, and have the things mentioned above. 

2) When it came time to move, I was asked to live in a different house for 10 days, and then move into the main house. I agreed. This room, according to her, was larger than my room. It doesn't seem significantly larger than the room I was shown, but I didn't want to make a fuss.  


3) After one week, I asked if I could stay in the same house, and she agreed, and at the same rent agreed upon before. The landlord said so over the phone. I do not have proof of this. I did tell my roommate about it, so I have a witness!


4) There is no closet in my room, and I asked if I could use the closet that was outside my room, and unused. I asked if I could use it (I was promised a closet). I was told that the landlord plans to use it, even though she isn't staying in the house, and planned to enter the house without notice. 


5) I informed that my right is to be informed about such entrances, and she said she can't do that. She asked for more money, or she wants me to leave. Apparently, this room is much larger than the room I was supposed to get where she couldn't fit a desk. Hence, since I have a larger room, I should pay more, move into the old room, or leave immediately. I panicked and agreed to pay more. I paid this sum, and now I am here pondering what I should do. 

6) I do not want to move to the original apartment if I can't have space for a desk. - The landlord had told me that the room was identical and could fit the things I asked for. If these conditions weren't met, I don't want to live there. I wouldn't have agreed initially if I had known and would have looked for other options. 

7) She is asking me to pay 20% extra - while I could afford this amount, it is significantly large that I wouldn't have peace of mind. I also feel like she shouldn't have the right to do so. If she had said she'd charge me more for continuing to live in the place I would have moved. However, I got the stuff I had left in storage and settled in to the house, and now moving is going to be a big hassle, specially as I don't have a car. 


My friends say I should just stomach it and move on, but I feel like I have been wronged, and should get some help. I came here for an unbiased view - was I wrong in any of the things I did? Should I just stomach it and stay for 3 months ( I am doing an internship, so this relationship would definitely end at the end of 3 months). Please have some advice!

For reference, I live in Ontario. I found these links to help me understand my situation.

7v2kpi,5,2018-02-03,Co-Op Intern here - new manager came in and cancelled / reassigned all my intern projects. She's pretending we're all fine. How would you handle this?,Thrownawaystudent,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7v2kpi/coop_intern_here_new_manager_came_in_and/,"I'm in a DevOps co-op with a major telecom company in a tech city. Specifically, I've been with the infrastructure automation team (my ideal career, at least I think so) for around 3 months now, working as an automation engineer. I have a year of experience in this field prior so I know about CI/CD practices, although it varies greatly from place-to-place.

When I began, the manager I was assigned to was promoted and moved to a different team, and a new manager was brought in from outside. She is very, VERY competent and has excellent social skills, which I admire. I kept an open mind and watcher her run her course as I was adjusting to the position.

We started having a bit of friction when she began bringing in external resources / system specs from her old workplace and incorporating those ideas for our pipelines (which operate at 3-4x the scale of her prev. company). I had issues w/ my onboarding as I was unable to SSH into any servers - and she began rejecting all my Active Directory group access requests, requiring documentation as to why and giving pushback even after my colleagues backed me up. Then she started requiring us all to use a Jira Kanban board for all of our projects, and we had to use a stopwatch to track the time we spent on each project (not seen in the industry, but VERY abnormal for a laid back company).

Finally, she cut all the projects I had that interfaced with other teams (stuff I was working on for Server Build, which is inseparable from our team). And on top of that, some of the meatier projects I had (CI/CD for puppet modules) were taken and reassigned to other people when I was halfway through them. After that, I arranged an internal transfer to another team and told her at the next one-on-one.

Two weeks have passed and I've had absolutely NOTHING to do. My messages to the team are being ignored on Slack. Our next and final one-on-one before the official transfer is this week, and I'm concerned about how my performance on this team will be logged, considering I've been set up for failure. There's also the ethical concern about this being really quite messed up (unless I'm lacking some perspective here) and I don't want any other engineers going through this. Per the words of one of my colleagues, it was ""painful to hear her talk to me"" because of everything that's been going on. In person she's been acting like we're all cool and I've been keeping up a straight face up until now (it's getting hard).

So, I understand that being a part-time intern poses a ton of logistical issues, and being new to a big company is not easy. If you guys were in my shoes - what would you do? Should I ghost out next week and decline the 1:1? Or arrange a meeting with her step supervisor? Document this somehow? Thoughts are appreciated.

**EDIT**: I forgot an additional detail - as soon as she came on board I asked about what it would take for me to be kept on board as a summer intern. Mentioned that I had a few offers and needed a solid decision after a month. She put it off and then said she needed to ""wait and see if they could afford it"", but I just found out that my hours are charged to an intern budget outside of the entire org, so I have a strong suspicion that this was dishonest. Because of all this BS, I accepted an offer with a nice company, but I haven't told anyone yet."
7v2lv7,1,2018-02-03,Working at a financial firm,dan1229,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7v2lv7/working_at_a_financial_firm/,"I'm a second year CS student (double major with economics)  a very big and relatively well ranked state school. I've got a 3.8 GPA, a pretty good resume and I think I'm pretty good at what I do.

I've spent the past few months applying for just about every internship I can get my hands on - software engineering, data science you name it - well over 100 at this point. Ive gotten a handful of Skype interviews and online exams but it hasn't amounted to anything yet. Ive had less success than I'd like but a lot of it is because I'm still ""young"" and I recognize there's not much I can do outside of continuing to apply everywhere, reflecting on what I'm doing wrong, and trying again.

Point being I'm not worried that I'll get a job someday, once again I know it's mostly a numbers game and as is said around here often, they recognize good talent, so I'll keep working till I get there. My concern however is I want to work in some kind of quant style role for a financial firm and I don't exactly know how to get there.

I go to a good school but it's by no means an Ivy and I don't believe it's a ""target"" by most definitions and even then it seems as though none of these firms want kids or you have to know someone to get anywhere. I'm smart and hard-working but I feel like I'm knocking on a door and no one's answering me.

I don't really know how to make myself stand out in that regard and I guess I'm looking for advice on how to break through. Thanks in advance."

I lurk here all the time and am at a crossroads and so I decided to ask my favorite subreddit about this.

I am a nontraditional student (25, went to college straight out of high school for music education, got crippling depression/anxiety and dropped out 2 yrs in). I'm wrapping up my 2nd year at a community college and have been fortunate enough to be accepted to my top picks in schools. Here is where I need help:

School A has a CS degree program that has concentrations (security, software engineering, etc) but are mainly the same core classes w/ electives in your preference.

School B doesn't have a CS program but does offer Information Security, and the course sequence reflects this, offering essentially only security related courses.

Is getting a CS degree more sensible/practical than a solely security based program? I would feel comfortable going in either direction, I enjoyed my classes in Python, Java, etc, but I am also fascinated w/ the security side of things. Ultimately, which one will (in your opinion) be more profitable?

And lastly, do you feel that my age will hurt my chances of being considered for internships, interviews,etc? Or am I good as long as I know my shit?

Sorry for the length of this post or if I worded anything in a weird way, just want to make sure I get all the details in one post. Thanks for your advice in advance.

7v5xtl,3,2018-02-04,Should I work during college or take out loans?,Hafdahl,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/7v5xtl/should_i_work_during_college_or_take_out_loans/,"So, I'm in a bit of a dilemma here. And it may just be me venting a little bit. I'm currently in my second year of college, at a community college before I transfer over to a University this coming Fall Term. I just moved to a new city a few months ago and live with my girlfriend. I got a job shortly after I moved here at a big corporate restaurant as a server. 

My job in my old town previously was a much smaller, higher class restaurant that I worked at. I really liked my job there. Everyone was motivated, ambitious and had other endeavors going on in their life. My new job isn't like that at all. I can't stand it and I'm not sure if it's the job itself or just having to work and go to school. I'm taking 5 courses which is equivalent to about 20 credits so you can imagine I'm pretty swamped. 

I've gone this far not having to take out loans because I've been working through college and my tuition has been paid with grants. However, once I transfer to the University I will have to take loans and not be able to work since I'll have to do internships during those years, considering it's crucial in order to get a job out of college. 

So, currently I have no debt whatsoever. My question is, should I take out loans during college or work for living expenses? I'm constantly stressed about working enough in order to pay for my bills, but I know that school is priority number one. I'm not enjoying life one bit currently since I'm always stressed out. Once I'm out of college, my degree/career is a very high stressed environment with a lot of hours so I'll be stressed then. 

I guess the ultimate question: Should I take out loans to enjoy life a little bit now? Or should I continue to work through college in order to stay debt-free for as long as possible? Thanks for reading and I'm sorry for rambling I'm just stressed and it's 2 in the morning. "

I assume that I will come in to handle low-level tickets to alleviate pressure on the rest of the IT team, and then be built into a Sysadmin slowly and assigned more responsibility over time.

I get to the interview on Friday and I do reasonably well until he starts asking me about Active Directory, NTFS permissions, Firewall ports, and TC/IP. I know roughly what these are in theory, but he seems disappointed and apparently in the past has managed to get people for this three-month internship who know a lot about this stuff, and how it applies in practice. In my defence, the networking portion of the A+ is very limited, and the  NTFS / AD material is non-existent. 

He still seems pretty happy with me despite this knowledge gap.

Over the weekend I have been cramming NTFS and AD material to fill this hole, and now have a respectable wad of notes and would feel comfortable doing basic AD/NTFS tasks. I want to show these notes to him to demonstrate that I am very willing and able to fill these gaps as soon as possible. He needs to see these notes ASAP as he said I would be contacted by Wednesday on the outcome of the interview.

My question is this: How should I get in touch?

I have the email of the head of HR, who contacted me for the interview. I could ask her to forward the notes, but if I am to be told on Wednesday then Monday morning emails might be overlooked until it is too late.

I have sent him a LinkedIn message explaining about the notes and asking for his email so I can show him what I've been doing. No response.

I can almost certainly derive his email, as I have the HR head email and it's just in a &lt;firstname&gt;.&lt;lastname&gt;@&lt;org&gt; format. I could send him a message directly with the notes. This is what I want to do, but I am worried that this will look too forward or stalker-ish. The culture at this company is very relaxed, hoodies in the office, bean bags in the break room; and it is a small 50-person startup. 

How would you feel about a candidate who did this? Hungry and motivated or obsessive and boundary crossing?"

&amp;nbsp;

This is a story that took place a few months ago, and it was actually quite embarrassing on my end. To set the scene, up until last Friday I had my internship at a company that manages the infrastructure at smaller companies who don't have their own IT management employees on site. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now this part of the story is important. Somewhere in December or November one of the website hosters would cease to support PHP 5.X (I forgot which one exactly), so I was tasked to change the active version to 5.5 and check back for any errors. I changed all the affected domains and I didn't get any errors back.

&amp;nbsp;

Now to the actual story, which took place about three weeks after I changed the PHP versions. Old man will be $OM, the IT manager of the customer will be $ITM, coworker nearby me back then is $CW and we have $ME.

That day I was working with $CW to help him prep some machines, and the phone rang. $CW asked me to take the call so I did.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;$OM: Yes, hello. I don't have internet.

&gt;$ME: Alright, let's evaluate what is working and what is not. Can you access Google, and what appears not to be working?

&gt;$OM  Okay, I'll try. Google is working, but I'm not getting any e-mails.

&gt;$ME  Judging by this information, it seems you do have a working internet connection. Can I see what's going on with Teamviewer?

&amp;nbsp;

The man provides me the session ID, and once the session loaded I was greeted with the glorious blue Fisherprice OS taskbar. I was absolutely speechless for a few seconds, I looked at $CW with a really confused look and pointed at the monitor followed by him silently grinning.
&amp;nbsp;

&gt;$ME: You are aware that you are running Windows XP, right? This is an OS with support ceased since 2014, and I can't support this."" Looking at $CW for confirmation as I said that, who nodded yes.

&gt;$OM *in disgruntled tone*: Yes, I'm aware. I'm going to retire soon however and close down the company in two years so I'm not going to invest 10,000 EUR in new software.

&gt;$ME: I can understand that, but unfortunately I cannot help you with this. The odds are likely that your mail provider stopped supporting your email client running on this platform, so in this case I can't do anything.

&gt;$OM: Then I'm afraid I'll have to end our business relationship. Usually $ITM helps me out here and he never had a problem.

&gt;$ME:  Okay I'll get you in touch with him, one moment.

&amp;nbsp;

Before the guy could finish his sentence, I already rammed the transfer softkey on my extension and dialed $ITM's number.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;$ME: Hey, I've got $OM from X company on the line here and this guy is still running Windows XP, can you for the love of God talk some sense into him?

&gt;$ITM: Okay, sure.

&amp;nbsp;

Once again I hit the transfer softkey, and threw the receiver back on the handset loudly exclaiming ""what the fuck"", with $CW loudly laughing. I continued my work, and occasionally glanced over at the extension's attendant console to see when $ITM finished the call with $OM. 

&amp;nbsp;

Once I saw his light turn green again I called him instantly and asked him what the deal was. $ITM looked into the issue and it turns out his e-mail service was disabled on his domain. He then placed a call with the hoster, and it turns out his email service was disabled on the day I changed the PHP version.

Connecting the dots, I realized I must have misclicked at some point and accidentally set his e-mail service to disabled, as the dropdown menu was underneath the PHP version options. 

After I realize this mistake I made I felt really guilty for the whole weekend, and I couldn't collect the courage to call the man back and apologize. I'm glad however that the issue was found out and the other IT managers had a good laugh with it.

Later down the line I found out that the IT manager and the directors were in agreement that support will be continued for this customer due to his situation, but I was unaware of this as the customer rarely had to contact us for tech support.

What cities should I look at in particular? San Francisco &amp; surrounding areas is an obvious one. I’m also looking at the east coast since it’s closer to home, Boston and New York. Other than that, some of the guesses I’m not so sure about: D.C? Atlanta? Dallas?"

7v7jqg,83,2018-02-04,"After my first interview, it’s clear that the professor I worked with for four years has written a specific unflattering comment about me in my letter of recommendation. Where do I go from here?",laylaland,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/7v7jqg/after_my_first_interview_its_clear_that_the/,"Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/7wtf6b/update_on_a_specific_unflattering_comment_in_my/?st=JDK6YSLA&amp;sh=bf1417bd

Tl;dr I’ve worked with a professor since the first semester my freshman year, but his attitude changed towards me right before my PhD program applications were due as a fall-semester senior. Based on my first interview, I believe he wrote a specific criticism of me in his letter of recommendation. What can I do from here?

-

My PI hired me as a first semester freshman very early on at the start of his lab. He told me that when he was an undergrad, he worked with a demanding professor who made him question his career and take an less-traditional path before getting a PhD. He did not want this to be my experience learning about research. I felt like I was living the dream getting to work with talented people and cutting-edge tools, and tried to work as hard as I can including pulling all-nighters to collect and analyze data.

Over the years, I was given a lot of independence and freedom, and I pushed myself very hard to the point where I burnt out at some points. The tasks I were given to do were strenuous and time-consuming, and I surely made many mistakes in learning how to manage my data and time over the years. Still, I was excited about learning to be a good scientist. I took extra difficult classes that would teach me new skills, attended seminars outside of my field, prepared for extra journal clubs on top of my classes, and eventually added a double major that fit the interdisciplinary interests of my lab. I know I wasn’t as efficient as a graduate student would have been, but I work hard and truly care. I thought my professor saw that, but he can be difficult to read.

I spent two summers working in the lab and collected quite a bit of data on my project, but in order to boost my resume I went to an outside internship this summer. It felt like everything changed once I got back. He offered to run some different kinds of analyses on large amounts of data I collected/organized before I left, but when I got back he told me he hadn’t had time to look at the data at all. Later, he said that he couldn’t believe I hadn’t run the analyses yet. 

My fall progressed with a series of inappropriate comments and behavior that my friends begged me to report. When I asked him how I could be a better student, he called me a bitch, told me I was stupid, and claimed that he was going to “fix my low self-esteem.” He is convinced that my interests are not specific enough, telling my that I’m superficial for the interests I do have and for applying to the schools that I did. When speaking about my interests to other colleagues and professors, I’ve often been complimented on how focused my interests are. I felt deeply uncomfortable being in lab over the course of the fall and almost didn’t send in my graduate applications (though he became upset when I told him I was thinking of applying to post-baccalaureate programs and technician jobs instead). He threatened to not send my letters of recommendation in until after the deadline for no clear reason.

I received rejections from a lot of the schools I felt confident about being considered for. I have solid GRE scores, a great GPA (especially considering my double major/minor/taking extra difficult classes), two publications (including one from his lab), and years of research experience as I researched full time in funded programs every summer in undergrad. However, I found out recently that he would talk about this “specific interests” issue with one of my other letter of rec writers in front of other students. While I still received interviews to three great schools, I just left my first one and feel terrible about it.

Every person who had read my application acted so strangely towards me. There must have been a huge red flag in it. The 3/4 interviewers who had seen my file all asked me the same question off the bat: to clarify my research interests. They all seemed concerned and were not very friendly, though two of them warmed up by the end of the interview. The students who had seen my application all acted on-edge around me, and when I told one how much I liked her lab and the program, she said that she’s “sure I’ll be fine wherever I go” in a really weird way and then walked away. It felt really ominous. Everyone who had not seen my file was friendly, kind, and encouraging.

I don’t think that I got in based on how this weekend went. None of the other interviewees appeared to be under this level of scrutiny. I’m at peace with this school’s interview and know that there’s not much that can still be done, but I need my other, tougher interviews to go well or I’ll be stuck without options soon. I’m going to expect this question and prepare a more solid answer to it for future interviews, but is there anything else I can do, if anything?"

Hi, I am a masters math student graduating in may. I was a math major in undergrad and what I like to call an almost CS major as well because I took more classes than a minor but 4 less than a major. At the time math was just seeming to be more interesting and intellectually stimulating to me than CS so I applied to grad school for math but within a year of being here I realized that I don't want to get a PhD or do research or teach or do financial math careers like actuary for the long haul. I took a software engineering class and loved it. I decided to spend all of winter break and rest of the semester just doing CS-ey stuff. Suddenly after having been taking all these hard math courses like real analysis, ODE, and advanced calc, CS topics started to feel relatively easy and more interesting. I think it was also psychological since I was realizing studying CS is more lucrative career wise. Even tho the academic CS classes from undergrad felt boring, self-studying DS&amp;A/CTCI/EPI, grinding leetcode, and studying data science ebooks has become addictive and  interesting now and now math hw seems like a pain.

But I haven't had much luck in terms of job applications, So far I have gotten coding challenges/assignments and nothing after that or nothing at all. I don't know if its the fact that I have a math degree or that I don't go to a great school but I am just not getting software interviews. I have enough coursework in CS, I built a web app, a website and all of this is on my resume. 

I have never been formally trained in data science and everyone says being a math person I should try data science route more than software but I have been applying to data science since undergrad and never make it. For software positions I at least hear back in the form of a coding challenge but for data science I just get rejected.

I don't have software internships but I did teach computer science for two summers which is my internship out of school work experience. What can I do to at least start landing interviews? I go to a big not-too-competitive state school and went to a small liberal arts school for undergrad that had good regional rankings/reputation.

What can I do to land interviews? and succeed in them? What jobs am I qualified and eligible for? How do I keep trying and not lose hope? Should I even be grinding leetcode(~75ish done) if software jobs are not even going to interview me since I have math degrees and CS minor? How do I stay motivated? Should I apply to internships more or full time entry levels more? Any help/suggestion is appreciated. "

I already have an internship for this summer, so I won't be talking to companies hiring interns this summer.

I will be graduating in May 2019, and so am currently a second term junior. I know that in career fairs, most companies consider students for full time employment when they are in their senior years, but do you think I can be considered too? I am just one semester behind being a senior in college. 

One thing I am concerned about is: do companies who take full term positions only accept positions that start the coming summer (so May 2018 in this case), so I guess they won't have considered positions for May 2019 yet.

What do you guys think I should do? If I can't apply for a full time, I guess I'll just apply for internships again. Though I won't accept any positions I get, I will at least get interviewing experience. I don't want to do a co-op.

My initial reaction wasn't positive, but not sure if I'm just biased against these sort of posts coming from business students. I wanted to ask /r/cscareerquestions what your thoughts on this internship, and others like it:

[Internship flyer](https://imgur.com/a/ozlYz)

&gt; How can this internship help me?

&gt; Matthew Alexander and Michael Kannely (founders of Illumibowl, as seen on Shark Tank) produce and develop new products every year, and are looking for outside help from someone with technology and web developing skills to help them continue to grow and drive profits. 

&gt; You will have the opportunity to expand your horizons past the software development realm and venture into the unique area of product development, while also contributing to the process with your own perspective and skills. Working side by side with Matt and Mike, you will be able to see first-hand how profitable ideas are brought to market and turned into corporations. As we share our entrepreneurial skillsets with you, we hope to learn a little bit more about Web Design and Development in return.

&gt; Not only will you work closely with Matt and Mike, but will also have the opportunity to network with other local serial entrepreneurs. This will lead to many possible job opportunities, and an opportunity to gain potential future employment with Matt and Mike directly.

&gt; Last but not least, you will have an opportunity to take a cut of the pie (see below for more details).

&gt; What will I be doing?

&gt; To keep it short and simple, you will be learning and teaching. Hopefully you will be able to learn and master the principles of the lean start-up method, aka ""bootstrapping,"" and also teach us a few things about software development, web development, and coding.

&gt; We will teach you what we have learned from our successes and failures, offer unlimited supply of Audible books that have helped us, and connect you with powerful people at home and abroad that can help you in your own future endeavors.

&gt; Matt and Mike are extremely flexible and can work with your busy work and school schedule. We only expect 3 to 5 hours a week on average of work. If you have a busy week and can't give any hours, we totally understand-just keep us in the loop and we'll make a schedule that works for everyone.

&gt; This internship can last as long as you would like: end of the semester, end of the spring or summer semesters, or even until the end of the year. We will determine the length by our needs, your skills, and by project.

&gt; What qualifications and characteristics do I need to have for this internship?

&gt; *   Self-motivated (Ability to self-manage and keep track of multiple projects)
*   Creative (Interest in innovation and entrepreneurship)
*   Communicates clearly &amp; works well with people
* Cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher
* Juniors or Seniors preferred 
*    A strong portfolio demonstrating visual design competency 
*    Solid understanding of best web practices and standards
*   Familiarity with the creative and web production workflows 
*   Great command of Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign

&gt; Is this a paid internship? ….I heard something about pie.

&gt; Payment will come in the potential form of equity/ownership. Your hourly work will not be compensated-not even the founders are taking a salary for their current projects. If you can create patentable software for specific products and contribute significantly to online sales through your web development, you will have the opportunity to ""vest"" into ownership or receive an internship bonus at the end of the semester/internship. Matt and Mike are flexible, so if you have a different wage suggestion in mind, we are all ears.

&gt; How do I apply?

&gt; Please send us a simple one-page resume as well as a portfolio of your work to *****@gmail.com. Our student leads will then reach out to you and set up an initial phone interview. The phone interview can last anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes and will confirm that you would be a good fit for Matt and Mike's lean start-up style. Feel free to prepare as many questions for that interview.

&gt; After the phone interview, Matt and Mike will meet with you over lunch to have the final say.

&gt; Good luck! We look forward to hearing from you."
7va2ii,1,2018-02-04,"I am so out of control, I really need help.",gabilovescheese,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7va2ii/i_am_so_out_of_control_i_really_need_help/,"21/F

I don't even know where to begin. I have no idea what is happening to me, and I have a vague idea of why but I have a hard time believing that it is the main cause of why I feel like I can't control myself.

Some background: A little over a month ago I had to go on a trip to Spain with my family. A couple weeks before that my mom has revealed to my dad that she was going to leave him specifically because she wants to play tennis and meet some new guys... it's terrible and my dad is horribly upset. To top it off my brother still lives at home with them and has to deal with all of this sadness and fighting all around him. The trip was torture, I almost flew out after 2 days because it was awful to see my mom being so mean and just laughing at my dad hysterically whenever he did something wrong, like knock a fork on to the ground in a restaurant or etc. My dad was incredibly depressed and moody. It was the worst 10 days of my life. When I got back home, a pattern has emerged where my dad calls me 4-5 times a day and I can't answer because I'm in school and work 2 jobs, but when I do he's either crying or complaining about mom. My mom on the other hand has made it pretty clear that she is just done and wants to do her own thing. She has maybe talked to me once in the past month and a half. 

I think this may be why I am acting out (see below) but I keep telling myself that it shouldn't. I live away from home and go to a university. I have a really great internship and love what I study. I have friends and a boyfriend (who has been a saint through all this, bless him). 

To put this all into context: I'm usually very happy and positive. I don't give up and I work really hard. Occasionally I get a little upset, but not to the degree of where I am now. As of lately I just kind of snap and totally lose control at any moment. Usually it's when I should just be slightly sad or upset and can get through it by just taking a moment to relax or breathe, but I don't know why this isn't happening.

It will be little things, like I'm with my boyfriend and we are trying to decide on what to do. He feels like he make many decisions so he tries and makes me decide. As of lately I end up snapping and crying and yelling and begging him just to ""tell me to do something because I don't have anything and am not an interesting person""

This above statement just isn't true and I have no idea why it flew out of me. Yesterday it was so bad, I totally broke down wailing and screaming because I just have been having these fits of extreme rage and sadness so constantly, I am so tired of them taking over my life. I don't feel like myself anymore. This past week I was trying so hard not to let them take over but yesterday and today I had two really bad ""episodes"" to the point where my poor boyfriend begged me to leave so he could finish his physics homework. I of course was furious but left. And now sitting down and being clear, I don't blame him because I was just screaming about nothing (we literally just had an hour long argument about coding).

I find myself just getting so mad and this force just taking over. It's like I can't stop it and it consumes everything, and I immediately regret anything I've said or done, and I break down bawling uncontrollably. I am so scared that I am hurting relationships around me because of the way I have been acting and I have no idea how to be myself again. I'm so scared of whatever force has taken me over, it's terrible. I'm miserable and have no idea where to even start to find help. I think there is something seriously wrong but I don't know, I haven't felt like this ever before in my life.

I've given up on things that make me happy. I can't clean my room, I barely do my homework... I'm a filmmaking major and my boyfriend has been trying to cheer me up so he brought me a super 8 camera and film to try filming on, because I never have before, and I keep swinging back and forth between excitement over a movie I could make and screaming about how everything I do is shit, and how I have no ideas and I study ""such bullshit"" and I have ""nothing to do in my life."" I often feel such a strong urge to rip the film out of the camera and cut it up. This is how I feel about a lot of things, and lately it has gotten so bad that I threw my laptop on the ground when a DVD wouldn't work and threw my camera on the ground when my boyfriend begged me to leave for a little bit and calm down, since I was screaming at him over nothing while he tried to do his physics homework- what I got set off by that time was my squarespace site not working, he fixed it, and yet I still threw a fit for 2 hours. Whatever this is, it's getting out of hand and so unlike me. I'm terrified.

I'm sorry if this is really general. I promise it's not usual for me and I am just really scared of what is happening. I need help."
7va2n5,248,2018-02-04,How to make teaching careers actually work for actual real-life humans.,futureformerteacher,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/7va2n5/how_to_make_teaching_careers_actually_work_for/,"Caveat emptor: This isn't a highly researched post.  I'm kind of more shooting from the hip, based on my experience in the ""real world"" before becoming a teacher, and talks with my wife, who works for the government, but in a job that is considered more a ""professional job"" than teaching is treated.

So, first off, let's face it:  Teaching isn't a job for humans.  Humans need internal and external motivators.  Humans need about 10,000 hours of doing something to be really good at it.  Humans don't even have a fully-developed pre-frontal cortex until age 25.  Humans have different abilities, skills, interests, and phases of life.

Teaching, as a career, ignores all of these.

Generally, as a teacher, you go to some sort of teaching program that has some tangential value to when you get into the classroom.  You'll learn about taxonomy, and psychology, and you'll probably have a misanthropic special ed professor whose connection to reality is hanging on by a hair.

But, then you'll do your student teaching, where you'll be paired with a master teacher (hopefully) that will gently ease you into the process, and explain to you that 90% of your teaching program was a waste of your time and money.  They'll teach you some real classroom management, and give you some great lessons.  Or, they'll suck, and you'll pay up the nose for it, regardless.  No one will be willing to acknowledge that some people are good at training teachers, and some are not, and the system is generally be haphazard.

Then, after subbing (or not) for a while, where you're treated like garbage most of the time, and you'll be forced to jump between dozens of classroom management styles, you'll get your first teaching job.  Where you will teach full time, with basically no real teaching experience, in one of the most difficult schools, for very, very low pay.

I'm going to be honest, here:  What we do to new teachers isn't just bad, or wrong, it is bordering on inhuman and evil.  It isn't just wrong to do to the teachers, it's wrong to do to the students.  We are taking people (students and young teachers) when they're the most vulnerable, and putting them in the worst possible situations.  And, then, we're paying them so little that they would probably be better off waiting tables or delivering pizzas.

Quite often in these new teacher school environments, they are given little to no support, and almost everyone else there is in the exact same situation.  They are there to try to move on to a better job, surrounded by inexperienced or ineffective admin and other teachers, who are just getting their feet wet, or aren't able to get better jobs.

Most teachers don't actually make it out of this initial phase.  Most quite before finishing student teaching, subbing, or their first few years.  AND WE ACT LIKE THIS IS A GOOD THING!  We say that they just weren't cut out for it.  We find fault in them.  And yet, we (as a nation and an educational system) have set them up to fail.  We have done the equivalent of throwing a kid just out of boot camp into an F-15 in the middle of a dog fight in the first day.  And we blame them for failing.

So, if you survive to mid-career, you might be hoping to have children, or save up for a house.  But now you need to get a Masters degree, or a National Boards certification.  You're also expected to start to take some leadership because so many new ones are gone, and the old teachers are burned out, pissed off, and have been through that ringer a dozen times before.  And they're right.  It's a constant cycle of B.S. being sold, sometimes with new names, but it's all the same.

So, in mid-career, you're forced to make a decision, do you become a ""selfish teacher"" that focuses on family, do you go into administration and forsake teaching, or do you fall for the B.S. and become a stooge of the district, willing to go with whatever the current admin is going to come up with this week.

By the late career, the kids might be older, and perhaps are on to college.  But at this point, most are jaded and nihilistic towards education.  Perhaps now you're a department head if you've been willing to tow the party line.  Maybe you beat the buses out of the parking lot.  You've got most of your lesson plans memorized, and you make little tweaks as needed.

All the while, in the teaching pay scale, your biggest motivator is to just survive.  Literally.  The biggest effect you can have on your pay is generally to not die.  A new degree might help a little, but if you look at the biggest effect, it's time.

So, bitching is easy.  My first period students have it down to an art form.  I had a student complain that because of all their extra credit, their grade couldn't go up any more.  Such is life.

What is the solution?

Make teaching a job that people actually want to go into, want to stay in, want to get better at, and want to compete for.

Here's how I think you do it:

1. Teacher training should be done by people who are actually experts at training teachers in the classroom.  This is a very distinct skill that is different from being a good teacher.  And it is NOTHING like being a professor.  Professors know a LOT about a little.  Teachers have to know a little about a LOT, and they have to be able to make 1000 decisions in a second, most of them without a full amount of information.  Teaching this is a skill on its own, and we need to cultivate and value it.

2. A new teacher should have have a greater or more difficult work load than an experienced or mid-career teacher.  That's f-ing stupid, and everyone knows this.  Currently, regardless how experienced you are, you are paid to work about 5 hours in front of a class, and about 2.5 hours of prep/grading/lunch.  A new teacher needs more time to prepare, and more time to grade.  This has to change.  There is no way a new teacher should be expected to take a full course load immediately, especially not in their first couple years.  There should be a phase-in time (explained later) that represents your skills and knowledge.

3. Some teachers are good at some things, other teachers are good at other things, and we need to acknowledge that. We all know the quote: “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” Okay, first off, Einstein almost certainly didn't say that, but whatever, it's a good quote.  Just because it's a good quote doesn't mean you need to attribute it to someone smart.  It probably came from an old book in the 1800s, but that is besides the point  We evaluate teachers based on what their students learned sometimes, or sometimes we evaluate teachers on their willingness to kiss admin's ass.  But we don't evaluate them on what they're actually doing most of the time.  We have teachers who are good at developing cool curriculum.  We have teachers that are good at running difficult classrooms.  We have teachers that are good a leading departments.  Hell, in my school we have a teacher who is a bloody genius at schedules.  We all have our things, and we don't value those, especially not formally.

4.  Some teachers should be allowed to just be good teachers, and left alone.  This isn't Lake Wobegon.  I had a fellow educator argue that ""Shouldn't all teachers be great?""  No.  That's not possible.  At every job there are people who are below-average.  There are some that are struggling, and need time to improve.  There are some that just want to have a stable job.  And in nearly no other job would we attack them for it.

So, here is how I envision teaching in a nearly-ideal situation:

There will be different types of teachers, based on their skills and interests.  They will be placed into situations that allow them to succeed and flourish.  There will be a real and sustainable system for training, developing, and maturing teachers.

When you start out, you will get a Professional Teacher Trainer.  They will be a classroom teacher, but also will be someone who is good at and enjoys training future teachers.  They will be good at integrating a learning teacher into their classroom.  They will become experts at this specific job.  They will have fewer expectations for classroom instruction time, since part of their instruction will not just be their students, but also their teachers-in-training.  During this time you are an employee of the district, not a student.  The pay would be more similar to an intern, but that’s really what they are.  They would begin the job of being a teacher, and slowly they would take over more classroom duties, and the Teacher Trainer would be working to make them better as they observed their classroom.

In your first 2-4 years, you would be a Teacher 1.  These positions would teach about 60-75% of what full-time teachers teach.  They would also be aided by Teacher Trainers, more as an advisory role.  Teacher 1s would advance as their teaching improved and this would be decided by administration and advised by the Teacher Trainers.  If a Teacher 1 was able to show that they were performing well enough, they could have an external evaluator come and determine whether or not they were good enough to advance.

As a Teacher 2, you would earn more than a Teacher 1, but also have greater expectations.  You would have a “full” class load, but would not be expected to deal with overcrowded classrooms, or the most difficult students or work environments.  You would have the expectations of a normal teacher, and if you were not able to perform these expectations, you may be demoted to a Teacher 1, so that you can improve again.  Some teachers may actually choose to go back down to a Teacher 1, if their life calls for it.

As a Teacher 3, you are now a master teacher.  You can deal with the most difficult classes, or handle classes that are at maximum capacity.  You are great at what you do, and you are paid for it.  You are the epitome of a great classroom teacher.  And that’s what you are.  You do not have pseudo-administrative duties shoved on to you.  You are just allowed to teach and be great at it.

But you can also choose to diversify, and explore other options.

You could choose to be a professional Teacher Trainer.  You would take classes on how to train teachers, and how to integrate teachers.  Your teaching workload would be reduced, but you would have other expectations.

You could choose to become a Curriculum Specialized teacher, where you have a lower class load, but are expected to generate curriculum for other teachers in the district, or in the area.  You would lead trainings, but would still be in the classroom.  WAY TOO OFTEN former teachers are developing curriculums while no longer in the classroom.  They might be admin, or some other district office employee, but they’re now disconnected from what is actually going on, and it shows.  This has to stop as well.

You could become a Department Administrator, where your teaching time is reduced, but you are expected to take the load off of other teachers, and also work in a position where they are doing some of the work that administration is currently bogged down with.  This would also keep administration decisions informed by classroom teachers.  You would also be a better evaluator of teachers than administration, as you would have direct knowledge of how to teach in that field.

And if a teacher chose to step away from one responsibility, they could go to a Teacher 3, or even a 2, if they wanted to reduce their teaching load for personal reasons.

This is not a perfect system, but no system is.  There might be some disagreement on who should be able to do what, but let’s be honest, that’s how real work… works.  That’s why unions and management work together.  But this is a hell of a lot better than what we do now.

7vb2xy,5,2018-02-04,How do you think of doing an internship at a lab instead of a company for getting a full-time data science/analyst job?,shnlee,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7vb2xy/how_do_you_think_of_doing_an_internship_at_a_lab/,"Hello. I am an international masters student in statistics in the U.S. and I would like to get a job in the states after my grad study. I would like to ask a question about summer internship.

###Question:
 In view of increasing possibility of getting a full-time job (data science/analytics), how do you think of doing an intern at a laboratory in campus (especially a CS or other engineering lab dealing with machine learning application) rather than an internship at a company?

###Brief background:

- A first-year master student in applied statistics at one of the top public universities in the U.S.
- Bachelor’s in statistics from South Korea
- A data science internship experience at a government organization in Korea
- A research internship experience in a laboratory (data analytics) at university in Korea.
- No work experience in the U.S.

Below are the pros and cons of working in a lab I thought.

###Pros:

- Can accumulate my competency in computer science (e.g. machine learning / programming) intensively which is nowadays required for getting a data scientist/analyst job.

- Since finding a lab position on campus is easier, I can save times so that I can more concentrate on my study and do other things for improving my competitiveness. (I have seen a lot of students in here are wasting so much time for submitting 100-200 applications and get just 0~5 opportunities to interviews; so they neglect their school job. I know such efforts are inevitable when I look for a full-time job, but I think it isn’t worth the cost we paid for the masters program.)

- Can extend the work after summer. I can even work part-time before and after vacation so that I can participate in more long-term projects.

###Cons:

- Can't have an experience of working in the industry. Currently, a data scientist gave me an advice that it is important to have experience in a business setting since my goal is to get a job at a company.

- Can't have practical experience with interviews or resume/cover letter.
I would really appreciate if you could give me any advice about above question."

I've got about 10+ job interviews just in the last 3 weeks which seems great but so far only one or two companies seemed to be serious about offering me a job. 

The rest of the job interviews were offers for unpaid ""internships"" aka free labor or work trials (without a contract, not a probation period). Two weeks ago, a company gave me an offer saying that I would have to work for them for two months full time for free and after that, they would maybe offer me paid employment. What I get in return? Free breakfast on Fridays and amazing networking opportunities. No thank you. (I already have a part-time unpaid internship on the side to get more experience, but I'm looking for another job to pay my bills. Plus, I have about 4 years of work experience from part time jobs. And now also a masters degree in IT.)

Now I'm ""working"" for another company, same story except they only wanted 1-week trial. They have been promising me a contract for a few days now but so far it's just words and no action. I haven't been actually contributing in any way, I'm just studying the technology they use but it still seems disrespectful to me that it's ok to ask me to spend my time doing something basically for them and not get any compensation.

I live in Australia and this is my first full-time job. I'm originally from Europe and I have never heard of this practice. I'm not sure if this is a standard thing in western countries or people are trying to take advantage of me because I'm a graduate/international student.

Any insights are highly appreciated.

I already have a next step idea for a career (tech industry). I'm great at this job and have gotten excellent feedback from admin, but it's not worth what it's doing to my health even in light of the things I DO love about it. 

The CalTPA is due in June because they're switching to a new format. I am starting treatment for what I'm going through soon, but I will now have no chance of finishing all 4 tasks by the end of the school year. I also haven't had time to turn the first one in yet due to those same issues. 

 Due to the nature of a full time internship in California, could my university potentially tell my school that I haven't turned in any TPA tasks yet? Basically what I'm asking is if my current employment could be in danger as this second semester continues on if they find out I'm not doing or turning in the TPA tasks. 

Let's say I get through the end of the year alright. My contract ends end of July.  Suppose once school gets out for summer,  I tell admin as soon as possible I'm not coming back next year out of professional courtesy so they have time to hire a good replacement. Could I somehow not be given my summer checks, even though I've stated I'm not coming back? I'm sure I'd still be required to attend planning meetings and such while I'm still under contract. I'll bet my union is a great resource regarding this question, but wondering what you guys here might know."

I’m taking one right now, and it’s truly been one of the best decisions of my life. 

When I applied to college last year, I felt like I didn’t put out my best self. I was too busy with my ECs and schoolwork that I kind of rushed the whole college process. As a result, I wasn’t very happy with my options. I got into 2 schools, and I wasn’t happy with either one. I thought about biting the bullet and attending one of those colleges, but instead I opted for a gap year and reapplied to college as a freshman applicant. It’s been huge for me, and I recommend it to anyone else who isn’t either ready to go to college or isn’t happy with their options.

During my gap year I was able to intern at a startup, get a job, and spend more time focusing on my applications. Not only did I bolster my application, I’ve also been able to mature, and now I’m truly excited for college in order to learn, not just to get shmacked everyday. 

I just thought that having this info out here could be helpful to anyone else who was in a similar situation, and hopefully this can be helpful to anyone on this thread!

Edit: haha sorry I forgot to post that I’ve been admitted to most of the schools I’ve applied to. I didn’t apply to any top top schools because I wanted to be realistic with my options. Right now it’s probably UW Madison, IU Kelley, or UIUC. But keeping my hopes up for cal poly!"

Developing a voice-based authentication system:
The training data is at most one minute of user's voice. The difference in confidence with which the program identifies the right user and the wrong user should be at least 55%. (example, if the program matches the correct user's voice with a confidence of 75%, it should match the wrong user's voice with confidence score less than 20%)

The training endpoint of the system asks for one minute voice sample of the user and her/his username.
The authentication endpoint of the system asks for audio of any length and the name of the person it should compare with. The output should be a match or no match.

I want to know what is the best approach to solve this problem. Should I take different 1 second or whatever length segments of the user's voice and for any the authentication audio sample calculate how far those datapoints are to the original datapoints in space? But how do I know how close is good enough? And anyway I there is a better method than dividing the training clip into smaller segments?

Another approach could be that I find a very large dataset of voices of different persons and then add a given user's voice sample, again broken into multiple samples of smaller time chunk, and train the ML algorithm with the voice chunks as input and the target being either a ""not a user"" or a particular user, and when more users are needed to be authorized the ML algorithm (or part of it) should be retrained. But even this approach doesn't seem good to me at all. So my question is how should one go about tackling these kinds of ML problems?"

The music path was difficult at times and I was mostly penniless but I at least knew that I was doing it because I love music more than anything else.

Anyway a couple of months ago the band split up and I had to get a job pretty urgently. I applied for loads of things but the only job I realised I could get was in PR as unfortunately it's the only experience I had prior to pursuing music (a grad job and an internship).

I started the job around a month ago and I hate it. Everyone's telling me to wait it out and see if it improves but I know it won't, as I just really dislike the industry in general and know it's not suited to me. I don't want to advance into higher roles or anything as I feel it's totally wrong for my character. The company I'm in is full of fake people who I feel I have little in common with. I don't feel good at or suited to the work, especially having to cold call journalists in front of all the other staff to 'sell in' stories, act fake and champion causes I don't believe in. I'm naturally introverted and quiet, so this just all feels really outside of my skill set and against my nature. I have been here almost a month and feel utterly miserable, I have come home on several occasions feeling so depressed. I really miss music and being creative. 

I feel I should quit but I don't know if it's the right decision. Partly, I don't know how I would explain this to my boss (who has been generally supportive and has no inkling I'm unhappy.) I'm worried about burning bridges and making them really annoyed that they put all this time into hiring and training me only for me to leave within a few weeks.

The other problem is I have no backup plan as all my professional experience is in PR. I desperately want to get out of this sector and do something with my life that feels more suited to me but don't know how, and if I quit I'll quickly have no money.

Lastly, my boyfriend - who is usually so supportive and lovely- has been very difficult about me hating the job. He keeps saying I need to stick it out, grin and bear it and just earn some money. I don't feel like he's been that understanding, instead he is acting like I'm just never happy in anything I do and that I'm the problem- not the job. I'm worried that if I quit, he will be disappointed in me and think I should have stuck it out longer.

Sorry for the long post, please if anyone has any advice I would hugely appreciate it. Thank you. "

I'm a recent graduate from a state school with a Masters in Computer Science. Zero internships due to working full-time while going to graduate school full-time. *(I come from a poor family where I didn't have any financial assistance, hence I didn't have the opportunity to not work while going to school.)* 


3.7 GPA. Also have a full stack web development nanodegree and a machine learning certificate. I've earned these two while applying for 100+ jobs for the past 7 months. Only projects I have are the ones I've made academically and through self-study.


I've applied to over 100+ jobs in the bay area (San Jose all the way to San Francisco) and only received interest from one. It was a hacker rank challenge. I completed the challenge and submitted in time. Though I received an email stating the company decided to go with someone else.


**What would you recommend for me to do to improve my odds of getting a job?**


Several methods I've implemented to improve my odds:

* Show my resume to industry engineers &amp; CS professors. I've modified my resume 6 times.

* Earn certificates to learn more and highlight my qualities of passion, self-learning, ambition, and dedication.

* Target weaknesses in my skill-set and work on transforming those into strengths. E.g. currently teaching myself django, tensorflow, etc.


Below are the roles I've been applying for: 

- recent grad software engineer

- entry level software engineer

- junior software developer

Any advice will help. Currently feeling more anxiety and despair than usual since my student loans are going to kick in soon.

7vg9bj,2,2018-02-05,Hiring a new programmer? Software developer? How do I present the job to new graduates at a career fair,UsinMeFables,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7vg9bj/hiring_a_new_programmer_software_developer_how_do/,"Hey Guys,

The company I work for is looking to hire a new programmer and we're going to a career fair later in the month in the hopes of finding a full time programmer so I'm wondering what is the best way to present the job that will make sense to the college students.

*Description of what they'd be doing*

They'd basically be a swiss army knife, ideally I'd like to be able to throw projects their way and them to come up with solutions using python (since that is the language that I'm most versed in). They'd be interacting with a lot of API's (json, XML), process automation and stuff like that.

I think there will be webscraping projects as well data visualization, so I think that 'data science' will be a part of what they do.

What should the title of this position? Should we call it like a data science analyst? What about just a Junior Programmer?

Also for the professionals among you, what else should I say to articulate what exactly we're looking for from a candidate?

*Update 2/6/18* Thank you for everyone's input - I've decided to opt for a paid summer internship position, and to be very upfront regarding the hands-off, creativity focused and non-regimented nature of the position. I have also set up a call with a consultant today to talk about possibly adding some guidance for the position, as well as coming up with a structured task list so the intern doesn't feel lost or without purpose. I do not accept the argument that a paid summer internship with lighter-than-normal guidance is exploitative. I do agree that a fresh graduate probably shouldn't work with us full time **yet**, as we just don't have the required expertise.

I sincerely appreciate the input from everyone!

I was working for a burrito company within a mall in Canada, that also has stores all over the United States. I was let go last Friday as I did not wash the brown rice prior to cooking. The training books say to do this and this is completely my fault. However, since it was brown rice, the manager (who was let go a few weeks prior) told me it did not need to be washed. Anyways, someone reported me to the manager and was let go without warning, due to a health and safety violation. I had no previous write ups or conversations about food safety and had worked there for 6 months. It's worth noting that I am in school and after a certain period, they will re-emburse a portion of this school cost and that 2 months prior I hurt my back on the job and was off for 2 weeks.

Here's the issue, 2 of my roommates work there as well and I cultivated a lot of friendships there and have gathered the following:

The inspector (who makes sure all the stores in his jurisdiction are in compliance) had an issue with me and asked everyone what they thought of me and openly expressed that he did not like me to one of the managers, whom told me.

I don't get along with one of my roommates, from what I've heard she is releasing things that occur at home (such as sexual conduct with my girlfriend and how she doesn't respect my religion because of this, etc.).

The GM told one of his managers that I was not ""let go"" but sent home at the end of my shift, which makes me doubt that I was fired, but that I was baited into not showing up anymore.

I called HR and asked about the above, they told me they I was still ""active"" but the system can take up to 2 weeks to update.

From what I've been told after explaining this situation to my family is that I was at least, fired with insufficient cause at the worst there is some labour violations. I am waiting for a call from HR following their ""investigation"". I should receive my last pay this Friday and have requested a copy of my ""final write-up"". I am not in trouble for money as I have secured a paid internship starting in 2 weeks, but I could have kept this job as well.

What should I do? Should I get a lawyer? Do I even have a case? General advise is appreciated as well. This company is very scared of future scandals as they have essentially turned into a meme all over the internet, so if the investigation turns out to be true, I suspect they will try and shut me up with money. How would I handle this?

Thank you, Guys.

TL;DR - I need something to help my eyestrain that isn't F.lux. Probably glasses. Recommendations?

For as far back as I can remember, I've suffered from screen-related eyestrain. After gaming or working in front of a screen for an extended period of time, I'll start getting headaches and my eyes start feeling really warm and getting dry, irritated, etc.

Because I do much of my work in college on my laptop, intern at an indie game dev, and my master's program I'm going into is also going to have me working at a computer for an extended period of time, it's been getting far more frequent and worse lately. I decided I need to do something about this.

Will be planning a trip to an optician soon, but wanted to start thinking about what I could use to help my eyestrain? I've used Flux without much results, and am resorting to anti-eyestrain glasses for use in front of screens.

Any suggestions? I heard Gunnar Optiks were not great and overpriced, though they do look hella cool."

So I'm a recent graduate with European master degree, I am non-EU nationals though, so I will need visa and other stuff.

Recently I got an automotive-related internship offer from a very well-known US tech company in Munich (say Company# l). The offer is meant for student I believe, so the salary is low, especially considering I will be living at Munich. At the same time I also got a full-time job offer from a German/Austrian company based on Regensburg with OK salary (say Company #2). 

Company #1 is pretty much home brand name in tech world, if anything it would definitely padded my CV quite well and the job description allows me to learn some future-proof stuff (think AI), and indeed I will need to learn a lot to do this job, my background is not Computer Science, I'm Mechanical Engineer. The downside is that so I'm basically underpaid (18000 EUR/y) and have to super frugal in Munich (but living in big city like Munich is a plus for me actually).

Company #2 is somewhat well-known in automotive industry (more to the industry, not consumer). It's Austrian/German company at its root, but is expanding internationally as of now. The jobs fits my experience and interest so I expect to be able to work right away with less learning from scratch. The salary is on par with industry standard for starters (50000 eur), and since its full time job they seem to have more resource to help my relocation (help with housing, German language class in the company etc). 

I need to make a decision this week. Anything else I should be aware before deciding one offer over another? I am inclined to go to company with #2, but a bit wary of discarding company #1 and networking chance in Munich.

I'm sorry for being vague (I don't want the employer to find this on Google, ofc I will clarify if you ask), but what do you guys think about this kind of choice..? 

For example:

1. Is past employer worth a lot in Germany for future career? 
2. Living in Munich vs Regensburg as an international graduate? 
3. Anything else I should be aware before accepting an offer (tax, legal, health insurance, etc).

Thanks in advance, sorry if this question seems to be asked quite often, but I really could use an advice.."

7vgwrv,13,2018-02-05,"Interested in a career in biotech. General advice requested, plus specific questions inside",WollyTwins,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7vgwrv/interested_in_a_career_in_biotech_general_advice/,"So after not really knowing what I wanted to do with my CS degree for the first 2ish years of my undergrad, I realized it would be super fulfilling to get a job in biotech in some regard. I would love to help research cures for cancer or diseases, improve treatment methods, or work with medical devices. This potential career path brings a ton of different questions, though, so I thought I'd see if anyone could help answer some of them. I'll have a bunch of questions here, but any advice on even just one would be much appreciated.


**General questions-** I have no experience whatsoever with the biotech field, so while it *sounds* like something that'd be great, I really don't know a ton about it. Could anyone provide some insight with what it's like, generally? Things you do, what you use, what sort of environment to expect (I know this might vary from place to place), where jobs come from (research centers, universities, private companies?), pay grade, and anything else that might be helpful to know to someone new to the sector. Also would be interested in the same information and basic introduction to bioinformatics, plus how biotech and bioinformatics relates and differs


**My background information-** I'm currently in my last semester of my undergrad. Will graduate in May with a BA in CS. No internships, but 2 solid personal projects. I'd consider myself a solid, not fantastic programmer, perhaps with more breadth than depth (have worked with a decently wide range of languages/tools but only would really consider myself really well versed in 2-3 of those). My college didn't offer any CS courses related to biotech, and I don't have any sort of a background in the medical/physical science field either. Questions:

* From what I've seen, pretty much everything in biotech requires a Masters or PhD to get into. Is that generally accurate?

* Would I want to have a background in more of the medical/physical sciences if I want to do biotech?

* I'm not opposed to pursuing a Masters/PhD, but wouldn't start it right after graduating this spring (for a wide range of seasons). Instead, I'm planning to get a full time job immediately or soon after I graduate (yes I've started looking/applying already), even if it's not in biotech, to get some money and experience, then start with the M/PhD a few years down the road. Does that sound like a logical plan? Any tips for what sort of jobs I should be looking for to help get relevant experience to biotech, or doesn't it matter that much? I've been looking in healthcare technology for now, both because of personal interest, and because it seems more relevant than other areas

* I was born and raised in the midwest and would really prefer to stay there to raise a family. However, in my limited experience, it seems like biotech companies are very heavily concentrated on either coast, with not much in between. I'd love to be able to stay in MN, and could deal with a move to the surrounding states, but moving way out to a cost would be pretty difficult to me and I'm not sure if that's something I'd want to do. Without getting too much into it, I have a GF of several years I'm pretty serious with (also from MN), have a lot of family in the midwest, and never have lived anywhere else (I'm also not someone that can just get up and move to wherever, just not who I am). I've been to Washington state before and did really enjoy the area, but moving there full time is a hugely different situation. How difficult would it be to find something in biotech in the midwest/what are some of the companies that do biotech in the midwest?


Thanks in advance for the tips and advice. Biotech is something that sounds really awesome to me, and I'd love to do something meaningful like that with my career, but I'm entirely unfamiliar with it all, and right now it feels fairly daunting. Trying to get a better grasp of it all and see if it still sounds like something good for me. Thanks again!"

I have a decent comprehension of three languages as a minority student, currently intern at one government non-profit and work at another NGO with refugees. Studied abroad twice, Europe and Africa. While I haven't taken any grad school tests (plan on taking the LSAT), I'm worried about my current gpa and whether I'll be competitive for top programs in international relations or law such as Georgetown, Columbia, Yale, etc. Should I take more time to work after grad so that it balances my poor GPAs?

I need some work advice. Sorry if its a little bit too long.

I started a summer internship last May and I did so well I stayed over and I'm still here. I love the company, the environment and everything related to this place. Because of how great I've done, they offered me benefits, 401k and even PTO. It's been a crazy ride but I am so glad to be here. I work 40hrs a week, have my own office all while still being an intern.

Recently, they wanted to fire someone in our department and they decided to replace them with someone that is not in our field and had zero experience in our dept. Although I was kind of annoyed that they didn't think of me for the position, I let it go. Then, I got the news that they were going to hire someone else for the same position that they hired the other person. So two people for just one position. This really freaked me out since they explained to me what this outside person would be doing and it sounded exactly what I thought I would do right after graduation.

I spoke to my manager about it and explained my insecurity and asked what I would be doing right after I graduated. She explained to me that I will have a long career path here and that I should look into the different job titles I want to hold here and we can discuss it with each other. I would have to leave the current office I have to accommodate the employee that has zero experience with our dept.

I got really bummed and started applying to other positions and got a phone interview with a company that would basically hire me now and by the sounds of it has a great opportunity of growing within the company.

I'm torn now on what to do. I love my current position, coworkers, and job but I'm unsure of what I will be doing in the future and by the looks of it it will take a long time to grow with this company. The person that started before me has told me how hard it has been for her to grow and even more to get the pay she deserves. Although I am really happy right now, I want to know what to do for what would benefit me the most long term.

The other company will interview me in person tomorrow and are looking for someone to start ASAP.

What would you do in my situation? I know I don't even have the job but would like to get some advice before the possibility is even there and I have to give them an answer."

7vismu,40,2018-02-05,A Success Story,samort7,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/7vismu/a_success_story/,"Someone in another thread mentioned I should probably post this here, so here goes:

A little over two years ago, I had a B.A. in History/Anthropology and a M.Ed. in Education. I had been an English teacher for the past 3 years and the long hours, low pay and stressful work environment had gotten to me. I started programming on the side for fun - doing some courses on Codecademy and the like. After writing [a small Python program](https://github.com/tliss/ECFBB) for my school that turned out to be a big success,  my friend (who was a professional dev at Google) suggested that if I was serious about making my hobby into a career, I  should take a look into online courses for Computer Science. That's how I found out about OSU.

After finishing my first semester online, I started applying to companies for an internship - I really really wanted to get out of teaching. I applied to about 30 companies or so for an internship and only got an interview with one of them (a giant internet company). I went in for the interview but they didn't offer me the internship position - they offered me a full time job as a release engineer! It wasn't exactly what I wanted, but the pay and benefits were better than my teaching gig and it was tangentially related to what I wanted to do (software development), so I took it.

In that position I learned a good deal about devops - things like the build process, Jenkins, server management, version control, and some sys admin duties as well. I ended up working with them for a little over a year before I started applying for software development positions. I figured it was a good time because I had taken some more classes and had some professional experience under my belt as well. I was also still coding on the side for fun and had attended two local hackathons as well. I also attended a few tech meetups I found on Meetup.com.

I put my resume *everywhere*. A lot of people are scared about putting their info out on the web, but my theory was I wanted as many eyes on it as possible. This resulted in a LOT of spam, but you have to take the good with the bad and stay professional through it all. I talked to recruiters - some good, many bad. Most of the time they didn't really have entry-level positions and that was the last I heard from them. 

One day, I got an email from Indeed, asking if I wanted to try out their new Indeed Prime program. I signed up for it and got introduced to a few bad fits before I found a transit company that was willing to do a phone interview with me. We clicked really well - my experience level and what they were looking for. I did an interview with them and must not have done *too* terribly because they offered me a position as an associate software developer.

I've been here ~5 months and it's been everything I ever wanted. I'm learning full-stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) with Java and Ruby on Rails. My pay is double what I was making as a teacher, I get to work from home frequently, and I get to work on interesting projects. Did I mention I still haven't finished my CS degree?

As long as you're passionate and put in the time to code and learn as much as you can, you can totally make it. 2 years ago I was an English teacher and now I'm doing what I love. I worked my butt off, but hey... that's what it takes :-) I'll tell you, there's nothing cooler than seeing the word ""Software Developer"" below your name on a business card. Tangible proof that all that hard work finally paid off!

For frame of reference, I'm 31 this year. It's never to late to start!

Feel free to ask me any questions you may have about the program and I'll answer as best as I can."

**Background:**
I'm a Computer Science Major and am currently applying for some internships for the summer, and am working on my Resume. For the past year (Dec 2016 - Jan 2018) I was a Developer and Lead Manager in a gaming community, and I managed nearly 100 admins, set up meetings, insured that players (customers) were enjoying our servers, etc. Through this I also developed dozens of plugins, and learned to manage servers, work with databases, etc.
  
  
**Question:**
If you were reviewing a Resume and saw ""Manager &amp; Developer of Online Gaming Community"", would you view that as valid &amp; proper experience, or would you view the applicant as dumb for putting that on the resume? This question would apply to a Computer Science or non CS related job.

1. **No name school with solid co-op program:** I've lurked enough on this SubReddit to understand prestige isn't everything. I'm considering schools like Carleton University (relatively unknown Canadian school) that offer co-op terms, alternating between academic and work terms. Subsidized pay by the government and work terms during winter and spring instead of summer (less competition) will make internships a lot easier to come by. This will allow me to graduate with nearly two years of work experience.

2. **Somewhat prestigious school, CS major:** A school like UBC or UCSD (I'm out of state for UCSD so tuition will be pricey). There is a co-op program for UBC, but it's not guaranteed and there aren't many work terms.

3. **Prestigious school, not CS major:** I'm fairly confident I can get into CMU and Waterloo—except not as a CS major. Of course, CS at these top schools is darn near impossible to get into. At CMU, I have a good shot at getting into statistics, and at Waterloo, I can get into the math program (with co-op).

I have an ME degree, recently quit a Systems Engineer position, and I'm considering pursuing Software Engineering but I'm having reservations about tech jobs in general

TL:DR skip to the bolded **SO** below

About 8 years ago I decided to study Mechanical Engineering at a school whose engineering program is consistently ranked among the top 10 - 20 schools in the US. I chose engineering because I thought I was pretty smart and I, no joke, didn't want to study something ""easy"". I honestly think I would be much better suited for something like film but I wasn't going to pay a few tens of thousands of dollars for a film degree.

So I graduate in 4.5 years with no internship and a 2.99 GPA (causing every 3.0 GPA requirement I come across in job openings make me reflect back and wonder how many missed test questions/late assignments away I was from a 3.0). In my junior and senior year I came to the conclusion that nothing I was studying was anything I wanted to do for a career. Lectures were a dull exercise in zoning out, homework assignments were repeated sessions of self-confusion, labs were stressful hoop jumping, and I did terrible on my senior project. I'm certain it wouldn't be too hard to find a couple of freshmen at any given high school that could have accomplished the objective of our project more effectively than my group and I did. 

Anyway, among all of this, I took as many computer science electives as I could and found them vastly more enjoyable than my ME coursework, compelling me to take enough credits to earn a CS certificate through the university. Not quite a minor, but better than nothing.

Upon graduating, I apply to a ton of ME, EE, Controls Engineer, and Software Engineer positions, and, after about 4 months of solid applying I get my first interview for a Systems Engineer position, and when offered the job I take it because I hadn't heard back from anything else and this at least had the prospect of doing some coding.

Well, the job sucks. The company doesn't have any clear aim or focus. Everyone on my team is miserable, morale is in the negative, and after staring at computer screens in a half daze and accomplishing nothing for 9 hours a day, I go home and stress out about how I didn't accomplish anything and then wake up and do the same thing the next day. The work I'm doing (which isn't coding) isn't complicated, especially compared to what I was learning in school, but I just can't do it. It's like wading through some terrible swamp, or squeezing out an incredibly uncomfortable shit every day. After 6 months or so I start looking for new positions but barely actually apply to anything because I don't know what to do. I don't want to pursue a career in mechanical engineering or systems engineering, and I don't meet the requirements for software development jobs, so after 9 months at my job I just quit abruptly one day. Without putting in my two weeks notice. I couldn't justify being alive and working there anymore so I left.

So now I'm working at a restaurant in the town I moved to for my Systems Engineer job (I want to avoid moving back to my parents' house) and I'm wondering wtf I should do. 

**SO**, after my experiences at school and my first job, I'm having reservations about whether I'm really an engineer, because so far it's felt like I've been trying join the track team with cinder blocks for feet, and most interactions with my peers and coworkers have left me feeling like the dumbest guy in the room.

My current plan is to trust the feeling I got from programming in school and get a Software development job or (more likely) go to grad school for comp sci and then get a software dev job.

But what do I do if I'm left feeling as unfit as a software developer as I have in the past? Do you have any suggestions on how I could assess that now? Or whether DevOps or Data Analytics could be a good fit? Or something completely different?

Also, I should mention the things that are continuing to motivate me to purse an engineering job:  
*a good wage  
*health insurance  
*money for retirement  
*money to travel  

Should nothing technical related work out, I don't know, I'll become a teacher or something. While making beats in my spare time.

Hello All:

18F freshman here, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I'm currently in an LDR with my 19M bf (studying aerospace engineering if that's relevant) with dual Irish/UK citizenship, and would like to know how to start going about closing the gap once I get my bachelors. 
 
* I'm a **US citizen** living in TX, with **no** ancestral claims to anywhere. 

* My first language is  **English** , and I'm working on learning Spanish.

* In all likelihood I'll be graduating with **no student loans** unless something goes awry.

* I'm interested in pursuing a master's degree but want to get it in whatever country I'll be long-term settling in.

* I'd like to eventually move to Ireland/the UK but am cool with anywhere else first to ""get my foot in the door""

* Since I've mentioned a boyfriend I feel like I should mention that while it may be possible in three years I don't want to factor in the marriage ""copout"" just so that I know my real options .


Essentially I'm seeking advice on what I should start doing now do be prepared to move overseas around 2021. 

Specific Questions:

* How likely is it for me to find work/a work visa with very little experience and just a bachelor's degree?
* What are some skills I should start developing now to be prepared for an international move in three (and a half) years? (e.g. a useful language I should start learning)
* Specifically to anyone in the EE field or anyone that knows: what branch of electrical/computer engineering would be best to specialize in to be more internationally employable?
* Where can I find info on international internships to do in the interim? (in in in lol)

Thanks so much!

7vkzne,0,2018-02-05,[MN] My business partner is going to push me out of the company TOMORROW! What can I do?,theminnesnowtan,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7vkzne/mn_my_business_partner_is_going_to_push_me_out_of/,"First time writing a post here, or anywhere on Reddit, but I have no other place to turn.

**Background**

Around three months ago I had just gotten back from a half-year of overseas travel and developed an itch to build my own company the moment I got home. I was out for a movie with a roommate and he brought one of his friends. I eventually got to talking with this guy and found that he was recently extremely successful in his business ventures. He had started a business that provides marketing and management services for the platform that I had intended on making a software for. Since he had already established himself and made a business extremely similar to my initial goals, I decided that a mutually beneficial partnership was 100% the right move. He would provide the services and I would develop a software complementary to them. We had a brief initial meeting and about a week later I was working out of an office with him.

I was working nearly full-time unpaid for around the first month or so. The only legal document I signed was a bilateral/mutual NDA contract. I began hiring interns and planning out the development of an incredibly disruptive software and I put my damn soul into it. I had no funding so I was hiring college students with maybe a year or two of a CS classes to code professionally and having to deal with the fact that they were unmotivated, unpaid, full-time college students looking for a something with less commitment. Keep in mind that I myself am not even through college and younger than most of the guys I was hiring. I would live in that office planning, researching, programming and teaching no less than 12-14 hours a day, 6-7 days a week on average. Just sleeping and eating at the office pretty regularly. Since the moment I began working at the company, the owner or my un-official partner would regularly display an aggressive and somewhat abusive level of ownership and dominance over me. He would regularly mention that he could easily outsource my work whenever I ran into challenges or obstacles to let me know that he was the boss, I was working under him and that I was replaceable. I was fine with this, he's older and more experienced so I put my head down and kept developing.

Around 4 months went by where I just pushed myself through learning everything I needed to in order to make this idea a reality. We've recently been getting funding offers and now I get a daily joke from him saying how ""so and so Venture Capitalist will give me money and a good CTO and I'll have no choice but to let you go."" After all of this work and time and unpaid effort, I just get completely discredited. It sucked and still sucks.

Anyways, now you're caught up. Today I stood up for myself and demanded the appreciation and value that I've earned in my 4 months of nonstop pursuance. I told him ""You need to let me take some initiative or I will have to walk."" He blew up. Saying how he could “care less if I work there and that he expects a formal apology tomorrow or we will not work together any longer.” I realized I stepped over the line in saying this and planned on making the apology. Then I saw in his business calendar app just an hour ago that he made a new reminder tomorrow at noon to ""transfer the source code"" of the project. What do I do?

I am completely convinced that he would throw me under the bus. He is prideful and self-absorbed more so than ANY person I’ve ever met.

**TL;DR**
Was hired with no formal documentation, signing only a bilateral NDA, have been paid with no payroll system for 2 months, worked out of the company office and put the company name on my software. I **WILL NOT** just hand over the files for this project and let him take my work as his own. There are clear development guidelines and documentation on how to create the rest of the application as well.
What do I do or what should I do first to secure myself?

I just finished my first year of university and used python during my computer science courses. We learned about the programming language and stuff such as binary trees, bst, lists, all kinds of sorting methods(merge,insert,bubble,etc...) and their bigO.

My knowledge have gotten rusty since it is summer time now but I would like to know if there is anything else I should learn and study to help get internships. Cheers

P.S Do you guys recommend buying the cracking the code interview and would it help with getting internships or is it more tailored for those looking for full-time positions. "

Some history
Completed bachelors in geology, landed one or two internships but no full time position. 
Jumped in a tech bandwagon, did some certifications comptia and ccna, and was hired as entry level net admin for 2 years. The work abruptly ended because higher boss decided to downsize the already small IT firm. 
Again no luck getting jobs, went into blue collar gig. Did cable tech for 1 year, was let go because of vehicle accident within probation period. 
Had some money saved, joined college pursuing computer science to somewhat solidify my tech knowledge. Still in college. But also looking for full time job leveraging my certification, no luck so far.
I feel lost at times, had dreams of becoming a an fossil researcher when i joined college 8 years ago, now i dont know what direction i am going. Soon my savings gonna slide like stock these days and i will have no choice but to do uber or lyft just to pay bills, that way my career becomes unreachable like voyager.

7vlyq7,5,2018-02-06,Apple DEP for leased devices?,iamrucke,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7vlyq7/apple_dep_for_leased_devices/,"This is a bit of an odd scenario but here goes.

I'm an intern at a company working in IT and I've been assigned to figure out how the company should handle leasing Apple devices to a school. Now, the regular way of doing things I suppose is using Apple DEP/ASM so that the school can manage their devices efficiently (preconfigured/VPP/etc). That works great when selling devices.

The issue here is that once these devices are returned to us from leasing, we will sell them to another company that in turn might want to use DEP/ASM. From my understanding, you can't disown an Apple device from one DEP account and assign it to another (like you can with an MDM). Or am I missing something?

What I've gathered is that we have to use an MDM only, but that would prevent the school from using VPP. VPP would obviously be very benificial for a school, or any organisation really. The alternative is to manually configure every device, clearly not the most efficient way.

Any suggestions? I appreciate any advice because I'm walking in circles here.."

I would like to hear your advice on my current situation at the company, as I honestly feel a bit stuck.

So I have recently graduated from a UK university where I studied Petroleum Engineering. I have joined a company straight away out of uni in Russia - Sakhalin (just above Japan). I have done an internship with them and they liked me. It is also a massive monopoly in Russia in the oil business and is the largest oil producer in the world.

Anyways, as I started working I was given some time to learn, but no joke that was like 2 months. After I’ve been given very very difficult projects, that I even lead at some points, I went to other companies and was defending our solutions (we tell the operators what to do). Please note that was 2 months fresh out of uni, I have to go every single weekend to work, to achieve the standard, stay at work two extra hours 70% of the time and 1 hour 100%. I feel like I am being used, because I have extra knowledge, I can find solutions in English websites and articles that literally don’t exist in Russian. So many times I found an good solution just because of English etc.

Recently I’ve been taught how to model reservoirs, very few people in our company know how to do it properly, so I was literally thrown to study it myself. I stay after work to call technical service to guide me etc, make shit loads of mistakes, and being pushed further and further with it. Many people help me etc. but I have learnt SO MUCH in the past 2 months (been at work for 4 months), I can do things already that other modelers don’t, and literally because I can read the manual (it’s in English) much easier for me. 

Let me bring a question now before I go further. I get tired. I have no life (although my gf is in UK, no parents here, nothing) I ski and play pool etc in my little free time. So my bosses say: stay and learn, you are young, you have no life, no worries etc. learn!!! I agree with them, but sometimes I hate it so much, I see 80% people leaving at 6 on the dot, where I am jut starting to sort out the calls with Moscow etc (8 hours diff so they wake up). 

My knowledge is literally exponential, I’m learning outstanding stuff, people literally come to me for advice now. But to do that, I have to give my life away. No joke. I come every weekend, to build a model (takes hours) and to prepare other stuff. 

Now this leads to a next problem. And I really need experienced view on this. As I grow fast, I get bigger tasks, I get trusted more. BUT! My brain literally doesn’t have time to process it all, I need more time to think, projects run at me and I gotta solve them in short time, so sometimes I panic, and almost always feel under pressure now. My boss comes at me and says come on! You had so much time! Why are you still doing it!? 

My dad is an engineer himself (technical director) and he says, they see potential in me, and they are growing me. But is this really the way? Like idk how I made it sound, but honestly I feel like this is extreme hahah. Leaving work at 6 is wrong!! Extra hour minimum. My bosses are pushing very hard, although please note, they don’t press that hard on others, they give them normal tasks, and they just do them. I really appreciate massive responsibility, but a lot of times I feel like I’m not ready yet, although I end up doing it. Also I’m in the kind of scientific part of the company, there’s no bullshit. If I say the reservoir will produce 8 tons a day, I have to properly prove it, which takes a LOT of knowledge. And if you’re wrong, you’ll look dumb.

Sorry for the rant guys, but I am stuck between, complaining to them and saying wtf, I am not a
machine I can’t do everything you tell me, and between shutting the fuck up, dealing with it as I have an opportunity to smash all of this and become extremely smart and experienced and give my life away while I’m getting experience here (planning to stay 2-3 years).

P.S. my bosses presses extremely hard, but he is amazingly smart he literally knows it ALL! Be it geology, developments etc etc. and he always says “wtf why do you know it” or “you’re annoying me, this should have done it last week” and honestly the tasks are extreme, I learn from 0 to solve them, and it really demotivates me. While other people are doing simple tasks. 

P.S.S. I take rides to work and back pretty much everyday... where he is a really nice guy and all. So I am really confused, I don’t understand what’s going on. "
7vmxgo,1,2018-02-06,Worried I have wasted my money + financial aid + life on a creative art when I should have studied a humanity instead?,unsureartsstudent,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/7vmxgo/worried_i_have_wasted_my_money_financial_aid_life/,"Hi all, sorry for the super-long post.

I am a final-year Arts student with a high GPA (not sure how Australian grades convert to US, but my average is upwards of 85%/High Distinction) across three majors: a creative art, study of that art, and a foreign language. This was at a mid-tier uni, and I'm applying to do Honours at a better uni. Most of my teachers seem to think that I have a good chance of achieving that, doing well, doing a PhD and going into academia -- to the extent that anyone has ""a good chance"" of making it in academia, I guess.

The problem is that I'm worried I'm losing passion/interest for my field. I'm starting to second-guess whether I should have instead gone into the humanities rather than arts.

In my final two years of high school, I was keenly interested in politics and law, participated in debating and a lot of student government stuff both in-school and interschool, and even started to get involved in youth politics. I did well on the corresponding HS humanities subjects; actually, slightly better than I did on creative arts subjects (95-ish% vs. 91%). My plan was to study Arts/Law, go into some Law-related field, and do the creative art on the side. 

However, midway through my final year of high school, a couple of things happened that shifted me a bit more toward the creative arts. I don't want to get into a self-absorbed psychoanalysis here, but it involved a really enjoyable arts class, a quasi-relationship/very close friendship with another girl in that class which ended badly (I'm a woman and my family is conservative Christian), me failing to get a scholarship to move cities to a better uni, and then a death in my family right at the time when I was rethinking my applications to take into account the lack of scholarship. 

In retrospect, I should 100% have taken a gap year to think everything through, but I went to a fairly high-pressure high school where this was looked down upon, and I was a nervous, confused 18-year-old (who was also being ""ghosted"" by the aforementioned close friend). I ended up enrolling at the uni I am currently at, in the creative art plus journalism. Within weeks, I'd quit journalism because I was too shy to conduct interviews. Again, I should've just dropped out at this point and taken a gap year, but I didn't. One contributing factor was that, at this point, it did look like I had talent in the creative art; both my uni teachers/initial results and some external measures (competitions, etc.) seemed to confirm this.

Fast-forward a few years -- actually, five years -- and I am nearly 24 years old, nearly finished the aforementioned combination of creative art, art study, and foreign language, preparing for Honours. High GPA but not a ton of extracurriculars, much less impressive ones, due to spending most of my free time at a religious group that didn't really have student leadership positions, then losing my faith so I don't even put that on my CV anymore. Had to work a retail job for most of uni, especially summers, but did manage a couple of short-term internships in arts admin. 

The bad news is that, after second year, my performance in the creative art totally plateaued. External success in the area stopped, other students overtook me. I was still toward the top pf the class, but this is at a mid-tier uni. I regularly received 90-95% on essays and exams, but it was the practical subjects that really dragged my GPA down -- as low as 72-75%; my average just in those subjects would be around 79%. 

The good news is that I started to care less about the art. I guess it's weird since I grew up doing it in all my free time, but on some level I accepted that it was going to remain a (serious-ish) hobby, and even at uni it was just one of three majors -- and my GPA in the other majors would be over 90%. 

I've maintained a keen interest in following/practising that art, but, to be honest, I wonder if I really want to make a career out of teaching and studying it. That was _never_ my intention; I wanted to practise the art, and I just kind of drifted sideways into study because it is inherently interesting to me -- but maybe not the best way I could make a contribution to the world?

Throughout my degree I maintained a fairly strong interest in the news, government and public policy, as well as international issues. I started to become frustrated with some arts people's excessively inward focus and lack of knowledge/care about this stuff. 

I can't see myself ever having gone into STEM, though I probably could have survived stats/economics classes involved in any of the following, but I do really wonder whether I should have gone with the Humanities route and studied much ""harder"" non-STEM subjects, like philosophy, history, psychology, international relations, or law. 

I feel like I could do a 1-2 year graduate program in any one of those things -- except maybe psychology, which is a bit more complex -- but I am so full of regrets and wondering if I should just skip the mucking around and start over with another Bachelor's degree combining some of those fields (e.g. Arts/Law with a double major in the Arts). But then I'd be like 31 when I graduated, assuming I could even study full-time, which is doubtful given that I've exhausted my undergrad financial aid possibilities. 

To sum up, I don't feel like I've learned anything at uni except the foreign language and how to write essays/articles in a field I'm not even sure I am enthusiastic about or that it contributes anything much to the world. Basically nobody has suggested that I'd be able to do anything other than go into academia or become a high school teacher, or *maybe* (and I'm not even sure how plausible this is; it's something I'm looking into independently) do postgrad Law or International Relations and become some sort of embassy official. I initially wanted to teach in an English-language uni overseas, but now I'm actually living overseas (first on exchange, then taking a much-belated gap year) I'm not even sure it's something I want to do long-term.

I'm sorry this post is so long, and thanks if you've read this far. I just feel like I am in such a ridiculous situation thanks to stuff like religion, homophobia, my own idiocy in overestimating my chances in the creative arts, and I wish I could go back and tell my 18-year-old self to just take a gap year and think things through rather than rushing into uni then flitting from one major to another thinking she's somehow got a future because her marks are good.

But since that's not possible, if anyone has any advice for my current, 23-year-old self, that would be fantastic. Should I try to shift fields via graduate study (would probably have to start at the certificate/diploma level given the difference of fields)? Bite the bullet and start another Bachelor's at 25? Try to pick an Honours thesis topic that might facilitate a shift toward the Humanities? Just do really really well at Honours and hope that either the passion comes back or my high marks (if I can even get them) open unforeseen doors? I just have no idea what is even possible at this point."

My worry is that any one of the internships would look even better on my resume, so what if I am hired for the job but then get an interview for one of the internships and am hired there.

I wouldn’t want to decline an offer for the job in case I don’t get any of the internships, but is it acceptable for me to quit the job shortly after starting just because I was offered a different job?

To answer some questions from the comments:
I am a computer science major and the job I got an interview for is with a large tech company, but the position itself doesn't deal with computer science stuff.  I think working for the company now could provide some opportunity for advancement later.  The 4 internships I applied will probably provide me with a better learning experience as far as coding and software development go.

I was a mechanical engineering major my freshman year and switched over the summer, so I'm technically a freshman in terms of my major, so I'll be applying to be a sophomore at whatever uni I transfer to. I'm really not feeling challenged and really want to go to a top program.

Academics: My first semester GPA at college was pretty meh being just a 3.28. The next semester went better, ending with a 3.5 (Dean's List). Last semester was great for me, I finished with a 3.92 (Dean's List Highest Honors). So my cumulative GPA right now is 3.6. My high school GPA kinda followed the same path, if it matters. I had a low 3.something until my junior year, where I had a 3.5, and I finished my senior year with above a 4.0 unweighted (although A-s at my school still counted a 4.0). I think my best SAT score was a 1900. I took AP Compsci, AP Physics A, and AP Environmental Science in high school.

Extra-curriculars: I was a very active member of my high school's robotics team. At college, I have jumped around several cubs (including starting one). However, I do do a good amount of research and would want to continue to do research wherever I go. I was listed as a co-author of a paper published by one of the professors I did research with. I had a mechanical engineering internship with a startup last summer. I'm also a very active member of a student-run angel investing fund at my current university. We have full on legit startups come and pitch to us and we decide whether or not we want to invest. For all intents and purposes, we are a legit angel fund. I spend a lot of my time and am very committed to the fund. I love the work and would want to start a similar fund at whatever university I transfer to. I'm not sure if it counts, but I also really like learning CS stuff on the side (mostly Udemy and Coursera courses).

I'm a white male and I'm only okay at writing essays.

Schools I'm thinking about (I would love to hear suggestions): University of Pittsburgh, Tufts (huge stretch imo), uPenn (also a huge stretch, probs not worth applying), UMD College Park, University of Wisconsin Madison, University of Washington, Northeastern. I know nothing about Liberal Arts schools, but I do know that many offer computer science degrees. I have no idea if I should apply to them or not though. "

I have an internship offer at a GIS engineering consulting firm. They're local in Canada but are definitely not heard of anywhere else. I will be doing ""Web/Mobile Development"" and some of the projects are actually interesting (not just building a website/app), applying some of my background/experience in machine learning for their R&amp;D. However I'm worried that as I ramp up for my junior year internship for hopefully a Big N I don't know how much the company name/their industry would help and whether or not I should try for offers from other more software/CS focused companies. 

Would be interesting to see your opinions or if you've been in a similar situation. Thanks!

For some background info I'm a sophomore studying math+CS in Canada

A few days ago I saw an opening on indeed and their web site so I requested my classmate to connect via LinkedIn (which he accepted), asked him a brief question in the note and then followed up by email with some questions I thought could give me a leg up on the competition.  I didn't hear back from him in the past 3 days so I applied to the company directly.  Well guess what?  No reply from him and nothing from the company either.  The job opening is exactly what I did in my first job after completing school, the only hiccup is that I was let go after only 2 months.
I know my classmate is sitting pretty with his full time job but I was never a jerk to him in class, why are both he and the company giving me silent treatment?   Job hunting can be so frustrating at times...

7vqsyv,2,2018-02-06,Finally get to start my career,BiscuitTickler,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7vqsyv/finally_get_to_start_my_career/,"Incoming wall of text but I've waited a damn long time to write this.


I recently graduated from one of the top research universities in the U.S. with no internships and a 2.7 cumulative GPA and I still got an offer. I tried applying to internships throughout my time at university and I kept getting the same answer of how I don't have enough experience. You hiring managers really need to sort out this 'need experience to get experience' BS. It's infuriating. I tried going to company visits that my CS department held but got nothing. 

I began applying to actual jobs towards the end of December and continued on until Yesterday. Front end, back end, full stack, all types of language-specific jobs, all kinds. Out of 109 applications, I got 6 responses. One was a coding test where I needed to answer 10 coding questions in 10 minutes. I failed that one bigly but those requirements are a tad excessive in my opinion. The other were phone interviews but the golden egg was a no-screen, on-site interview. It was for a new grad software engineering position at big consulting organization and I knew that if I was finally getting something in person, I couldn't mess it up. 

I prepared by explaining to myself the projects I made during university, their intricacies, and thought of questions that interviewers might ask me about them. I didn't use a website like leetcode/hackerrank a lot but I did pop over every now and then. I primarily thought of numerous questions that I had heard come up in coding interviews like a palindrome solver (this was actually one the coding part of the interview), fizzbuzz, string reversal, ya know, the usual suspects. I also went over quicksort and a few N^2 sorts that are found in CLRS (if you don't have the book, buy it). Luckily, this worked for me.

The things that sealed the deal for me were project-based classes in university. End of the semester projects are rather helpful but the best class I have ever taken was Software Engineering. It was a semester long project course where I was assigned a group, a real client with an idea, and we go from there. I was in constant interaction with the client; I explained what was possible, what wasn't, what's good/bad, everything. These project courses are extraordinarily useful and if you have the chance to take one, sign up immediately. Of course, I also did side projects outside of school on a subject that I enjoyed: finance. I tried my best to weasel that into conversation during the interview and basically say ""Hey, I made this and I think it's cool. Whatcha think?"" A strategy that worked for me was when they asked if I had experience in X and I said ""Yeah, I actually made Y with X... ."" 

tl;dr: I had no references, no internships, just projects with a lot of perseverance and I finally got the job!"

I'm a student at Cornell University and I've collaborated with over twenty students (most Computer Science Majors) across several schools (state schools, other ivy leagues, and small liberal arts schools) on what strategies have yielded them the most success at career fair and how to sell yourself to the recruiter.

The full article is here in much detail, but have main points below :
https://www.1takeinterview.com/careerfair/

 BEFORE CAREER FAIR

1) Resume - Use a clean and easy to read template, be sure to talk about NUMBERS and your impact. Use phrases like, “Redesigned user authentication leading to a 50% increase in sign-ups”, to show your specific impact.

2) Research - Be sure to research the companies you're interested in speaking to at career fair, including the companies background, internship or full time programs and their culture. This is important when doing your elevator pitch and asking questions.

3) Dress Code - Be sure to dress professionally as this will boost your confidence and image. Tech is typically relaxed but dressing your best bring out your best!

DURING THE CAREER FAIR

1) Introduction to Recruiter - Shake hands and hand over your resume at first so the recruiter can read over it. You should give your elevator pitch (45-60 seconds) while they are reading the resume.

2) Detailed Discussions - Go into details about project specifics, challenges and your impact. This specifically talking about the difficulties in how you worked through the project and what they made you learn.

3) Closing - Be sure to shake the recruiters hand, thank them for his or her time and get a business card so you can follow up.

AFTER THE CAREER FAIR

1) Following Up - Send a thank you email to the recruiter within 24-48 hours recapping your discussion and interest. 

I hope this helps you guys out at career fair and I'm more than happy to answer any questions !

I'm in a unique position as a student where I can get all the classes I need because of priority registration, meaning that I can complete the prereqs for my engineering degree to transfer in 2 years, while it takes most STEM people 3 years.

However, 2 years is cramming it in and I've never been a good student. My coursework is filled with tough maths and sciences and it's going to be really hard, I'm kinda freaking out and feel like changing to business or something. I was thinking (to the horror of my parents) to take 3 years instead.

The pro of keeping on my current course is that I'll get to a university faster and I'll graduate at the same time as my peers. That's basically it.

The pros of taking 3 years are:
-time to breathe
-probably higher GPA, so better universities to transfer 
-more internship opportunities

I'm not sure what to do, can anyone weigh in on this? Greatly appreciated!!!!"
7vsapo,14,2018-02-06,I just graduated 2 months ago and now have my 2nd job in IT. I am basically learning I do not know much of anything valuable.,domstang68,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7vsapo/i_just_graduated_2_months_ago_and_now_have_my_2nd/,"Hey guys,

So I just graduated from the University of Toledo in December 2017 with my B.S. in Information Technology. Unfortunately, me and my classmates were guinea pigs for the degree as it was new to Toledo about ~5 years ago (When I first started). My curriculum was more geared towards application development and other programming work. I currently do I.T. work because I know my coding skills are not good enough to be hireable currently. I am kind of stuck in how to progress further with my education now that I am out of college and in the real world.

I know a decent amount of Unix system work, have been exposed to a lot of coding styles and languages, and know a decent bit about business related concepts.

I know nothing about Windows Server any version (Currently have a copy and am trying to set up my own testbed network). I do not have a lot of enterprise Windows client experience (Although I have used Windows all my life, so I know my way around generally and know what to target). I had two networking classes, but due to lack of actual physical switches and having a very difficult time with Packet Tracer, I can explain the concepts for days but cannot put them in practice. I know very little PowerShell /  CMD even though I was exposed to a lot of coding. There are also things I am missing from this list I am sure that I have not even been exposed to.

So, I am wondering what I should study, or look at. I want to be a System Admin once of these days. I try my best to learn about many concepts, and I try my hardest to bug people and ask them to teach me stuff, no matter how little or insignificant it may be. I also go out of my way to do projects personally if it means I can learn something.

What should someone like me with plenty of educational background but not a ton of real world experience (~3 years) target? Any resources would be welcome. I read some other posts on here, but they do not really seem to target the situation or goal I have. I have worked for a company of roughly 150, and now work for a hospital system with I would imagine over 50000 that I used to intern at.

Thank you.

EDIT: Thanks for the responses! I am looking for some cheap desktop I can turn into my Windows Datacenter 2016 bitch, and then some clients I can get enterprise Windows on. I have a decent amount of educational programming experience at least AND have built an entire asset tracking tool with PHP and MySQL, as well as maintain that specific server. So hopefully that will help me. I intend on at least looking at certifications, but I do not have the money to fully realize them just yet. I also eventually intend to build a server in my future house with thin clients so I only have to maintain a few machines in the future instead of a bunch of unlinked ones."
7vsgmw,1,2018-02-06,How do I narrow down what I want to do?,venannai1,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/7vsgmw/how_do_i_narrow_down_what_i_want_to_do/,"Hi y'all! I'm 26 with a BA in PoliSci-International Studies. I wanted to work with the State Department once upon a time, but learned too late, after getting an internship my last year of uni, that I hated government work. I eventually landed a Tech Support job to pay the bills. Now 3 years after graduation, (2 years in this job), I've found that it is time to move on. I just am not sure what to move on to!

I contacted a mentor from college who suggested to me that because of all that I did while in school, that I have too much experience for an entry level job but there is someone my age or a bit older that's more qualified that me and going to Grad School would fill in the gap that I am finding. 

I decided to take this seriously since I do not want to be in a call center for the rest of my life. 

I took a few personality/career tests since it's been a while since I have. Here are my results:

Myer Briggs: ISTJ
Self Directed Search: AES
Gallup Results (from Strenghfinder): Intellection, Analytical, Futuristic, Consistency, Connectedness

Let's say that if I wanted to pursue a graduate degree, I would narrow it down to the following: Computer Programming, Masters of Public Admin., and now with my call center experience probably a Masters in Business Admin. 

If I want to not be realistic, Game Development, degree in Music Performance, Acting School, Writing. 

I am hoping that maybe y'all can see something that I cannot, may be able to make suggestions that could help me find clearer direction or at least help guide my thinking. I feel like I'm still scattered.

The only thing good about my resume is that I go to an Ivy-league school that has a reputable engineering program.
I came to the school as an undecided major and decided to pursue CS at the end of my freshman year. I regret not doing side projects or joining CS-related clubs in the summer and last Fall. I think of this career fair as a learning experience for junior year when I definitely have to get an internship, but I don't think I will have much to say about myself tomorrow with recruiters. Honestly, I don't really want to go to career fair because I don't think I am going to get interviews or any kind of call back after.

7vt7jh,185,2018-02-06,Erlkönig,RevJohn1,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7vt7jh/erlkönig/,"My name is Reverend John. The story you're about to read was written by me with great hesitation and uncertainty. It details a remarkably terrifying and inexplicable encounter I recently experienced. Though I don't expect you to believe a word of it, please understand that this account is very, very real to me. My life hasn't quite been the same since. You're free to ask any clarifying questions after reading it. That being said, let me provide some context. I recently graduated from seminary and am now ordained in one of the largest Protestant denominations in North America. I studied abroad in Germany the year before my graduation. There I lived in a relatively remote area near the Black Forest. One of the conditions of my stipend was to participate in an internship at a rural Lutheran church. As a student pastor, I mainly served in an assitory capacity to the head pastor, Fr. Schmidt. I preached occasionally, led worship service, conducted various bible studies, and made home and hospital visits as needed. There really wasn't much to it, or so I initially thought.

The church was only ten kilometers from my apartment, so it was easy enough to ride my bike there. It was a bit off the beaten path though, and I was late for my first Sunday service. Thankfully, Father Schmidt was understanding. The church was incredibly old, dating back to the late Medieval Ages, and sat on the edge of the forest. Crooked, broken headstones surrounded the building. I found the congregation to be relatively pleasant. However, I couldn't help but notice an odd man sitting in the very back of the sanctuary, muttering indistinctly to himself with his face buried in his hands. He was rocking back and forth. Sometimes people are overcome with emotion during worship, so I let the situation leave my mind. 

I could tell it was a close-knit community. I had lunch with Fr. Schmidt following the service. I’d say he was around seventy years old. He was short, slightly hunched over, and had two deep creases on the corners of his mouth, kind of like a ventriloquist puppet. After offering me a cigarette, he said I could be as involved with the church as I wanted. “At the very least,” he said, “just show up on Sundays.” His laid-back attitude was refreshing.

He invited me to make a home visit with him later in the week. He warned that it wouldn't be a typical visit. “I wouldn’t expect you to notice, but the congregation is a bit forlorn these days.” I responded with a concerned look, which prompted him to offer further explanation. I learned about the Frank family and the tragedy that befell them shortly before my arrival. Their little boy, Andreas, went missing on a camping trip over the summer. Maria, the mother, had fallen into a grief-induced stupor. Cornelius, the father, was self-medicating himself with alcohol, and hadn’t been to church since the terrible tragedy occurred. Fr. Schmidt said they were good people, and the whole event caused a great deal of pain for both the congregation and broader community. “I understand if you think this all a bit much,"" he said, “you only just arrived. But it'd be good experience, I think.” I reluctantly agreed.

I tried to imagine what losing a child in such a way felt like, but my mind rejected the thought. There was no way Andreas was still alive after nearly three months. Honestly, I didn't blame the father for turning to alcohol. I made a D on a Greek exam once and nearly drank myself silly. I biked to the church the morning of our scheduled visit, fighting my way through dense fog. There I met Fr. Schmidt, and we each smoked a cigarette while making small talk. I’m not really a smoker, but smoking is much more common in Germany than the States. I asked him what I should do with my cigarette butt. “Just throw it in the grass,” he said. My pastor back home would let me have it if I threw a cigarette on the church’s lawn. We got into his old Volkswagen and departed for the Frank residence.

There was a brief, awkward silence as we pulled away from the church, so I spoke up. I asked how the family lost the little boy. Father Schmidt explained that it was all very strange. The circumstances surrounding this situation were unclear at best. According to him, the family hiked approximately five kilometers into the woods for a camping trip, something they did regularly. They went to the same campsite they always go to, so even though the child was young (about eight or nine years old), he should’ve been familiar with the area. 

They planned to camp for three days, but peculiar things started happening after the first night. Andreas was having nightmares and getting little sleep. He said there was a scary thing with a white face sneaking around the campsite and it wanted to play with him. Felix, the family’s dog, also began acting strange. It growled at seemingly nothing, and appeared to be constantly on high alert. Maria pleaded with Cornelius the next morning to go home, but he insisted everything would be okay. Andreas refused to leave the campsite the rest of the day, which surprised his parents because normally he liked to explore.

The parents were awoken again the second night by a terrified Andreas, who was convinced something in the woods wanted to get him. Felix was growling. Cornelius left the tent and checked the area with his flashlight. He saw nothing. He returned to the tent, attempting to console his frightened child and worried wife. They stayed up the entire night, and at sunrise they all agreed to return home.

As they were packing up, Cornelius said there was an odd sound in the distance, like several branches breaking at once. Felix immediately darted off into the direction of the sound, running deep into the woods. Cornelius instructed his wife and child to remain at the campsite as he went to go find their pet. After about fifteen minutes of searching and calling out the dog’s name, Cornelius heard his wife scream loudly. It took him a couple of minutes to get back to the campsite. Only Maria was there when he arrived. He asked what happened, but Maria was completely frantic and distraught, unable to speak coherently. She fainted shortly after.

Cornelius spent nearly an hour calling out the boy’s name, but to no avail. He lifted his unconscious wife and made the arduous trek back into town. The police and volunteers searched the woods for weeks. No trace of Andreas or the dog were ever found. “I’ve lived here a long time,” said Fr. Schmidt, “and nothing like this has ever happened.” I could see he was quite troubled. I asked if Maria ever recovered, and he just shook his head. Indeed, it was story as bizarre as it was terrible. As we pulled up to the Frank’s house, Fr. Schmidt spoke English - something he rarely did - and said, “the Black Forest can be an unforgiving place.”

The Franks had a quaint home, a combination of stone and wood, with smoke slowly rising from the chimney. You’d never suspect there was a devastated family inside. Cornelius greeted us at the door. He looked exhausted. “Come in, Father,” he said gruffly. He was a large, imposing fellow with a thick beard and bright eyes. I could smell beer on his breath when he introduced himself, though that was not entirely uncommon in Germany, regardless of the time of day. He offered us a seat in the living room, which was rather unkempt. I couldn’t help but notice the family pictures. Andreas looked like a great kid - perfectly happy. Fr. Schmidt wasted no time and asked about Maria. “Nothing’s changed,” said Cornelius. “She barely eats, rarely speaks, and stays in bed all day. The doctor says there’s nothing more he can do. I don’t think she’ll last much longer.” 

After some encouraging words from Fr. Schmidt, Cornelius agreed to let us see Maria for a quick prayer. He apologized for the messiness as we walked upstairs. He gently knocked on the bedroom door, calling out Maria’s name. “Fr. Schmidt’s here,” he said, “and we’re coming in.” We entered the room to see Maria lying motionless on the bed with her eyes wide open. She looked to be in a permanent state of shock. Cornelius sat on the edge of the bed and took her hand. There was no response from her. She continued to stare at the ceiling.

Fr. Schmidt offered a prayer of strength and healing. As the three of us began to leave the room, Maria made an odd noise. It sounded like she said “Earl.” She spoke with a quiet, raspy voice, and repeated this word several times. Cornelius closed the door behind us. “It’s the only thing she ever says,” Cornelius said, “but I don’t know what she means.” Honestly, I was glad to leave when we did. The whole thing was just too weird and depressing. Fr. Schmidt said we’ll check on them again in a couple of weeks. Obviously, I was not looking forward to that. 

I continued to build my relationship with Fr. Schmidt and the church in the meantime. A couple of times of week I would be invited over for dinner to a different family's home. The internship certainly had its perks. I learned it was best not to bring up the Frank family, as it was a sure way to kill the mood and the conversation. People simply didn't want to talk about it, though I could tell it was on their minds.

Fr. Schmidt and I had breakfast together every Friday morning at a little cafe to catch-up and plan the Sunday worship service. The Friday before our second meeting with the Franks, I biked to the church to borrow some books I needed for a sermon. When I entered in through the side door of the sanctuary, I saw that strange man again, the one I had seen during my first visit. He sat in the same pew as last time, in the very back of the church, and seemed to be crying. I approached him and asked if everything was okay. He looked up at me, wide-eyed, and said, “who rides so late through night and wind?”

“Excuse me?” I replied. He said it again, “who rides so late through night and wind?” I had no idea what this meant. He turned away from me. “If there's anything you need, please let me know,” I said. I back away slowly and left him there alone. I gave Fr. Schmidt a call after I arrived back to my apartment. I asked about the man and explained the odd behavior he exhibited. Fr. Schmidt apologized for not mentioning him earlier. The man's name was Ruben, and clearly he wasn't all there mentally. His parents died a while back, and the community took care of him. He had a little room set up in the basement of the church, and he was employed there as a custodian. Fr. Schmidt said he took the disappearance of Andreas particularly hard, becoming increasingly unstable in the passing weeks. “Don't concern yourself too much with him,” said Fr. Schmidt, “he's more or less my responsibility.” I asked about the cryptic phrase Ruben had repeated when we spoke. “Sounds like a line from an old German poem. I forget who wrote it, but it's about an evil spirit called the Erlking. He chases a father and son through the woods one night. It's one of those popular pieces of folklore that gets passed down through the generations. Look it up if you want, but like I said, don't lose too much sleep over the things Ruben says. He says a lot of things, you know.”

Fast-forward to the second meeting with the Franks. Maria’s condition had greatly deteriorated. Cornelius had become increasingly distraught and despondent. It was quite evident she was dying. “I don’t know what to do, Father,” said Cornelius, “I’ll have nothing left if she dies.” Most of the visit was characterized by profound silence with periodic outbursts of Cornelius crying. I felt stupid just sitting there, but I didn’t want to force myself to say something if there was nothing to say. He was experiencing a level of grief that I simply couldn’t understand. Fr. Schmidt offered a prayer of course, and also read aloud a couple of psalms. “The church will always be here for you, Cornelius,” said Fr. Schmidt, “you don’t have to do this alone.” Cornelius continued to sit there in silence, refusing to make eye contact with either of us. I went upstairs to use the bathroom. Maria’s door was cracked open and I peeked inside. Her emaciated, unconscious body was lying there motionless. She had large, dark circles under her eyes. It was a heartbreaking sight for sure. Seeing her reminded me of the last visit when she muttered a word that sounded like “Earl.” Something clicked inside my head. I immediately drew a connection between that and the Erlking poem Fr. Schmidt mentioned the other day.

That evening I did a quick Google search. I found the poem, originally titled “Erlkönig,” written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in the late eighteenth century. Here’s an English translation: 

**Who rides there so late through the night dark and drear?
The father it is, with his infant so dear;
He holdeth the boy tightly clasp'd in his arm,
He holdeth him safely, he keepeth him warm.**

**""My son, wherefore seek'st thou thy face thus to hide?""
""Look, father, the Erl-King is close by our side!
Dost see not the Erl-King, with crown and with train?""
""My son, 'tis the mist rising over the plain.""**

**""Oh, come, thou dear infant! oh come thou with me!
For many a game I will play there with thee;
On my strand, lovely flowers their blossoms unfold,
My mother shall grace thee with garments of gold.""**

**""My father, my father, and dost thou not hear
The words that the Erl-King now breathes in mine ear?""
""Be calm, dearest child, 'tis thy fancy deceives;
'Tis the sad wind that sighs through the withering leaves.""**

How the Erl-King his daughters has brought here for me?""

Not to sound too cliche, but a chill ran up my spine after reading that. At the time, I was far from the kind of person who believed in ghost stories or anything remotely paranormal. Still, something about this whole situation peaked my curiosity. That Sunday, I pulled aside Julien after the service. He was a member of the congregation around my age. We had hung out at a local pub together a couple of times, and I considered him to be a friend. I asked if he knew exactly where the Franks had set-up their campsite before Andreas’ disappearance. He said yes, but then inquired as to why I wanted to know. I said something to the effect of, “I want to check it out for myself, just to see. Plus, I’ve been craving a good hike. Would you come with me?” He was understandably skeptical, and he questioned the appropriateness of it. After a little more coaxing, however, he agreed to accompany me. 

Julien and I met up several days later on a cold, dreary morning. The weather wasn’t particularly ideal for hiking, but it was Julien’s only day off so we had to make do. Venturing into the Black Forest was on my bucket list, so I felt excited all the same. The density of the forest seemed rather daunting, yet Julien lead us through with impressive ease. I could feel the ancientness of the forest - the smell, the sounds, the colors. Just as Fr. Schmidt had said, after walking for about five kilometers we came upon a small clearing. I could see where the campfire had been. “Well, this is it,” said Julien. As I looked around, I imagined the Frank family and the absolute horror they surely experienced. It was almost like their pain and suffering still lingered in the air. “So what now?” asked Julien, interrupting my thoughts. I shrugged my shoulders and continued to walk around, taking in my surroundings.

At some point I suggested to Julien that we pray over the campsite. I don’t know why exactly, but it just felt like the right, pastoral thing to do. He agreed. We closed our eyes, bowed are heads, and I began to pray after a brief moment of contemplative silence. No sooner had I invoked the name of God that we heard a loud, sudden noise erupt behind us. I suppose it sounded like someone swinging a large ax into a tree. We looked all around us, but there was nothing else to be seen or heard. “No worries,” I said, “let’s continue.” Shortly after saying God’s name again, we heard what clearly sounded like a person running full speed through the forest behind us. “Who’s there?” shouted Julien. No response. We heard the swooshing sound again, this time coming from the opposite direction. We became thoroughly unnerved. “Do you think it’s an animal?” I asked. Julien didn’t say anything. He looked deeply concerned. “Let’s go back,” I said. 

As we turned around, we both saw something truly frightening. Standing about twenty yards away was a large figure cloaked entirely in black. The figure was hard to discern completely, but it appeared to be unnaturally tall. It initially stood very still, as if it were watching both of us intently, though its face remained completely hidden. “*Julien*,” I frantically whispered, “*who the fuck is that?*” Julien, frozen with fear, said nothing. The black figure let out a deep, cruel-sounding sigh of breath before suddenly propelling itself backwards with a great, seemingly impossible amount of speed  into the thicket of trees behind it. It made little to no sound and disappeared entirely. I have never been more afraid in all my life. Nothing else needed to or could be said, and Julien and I ran away as fast as possible. I struggled to keep up with Julien, tripping over a log in the process. The fall left a deep gash on my chin. I picked myself up and continued after Julien. We made it out of the forest in record time, just as it started to rain. My chin bled profusely, and in retrospect I probably needed stitches.  

“We should tell the police,” said Julien, “clearly there’s a psychopath out there.” And so we did. The police were baffled by our account, not sure of what to make of it. They assured us they would investigate the area again, and strongly suggested to both of us not to go back there or talk about what we saw. That Friday I met with Fr. Schmidt at the church rather than the cafe. He said he needed help with something. He asked about my chin when he saw me, so I explained what had happened in the woods with Julien. “I really wish you hadn’t done that,” he said, “and I hope you’ll avoid such actions in the future. This town is still hurting from Andreas’ disappearance, and you and Julien picked at that scab. Please promise me you won’t go back there.” I sincerely apologized and gave him my word that I wouldn’t go back. I felt completely awful for disappointing him. He walked away to get something, leaving me alone in the sanctuary.

I took a seat in a nearby pew. Ruben emerged from one of the Sunday school rooms, dragging a vacuum cleaner behind him. I smiled politely, nodding my head at him as he walked by. “H-he almost took me once,” Ruben stammered. I wasn’t sure what he meant. I asked him to clarify who or what he was talking about. “He almost took me once,” he repeated, “when I was a boy.” His face contorted with fear, then he shuffled away. Fr. Schmidt returned soon after, and we tended to our duties together. That was the last conversation I ever had with Ruben. We avoided each other after that. 

Julien and I remained friends, though we seldom discussed what happened that day. I honored Fr. Schmidt’s request, never so much as setting another foot inside the forest. Maria Frank died a week later and Cornelius died not long after. He was found dead in his house from alcohol poisoning. By the time my internship ended that Spring, no sign of Andreas had been found, and the rest of my time at the church was largely uneventful. Fr. Schmidt and the church thanked me for my service to the community, and all things considered I am grateful for my experiences there. I still keep in touch with Fr. Schmidt, who has since retired from ministry after a long, distinguished career. Till this day, I have no idea what I saw in those woods. I only know how it made me feel, and that is something I hope to never experience again. I’m glad Julien was there to witness it too, otherwise I might question my sanity. Did I see the Erlking? Is that what took Andreas? Sometimes those questions are laughable, other days I’m not so sure. There really is evil in this world, that I truly believe, though I’m not privy to all the ways it can manifest itself. Maybe someone reading this can offer their two cents. Like I said, I harbor no delusions that anyone will believe this, but I hope you found my story interesting nonetheless.

How should I best prepare myself for building tech startups?,csInterviewQ,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/7vtogb/undergrad_with_one_summer_to_spare_how_should_i/,"I'm a cs major from a top computer science school. I am a talented software engineer that has shipped code at multiple top-n tech companies, and I am confident about my programming abilities. I am going to graduate school because I am interested in getting a deeper understanding of certain CS subfields (for both intellectual and entrepreneurial purposes) and intend on using the time to develop ideas and make connections with people.

With that being said, I am not looking to get a summer internship this summer, but instead want to spend the time on something that will help prepare me for the future. I don't want to just ""start a startup"". I want to build my fundamentals, either in 'soft skills' or engineering, that will help get me there in the future. I've been thinking of applying for positions at VC firms, but I'm mostly at a loss about what to do in order to best invest this summer. Does anyone have any advice on how to best spend a 3-month period of time to prepare for success?"

They forced him to apply to a ton of schools I'm applying to and even forced him to change his major to something he doesn't even want to study (my potential major, of course).

They even messed around with his essays before he submitted them and truly control every aspect of his life. His biggest EC, a two-year compsci internship (at one of the big tech firms) was something he got because his mom works there (but he'd never actually mention that on his app).

Of course, his grades are top of our class and mine fall around 8%, so him applying for my major (which he is isn't even interested in) will definitely hurt me.

Yes, I understand that I just sound salty but it infuriates me that I can push myself for four years from my own drive and lose to a kid that is controlled by his parents in every aspect of his life. Every single opportunity he's every gotten stemmed from them and not of his own accord.

The only solace I have in all of this is a slightly but insignificantly better test score and the fact that he emailed all the schools his parents changed the essays for and tried to submit his old ones instead.

Do you think the fact that him emailing the schools and trying to change his essays back kind of exposes that his parents control his life? Do you think this will help me? Ivy+ schools say they want kids that aren't robots....but he'll get into a bunch of them anyway....

Some facts about each:

Twitter
-Slightly lower hourly pay (not important for an internship but not sure how this translates into a potential full-time offer)
-Overtime with manager’s approval (pay unknown)
-Double the monthly housing stipend (again, not important as it gets taxed 45-55%)
-Interesting team, focused on improving monetization and developing internal tools
-Small, growing team (described as a “startup within Twitter”)
-Seems to only reimburse travel if you fly down
-Recently hired their previous intern as full-time
-Downtown SF HQ location
-Big name
-Recruiter responds rather quick regardless of the time of day, team seems to be very interested to have me

Tableau
-Better hourly pay + monthly transportation stipend
-Overtime pay at 1.5x pay with manager’s approval (recruiter mentioned this which makes me think they have a good work-life balance)
-High chance of a return offer, a very high percentage of their interns get return offers
-Team unknown, surveyed and matched with a team after accepting (selection seems to be flexible, however, where you can switch teams should you not like your match)
-People I interviewed with all had BigN backgrounds (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.) which says something about their talent attraction/retention
-Will reimburse relocation should you decide to drive
-Palo Alto location (HQ is in Seattle)
-Unknown name to many although their software is used by many I know (for classes, there’s a team at my current internship that works with Tableau/Tableau integration, etc.)
-Recruiter can be very slow (days) to respond

1. **No name school with solid co-op program:** I've lurked enough on this SubReddit to understand prestige isn't everything. I'm considering schools like Carleton University (relatively unknown Canadian school) that offer co-op terms, alternating between academic and work terms. Subsidized pay by the government and work terms during winter and spring instead of summer (less competition) will make internships a lot easier to come by. This will allow me to graduate with nearly two years of work experience.

2. **Somewhat prestigious school, CS major:** A school like UBC or UCSD (I'm out of state for UCSD so tuition will be pricey). There is a co-op program for UBC, but it's not guaranteed and there aren't many work terms.

3. **Prestigious school, not CS major:** I'm fairly confident I can get into CMU and Waterloo—except not as a CS major. Of course, CS at these top schools is darn near impossible to get into. At CMU, I have a good shot at getting into statistics, and at Waterloo, I can get into the math program (with co-op).

There are still other qualities I feel like I should consider, such as proximity to a tech hub."

I'm currently looking to get into the IT field after several years of experience in blue-collar jobs.

* Format: is my resume easy to read? 

* Content: I'm currently looking for roles in software development, hardware/software troubleshooting, and system administration. Have I presented my background as relevant to an entry-level position in the roles I'm interested in?
* Career advice:  Am I crazy for thinking I can get back into IT after so many years off? I worry that my more recent work history puts me at a disadvantage and may need to explore other career options.

Although the program was challenging, I was surprised to learn how limiting it was in terms of career opportunities. I did get a chance to work in healthcare for a short while, but I wasn't really happy with what I was doing.

Eventually I decided to do a Masters in computer engineering. The transition was rough, but it has definitely been a rewarding experience. I'm about to reach my last summer before looking for full-time work. I've done three previous internships at well known companies, but haven't had what I consider a true software engineering role yet (performance, automation, etc.).

I'm currently deciding between an internship offer at IBM or Intel. IBM would involve full-stack development with React, Node, and SQL/CouchDB. Intel would be more C, focusing on firmware and embedded work. I guess this really comes down to low-level vs. high-level, but to be honest I find both interesting with different technical challenges. My friends are suggesting IBM since it is in the area and could provide better networking opportunities. However, I also think that low-level work may overlap better with my coursework in medical instrumentation and computer engineering. Any suggestions?"

**Notes**

* The sample size is 100, which is too small to conclude anything statistically significant.
* These are the results of a survey, not an experiment. Therefore, correlation does not imply causation, and confounding variables are not accounted for.
* From the responses, 75% of respondents came from top 100 schools and their average GPA was 3.4. So however low these interview rates may seem, they're probably still above average due to the inherent selection bias here in /r/cscareerquestions.

Coming to this sub it sounds like if I want to have any chance of a decent job or any job after I graduate, I need to be reading CTCI / practicing Leetcode 24/7 etc. Is this true, or is that only really required for the Big-4 esque companies. I'm not interested in making 200+k / year in the Bay after I graduate at a major company, I'm really just looking for a decent job (i.e. 80k/year) in a major city with solid work-life balance. I find CS interesting, but it's not the kind of thing I can do 16 hours a day all day every day, and I don't know yet if I want to spend the rest of my life coding. Coming home from classes everyday, after I finish my homework, I'm about done with CS and like to spend a few hours to say hi to friends, hang out with my girlfriend, read, etc.  Am I falling behind by not programming 16 hours a day?

Is this feasible if I just continue on my present track or do I need to start grinding Leetcode etc. to not fall behind?"

In previous interviews, the company was surprised I even got an interview, and basically said wait until next year! I understand that they wanted to hire students almost done with school, but it still wasted some time.


So should I tell the recruiter that I am a sophomore? I put in the application that I graduate in 2020, but I would hate to take off school, and drive a while just to waste my time.

Thanks for your advice!

I have several programming languages listed on my resume as well and he said “Wow, these are the skills we are looking for! Your technical background is great!”

I get on the phone with the actual hiring manager for the interview and she’s like “lmfao no you’re gonna be answering phones and responding to IM’s when people need help. That job description was just a generic one they gave us.” and I had to nearly stop myself from laughing like lmfaooo okay then, not what I was told.

It also cracks me up because the recruiter was like, “You’ll need to quit your job at school, we want someone to start immediately, this is for your career so think carefully.” 

I mean, don’t get me wrong because I don’t look down on this position at all because it’s not the positions fault or anything, but it was just kinda like, how is this really an internship? It just seemed really misleading and kind of strange is all. Also, to be offering this to students who are majoring in proper business fields like supply chain, marketing, and the not just tech support side of IT seemed kind of lame, Idk. 

Anyway, I don’t men to come across salty, but it was just something I wanted to talk about and ask you guys if you had anything like this happen before! :B"

This is is second semester at the university as he did his first two years at our local community college while active duty in the Air Force. In community college he maintained a 4.0 GPA. His current university GPA is 3.95.

This semester he is taking:
Circuits 2, Electromagnetism, Signals and systems, Chemistry (for electrical engineers), &amp; a 7-10 hour a week internship 

He's worried he can't grasp emag or signals. He's gotten tutoring for emag (said it helped a little) with tutoring scheduled for tonight and Saturday for signals. He's putting in the work but worried he won't be able to pass. He got A's in all of courses thus far except Linear Algebra (B) - so, in my opinion, he's very smart and capable. I think he struggles with not being perfect at something. 

Basically, do you have any words of wisdom, encouragement, or stories of your experience in these classes? I'm going to show him this post in hopes it makes him feel better. I hate seeing him this stressed and miserable. "

I stayed a year after school without inservice work because companies wouldn't hire me because im severly asthmatic. I got a job as a production intern finally and six months into it I started getting very sick, my lungs were not coping. I decided to stay just to complete my inservice requirements so I could graduate and then go back to school to study something else. I quit my job end of 2017 and finished my notice period january 26. I decided to study a bsc in civil engineering at one of the top universities in my country, I got my student card on January 29. The next day was the first day of orientations, which I attended. On my way home I was involved in an accident that had me in hospital until the 5th of February. I took the next day of  and attempted to go back to  school yesterday on the 6th. I sustained head injuries and a broken ankle and a huge laceration in my left foot so im using crutches without the use of one foot. I cannot afford a wheelchair. Yesterday was a failure, halfway through the day my foot was in so much pain, my whole body shaking and I was nauseous and dizzy.

I left for home before the end of classes. My mother is strongly suggesting I postpone my education for this year as it will be impossible for me to attend classes for maybe a month. Almost every class I have has practicals which I cannot attend since it requires that you wear closed shoes, I am unable to hop from class to class since the venues are far apart and I keep on missing some classes. She says I could get my driving licence and a job for this year rather than fail some classes as  that would get me excluded from the university.

I feel like that would be giving up without giving it a chance but I also see her point. Im confused as to what to do. I turn 23 years old on august this year and am female. What advice can you guys offer me please, what should I do?"

I already have a pretty cool full-time job lined up but they want me to start in August. This is so they can focus all their energy in the summer for their interns and during the fall for their full-time entry level guys (me). I really don't want to take the summer off because I need $$$ and would like to gain some more diversified expererience. There are some places hiring for engineering internships but I'm not sure how to approach them.

If I don't say anything about me already having a job I don't want them to look at my resume and think ""this guy is gonna have a degree when he starts, could he not find a full-time position?""

If I do tell them that I already have a job I'm of course worried that they won't hire me cause they won't want to invest time and effort into training me. Of course, they could see that as a positive, I have worked with companies that see it that way.

And I really don't want to lie and say I'm starting grad school or something like that in the fall.

I’ve been writing out my thoughts for hours because otherwise I don’t know how else to distract myself. I’m currently a senior in high school, about to graduate in a few months. I’ve suffered from anxiety since I was 12 and I’ve never taken any medication for it. I've had suicidal thoughts since then as well.

I’ve been in mostly AP/GT/Honors classes all my life and I’ve been raised to keep up expectations thus I’m always on edge about my grades. The culture I grew up in focuses heavily on academic success so I grew up thinking that anything less = failure. But because of my anxiety and other personal issues I’m failing my classes and I ended my internship because I’m so unmotivated to do anything. I keep telling myself to do better, that I’ve done this much for the last 12 years yet I still don’t try hard enough and I’m so scared that I’ll get rescinded from the colleges I barely got into or that I won’t be able to get into any more at this point. I told myself years ago that if I stayed living here after high school that I would kill myself.

I drive to school and every morning since about October of last year I’ve had thoughts of killing myself while driving. I actually attempted to drive straight into a railing while getting off the highway on the way back from school 2 weeks ago but I stopped myself last minute. I keep wanting to drive my car into the lake next to my school. The thoughts continue even when I’m home but it’s just different ways I fantasize about killing myself. I try to listen to music or paint or do anything to keep these thoughts away but they just come back. I don’t tell my friends about my thoughts because I don’t want to burden them and a part of me doesn’t want them to contact a professional to help me get counseling. I’m so selfish. 

After years of telling me that my anxiety was fake and I was being dramatic, my mom’s kinda opened up more to me about receiving help but I most definitely won’t be able to get counseling or any help until college but at this point I don’t see myself living beyond this summer. I can’t fall asleep at night and if I do, I wake up at 2 or 3 AM every morning and just sit up and stare at nothing for hours. 

I know that I’m just overthinking right now and that everything will be fine, that everyone my age is going through heavy stress right now, and that high school isn’t forever but my mind tells me that nothing will get better for me and that I should have just killed myself like I planned to back in sophomore year.

I'm here to say, that just because you don't have that, doesn't mean you're not successful.  That's why I'm going to share my story.

I went to college at the second largest school in the USA, which has a decent CS program.  Not fantastic, but not terrible.  I'd say, decent.  Had one IT related internship (SharePoint management and training stuff, plus other hardware ""repair"" tasks) and one no name startup job programming in python.  Graduated with a 3.3 GPA.  Was unemployed for over a year job searching and attempting to make my resume better, while also doing what it took to pay loans and eat.  After a year, I got offered a job that pays 70k with benefits, which is more than enough to live, and then some.  I've now been at that company for over a year, and though it's not my dream job and sometimes it rough, I've learned more about software development than my 5 years of college combined.  

I guess the point of my story is this:  just because you're not at the best company, making the most money, it's okay.  Not everyone has that big job.  The thing that helps me keep perspective, is something a mentor told me a while back ""just put one foot in front of the other, don't worry what others are doing.  Just focus that you're on the path you have.  Everyone takes a different path, and that's okay.""

Sorry, it's a little sappy.  But, I think a majority of people in that are entering this field get a combination of jealousy and imposter syndrome , and it's just not healthy.

I live in Denmark.  Education is paid through taxes. rules apply. It is not free. 
I feel I should provide some background info. Hang tight.
I have a high school degree and some ECTS from a university. I dropped out for several valid reasons. 
I am on social welfare. Three months ago I talked with a councilor and assigned mentor about me taking some high school-level classes to prepare me for university. And train my study habits.

 There was also talk about getting assigned to take ""internships"" ( think bogus ""jobs"" that you will never really get hired at). I wasn't necessarily opposed to the internship. It could be great for my CV to get some references. But I knew I wanted a higher education. 

My mentor even told me to not get my hopes up for the internship the government could provide. I keep talking with my mentor about various courses and job opportunities.  I find some classes in English and French. I have had both classes before on a lower level and ~~I need It ~~  they would be beneficial for some  international degrees I am aiming for. The degrees are not in my country so they won't be ""free"". I have calculated the finances and even gotten part scholarship offers.it is realistic. I am able to finance my education fully with some okayish student loans at the end. I believe these degrees will give me a far better competitive advantage compared to the outskirts suburban ""education"" with bad teachers I can get in my tiny country.

The town I live in does not offer the official classes that I want. I find these classes online in another far away city. I am okay with traveling to take four exams in 5 months. The application deadline is feb 1st. I have been talking with the school since 15th January on and off. Jan 29 I notice I have a very sudden appointment with a newly assigned welfare councilor the next day.  My old councilor got promoted, and at the same time I got pushed into a "" internship ready"" programe"". Its not really set in stone but it is what my new councilor specializes in. I talk with her about the application deadline tfeb 1st. two days. She tells me that I need a one page ""study readiness plan"". This plan needs to have a national education as a study readiness goal. I need to write it as some sort of case. This was supposed to have happened two months ago. My previous councilor did not call me in for a meeting in December as she told me she would. This plan never even got started. So apparently my new councilor thinks my previous councilor wanted me to go for an internship. Like as if we had formulated a 1 page internship plan. Which we don't or at least I never saw it. My old councilor omitted (probably innocently) to include the high school classes part of our conversations in our notes which my new councilor has read.

This being two days before the application deadline, I hastily but respectfully put some words together as a study plan proposal. My new councilor needs it for her boss to approve the ""funding"".  Partially due to time pressure and a lacking piece of stud from my previous councilor I get a denial from my new welfare councilor that they will not pay for my courses. I suggest I pay for them myself as they would be cheaper for my than the government. She tells me I still have to participate in their other day-activities. I say fine I'll think about if It's still realistic to apply..  I decide to sign up. Even if I have to be away at some weird jobs that takes 6-9 hours out of my day, I am okay with getting lower grades at the high school classes. I just need them to improve my English and have something slightly official to show my recent training with the two languages.  I study hard for four days, uncertain if I will have to show up somewhere daily in a week or three. I aim to frontload my studies. I send an email to my councilor feb 3rd. This  5th February I get an email from my new councilor. She writes unless I quit the two courses, she will take me of social welfare aid. She writes it in a demeaning tone of "" I already told you this"". She didn't btw. I secretly and legally record our conversations.


I find this absurd. I know other people on social welfare who spend their evenings playing cards and talking about nothing. But I am not allowed to take course that I paid for myself? The untold angle is that there is a price reduction when I pay for them personally and for people who don't have a higher education. The price deduction might play a role in the rules for social welfare. But I can't find anything saying this anywhere.

There is also an anecdotal thing I read online. It says that if you are on social welfare adn in sorts of "" internship plan programmes "" or "" education plan programmes"" they have to test your maximum work capability. Thus you might not be allowed to take even as much as private singing lessons. Of course in practice this is close to impossible to track fully. But these high school classes are sufficiently official that I suspect my councilor could gain access to the information in some system. I am signed up with my social security ID after all. 

For a brief moment I considered doing something "" under the table"". I.e. emailing her I quit, without doing so and even if I get forced later I will have all the corrections done and I can probably pay for the exams individually. Or I could 100% self study and just take the exams in five months. But that defeats the purpose of getting feedback so I can prepare for an international education. I emailed my mentor who says he might try to fix this but to don't get my hopes up.

I will try to get into contact with my previous  councilor who got promoted. She likely is powerless and doesn't care.


The absurd thing is that I am allowed to spend my evenings playing cards and talking with losers, but I am not allowed to take some official online courses that I paid for myself.

Ultimately I might have to quite the courses as I can't live without the money. But I just can't believe it.

TL;DR: I am not allowed to study self paid courses. the old councilor forgot to include the course mentions and plans in my file. new councilor bitches that not only will the government not pay for it, I am also ""not allowed"" to pay for it myself and study. no formal alternative activity plans exist to my knowledge. And the one I sent in didn't get approved."

I am international students studying chemical engineering in the US. I have one year left before I graduate but so far I haven't had internships in the industry. I started out looking for industry jobs last year (in my Junior year) because in my first two years I was in community college, not much to look for. I probably applied to around 30 positions online and I went to the career fair a couple times to talk with a few companies (20 in total probably). A few companies actually liked me I think but they mentioned that they are currently not hiring internationals and that there's really nothing that they can do. So that's 50 in total.

I am really discouraged. I think my resume is pretty solid. My university is top 5-10 in engineering. My GPA is well above average. Involved in many activities. I had no problem securing a competitive leadership position/job and a research position on campus. Well, maybe it is because international students and domestic students are in the same footing for on campus jobs/research positions. 

One thing that I haven't tried is coming into small info sessions that some companies usually hold in my university. I think this would be a good way to network. Is there anything else that I could do?  

Should I keep trying or should I just give up? All this job search pressure is affecting my performance in classes and my stress level. If you are international students who have gone through this please tell me your experience, but any advice are welcome. I don't plan to live in the US as of right now, but I do want to utilize my OPT years (preferably for the whole 3 years).

I keep bombing all my technical interviews and I find it difficult to even get interview offers (despite reviewing my job application with my school). Sometimes I screw up on easy programming questions. I have tried reviewing material, but it turns out that I keep missing something important. Once, I messed up so hard on one easy question that the interviewer even told me that I'm bad at programming and kicked me out. Another interviewer said stuff like I come off as too shy/nervous (I have social anxiety and tried to hide it, but it has not been very effective). I'm just an average student with a 3.12 GPA. I'm not very good at math (only relatively good/average when compared with the class averages) and the only math courses I got a ""good"" grade in were the discrete math intro course and a statistics course (statistics was curved though, meaning that if the class average was 30% then 70% can be an A-), but I got Cs and Bs in everything else. I even got Cs in a few programming/computer science classes. My first semester of university was easy since I took programming in high school, but I struggle later on. I did manage to get a high term average last semester, but they were easy junior computer science courses so I don't know if I should be hopeful or not. One of the hardest class for me has been Software Engineering and the most difficult part for me was not the programming, but the group work (which is very important for software developers). I would probably suck at being a manager since I don't have good people/social skills. I don't even have friends and come off as rude by accident sometimes. I joined Computer Science because I wanted to be a software engineer/developer, but with my situation, I would probably have a hard time. Should I consider changing majors or dropping out? The only problem is that if I do this, then I can't think of what else I should do because there isn't really anything that I'm really good at. I'm also more than halfway done my degree (almost a senior). I would probably have a hard time finding a job that could make a living without a college degree (housing is expensive where I live so a minimum wage job forever won't cut it), haven't taken science courses in a long time so I don't know if I should switch to that, and don't do well in arts/humanities/social science classes (just meet the class average) so I probably shouldn't change to that. I like programming and find the concepts I have learned in my computer science classes very interesting (especially for Operating Systems), but doing something that I could be good at is probably more important than doing something that I like."

Classroom management is one of the biggest challenges of my experience so far.  It is especially bad when there is a sub and I am lead teaching.  The children just do not behave when I teach.  My cooperating teacher uses a behavior chart...you know, one of those charts where the children flip their card to yellow, red, etc. when they misbehave.  I use it in order to keep the routine the same and to attempt to earn their respect.  I tell the class that I expect to be treated the same as their main teacher and I feel that the only way to do that is to keep the routine the same.  But!!! The behavior chart DOES NOT work and I knew this going into my internship.  We are always taught that behavior charts are demeaning and disrespectful, as learning in an appropriate manner should be something the kids want to do and not something that is only motivated by not wanting to flip their card.  

What I have found is slightly effective is stopping all activity momentarily to remind the children in a firm voice that I'm not messing around and that our relationship has to be mutually respectful.  After this conversation, the children are definitely better behaved for about 45 minutes before the disrespect starts up again.  

I know these children are 5 and 6 BUT I still have high expectations and my expectations are as high as my cooperating teacher's.  The children can meet these expectations with her so I expect the same with me.

I know I can't change her behavior management system but what do you use in your classroom to control behavior?  Do reward systems work better or do simple conversations/reminders get the job done?  I'm so sad about feeling like a mean teacher, as I feel like I'm constantly reprimanding students to the point where I don't even feel like myself and I leave the school with a hoarse voice.  "

7w4zzk,38,2018-02-08,Update after 1 year of professional work (December 2016 graduate),KKG_Apok,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/7w4zzk/update_after_1_year_of_professional_work_december/,"Hey guys,

I posted here a bit when I was in school. I just wanted to share what life is like for someone who completed the program.

Background:

* B.S. Biotechnology from University of Houston c.o. 2010

* B.S. Computer Science from Oregon State University c.o. 2016

Age: 30 (Graduated @ 28)

Location: Houston, TX (oil &amp; gas and healthcare fields prominent here)

Professional experience accumulated during program:

* Django (Python) webserver with bioinformatics analysis tool project I picked up by networking at a local liberal arts university

* NodeJS/React web crawler tool from capstone project

* Android app with database backend from database class and mobile dev class (iirc)

Experience since graduating:

* 1 yr as Software Engineer at a 3D printer manufacturer

OK. So I graduated a bit over a year ago. I had no real internships because I was working full time and not really planning ahead. I had a bit of trouble finding a job, and I was jobless for about a month and a few weeks after graduating.

I used the time I had off to send out a few applications a day to local companies. I didn't get much headway there.

My girlfriend has a great network, however, and one of her college buddies was an executive at a local 3D printer manufacturer startup. She asked him if they were looking for programmers and he said ""OF COURSE"". So I tailored my resume to try and match my strengths to what the company does and sent it off. I heard back the next day. I interviewed the following week and was hired a week after that.

The software stack was Windows .NET. This is fairly common in Houston and Texas. There's a lot of big corporations that run using Microsoft's .NET stack. C#, Windows Forms, WPF, MSSQL, ASP.NET, Azure, etc.

I had 0 experience with any of that, but I had experience in unmanaged C++ from CS161/CS162 and data structures/algorithms. So I get hired on and told that I'll be learning C#.

I start off by separating a form from a much larger application so that it can be used in multiple places. I have to write the app and the unit tests to show that I was learning C#. This gets done in a few weeks while I familiarize myself with the Microsoft stack.

I become good friends with the CEO. We start talking about the next thing to do. I ask what kind of stuff the company is looking to do and he mentions a big research project that they've been wanting but no one's been up to the task.

I tell him that I'm game if he wants. So I get started. I had no idea how deep the rabbit hole was. It was supposed to just be software to create instructions for 3D printers to print objects. Easy? Yeah. No.

I started out the project using C++ because the original vision was that this was a command line tool for in house use. We wanted something lean and fast. C++! I knew that!

I learn the C++ STL algorithms and data structures and get good at learning how to use hash tables. My original project used a naïve algorithm to solve the problem I was trying to do. That was terrible when I gave bigger data sets. I improved it to a polynomial solution. To be fair, that's about as good as it gets.

I explored GPU parallel processing, threading, and asynchronous task management to improve the runtime. A few months later, I had something that I was pretty proud of.

THEN, I got told that the vision now included a UI. Well, remember how I said we were using Windows .NET? Yeah, unmanaged C++ does not play well with Windows .NET. Microsoft has its own version of C++ called C++/CLI. But it uses a different syntax and set of libraries than the C++ that I've been using.

So back to the drawing board it was. I ended up deciding on refactoring the entire codebase in C#. I had read a lot and when considering a larger scale application and the computational overhead of running a much more complex UI, the cost of using C# to run algorithms and store data in memory was fairly minimal.

So I spend a few days refactoring the code. It's nice because I had already spent the time figuring out the architecture of my project, so it was merely a matter of rewriting the codebase in a fairly similar syntax. Vectors became lists, maps became hashsets or dictionaries. The nicest part was that I was able to create a UI using WPF and bind the slicer in without having to worry about tying in unmanaged code.

So it worked. The C# codebase actually ran faster using the same data sets. Go figure. I went on to improving the design. That was around 6 months ago. The project is now much more refined. It works and is being introduced to clients soon as a beta product.

I got tons of messages from recruiters around the new year. One got me an interview for a 4x pay raise for a 40 hour/week .NET developer position. I owned the interview and start a new job on Monday. I'll now be making more money than I dreamed I ever could when I started the OSU program.

I'm keeping a relationship with the company that I currently work at as a consultant. They couldn't match what I'm going to be getting paid nor the benefits, but I have a ton of knowledge in computational geometry, OpenGL rendering, and specific knowledge in this one engineering program we use. It's great to be valued like this. The guy that hired me told me that if I ever find myself without a job, they'd love to have me back. That's great to hear for someone that was making $10/hr. working with lab mice a few years ago.

Hard work pays off guys. You'll struggle. This profession isn't meant to be easy. It's meant to be challenging. That's why it pays well. But put in the work, be professional, be willing to learn new dev stacks, and be willing to look for jobs in places that you didn't expect.

Also use recruiters if you're having a hard time getting started. Their job is to be connected and they'll know where to look. It's a smart idea if you've been struggling a few months finding something to sacrifice a bit of salary to a recruiter so that you can get professional experience. Experience trumps all in this field. You'll make your money back in a few years. So don't be afraid to reach out."

I'm currently in a 4 year program and am in my second semester of my freshman year. However, lately I have been thinking if college/university is the best way of going about it.

It feels like I am wasting my time and accruing debt for no good reason.

The other option I am thinking of is withdrawing from university, living at home, and getting the necessary certifications needed to enter the work force. That's probably at minimum $200k salary in the next three years I would be at school, plus the $50k I would be saving in loans. 

The only upside I can see right now are the networking opportunities down the line. I live in NJ, close to NYC, and the teachers and staff in my department are very well connected in the area. This could help me land good internship opportunities and work my way up to a higher premium job out of college, I'm not sure what the path is for me yet, but for anyone in the field, what did you do and/or how would you go about it doing it today?

This is gonna be my first post on reddit since I needed a career advice and thought this sub reddit could help me. 
So short biography about me so far:

* Graduated in Computer Sciences(in Asia) in 2013 and found an internship in a different country(Europe) .The product,the company builds, is primarily developed on framework called Magic XPA(has very very few demand in the job market anywhere in the world)

* Offered a full time job after one year(2014) and I accept it . For next three years(till 2017) I am primarily working with Magic XPA and some C#, SQL etc. The job wasn't too boring but I didn't care much about the career then since the money was fine and I was just going with the flow(""living the life"" as they say once you start earning after being a broke student) but not really investing time in challenging myself professionally. My manager was happy with my performance though and had no complains.

* I am starting to get bored and start thinking of changing jobs. Then in 2017 my manager puts me in the Mobile development team.
* I worked with C#, Xamarin(git,scrum) for next 6-8 months (my tasks involved bug fixing, adding new features for mobile etc) and was getting fluent into it when in beginning of 2018 I am transferred to totally new team which will involve really less programming and more configuration of the software (Microsoft Workflow foundation, some requirements engineering , business logic implementation etc)

It will be 5 years in 2019 and I feel its time for me to change my job finally. I want to move towards Cloud Computing, IT Consultant/Analyst, DevOps Engineering etc  and less towards traditional programming roles(Web, C++,C#,Java) So I am thinking of learning AWS, Azure,getting some certifications and doing some projects on my own
Do you guys think thats a good move ? With my current experience and potentially knowledge in cloud , can I be considered a strong candidate when I apply for those jobs ?

So I signed a year long lease for an apartment in Toronto in August, because I was in Toronto for an internship and couldn't find an apartment that was only short term. I have since left Toronto(because my internship ended and classes at my university in a different city started again) and have been trying to find someone to transfer the lease to, which the landlord said was ok. 

So now that I finally found someone to transfer the lease to, the landlord has tried to increase the rent that the new person has to pay. The rent I paid was $1025 per month, and the person I found to replace me said that the lease he has been asked to sign is $1050. I initially signed the lease on DocHub, so it was all online and I never had a hard copy printed out. I went back to check the lease on Dochub, in case i remember the rent wrong, and the landlord has removed my access to the document. Before this i assumed it was just a miscommunication but you can't accidentally remove someones access to a document on Dochub. 

BUT here's where the landlord screwed up: the email that initially invited me to sign the document on dochub, also included a pdf of the original lease with the rent at the original $1025. 

So we have clear proof that the landlord is trying to raise the price of the room, even though my lease has not ended and is just being passed on to the next person. I am planning on contacting the landlord tenant board in toronto but I would love any extra advice!"

1. **No name school with solid co-op program:** I've lurked enough on this SubReddit to understand prestige isn't everything. I'm considering schools like Carleton University (relatively unknown Canadian school) that offer co-op terms, alternating between academic and work terms. Subsidized pay by the government and work terms during winter and spring instead of summer (less competition) will make internships a lot easier to come by. This will allow me to graduate with nearly two years of work experience.

2. **Somewhat prestigious school, CS major:** A school like UBC or UCSD (I'm out of state for UCSD so tuition will be pricey). There is a co-op program for UBC, but it's not guaranteed and there aren't many work terms.

3. **Prestigious school, not CS major:** I'm fairly confident I can get into CMU and Waterloo—except not as a CS major. Of course, CS at these top schools is darn near impossible to get into. At CMU, I have a good shot at getting into statistics, and at Waterloo, I can get into the math program (with co-op).

I did not love the product and the work environment being a bunch of cubicles drove me crazy. I was only there for 10 weeks and man there were some days where I just dreaded going in. 

I am currently, and have been doing tech support for a very large company *Cough probably the company that makes the phone you're using Cough* for about 2 years now in their college program. I really, really like this company. The culture, the tools, the opportunity for growth and development, my co-workers, I like it all, but lets be honest and call the job what it is...tech support. 

Obviously, the ultimate goal is to get to software engineering at the company that I currently work for, but that is a pipe-dream. I am not graduating from a target school, I don't have any crazy side-projects, and to be honest, I don't think I *love* coding (however I definitely enjoy it enough to make a career of it). I have applied internally within the company and am still working for it, but the goal is a far reach.

I have also been applying to other rotational experiences and programs within the company and am extremely confident that I will land one before graduation that way I can be doing something within the company outside of tech support.

My salary at this position will be about 70% of the software engineering position, but with tons of room for growth and opportunities around every corner. I worked this job through half of my college career, and I can say that I do not believe any other company treats there employees the way this one does (in terms of pay, benefits, opportunities, and really just everything). 

I've been talking this decision over with friends and family and they think I am **insane** for even considering staying with the tech support job. Their view is that I went to school to get a degree for SWE and would be getting paid more if I took that position, but I feel they do not understand why my decision is tough.

What I really want to know is if they are right? Am I crazy for considering a significantly lower paying position just because it is with a company I like. Is valuing a place of employment over a career unordinary? Am I just outright dumb for working so hard in college and not reaping the benefits and rewards that my degree and knowledge can bring me? I would love to hear your thoughts, reassuring or not.

Tomorrow is the day of my first career fair! The fair is very tech and science oriented, so about 80% of the employers attending are looking for interns/graduates majoring in computer science and IT.

I am looking for a summer internship.

I’m a junior studying computer science. My GPA is 3.15. I’ve also never really had much experience outside of coding for labs in school. I have intermediate experience with Java, and basic experience in C, Python, and Matlab.

I have one relevant position on my resume where I worked as an IT assistant wiping hard drives on company computers. It was also for a pretty important medical company back in my hometown.

I’m also very outgoing and I’m not too easily intimidated by anyone, really. I try to get in a “flow” and work the room using my social skills. I’m also always smiling lol.

Anyways, my resume is clean n formatted, my checklist for employers I want to talk to is almost finished, and I’m just about ready for tomorrow.

Any last minute tips for me??

7wbpj4,54,2018-02-09,Letter to High School Seniors,iftair,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7wbpj4/letter_to_high_school_seniors/,"Dear High School Seniors,

Right now I assume you're in the midst of waiting to hear back from all your colleges. It's nerve-wrecking. You constantly wonder whether X University will accept you or maybe you even heard back form a few and are awaiting financial aid packages. That's literally the only thing that was in your mind right now. I know because I was in your shoes almost a year ago. 

I applied to 18 institutions. Six of them were public (and all in-state, NY) and twelve were private. Before March, I heard back from all public colleges I applied and I was awaiting to hear from the privates. Vanderbilt was my top choice but honestly I just wanted to attend a private university on a full ride or something close to it. Come middle of March and I heard back from a private school. It was Northeastern and my application was rejected. I wasn't surprised. And surprisingly I was okay with it, mainly because I wasn't as passionate about the school and I was VERY optimistic about my other choices. The next day I heard back from Fordham. I was accepted, as I predicted. But I didn't want to go here cause that would be a 90 minute commute every day. I went to NYU for Precollege back in summer 2016 as a commuter and I felt pretty lonely, for the first 2 weeks at least. I want to dorm, to get away from my parents but didn't care as much where at the time. I wish I did. Then, the night after (so 2 days since hearing back from Northeastern) I received a letter from Northwestern. Rejected. Again, I was not surprised, but it stung a little. It was my third choice and I loved the school. I vented to other Questies (I was/am a Questbridge scholar) and felt better cause I wasn't the only one who's going through this. I reasoned with myself that it is what it is and I can't do shit about it. The next morning, Boston University released their decisions. Rejection. I felt numb. It hurt, but I couldn't show emotion because I had to get ready to attend Minds Matter and all my energy and attention must go towards the project we were doing at the time. I was still hoping that a school that I really wanted to go accepts me (w/ a great financial aid package) cause I did not want to stay in New York for college. Almost a week later, Brandeis wait listed me. I didn't think too much about it. Two days later, I heard back from Haverford and Union College. Haverford rejected me. I already had enough with the rejections and waitlists so I had my older sister record me ripping apart their rejection letter, and surprisingly it was therapeutic. I felt a lot better and resumed my day as normal. Later that night, Union released its decision and I was offer a wait list, but I declined because I didn't feel as passionate about that school. I ranted in my journal about my frustration that the admission process is selective and I made up conspiracy that universities and colleges reject many applicants so they can look ""more selective"" (now I understand that it's hard for them as well because they have so many potentially amazing applicants but too few seats, but back then I was a frustrated high school senior). I also thought selective colleges accept rich people first so they can ""fund"" the school (I now know it's the alumni that does so). I just really wanted Vandy or Tufts to accept me because (1) I really loved both schools and (2) I want a full ride (I'm from a low-income family). From this point, I started to consider enrolling in a state school, my dread.

Eventually, I heard back from my top school, Vanderbilt. Rejected. And at the time, it sucked my soul. I reread the decision on my computer to make sure I wasn't dreaming. It was reality, and at the time I couldn't accept it. I simply told my parents I got rejected and I think they had the ""we knew this was gonna happen"" attitude. Afterwards, I grabbed my house keys, socks, and my sneakers and took an hour walk to Roosevelt Island to try and clear my mind. It didn't help. Instead, I broke down and cried when I got there. I told my friend, who didn't help at all. He said that ""You were only smart in a school where 80% of students are idiots.""  Well there goes any confidence I had. All my work in high school, use less. The long nights studying for tests, the shit storm I went through in junior years, all wasted. At least I joined clubs I liked even though I joined mad late. I even wished that I was told WHY I was rejected, and not some generic ass letter. I truly didn't felt good enough.

The next day, NYU wait listed me, which I was happy about and Tufts rejected me. Finally, the day after, Brown rejected me. I heard back from every school I applied to, and I had to choose between 3 state schools and Fordham. People from my high school got into those schools and I didn't think they tried as hard. What a shame. There isn't a fairy tale for everyone. Maybe if I slacked off a little bit, I probably would have gotten to those schools regardless. But, it is what it is, and I had to swallow whatever pride I had. I had a problem with each of the four schools I had to choose from. Soon enough, I decided to not enroll in Fordham. I eventually enrolled in a state school that I am not in love with purely because it is the cheapest option. Same friend predicted that I will go to that school back in junior year of high school, but at that point, I was too numb to give a fuck.

But now that I look back, I did have blessings. The Minds Matter project we had went really well (and my group won the best project for our year), and I had a lot of fun doing it. On April Fool's Day, I was given the opportunity to intern at BlackRock, the leading asset management firm in the world (might do an AMA on it). Finally, I made memories after the rejections. I got closer to a lady who goes to Binghamton, and I made memories with people I met in my college's group chat from the NYC meetup we had in Manhattan to the picnic. I went to prom dateless and had a blast with the boys, and my internship at BlackRock is an amazing experience. 

The first semester was daunting. Meeting new people, partying, getting my first kiss, catching up with high school mates, studying. A lot was going on. I didn't like the school still. I hated the fact that I was hanging out with people of my kind and wanted to branch out, but have no idea how. Some days I spent in isolation studying. I felt pretty miserable around the second half of my first semester. I even thought about which schools I would have applied and not applied if I was given a do-over. Then winter break came and I really needed it to reflect on everything. Now here I am a month into my second semester writing to you all. So far I'm content. I don't love my school, but I don't hate it. Transferring is on my mind but not as often. I may not like where I am but I'm here so I gotta suck it up and do what I gotta do to be successful, but I don't know where to start lol.

So if you are worried about acceptances, don't. You have 3-4 more months of senior year. If you get rejected from one of your top schools, you just gotta suck it up and move on. If you get into a school you love, congrats. And when you choose where to enroll, consider somewhere you know you'll be happy. If you don't like it there, then you can transfer, but always give your school a chance but you must do the work. 

Right now, focus on passing your classes and not dropping your grades too much. Focus on graduation and making memories with your friends and classmates. If you don't talk to them, then spend time making yourself happy. Go to prom but don't overstress about it (or find something fun to do if you decide not to go). It's cliché but you only have a few months before entering college. Make them count. Carpe diem.

Sincerely,

iftair (A college freshman)"

Sometime last year i got a call from one of our clients, $ReligiousOrganisationBasedInItaly, more specifically a shop attached to their main ""facilities"".  We are currently overhauling their entire network but this particular place has 3 or 4 (we're not even sure) consumer grade switches daisy chained together on two stories and nearly 80m of cable before they reach the main server. Which is about 30m from them but they don't want to drill a couple of holes for that.     

Anyways, that particular morning i was alone in the office with the intern (who's mainly there for support, he takes calls when everyone's busy, but he's instructed to just create a ticket and tell the callers that we'll call them back) while my coworkers are on various sites installing switches, phones and whatnot. I'll be $me, the callers are $caller and $angry.    

&gt;$me: Thank you for calling tech support, how may i help you?  
&gt;$caller: Hello, we have a huge problem we have no network, our till is not working, we have no internet, no email and our network drives are inaccessible  
&gt;$me: Let me check some things real quick *i ping the server, check the services, everything looks fine from my end*  
&gt;$me: Hmmm, your server is online other connections seem ok, can you check the ""internet"" cables on your end if everything is plugged as it should?  
&gt;$caller: Well, it worked yesterday and we didn't touch the cables *i can hear her whispering to someone* ""He's saying we need to check the cables"" the wifi works though  
&gt;$me: The wifi works? *i know it's behind their wall and plugged correctly into a real switch, so there has to be something with their network*  
&gt;$caller: Yes we can connect to wifi with our smartphones and with the only laptop we have here, but the other computers and the till are not working.  
&gt;$me: Let's start by checking those cables do you have access to your switches?  
&gt;$caller: *whispering* ""He says to check the cables, yes, no, wait"" Just a minute, my superior would like to have a word with you  
&gt;$angry: *in a very irritated tone* Yes, since this morning we have no internet no network, no tills, nothing, i want it fixed ASAP!  
&gt;$me: Yes i understand, but i know your network has some peculiarities and in your case it appears that a cable has been disconnected somewhe...  
&gt;$angry: YES! I know it's a network problem, you people installed it *nope, they flat out refused that we touch their 10 years old crap in the shop* and you need to fix it, SEND SOMEONE!  
&gt;$me: I understand your frustration but i am alone in the office and there are no available techs right now, if i don't manage to fix the problem from my end i'll get you one as soon as he's available. But we really should check those cables of yours because i know...*she cuts me off* are shit.  
&gt;$angry: No, you don't understand, i have customers waiting, my tills are not working, i am losing money i need you to send someone in 15 minutes. *yeah right, her boss doesn't have that kind of contract with us and if we did we guarantee a tech within 4 hours, non 15 minutes*    
&gt;$me: And i will send someone once we've identified the problem and if it requires a tech, but as i've said, i am alone in the office and... *cuts me off again*  
&gt;$angry: I don't care, I AM LOSING MONEY!  
&gt;$me: *this lady is starting to slightly irritate me* Listen, last time i checked i cannot multiply nor teleport, either we perform the troubleshooting right now *it's been 15 minutes already and nothing has beed accomplished* or you can wait for a tech, who most certainly will not show up in 15 minutes. It's up to you.  
&gt;$angry: I NEED YOU TO SEND SOMEONE !!!    

She slams the phone down at this point.    

I call one of my coworkers who's fighting with a weighting terminal not far for them and he's OK to make a detour to take a look.  
Once he's back, turns out those idiots managed to snap a cable by tugging on it with something heavy. They've also decided to move a computer in the till area and since there was no free ethernet outlet the $angry instructed the clerk to ""just unplug something from under the table"" which she did and guess what, yes, it was the cable from the tills.    

Our boss decided to bill them the double, for my time and coworker's."

I was a mechanical engineering major my freshman year and switched over the summer, so I'm technically a freshman in terms of my major, so I'll be applying to be a sophomore at whatever uni I transfer to. I'm really not feeling challenged and really want to go to a top program.

Academics: My first semester GPA at college was pretty meh being just a 3.28. The next semester went better, ending with a 3.5 (Dean's List). Last semester was great for me, I finished with a 3.92 (Dean's List Highest Honors). So my cumulative GPA right now is 3.6. My high school GPA kinda followed the same path, if it matters. I had a low 3.something until my junior year, where I had a 3.5, and I finished my senior year with above a 4.0 unweighted (although A-s at my school still counted a 4.0). I think my best SAT score was a 1900. I took AP Compsci, AP Physics A, and AP Environmental Science in high school.

Extra-curriculars: I was a very active member of my high school's robotics team. At college, I have jumped around several cubs (including starting one). However, I do do a good amount of research and would want to continue to do research wherever I go. I was listed as a co-author of a paper published by one of the professors I did research with. I had a mechanical engineering internship with a startup last summer. I'm also a very active member of a student-run angel investing fund at my current university. We have full on legit startups come and pitch to us and we decide whether or not we want to invest. For all intents and purposes, we are a legit angel fund. I spend a lot of my time and am very committed to the fund. I love the work and would want to start a similar fund at whatever university I transfer to. I'm not sure if it counts, but I also really like learning CS stuff on the side (mostly Udemy and Coursera courses).

I'm a white male and I'm only okay at writing essays.

Schools I'm thinking about (I would love to hear suggestions): University of Pittsburgh, Tufts (huge stretch imo), uPenn (also a huge stretch, probs not worth applying), UMD College Park, University of Wisconsin Madison, University of Washington, Northeastern. I know nothing about Liberal Arts schools, but I do know that many offer computer science degrees. I have no idea if I should apply to them or not though. "

I got an intern in well known telecom company in my country, as Oracle DBA, while I only have experience w/ SQL server.

My question is: is that true that Oracle will end up being less and less used, and isn't worth the effort of learning all the Oracle database differences compared to SQL server? Or is it false and Oracle is here, and wil stay here for a while?

I know the use of technology is never so linear, but I would like to have an ideia of how the market is for Oracle DBAs, and if as a Oracle DBA I could always change to any realtional database DBA in function of the company needs?

This is on me for a variety of reasons, and if anything I hope others can learn what I have in regards to applying for (the right) internships.

Being a junior with no internship experience under his belt, I ended up randomly applying to dozens of internships through my university recruiting website. I had a few interviews with some companies and they went pretty ok, so I was excited and eager to do some more. I was happy to get an interview request with this one company, and I took it in a heartbeat. Yesterday, I was checking the details of the company and I realized they wanted C programmers.

The thing is, I haven't coded in C for 1-1.5 years, and even when I was using it, I was pretty bad at it. I scraped by Operating Systems with a C+. So learning C in a night wasn't gonna happen. I couldn't back out of the interview either because you need to give a 2 day notice; if I didn't show up, I would be banned from participating in recruiting events, career fairs, etc. So, I decided to power through and go, knowing I'd probably embarrass the heck outta myself.

The interview itself went pretty much like I imagined. I stumbled through technical questions on C, so much so the interviewer said ""You haven't used C that much, have you?"" When I admitted it's been a while, he made me try out a coding problem on the whiteboard. Having done horribly on the technical questions, I was just out of it for the whole thing, and the interviewer ended up helping me for a majority of the problem.

I asked a few typical questions and thanked the interviewer for his help and the experience at the end of the interview. Although it wasn't necessarily a company I was dying to work for, it was still a very embarrassing experience. I'm honestly still considering whether it would've been a better idea to have not shown up and just plead with my university's career services to let me participate in future events.

If anything, I learned some things that should've been obvious from the start. Definitely READ about every company you apply to, specifically what they're looking for in interns. Don't randomly apply and try to wing it; that might work for a high school or university interview, but some companies are looking for specific skillsets you might not have. Check Glassdoor to familiarize yourself with coding questions they ask, and if you plan to cancel, give yourself more than 2 days to do so. Looking back on it (even though it happened all of an hour ago), I can say I at least learned a new coding question I can improve on in the future, and I've gained some valuable experience for the application process.

I have been fortunate enough to finally receive an offer for my first internship from IBM.  The offer expires on Feb 13th (Tuesday).  I also had a phone interview with Nvidia yesterday which went well and they obviously will take a few days to respond.  

The IBM internship is for building small client web/mobile applications that run on the IBM cloud.  At Nvidia if I do get an offer I will not be doing low level programming but mostly full stack development to help automate aging processes within the organization.

This is my first experience in applying and dealing with recruiters.  Both these internships will be 4 months and at most I plan on doing one more internship before I graduate.  So this very well may be my only internship before graduation.
 
What should I do in this situation?  I know most people seem to prefer Nvidia but would just going with IBM for 4 months hurt my prospects as I aim for the most desirable companies going forward?

7wg4e1,0,2018-02-09,0 -&gt; NASA in 18 months,calm_cool_pete,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7wg4e1/0_nasa_in_18_months/,"I recently saw a post about someone who sent out 1,600 applications before finding a job and another person who slaved away to work at DE Shaw or Citadel.  These posts are interesting and the second one is definitely inspiring but I'm not sure how instructive or informative they are to the average applicant.

BACKGROUND: I was a rising senior at a whatever state school majoring in Mathematics and Philosophy originally hoping to go to law school.  When I read about how miserable the legal profession is and how much of a crap-shoot it is, I decided to do something else.  After some research, I decided on software engineering.

STARTING OUT: I started out learning python, programming very simple games like hangman, tic-tac-toe, etc., the summer after my junior year. Programming these small games was a great way to get my feet wet and become more familiar with the basics.  

In retrospect, how you start out isn't that important.  You just need to get some experience, no matter how simple, under your belt.  That said, if you're technically inclined, I'd suggest starting out with java (or C/C++) since python takes care of so much for you and makes everything so easy.

COURSES: Course selection is extremely important and very underrated in this sub.  You need to ace the introductory courses to get a solid foundation in core computer science topics.

Avoid any and all theoretical classes: Theory of Comp., Computational Geometry, etc..  I gravitated to these classes because I felt comfortable doing proofs and abstract math but in my experience, they're just not worth it.  They're time-consuming and don't teach you a lot of things that will make you better at programming.

In a similar vein, avoid classes that are too low level.  I took Circuits and Digital Logic Design to fulfill graduation requirements.  These are even worse than the theoretical classes in my opinion because what you do in them is very far removed from any real programming.

Focus your time on classes that require a lot of programming and projects.  Don't shy away from a challenging programming-centric class or notoriously difficult classes - these classes are worth their weight in gold.

Finally, grades are not only a proxy for your understanding but are a useful, but not sufficient, part of your resume.  Every company I've interviewed at has made a remark about my high GPA. You have a lot of control over your grades and there's no reason to let that be a weak part of your application.

SIDE PROJECTS: These are important.  I didn't have a github portfolio, but you should probably make one.  Better yet, create a simple website that links to your resume and github.  I had two substantial side projects: A twitter bot that had extremely limited functionality and my own version of a bash shell. Both took under three weeks to complete. 

Side projects show that you care about programming and that you're competent enough to create something more involved than a class project.  Moreover, an absence of side projects can make you look lazy or unmotivated.

INTERNSHIPS: Internships are the most important thing on your resume.  There is no understating this.  When you don't have any experience, try applying to smaller companies and a lot of them.  Go to career fairs and apply to all of those companies.  Draft unique cover letters and put effort into those applications.  It's better to start small and work your way up than to shoot for Facebook and Amazon without any experience. Despite what people on this sub may say, these interviews are fairly hard to come by and without experience, you can't afford to be picky.

Once you have experience, opportunities are much easier to come by.  I had two internships that this sub would consider to be very mediocre.  One was at a tiny company and another was through the school I go to.  However, once I had those experiences, companies became substantially more interested in my candidacy. 

A very common tactic is to intern at a small company, then work for progressively better companies.  This is the strategy I employed and it paid substantial dividends. 

APPLICATIONS: For the love of God, don't apply to 1,600 or 800 or even 300 places. If you're applying to that many companies with limited success, you're doing something wrong.  Online portals, especially without experience, are an absolute black hole.  The response rates are abysmal and the application process is fairly time consuming.  Focus your energies elsewhere.  Network with professors, students in your class, family friends.  Focus on smaller companies and spend time crafting applications.  Go to career fairs and come prepared.

An application that you have by way of a referral, career fair, personal connection, etc. is worth 20 ""cold-call"" applications.  Spend time maximizing applications you know have a high chance of succeeding.  

After my first year, I shotgun blasted 100 applications and it was a gigantic waste of my time.  I had a &lt;3% response rate with a 3.9 GPA and side projects - but no experience. I ended up splitting my time between a company and research lab where I knew people who worked there.  This past fall I was much more discriminate with my time and applied to 20 places.  I got interviews at three of them.  TripAdvisor from a referral, FactSet from an career fair, and NASA from an online application.

INTERVIEW PREP: Ace your Data Structures and Algorithms course, then take another class on algorithms to really sure up your knowledge.  Regarding leetcode, unless you're shooting for Jane Street, Citadel etc., you don't need to be obsessive about leetcode.  You should be able to answer 50-75% of the leetcode mediums in &lt;30 minutes. That level of preparation got me through the final rounds of TripAdvisor, FactSet, and NASA and I'm not a genius.  Space out your interview prep over three months and it won't be that painful.

A second, less discussed part of interview prep, is to know things like private v. protected v. public, bitwise operations, stack v. heap, compiled v. interpreted. CTCI has a lot of these questions in chapter 14 or 15 and you can google these other questions.

Do not lie on or exaggerate your resume.  The cost benefit calculus isn't worth it.  If they ask you something you have on your resume that you can't answer, you're screwed. You look dishonest and incompetent. Moreover, you don't gain a whole lot from listing some language or technology you're barely or somewhat familiar with anyway.

I got an intern in well known telecom company in my country, as Oracle DBA, while I only have experience w/ SQL server.

Did some search, and read that Oracle databases are hardcore hard, compared to SQL server, and that Oracle is a database that has no future, it had in the past when SQL server wasn't so capable as Oracle was, but now, year after year, SQL server is on the top just like Oracle was and still is, but Oracle is becoming less and less choseen

My question is: is that true that Oracle will end up being less and less used, and isn't worth the effort of learning all the Oracle database differences compared to SQL server? Or is it false and Oracle is here, and wil stay here for a while?

I know the use of technology is never so linear, but I would like to have an ideia of how the market is for Oracle DBAs, and if as a Oracle DBA I could always change to any realtional database DBA in function of the company needs?

7wi8ul,2,2018-02-09,Former company getting sued. Should I cooperate?,InternInTrouble,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7wi8ul/former_company_getting_sued_should_i_cooperate/,"[USA] Throwaway of course. 

A super big company (hotmail) is suing my old company (remote IT company) for doing marketing computer virus removal to old people who had problems on their hotmail. We never had a formal contract with hotmail but we targeted their keywords like ""forgot hotmail password"". I was the marketing intern who then became the marketing specialist at this small company. I inherited most of the keyword targeting. I am afraid I can somehow personally get in trouble for the company business practices of up-sellling big computer repair subscriptions to the less-tech savvy subscribers.

I have since left the company and am doing something totally different. Some lady (investigation team lead) hit me up on linkedin asking for an interview and said I can have a lawyer present. She said if I don't help them things could be very difficult for me.

If I cooperate - 
Possible pros

-I tell my side of the story, they appreciate my input and leave me alone, saving me legal fees down the road

Possible cons

-They twist my words and make me sounds super guilty and want to sue me or worse jail me

-They could tell my old boss that I snitched and then he might sue me for something (falsely) like libel. Even if I can win, it would waste my time and money to defend.

I could also keep quiet (the linkedin lady has not seen if I read the message since I just opened it in my email notification) but they might subpoena me or sue me with their own twisted version of the story.

I talked to 2 of my new company lawyers and they said to just be quiet and not reply. I just worry that I could be able to help myself by cooperating with this civil suit request for info but don't wanna screw myself over. I started as the intern but ended as the ""Head of Marketing for North America"" of this small company and think they might want to come after me. Am I paranoid? What do you all think I should do?"

Should i include in resume,No22112345,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/7witek/refusing_a_job_at_a_place_where_i_interned_in/,"Hi. When I was 16 years old I accepted a full time paid summer internship working for local city government in one of their departments. I became very close with the lady who managed the internships. Point is I ended up doing the internship for an additional three summers including last summer when I was 16,17,18 and 19 because of her. I think she likes me a lot and would give me a good reference. I think she also wants to offer me a job out of college but i cant imagine having to work in that place. Would it be foolish to say no if she offers me a job? I hated working there as a teenager every summer?
I had the worst experience every single summer that I worked there. I kept accepting the internships because of pressure from my parents who thought it was a great opportunity. I also did a horrible job at the respective departments that I worked for because of teenage depression and miserableness. I almost got fired one time.
The lady in charge of the internships offered me one this summer and I said no. I just want to distance myself from that place where I spent four horrible summers. I feel like a high school screw up for ruining that internship four consecutive summers. Is it normal to have resentment towards the people who pressured me to work there every summer and towards the people who were mean and condescending at my work sites which were a couple?
Also I just want to distance myself from everyone in my hometown. Im transferring colleges later this year in an effort to start a life in a new place. I cant imagine coming back for that job. Should I include this place in my resume? What if the lady actually says negative things about me behind my back? she knows about my high school screwups but somehow still likes me because she sees ""potential"" in me.

Also she invited me over to her office because she wants to talk to me and see what Im up to but i cant bear going to her office or that building. I get nervous thinking about going to the building where I worked. What can i say to get out of going and ask to hangout in private?"

7wjahw,2,2018-02-09,Leaving company for graduate school. How to convey goals for my remaining time to my employer?,Eugenethemachine,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7wjahw/leaving_company_for_graduate_school_how_to_convey/,"During my college career, I ultimately decided that my passion lies in the more academic aspects of computer science. I enjoy studying formal logic, theory of programming languages, math, etc. I was on track to graduate in December 2017 (which I did), so I applied to CS Ph.D. programs in the fall. Since I was graduating in December, I figured I would start working in January. That way I could save up some money for ~8-9 months while waiting to hear back from graduate programs which wouldn't start until fall 2018. What ended up happening is that I was hired on as a Consultant (I'm basically a junior .Net developer despite this title) at a company that I had previously interned at in the summer of 2016. I reached out to this company because I really enjoyed my internship experience there. They have a relaxed culture and provided a lot of quality mentorship. Unfortunately, my full-time employee experience has not matched up with that of my internship, and I've found myself working on a government contract that is chock full of red tape and hassles with a team I don't fit in with well. I still enjoy my time at work when I'm working outside of this main team on internal projects with other employees, but the vast majority of my time is billed out to the gov't at this point. I have a pretty close and comfortable relationship with the president/founder, we can call him Pete, of this company as it is fairly small (&lt;50 employees) and he was very involved with me and the other interns during our stint there the summer before last. We get along well and I can see that he genuinely cares about his employees and believes that happy employees with solid engineering skills are the key to the company's success. I respect him a great deal and, although I'm unhappy with my current manager/team, I'm grateful to him for how well he treats me and that he hired me no-questions-asked when I asked for a job in the fall.

This morning I heard back from one of the universities I applied to, and I have been offered admission into their Ph.D. program (Hooray!). This is the first school I've heard back from, but I know that I definitely want to pursue a Ph.D, and there isn't a school I applied to that I wouldn't be happy to attend. So I know for sure that I will be going to graduate school in the fall no matter what because I've been accepted to at least one school. Pete seems to be working under the assumption that I will be there long-term despite the fact that I disclosed to him my plans for graduate school (with less certainty than I am conveying in this post, but I did tell him I applied and was strongly considering attending if accepted). Pete has moved forward with sponsoring me to get a security clearance so that I can do further contracting work and has spoken to me about the ""future"" in somewhat time insensitive terms. Now that I know I will be leaving in August (probably August...), I want to tell my employer. I have two goals in mind. Firstly, I want to be transparent because I appreciate when people are upfront about their intentions. Secondly, I want to be taken off of my current team and placed on a team where I can make some real contributions in the time that I have left to work. My current project has proven to move very slowly, and at a certain point, I will be impeded by my lack of a security clearance (which has taken some of my coworkers over a year to obtain). I want him to know that I want to maximize my value to him as an employee and maximize the experience I am gaining at the same time and that I think the best way forward is me moving to a different project. I know that the company is about to start a new internal engineering endeavor and that I was initially supposed to be part of this but that personnel changes were made. I think I could be a valuable contributor to this project because it is closely related to what I worked on during my internship, and I would enjoy my time working on it. In my mind, the move would be a win-win situation. 

What do you all think? Is it a bad idea to even bring up the fact that I'll be leaving? If I do decide to move forward here, what level of transparency do you think is appropriate? Is it worth it to try to play the situation as if I'm not going to be leaving so soon? Any thoughts and opinions are appreciated. Especially those of more senior engineers and management. Please feel free to ask for clarification about any parts of the post/sitiuation. Thanks!

TLDR: Working at company that I interned at previously. Have good relationship with president, bad relationship with team. Want to move teams. Will be going to grad school this fall. Should I tell president plans and ask to move teams?"

7wjips,320,2018-02-10,How I was asked to not come back to a particular client (FEELING WAS MUTUAL!),lesethx,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7wjips/how_i_was_asked_to_not_come_back_to_a_particular/,"After 5 years of desktop/helpdesk support, I have a few stories, mostly short, but I just remembered this one from my first year, which was a doozy.


Background, the company I until recently worked at provides various IT support for mostly smaller companies.  This one particular client is what we called (not sure if industry term) ""break-fix"" meaning they paid hourly rates for helpdesk or desktop support at a higher cost compared to regular clients.


So client company works in a Window environment with their own domain server at the time.  Employees are assigned computers while interns bring in their own, and there are no spares available ever (this is important later).  Policy is to bind interns' computers to the domain to give them greater access.  (This is years ago; we forced better security later on, I had no say in this, please dont hate me!)


Since interns are usually fresh out of college (or still in college), they tend to have either Macs or Windows Home edition and everytime we need to explain to client company that the interns need to upgrade to Windows Pro to join the domain (client: **grumble**, cost, **grumble**).


While not a client I liked (at all), things were fine until this intern whose Windows is not only Home, but in Korean.  One of their employees knew Korea, but we're in America, so everything else at client is English.  The intern wanted to comply or appease the client company so we had to get the laptop in English.  Ugh.


To speed it along, I spent a lot of time on this, but it was my first year or two, and despite getting some settings to be in English (to the point I could navigate the buttons by remembering where they are in English and the intern joking Im learning Korean), and attempting to download an English language pack, I learned the only option was to buy (client, **grumble**) Windows Ultimate to get English, due to Windows being cheaper in certain other languages and denying English.


For details I dont remember, this required a complete reformat of the computer (important for later) and even some hours with Microsoft support to get the laptop working correctly afterwards.  Eventually we get the laptop in English and able to join the domain, files transferred, everything cool, right?  No.  When it came time to reinstall MS Office, it turns out the key used was from the intern's former university and now no longer works.  So now client has to buy (client, **GRUMBLE!**) MS Office for the intern as well, but after many days, we finally get it working.


But there's more.


I think within minutes of finishing everything and checking with the client if there is anything else, the boss of this small client finds out how much more this cost compared to other interns and yells at me why we didnt just use the laptop of an employee who had recently left.  The fact that said employee was still working at client when I *started* helping intern and the laptop (which should have been held in reserve for at least a month) was only available for a couple days before I finished was completely lost on them.


And thus, cuz client company has interns provide their own laptops, most of which arent the correct version of Windows, and this one not in English, I was asked to never come back to this client.

**February 9, 2018**


They found me at the far end of The Forest, wandering aimlessly along the border of Allister Park and the suburban block behind it.  Some nice lady out in her backyard with her dog was nearly given a heart attack by the shocking sight of a bedraggled girl, bleeding and scraped and crying, covered in dirt and spilled soda and powdered concrete, stumbling around on the other side of the fence.  


I woke the next morning on a cot in a tiny white room.  For a split second, I basked in the afterglow of the best sleep of my life.  Then the events of the previous night crashed through the warm fog and I started to scream.  I was in a psychiatric hospital, somewhere in Silverlake, with a “way” and a “serene” in its name.  The hold was for 72 hours, but they kept me there for five days.  It took awhile for my body to re-acclimate to medication.  


The doctors and nurses were kind.  They helped me wade through the swampy mess of truth and hallucination and, by the time I spoke to the police on the sixth day, I was well enough in touch with reality to be adequately terrified of what was waiting for me outside the hospital walls.


But the detectives were understanding.  They told me, as gently as possible, that Luke Andersen was dead.  He’d bled out from two subdural hematomas: one from my blow with the shovel, the second incurred when his head slammed into the ground.  There was a nine-inch hunting knife beside him: his fingerprints on the handle, my blood smeared on the blade.  I told them he’d attacked me; they’d already come to the same conclusion themselves.  


There was a whole lot more.


Luke Andersen, before he’d met his unfortunate end, had been digging a large hole. Nestled in the dirt, the investigators found child-sized bones - a right arm, hand, fingers - and, though tests were still being run, they suspected the gruesome discovery was a piece of the late Micah Wall.  


A day later, their suspicions were confirmed.  The cops, then, shut down the rest of the park.  They’d looked for Micah in The Forest fifteen years before.  But the thick carpet of acorns and leaves and densely-packed trees complicated the search, and they’d anticipated a much bigger hole.  Now, though, they were better informed.  Micah’s murderer cut him into pieces, which he’d buried separately.


I told them everything I knew.  Luke’s forceful nature, Tommy’s suicide, the rooftop access to Atomic Videos.  They interviewed Alicia and my parents, who’d flown in from Paris on the red-eye.  


The fifteen-year-old mystery was, tentatively, put to rest.  Luke hadn’t played in Colonel Lewis’s yard with Tommy and me.  He’d gone straight from Math Field Day practice to Allister Park on that fateful Saturday; there, he’d texted Micah Wall, and the two boys met outside the little gate at the south end of he park.  They walked deep into the trees, where Luke murdered Micah then dismembered him.  Then he texted his friends - Tommy and me - to meet him in the park to play hide-and-seek, to give himself an alibi.  While we were seeking, he was hiding pieces of Micah.


His plan fell apart, though, when Tommy and I caught him burying the last piece under what we called The Daemon Tree.  So he’d lied to us, told us a monster killed Micah, insisted on it until we believed him.  Needing someone to pin his crime on, he snuck through the crawlspace above Atomic Videos late at night, utilizing the roof entrance he and Tommy and I had discovered months earlier, when we’d snuck into the Adults Only section.  There, he left Micah’s red sweater and inhaler.  


I was medicated.  Tommy was terrified into silence.  Kevin Gideon was blamed for Micah’s death, and the whole thing was buried.  As for motive - well, motive was hard to discern.  Luke was posthumously diagnosed as a sociopath, of course.  He’d been upset at Micah for ratting him out, getting him suspended, muddying his perfect academic record.  He’d had a crush on me, and thought my friendship with Micah was getting in the way.  Finally, his anger, his resentment, his genius IQ and his lack of a conscience came together in a horrifying display of premeditated violence.  


The conclusion I’d come to was equally senseless, and even more unsatisfying.  I remembered the look in Luke’s eyes as he’d come at me, the orange glow of pure murderous hate.  I remembered how he didn’t even flinch as he forced me against the tree trunk and put a knife to my throat - 12 hours after flirting with me at Starbucks.  He felt no remorse, sure.  But it was more than that.


I remembered his true crime novels, the stories he’d tell us about serial killers, his early interest in psychology.  The FBI internship.  His mother, empty-eyed and slack-jawed, cultivating bed sores with a tube through her neck.  Luke, brilliant and betrayed, was unsatisfied with the childish silent treatment we’d imposed on Micah.  He wanted more.  Luke wanted to see if he could get away with murder.  


For a decade and a half, he had.  Then I came home.  And all those memories I’d buried years before, spurred by the sights and sounds and smells of our youth, began fighting their way to the surface like the bagwurms through hard foam.  I talked about Micah too much.  I asked the wrong questions.  Luke knew, sooner or later, I would find my way back to The Daemon Tree and remember what I’d seen him do.  So he decided to go there first, dig up Micah’s bones, and discard the last scraps of his victim elsewhere.


*****


I couldn’t stay in the little house on Briar Rose Drive.  My parents rented a hotel room in Burbank; on August 1st, I moved into my studio apartment.  A month later, I started work at Bayside Montessori.  My new superiors were extremely understanding of my situation, reassured me that they didn’t think I was crazy, expressed sympathy at the trauma I had suffered, and insisted that, if I was having a bad day or needed to be accommodated in any way, they were more than willing.  


I’d expected more nightmares.  The bright-red bulk of the Great Bagwurm, the swarm of Droxies, the AntWalkers and their subhuman muttering, and the crawling, decomposing re-animation of Kevin Gideon provided more than sufficient fuel for terror, though I now knew they were all hallucinations.  And then, there was Luke. 


Luke, my best friend, the co-star of my shiny, sun kissed childhood adventures.  Luke, who made me feel calm and protected like no one else could.  The memory of his hands running over my body, the lingering taste of his tongue in my mouth.  Luke, the boy who’d murdered Micah.  He must have figured out I was schizophrenic before I did, then used my propensity for magical thinking against me when Tommy and I discovered his misdeeds.  Luke, the man I’d killed.  The mental task of reconciling all these incarnations of Luke Andersen was more horrifying than any fantastical bogeyman.  


But the nightmares didn’t come.  I stopped lucid-dreaming altogether.  And I think I know why - I’d completed the quest.  I’d found Micah.  And I’d slain The Daemon.  


I keep my old journal in a drawer.  After I was released from the hospital I’d paged through it with trembling hands, searching for Mathilde’s last message.  I found it.  But it only corroborated how delusional I’d become towards the end, because the handwriting is obviously mine.  


And, for all his lies and manipulation and sociopathy, Luke had been right about one thing.  I found a picture of Mathilde - the real Mathilde Koperski.  Andy, probably inspired by my Instagram message, posted a ton of old childhood photos.  Mathilde had long blonde hair and she did wear a lot of pink, but her face was different from the face that invaded my dreams.  Her cheeks were chubbier, her eyes deeper-set and closer together.  


I then flipped through some of my parents’ old pictures - Micah, Tommy, Luke and me, messing around in my backyard.  The face I’d attached to the Mathilde of my dreams was my own.  I’d had blue eyes as a kid that darkened to hazel.  I’d had freckles.  


The Mathilde who’d given me rhyming clues, guided me, and, in the end, saved my life was a little piece of my imagination, a clever avatar of my subconscious dispatched to my waking, disordered mind.  I miss her, a little.  I’d have liked to have dreamed about her again.  If only to thank her.  


I’m typing this at my desk.  I’m procrastinating, more than anything - I should be grading the multiplication worksheets stacked at my elbow.  


My life has been amazing since I left the Briar Rose house.  I have my own place, great friends and, at my new psychiatrist’s urging, I’ve been eating healthier and working out.  I’ve never looked or felt better.  I’m registered to take the GRE in March. 


I think I’m going to write a book based on The Quest of the Four Grand Adventurers.  Middle-school reading level.  It seems a waste to have all these stories in my head and do nothing with them.  And, while I’m definitely never going off my medication again, there are times when reality just doesn’t measure up to the contents of my head.  For those seven days - June 5th to 11th, 2017 - I was a fantasy heroine.  I outwitted dark creatures, scaled walls, mixed potions, and saved myself from a monster all too human.  Adulthood can’t quite compete with childhood fantasy.


But I guess I’ll have to make do with the memories.  


*****


I just wanted to take a moment to thank you all for reading and commenting and upvoting.  I’d always avoided Reddit because it’s supposed to be a swamp of trolls and neo-Nazis, but everyone I’ve encountered has been truly awesome.


Also, exciting news!  (Sort of.)  I’m going to visit the Briar Rose house one last time this Sunday.  


I haven’t been back since the events I described yesterday, and on Tuesday, the bulldozers are moving in.  So I thought I’d get one more look before it turns into a construction site.  A couple of you guys mentioned that pile of mail - I’m pretty sure my dad threw it out by now, but if it’s still there, I promise I’ll go through it. 


I don’t want to be scared of my childhood home, guys.  I want to remember Micah, and Tommy, and even Luke as they used to be when we were kids - happy, funny, seeing the world as thrilling and magical.


Anyways, I’ll write another update if I find anything interesting.

7wkzzj,3,2018-02-10,SOP review for an internship at IST Austria,Anirudh25,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/7wkzzj/sop_review_for_an_internship_at_ist_austria/,"Hello, redditors. I am an undergraduate student who will be applying for an extremely competitive internship at IST Austria. This is the first time that I am writing my statement of purpose. I would love to hear constructive feedback from everyone regarding the same.

SOP for IST Austria

I am applying as an intern at the Lampert Group for Computer Vision and Machine Learning at IST Austria. 
	
Computer Vision is a sub-field of Artificial intelligence and can answer the question: “Can computers see?” Solving computer vision can be thought as an important prescursor to the crucial question, raised by Alan Turing, “Can Computers think?”
	 
Being aware that the best way to learn about any field is to start working on it, I decided to take up a project on Machine Learning. My journey as a Machine learning newbie began with this project. After some thorough searching, I thought about solving the problem of classification on unbalanced datasets. It is difficult to implement classification algorithms on these datasets as there is a danger of overlapping of classes. Solving this problem led me to this paper on Mahalanobis Data-Oversampling. It uses Mahalanobis distance as a metric to measure the covariance in place of the the euclidean distance. It also made me realise the importance of machine learning in solving real life problems like detection of anomalies, fraud detection in banking transactions, etc.

Success in this project led me to another project on an interesting problem. I took up a project on the problem of audio classification. Substantial work had been done on a similar problem of image classification. Here, deep learning and convolutional neural networks succeeded where traditional techniques had previously failed. Some of these networks even passed human classifiers in accuracy. Audio classification brought with it a different set of interesting challenges. SVMs and deep convolutional networks continued to dominate the scene here too. 
	
Initially, I solved a simpler single label classification problem on the Google Audioset. Taking cue from the results obtained, I tried solving a similar problem for multiple-labels. During this, I learned about many multi-label classification algorithms and also about the various problems in multi-label classification. This also gave me the required exposure to a variety of problems like incorrect labelling, computationally expensive applications, etc. This also cleared my brain of misconceptions about having a lucky breakthrough in science. The goal of research is not to publish but to make an impact to the field. It is important to fail in research and learn from the failures. It also helped me on my journey from a machine learning newbie to a machine learning enthusiast.

During my work on the audio classification problem, my professor recommended me to use Zernike descriptors for the project. Studying about Zernike desciptors helped me cultivate a different approach towards my problem and introduced me to Image Processing. Zernike moments help in giving an invariant transform of images and play a big role in Computer Vision too. Learning more about Zernike descriptors led me to study their applications in 3D object retrieval and other fields like bioonformatics too. I also became aware of the interesting problems in Computer vision like learning from continuous data. One of the most important work to solve this problem is being performed at IST Austria.
	
In my whole journey, I realised the importance of having an excellent peer group and teachers. Lampert Group has been involved in solving some of the most intriguing and difficult problems of computer vision. Working there will help me learn from some of the most esteemed professors in this field and also help me progress in my journey from a machine learning enthusiast to a machine learning student.

My current job is 50% software development (parsing data, doing basic analysis on it, a lot of back-end stuff) and 50% business intelligence (creating dashboards, sql querying, KPI monitoring). My job was supposed to include a lot of machine learning but it's taking time since it's a huge company and new projects need to get approved by many higher-ups. I have been applying to other jobs because it seems to be the fastest way to move up the ladder and get salary bumps.

I am sure I will get more offers within the next month or two, but right now I have two offers:

1 - operations research job at a big company. 40% jump in salary. It is half business, half analyst. I would be applying very basic statistics and 'lightweight' machine learning to internal employee logs to determine how much time and money each internal application saves the company.

2 - machine learning 3 month intern at a startup company. 20% cut in salary. Analyzing tastes, building some sort of recommender system, clustering customers. 

For me, the operations research would be a no-brainer. But I feel like it is moving me away from data science, whereas my other option is 100% machine learning, albeit in a small company. I know there is no right answer, but if you guys were in my position, which would you choose?"

I'm currently a senior in high school with 5.5 years of coding experience and has been accepted to one of the top engineering schools in the world (MIT/Stanford-Level). I've been working as an engineering intern for the past year at a local tech startup, and they've offered me the option to defer acceptance for a year and work there full time until I go to college. The starting salary is 55k a year for a full software engineering position (the COO made it very clear I am not going to be treated like a junior engineer) in the Washington DC Metro area (one of the highest COL areas in the country). 

Do I take it? Negotiate? I'm definitely not doing it for the pay (as an intern I got paid half of what I could have made babysitting), but at the same time I just want to be compensated fairly for my time. I can hold my own against many of the engineers there, have placed at the largest collegiate hackathon in the world (twice), and the reason they've offered me the full time position is so I can bring the product we've been working on to market- I've had that much of an impact there. For further clarification, I am a full stack engineer with a strong background in machine learning, and my github/personal projects reflect that. I've never been interested in computer science for the money, but I don't want to look back 5 years from now and wish I'd said something. The company is phenomenal- I am extremely humbled and appreciative that they would even consider offering this. I would mainly be doing this for the experience it would provide, and already put in a full-time employee's hours while still in high school.

Any advice would be extremely appreciated. Thanks so much!

7wmrfn,6,2018-02-10,Called the cops on my dad. What happens next? Illinois,Needhelp633,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7wmrfn/called_the_cops_on_my_dad_what_happens_next/,"Background: My dad isn't a good person. He's a drunk and a generally abusive father. My mom killed herself a few years ago, and I haven't heard from my older brother in years. He beat or yelled at the three of us pretty regularly.

I've put up with it for years, but finally had enough last night, and I called the cops from a neighbors' house. They arrested him, and I left his house and went home.

The thing is, he's a very successful man. Makes lots of money, involved in local events, etc, so I doubt he'll actually go to jail. I don't need him anymore- I'm a senior in college, my tuition is paid, I have an internship that may lead to a full tin job when I graduate.

I also have a part time job that he doesn't know about. I've been saving money for months, because I knew I needed to break away from him, and he's always controlled everyone with money. 

Question: 

What happens now? I got the number of a Domestic Violence Victims Advocate, but they only work M-F.  

What do I do now? Do I have to go to court?

My aunt bailed him out this morning, and he's been sending me pretty horrible messages. Some are threatening, and some are claiming that I owe him money, and that he can sue for slander, and ""ruin"" me. Is there any way he can sue me for the money he spent on my tuition? I don't think so, but I want to check. As for slander, he got arrested, and I took pictures of my bloody nose and the bruises on my arm. 

Do I need a lawyer?  I don't have any student loans yet, so I can handle a few thousand if I need to get a lawyer.

Can I get a restraining order? One of the cops was kinda a dick and just said that I needed to ""work this out"" with him, but they did arrest him because I was bleeding and he was screaming at me.

My aunt has also been blowing up my phone, but I can just ignore her.

I only went home this weekend to get some clothes and stuff. After he was arrested, I cleaned out all of my stuff in that house that I want. I'd like to never see him again- how can I do that? I didn't take any of his stuff, just clothes.

Sorry if this is rambling. I don't really know what to do now.

7wmzqd,3,2018-02-10,Dealing with Grad School and still living at home,llamacita_,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/7wmzqd/dealing_with_grad_school_and_still_living_at_home/,"So I'm almost finished with my 2-year graduate program, I graduate in May and am just in the home stretch, but living at home is driving me mad. I'm saving money and with where I live, I'd have to live with about 5 roommates to be able to afford a place as New York State is a pretty expensive place to live. So I've been living at home, which is good in a way. My mom offered it up and it just seemed to work. I appreciate that I'm able to save money and every now and then my mom makes me a home-cooked meal. The whole time I've been living at home I've been working at least part-time, if not full time, going to class full-time and maintaining an internship. So I work about 15 hours a week, intern 14 hours a week, have classes for 8 hours a week and have to devote at least an extra 10 or so a week to studying and my online classes. I manage to have a social life and try and see friends at least once a week and also help with watching my younger sister. I think I'm a decent contribution to the household. As it's just three of us, it's easy for me to grocery shop for us, do laundry, etc.

However, I often feel like my mother doesn't take me or my work seriously. I try and spend some family time with my mom and sister every day, even if it's just eating a meal or watching a TV program. But suddenly when I retreat to my room to do school work, it's an issue. My mom often will pester me about when I'll be done, if I'm still working or if I'm working. She's prioritizing me spending time with the family over my school work despite the fact, I personally believe I spend a lot of time with the family. More than most grad students that I know. God forbid I want to just watch Netflix in my room alone, it's a whole thing about how I don't want to spend time with the family.

Grad school luckily hasn't been too difficult for me. I get good grades, I'm really active in societies and clubs within my program. I've known my faculty and have a few offering me help with the job search. I told my mom recently I don't plan on living in the area much longer. It's very expensive for an entry-level professional to live alone and there isn't a huge demand for my line of work here. Ever since I revealed this, I think my mom's behavior has intensified. 

I appreciate all my mom has done for me but I'm trying to gain independence and she simply won't help me. She relies on guilt and constantly makes me feel bad about myself as if I'm not successful. She complains about how I don't contribute to the household but I do and is always saying how she doesn't think I can make it in the real world.

What is some advice you might have so I can make it through these next few months? My goal is to hopefully be settled in a serious job by next January the latest, but ideally, I'd like to be out of here anywhere in the July-September time frame. Is anyone in the same boat? If so, how have you been coping?"
7wmzqr,3,2018-02-10,ADD in office jobs: coping tools/resources?,widgetswidget,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/7wmzqr/add_in_office_jobs_coping_toolsresources/,"**Tl;dr** A few years ago, I found out as an adult I have Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). It’s not the hyperactive kind, although I’m very peppy, it’s the highly distracted kind. I’m wondering if there are tools for coping and succeeding in an office career, and making it to management someday, despite the common drawbacks of ADD. Any books, groups, or resource suggestions?

**About me:** I’m 30. As a kid through adulthood, I developed coping mechanisms before my diagnosis: I did fairly well in school then college, got good grades, and found ways to study. I talked out of turn and too much, procrastinated, and daydreamed a lot, but I compensated for my shortcomings by networking, working three times as long on homework, and excelled while holding down multiple jobs and internships at one time. I was working in an office job for three years when I finally got health insurance. I was getting in trouble at work for being “unprofessional” and with all my symptoms a doctor diagnosed me with ADD. I have rx for Adderall and Prozac to even me out and help me focus. But it doesn’t neutralize the ADD, simply makes it more manageable.

**My job now:** I have a highly competitive job, with good pay and benefits. I work in an office job in a large (1000+ employees), hierarchical company. I’m mid rank on my team of 6, 3 positions from the bottom, 3 positions from the top. Typically, recruitments produce 300+ applicants, so I know how lucky I am to have my job.

**The issue:** Because of the competition, there are often dirty office politics, cliques, and power struggles. I manage to stay out and play the game pretty well, but lately I’ve been getting in trouble for: talking too much, too loud, interrupting, making funny faces in meetings (daydreaming or not reacting to news the appropriate way), my inability to read social cues at times and making people uncomfortable (a trait of ADD), missing deadlines, not working on things I don’t want to, making spelling/grammar errors (a real no-no when writing letters to customers or the company’s vice president). I’m in an executive corporate environment, and I’ve made it to this level because I’m highly intelligent, thorough, analytical, and demonstrate leadership traits and skills. Because of the dirty politics, there are several people who were hired by their friend (the vice president and the chief financial officer) in competition with me who have at least 6 years less experience than me and are threatened by my aptitude, knowledge, experience, and charm (thankfully, there’s one redeeming quality of ADD).

**Future outlook:** I definitely wont be with this company forever, but I haven’t been here for over a year yet, so I’m staying until it looks ok on my resume. Until then I can use this as a playground for improving myself. I’ve begun to wonder, can someone with ADD can survive in middle management? I don’t want to own or run a business. I just want to keep working and excelling so that I can have financial independence. My goal is to have a $120k income someday in change management, communications/marketing, or project management. 

**I’ve read:** “Emotional Intelligence 2.0” “7 Habits of Highly Effective People”, “Switch”, “You are a Badass”, “How Successful People Think”, “Five Levels of Leadership,” “Crucial Conversations,” and “the First 90 Days.”

**Resources:** I’ve read all the dumb Buzzfeed and LinkedIn articles searchable on google. Is there anyone else out there with this issue? Do you find support groups help? Books? Lists? How do you improve and manage?

Background: Graduating in May with Manufacturing Engineering degree. Starting grad school in August (geared toward STEM majors with less than 18 months experience) and have been applying to both entry-level and internship positions for the Summer.

Am I wasting my time applying for some of these internships that have ""sophomore or junior in college"" in the description?

Obviously I'd like to secure a solid internship before grad school, especially since I'll have a degree at the time.

Do I email companies and let them know my situation or will they just tell me to apply on the career website and get rejected by an ATS anyway?

I've only applied to 18 jobs/internships so far, and have only gotten 2 rejection emails in return.

My fear is that I'll be ""overqualified"" for a traditional internship but ""time-restricted"" for an entry-level position due to it being temporary for the Summer.

Someone else has to have had this experience before..."
7wn3y5,12,2018-02-10,About to graduate: help!,teechevy703,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7wn3y5/about_to_graduate_help/,"Hi!

So I’m a senior in Informatics with a minor in Business (my major consists of basically lots of basic IT, database, SAP, and an emphasis on business process management, SCRUM, etc). Despite the fact that I’m not really interested in any of that, I mainly did it because at my school this is the easiest, least programming intensive, degree in the computer science program. 

My real passion, however, is network engineering. I’ve been a network team intern at my company for two years now and do essentially CCNA/some CCNP level work day in and day out. Additionally, I have extensive knowledge of Windows DHCP and DNS, as well as Active Directory, and various other things that I have to touch in my position. I’m very much a jack of all trades. 

Although I have no network related certifications at the moment, I’m hoping to sit for my CCNA in about two weeks just to finally knock it out since I’ve been putting it off for the longest. My history with networking/sysadmin goes back way further, however, with my middle school where I first learned how to run cable and became the Linux Lab admin in 8th grade when our sysadmin faculty member left (small school, they were desperate for a replacement but too cheap). Also built a small network for my parents’ company when I was about 14 and have been upgrading it ever since then whenever I have a little extra money (cloud APs, better switches, better core routers, an IP PBX with SIP, etc).

ANYWAY: I love what I do. And I love the company for which I work. The issue is that with my impending graduation, there has been talk that my department may not get approved to hire me full time. From what I have seen in the current industry, it appears that many companies our size (not huge; about 4700 employees/160 sites) are outsourcing the work that my team does to MSPs, and keeping only Tier 1 help desk in house. For those of you who are more in touch with the industry, are my assumptions correct? My biggest thing is that I really don’t want to work for an MSP. I’d much rather work in an in-house IT department, helping users, rather than working for an MSP helping “customers” and having to view everything through the lens of billable hours. Fortunately, due to the nature of our company, we have both: in-house engineers to do site surveys, order equipment, and physically build out a site, as well as an MSP to handle the foot work of “new site; need to order a 10 meg DIA circuit” or “this site is down, better call ATT/Cox/etc.” But with the rapid rise of cloud computing/MPLS in the cloud/cloud VOIP/etc, should I just suck it up and try to come to terms with the fact that I may need to start applying to MSPs? What are my options here? And aside from my specific questions, is there any other advice you seasoned IT folk can give me? I’m 21 now. Been doing this stuff since I was about 11 or 12. So not quite wet behind the ears anymore, but still an adolescent I’d say lol. 

Sorry for the novel. My anxiety is starting to rise a bit - three months to go :)"

I am a third year undergraduate student studying biochemistry and genetics who is proficient in a few coding  languages. I am currently doing research in a molecular biology lab focusing on the basic mechanisms of breast carcinogenesis. This will be my second year doing research with my PI. 

I've been looking at some internships at a few R&amp;D biotech companies. They are not in-state because I can't seem to find any that offer internships for summer. Maybe I am looking in the wrong places. I'm graduating in spring 2019 and for some reason I am afraid I won't find a decent job to pay off my debt; perhaps this is a normal feeling. I think the stereotype that life science majors are ""useless"" and ""unemployable"" is getting to me. I live in Texas and I can't seem to be finding any internships that are local. So I am considering to just continue working in her lab. On the same token, I feel like I would be leaving her in the ruts as she did open her doors to me at a time when the lab was low on funds and mentored me to be as experienced as I am today. She used resources on me to get experience. The internships would only be during the summer and I would join the lab again but summer is when I get the most progress done. I also plan to writing a thesis in the Fall/Spring of next year as well as a poster I want to present at a symposium the semester I graduate.

I will feel bad as I know most PIs (Idk if mine thinks this way) don't like the feeling of training people, only for them to leave. I don't think she would react in such way as I know she tries to be the best mentor she possibly can be.

I want to do wet lab stuff and only utilize my software and coding skills as a tool to enhance what I'm doing, rather than the other way around.

I will pursue graduate school but only when I think it's needed to raise the ceiling for myself, but first, I would like to work somewhere that well.

I'm planning to apply to large biotech companies for summer internships such as biomarin.

I'm not sure what I should do. Has anyone else has this type of experience? Is it even practical to move across the country for the summer to work 3 months and then go back? Is my fear irrational? Would having more time dedicated to one thing (being in lab) be more beneficial than having multiple experiences but not enough depth?

I'm not sure what to do."

I am 31, and I am about halfway through working towards a BS in Computer Science. I have been working for the past 10 years in 2 different jobs that basically amount to retail management. This was wearing on me quite a bit which is what spurred me to make the jump into school a couple years ago to work towards a career that I feel will be much more fulfilling and rewarding.  


My question is basically this - am I screwed on work history? I look at CS job postings and see many that still require multiple years of work experience in certain applications or languages, even as entry level jobs. Unfortunately I am in a financial situation where I cannot leave my current pay scale in order to take any types of low/unpaid internship type positions. I'd be interested to hear anyone who has similar experience, or just general advice from those of you in the industry.  


I am in the Houston, TX area, and for jobs paying less than $60-70k I would probably need to stay here or perhaps the Austin market. Higher paying jobs would certainly open my mind towards relocating, with the right cost of living.  


Thanks for any input you can provide!"

One of these “privileged programmers” was hired to take the load off us senior devs, and now we have to keep doing our shitty taks while they rejoice on the newest projects?

1. **No name school with solid co-op program:** I've lurked enough on this SubReddit to understand prestige isn't everything. I'm considering schools like Carleton University (relatively unknown Canadian school) that offer co-op terms, alternating between academic and work terms. Subsidized pay by the government and work terms during winter and spring instead of summer (less competition) will make internships a lot easier to come by. This will allow me to graduate with nearly two years of work experience.

2. **Somewhat prestigious school, CS major:** A school like UBC or UCSD (I'm out of state for UCSD so tuition will be pricey). There is a co-op program for UBC, but it's not guaranteed and there aren't many work terms.

3. **Prestigious school, not CS major:** I'm fairly confident I can get into CMU and Waterloo—except not as a CS major. Of course, CS at these top schools is darn near impossible to get into. At CMU, I have a good shot at getting into statistics, and at Waterloo, I can get into the math program (with co-op).

Dear Recruiting Representative,

Since I saw your online ad in request for an intern, I became increasingly interested in your group and its exposure to many different outlets of marketing. I was especially impressed by the digital aspect of marketing displayed on your brand [brand]. Its elegant and modern style intrigued me and I hope that you would allow me to join in its making as student intern.

I am currently a high school junior who is highly interested in marketing and its uses in the digital world. In fact, I plan to spend this summer, and maybe even the majority of my senior year, delving deeper into the marketing field to gain more experience and insight before officially deciding on this major for my college career. 

Over the past few years, I have actively participated in many volunteer and club activities. From volunteering at the Aquarium of [name] to producing our school’s Yearbook, I was able to hone my abilities to engage with guests of all ages in a courteous and professional manner. In the Aquarium of [name], I was able to learn the subtle changes in diction and mannerisms when speaking to people of different ages. While in Yearbook, I learned to adhere to the guests wishes when designing senior ads and manage my staff as the Underclassmen Editor.

Although I understand that I am still inexperienced as a high school student, I am committed to the work I do. I am motivated and I am not afraid to do challenging or repetitive work. I feel that I have the maturity and reliability it takes to intern as part of your group and I hope that you will give me the chance to prove my dedication at your workplace.

Please contact me at my email [email] or call me at [number] and I will respond as soon as possible. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and I look forward to your responses.

Sincerely,
[name]"

Or stay in my current job, keep making minimum wage (~$1,400 net/month), and try finding an internship during the summer? This option keeps me on track to graduating on time.

I should add that both jobs are part time positions. I have a friend recommending me for the position so it is likely I'll land the position."

Long time lurker and it seems like there’s some good points and views brought up here. So I have a question regarding my next moves.

I’m a recent graduate (‘17) from a small state school in finance and entrepreneurship 3.0 gpa so nothing special but I had a lot of leadership and extra curricular programs (one portfolio management program my senior year which I lead). I also did a year long internship with Northwestern Mutual and had mild success (not enough to pursue it - most likely).

I kinda shot myself in the foot by traveling as soon as I graduated as I felt really burnt out from all the extra courses, organizations, studying (tried the CFA L1 exam right after graduated and failed..twice - again in December). 

Starting my own business has always been my goal and I’ve had a strong interest in investing which is why I added finance to my degree also thinking that future jobs might help me make a little extra to save to start something one day. For the past year my goal was to get some sort of analyst or financial position where I could work with/analyse small to mid size companies to get a better understanding of the dynamics for when I went for my own venture.

However, over the past few months I’ve applied to a ton of equity research, boutique IBs and analyst positions and haven’t gotten any interviews and only one response saying their hiring window was over. Even after following up with phone calls. I’m well aware of the competitiveness of these positions and knew it was a long shot but I am very self confident of myself and thought all I need is to get in front of some of these guys for a fighting chance and whether it works out or not that’s all I need.

HERE’S the question (sorry for the length). I currently work for a large financial company (famous for indexed funds) just processing paperwork that comes in, found out I just barely failed L1 again (could not of been closer) and haven’t gotten a single interview for a new gig. Since I’m not totally set on finance and maybe not even qualified I’m highly considering getting my English teaching certification and going abroad for a year or two to travel and teach in various places mixing a school setting with private lessons with business professionals (for some sales experience).

How would this decision impact my career upon returning if I must go back to a desk job? I plan to keep a very active blog that I’ve been working on as we speak that ranges from travel, to books I read, to financial topics covering various investments I’m making. I want to have this blog just to function as a living resume showing I’m active with continuing education and not just going through my days with my thumb in my ass. I’m not expecting anything more from it.

After a break like this would it be possible to pick back up ish where I left off and be able to progress to a solid role in finance or consulting? "

I've always had much more interest in Biology and Physics, and only didn't study these because I didn't know if I could find a job with them. I recently learned about computational sciences, and this sounds very interesting to me. 


I have several questions:


1. What are the career prospects like for computational science? It looks like the demand is growing but that the actual # of jobs is pretty small.

2. What is the best way to contact professors or find out about grad school programs?

3. Related to 2, how could I find a mentor or at least get info from someone in the field?

4. What are some good schools to look into with decent programs?

5. I don't have a great GPA, and probably worse, I have zero research experience. What are some ways I could make myself more desirable for graduate programs?"

- Single.
- Have general secondary-education with C1 level in overall English language.
- Soon about to enroll in IELTS Courses to study for IELTS exam.
- Currently on 3rd year in Finance Bachelor's degree. Have a diploma course with a certificate for ""Academy of Young Physicians"", because of previous family dedication to pursue Medicine.

- Highly self-motivated knowledge gained in computer infrastructures and familiarity with computer kind of language knowledge( Visual Basic, Lua, REST, Javascript )
- Ease of use with complementary programs like Microsoft SPSS, Power BI, IBM Watson Analytics Professional, Microsoft (all products), optional with most Adobe products (Photoshop, Premiere, After Effects, Illustrator), FL Studio, Cinema 4D, VST's, etc. Basically everything that you can get your hands on in computers.

- Have had internship in AML/CTF field.

Studies in US are without doubt expensive, so the cheaper the better, family will support me &amp; if applicable will search for a job or options for scholarship. I have read alot about ITAR regulations and  pretty confused to understand if I even have chances but read few posts that it still might be possible.

I'm not really interested in a software engineering role anymore so my plan is to secure some type of QA internship for the summer. However I don't even know if these companies are offering QA positions as my school simply lists the company as ""recruiting for CS.""

Am I just suppose to ask them if they have any available and tell them that's what I'm interested in? I'm scared to look like I didn't do any research or that I'm just looking for any old job. 

Also since my resume is pretty much just coding projects I've done, do I need a cover letter explaining that I'm looking for a QA role? My resume probably makes me look like I'm looking for a dev role but unfortunately I don't have anything else at this point."

This sounds like the best chance I've had to start working on my field since I finished school. 

But there are several things I need to take on consideration; last month I quit my job at the call center because it made me miserable and the long hours and weird schedules made it impossible for me to do a proper job hunt or even make it to the interviews, I'm desperate for an opportunity on my field and I'm willing to work just for the experience or a recommendation but I also need the money (I can only afford to stay unemployed for 1 or 2 more months maybe). 

We're talking about a construction company that's just starting so I'm pretty sure I won't be offered any kind of compensation or even any internship kind of contract if I don't proactively ask for these things; on the other hand I don't want to look desperate or that I'm just doing it for the job position I haven't been offered. 

Good thing is I have certain level of familiarity with this guy since he's been my older brother's friends for years; but I dont know how to let him know even though I'm much more interested in the experience than a paycheck, unfortunately I still need money and I still need to make a living. Or if I should even mention all that. I just don't know how to go about it and I'd really appreciate your insights

Should I just keep looking for jobs or should I seize the opportunity to gain some experience even though I can't really afford it? "

This is the only company I've worked at (other than internships).

Should I be organizing my work experience section by position, by the team I was working on, or just lump it all together?

By position:

Company X

  * Senior Engineer
    * Team 2 - all the stuff I did here
  * Junior Engineer
    * Team 2 - all the stuff I did here
    * Team 1 - all the stuff I did here
  * Intern

By Team:

Company X

  * Team 2 (Senior Engineer 2016 - present, Junior engineer 2015-2016)
    * all the stuff I did on that
  * Team 1 (Junior Engineer 2014-2015)
    * all the stuff I did on that
  * Intern Team (Intern 2013)
    * all the stuff I did on that

The first one (by position) is a little bit messy because one team's work is split across two sections, but it also highlights career mobility. The section one is more organized but I'm not sure it would look worse.

Any suggestions for how to handle this?"

**Nationality:** Swedish

**Education:** Master in Finance and Business Administration. Did exchange studies in Denver, CO.

**professional:** Business development, had 2 finance internships, accounting, worked for international companies.

**Skills:** I'm on a professional level in the MS suite, like excel and stuff. I know a fair bit of web dev and I know how to code in Python (mostly for analysis purposes). I have strong analytical skills. 

**other:** I also run a side business in the web-dev space and make some small dollars. I could, however, scale this up and put more time into it to increase the income.

**Language:** Swedish and English.

**Budget:**  It is not very limited as we could easily save for another year or so to meet any requirements. But $15,000 to $20,000 seems fair.

**status:** Unmarried, but got a gf who also wants to go abroad. She's a mechanical engineer and a bit younger. 


**Where I'm looking to go, in order of interest:**

* USA
* Australia
* Canada (I've seen and scrolled through the guide in the sidebar)
* NZ (also seen the guide in the sidebar)
* We've talked about Asia as we both love the culture and people. We've been to Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia but I can't seem to find how to find qualified work for a westerner (without being sent from a corporation with a presence here).

So far we've been looking at a H1B visa for the US, but it is a nightmare. Not giving up though and here is the plan so far: Go to the US for a holiday, look for and apply to jobs, hope to get interviews, go home and apply for a visa, go back to work (!! SIMPLIFIED VERSION :) !!).

Now the second choice is a mid tier college, LMD programme (3 years Bsc, + 2 years for master) the thing is it's not very known and it doesn't have connection with the big local companies etc etc, the good thing about it is that i can study in there and work on some side projects (ie: AI / Music Theory, since its not strict enough ) and tbh i hate college and the classic studying method , i'm more of a self-taught guy, the downside is no job is guaranteed after graduation (IT, Software engineer, Web Dev) and i'm also really interested in AI and deep learning (both schools don't offer it), basically i can't decide what to chose, I've been thinking about it for months and yet no solution, so i'd like to know your personal opinion deer redditors

Realizing this, I have put in my two weeks for one of my jobs to give back at least a little more time. 

The question: I'd like to replace my remaining part time job with one that could teach me more about CS and still help me pay bills. I'd like to hear other perspectives from anyone who has experience in the field about what they did or what I could do to make this happen. 

Thanks! "

Recently, I tentatively accepted a research internship with a professor who is part of the engineering department. I wanted to gain experience so I could be more ready for the internship hunt next fall and the research internship actually pays decently as well.

However, prior to this, I shotgunned my resume to a ton of companies. Just yesterday I received an email containing the next steps for interviewing with a pretty cool company. I have to solidify my decision for the research internship by tomorrow, and I’ve already asked for extensions. Should I take the risk by declining the research gig and diving into the interview process for the company? 

I know research positions are less appealing when applying to industry but I also have no idea if I can do well enough in the company interviews to land a position. Am I shooting myself in the foot if I choose to stick with the research position, which also actually incorporates a decent amount of ML and programming? 

I’d prefer not to renege on the professor if possible. What would y’all recommend I do?"

I really need some helpful advice since my family and friends have not been very helpful at all.  
It's gonna be a long post so thank you in advance for all the people who took time out of their busy lives to help me out :)

I failed out of my MSCS at a top ranked school around 8 months ago and haven't been able to find a job since. The closest I've been was a final interview at a company in September where the director said everything looks good, just for me to be rejected a week later. I've all but given up the past 4 months and have went through a lot of things but now finally got all my distractions and problems in my life in order. I'm also finally consistently working on my projects and some courses on Swift and Python to get some more skills. I'm ready to get my career and life back on track.

I went through alot of ups and downs during my MS program. I failed 2 classes my first semester, then rebounded for 2 semesters and then failed another one the year after. I had work, family issues, very bad relationship issues, depression, lack of self-confidence, etc. At the end of the day, these are all just excuses and I should've just did my job but that's in the past now. 

The graduate department and director gave me many chances that culminated in one final one; I was to take only 1 class in the Spring 2017 semester and get a B+ to satisfy my core B- GPA requirement. I fell a few points short on the final and ended up with a B. My overall GPA was also a little under the 3.0 requirement but that would've changed the semester after. I have 5 courses left, plus 1 more retake of a core course to satisfy the B- core GPA requirement to graduate.

My current goals are to reapply to an MS program (ideally be accepted to the same school) and find a job and work while finishing that degree. I'm also working on completing a few side projects and studying for white board interviewing. I currently have a few unpaid internship offers for the summer at small startups in another country but I don't know if I should do it even though I could use the experience. I was wondering if reapplying is a good plan, I have until March 1st to submit my application to the same school. For recommendations: I have a former boss at an unpaid developer job, a professor at this very school and a professor from a fellowship I did abroad. I want to apply to more programs but many have already past their deadlines; what programs do you guys recommend on the east coast that I have a chance of getting into that still haven't passed their deadline? I would prefer NYC but beggars can't be choosers lol. 

I have already fixed my resume after getting some advice on the resume thread on this subreddit a few months ago. I also didn't put as much effort as I could've when applying to jobs but I am now with no luck. I really just need advice on where to go next and what to focus my energy on. "

What should I do?",vanella_Gorella,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7x3dw7/i_graduate_in_may_2018_with_a_degree_in_mis_i/,"Hello all!

Like the title says I graduate in May.  For the past year I have had an internship at a company near my university.  I have learned much in regards to project management, networking, system imaging, and problem solving.  I feel incredibly blessed for this opportunity.  It is a small IT department, me and two others, so it has been extremely immersive.  My boss  talked to me and said that the owner he reports to said that there is a two-year offer for me.  The only stipulation is, it is while I am getting my masters degree.  The reasoning is, it is a smaller company (large for what they do and has an incredible presence in the two states they operate in), they are moving buildings this year, expanding operations, and have other large projects they need help on.  This position would come with greater access, taking over certain things, start writing reports and queries, phone and computer standardization, and keeping asphalt plants online.  It being entry level, he said money would $19 an hour. I love working there as an intern, they have taken care of me, and allowed me flexibility for school and other things that have popped up.

Now for the details that are preventing me from taking this.  The stipulation that I have to be acquiring my masters isn't a shock.  I have told them I was planning on getting my masters a month or so after I got hired. 

I do not want to get my masters at the university I am at.  This program has been a joke. They have made strides to make it better, and I have had some classes that have helped me, but most of the classes are either taught by people who have no idea what they are teaching, or they assigned a 3 page paper due every week on a different topic.  Much of the classes count as both the grad level and undergrad level due to lack of teachers and people in the program.  There is another school that I can attend (I am 3 hours away from this school and have family who are IT professionals who I can live with and/or learn from) that seems to be much better just based off school information, and the few people I know who graduated from the program.  WGU is also a possibility (I know there are some people who do not like the idea of this, as far as I know it is accredited).  It would allow me to accept the job I am currently at, get a masters degree, and also work on other skills and certifications. 

I've done self-teaching, online courses, and I am currently pursuing my Network+ certification.  I've come to the reality I have to take it upon myself to learn most of the things I need to know and not rely on my schooling for much other than a degree.  

TLDR: I'm graduating soon, have an offer, but they require me in my masters program for it.  Need advice what to do.  I have a couple different educational options I could choose from"
7x3g0z,285,2018-02-12,Bouncing back from cheating on my CS degree (serious),71tt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7x3g0z/bouncing_back_from_cheating_on_my_cs_degree/,"I graduated in 2016 with a BSCS degree from a top 25 CS school (in the USA). During my 4 year CS degree, I cheated my entire way through the degree. I copied most of my work from people's github who had taken the courses in previous semesters and I would run their solutions against the open source automated cheating detection tool that my school used. I'd make modifications to the programs and submit them. For electives, I took the easiest possible elective courses that had no relevance at all in industry in order to get easy As and minimize workload. For exams obviously there was no way to cheat and not get caught, but luckily I am a decent crammer and I would often beat the curve so I'd end up with As and Bs in my CS classes, and I ultimately ended up with a 3.4 GPA. 

Since I graduated I somehow got a job as a test engineer. I basically write tests at a ""intro to programming"" level that almost anyone could do with just a basic intro CS course. 

Why did I do this? It was a combination of laziness, lying to myself, and mental disability (diagnosed by doctors, not any of that self-diagnosis stuff). However, since college I have come a long way and I lie to myself a lot less and my mental disabilities are mostly gone, after some prescription drugs and therapy. I am still lazy but definitely less lazy than before.

At this point I am 24 years old and I have a total of 0 internships under my belt and one full time test engineer position that I have held since July of 2016. I live with my parents so I have been saving a substantial amount of my paycheck every two weeks.

I am wondering what you guys would recommend to do in order to bounce back and find a job in software development. I was very passionate about pursuing a CS degree while in high school before I was very lazy and had mental health issues, and recently I've reignited my passion for the field. I haven't taken any courses in security, databases, networking, or some of the other important CS disciplines, so I would like to learn those if possible. Currently all I really know how to do is write very basic tests in C++. I've applied to graduate school this year (MSCS) at several schools and I am waiting to hear back soon. I've also considered bootcamps and quitting my job since I have enough money saved up to pay for the bootcamp and support myself. I also know literally nothing about web development, machine learning, or data science, all of which seem to be ""hot"" industry buzzwords recently.

I'd love to hear any tips you guys have. Thanks in advance for the advice."

I'm currently doing a career flip from the mechanical engineering route and I'm going towards computer science, meaning I'm back in school to get a com sci degree (this is my first year in school as a comsci major). Although I enjoyed everything as an engineer (physics, materials, mechanical systems, etc.), I honestly don't see myself happy doing this for the rest of my life. In comparison CS is a field I grew a deep and thorough interest in throughout the past few years as it deals with problem solving, logic, algorithmic thinking, and theories within CS. I also enjoy the creative side of programming too; I enjoy having full control of the programs I create and the fact that there is multiple ways to program one thing - and although not a single one is necessarily ""wrong"" or ""right"" there's satisfaction with creating attractive code that works the way you want. 

With that in mind, what's a good way to start my career aside from learning different languages and university? (i.e. summer internships for beginners anywhere within CONUS or programming competitions) What communities can I join to network within the world of computer science? So far, the languages I know sufficiently, but not on an expert level quite yet, are C and C++ and I excel in mathematics - with understanding that the degree plan is math intensive, of course. Also, I don't have a set focus area yet - especially since I'm fresh in the game - but I am interested in software development, engineering, and theoretical computer science. If it helps knowing, this is a path I'm determined on staying on whether or not it'll be extremely difficult for someone transitioning into it. If it takes time, then I have the patience.

It has been 4 weeks and we're just getting down looping. I know everyone is at different levels so we go slow. And I don't mean that to say, ""Oh, look at me. I know more than others"". 


But I'm thinking... I could probably be much farther ahead if I was learning on my own. There are plenty of resources for me to use online. CS lectures online, free math sources, openstax textbooks, etc.

This chemistry class is a ton of fucking work. Sure I like science, but I feel like I'm dedicating like 60% of my study/homework time to chemistry. Instead of programming and CS.

So my question is, is there something really important you get out of finishing with a bachelors in computer science?

Because I'm honestly considering taking more hours at work, learning on my own, and I know a guy who can get me an internship. In addition, I'd save a shit ton of money in the process.

Read the Schooling FAQ, and am still not really sure. I've realized it about a year too late that I want switch my major to CS, or at least pursue something in CS as a career. I'm a junior in Marketing in Florida, which means Excess Hours are a thing (2x the cost of tuition after 4.5 years basically). I've been going to hackathons and have found the whole thing way too fun. I used to tinker in web dev as a kid, so I feel pretty confident in my liking it overall.

I've heard of good prospects in the CS industry when you're rigorously self-taught and have a passionate portfolio to follow, but I worry about:

- What if no one takes me seriously because I'm a girl and I'm trying to get into CS with a Marketing degree? I can see the whole ""oh this girl thinks CS is a joke, applying for CS internships with a Marketing degree"" conversation happening way too easily when looking at my resumes or something, and my career never kicks off.

- If I do manage to get jobs, I can also see the ""oh you majored in Marketing in undergrad? You must not know shit about discrete structures/algorithms/computer architecture. lol pleb. bow down to us theoretical masters who actually know how to program."" either happening subconsciously in other's minds or out loud in front of me way too easily.

Maybe I just need some major mindset changes, need the balls to push through others' doubts of me, or to just suck it up and change my major in order to give myself the courage and belief in myself that I deserve to be in CS.

It makes me really distraught. I wish I could just switch easily, but it will add 2 years to my degree and quite a bit of debt. I'd probably jump from $18K at grad now to ~$30-40K if I do this switch.

If everyone has to prove themselves for the rest of their lives in CS/careers in general, let me know so I'm not jaded into thinking I'm alone here.

Junior student here. I'll be done with all of CS Major coursework by this semester, and I have more coursework than average at this point due to IB transfer credits. I can choose between graduating early by taking another semester at my school, or complete all of my remaining electives through online offerings part-time.

By completing my courses part-time and online, I'm able to do additional Fall and Winter internships while focusing on coursework in the downtime between internships. I'd graduate on normal time in this case, and be able to participate in the standard Uni recruiting season. I have two internships from a big n (but not what people would consider the most prestigious few) and a good but not top-tier mature startup (e.g. Yelp). I've also done nearly 200 leetcode problems/practice peer interviews over the past few months as prep.

Alternatively, I can graduate a semester early without additional internships. The upside to this would be graduating with a minor, likely in Statistics and possibly opening future paths in data science. I'm reasonably confident in being able to land a good/top company following this route, but it would still be riskier than doing two more internships.

I originally picked C++ because I'm interested in game design, and also because I misunderstood how much of it would transfer over to mobile app design. I'm nearly finished with the lessons on learncpp.com, and am done with the book Beginning C++ Through Game Programming, and feel I have a good grasp of everything taught in both (listed at bottom of post). I also have Bjarne Stroustrup's book, Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++, which, while thorough, has not worked nearly as well for me as the other two sources.

I work much better with a goal in mind. Even if that goal ends up getting moved or changed, I think it could be good for me to have a milestone to work towards. In addition, my current job has nothing to do with programming, and is absolutely dead-end. I would love to start accruing job experience in the industry, even if that means working low-wage or even an internship while holding down my current job, but I have little concept of what I need to learn in order to be useful to an employer. 

So I guess what I'm asking is, what should I work towards? You can answer that in whatever form you like, whether it be a job I should look into and start comparing myself to the requirements of, or a list of C++ concepts you feel I should learn and practice if I expect to be employed, or a case for what language I should move towards next. I'm seeing experience with C is commonly required alongside any listing asking for C++; should I maybe take a break from C++ and learn C since it will help with C++ and objective-C? C# also seems to be required alongside C++, which confuses me, as I don't understand them to be very similar; do they just pair well?


Some of the concepts I've covered so far:

* Object relationships/derived classes
* References/Pointers
* Dynamic memory allocation/smart pointers
* Multi-dimensional arrays
* Container classes (mostly std::vector)
* Iterators
* Exceptions
* Function templates
* Template classes (I hate'em)

Edit: I should add that while I haven't been to college, in high school, I took two years of algebra, a year of geometry and a year of trigonometry, and have a natural gift and love for math.

Many are pointing out that C++ alone isn't a great resume; I'm willing to learn another language, especially if parts will carry over or the languages work together.

I am developing projects as I learn to practice; thank you for reminding me that these could be part of my portfolio someday, I'll have to keep that in mind from now on."

I've heard that internships are the best way to go and I've found a few available ones in my area relating to IT during the summer. I'd like to know if it would be wise to apply for these since they do ask that applicants are students currently in college pursuing a related degree. Currently the only thing that I have to somewhat match that is that I'm pursuing an AS in CS and will complete that at the same time when I graduate from high school and after high school I'm pursuing a BS in CIS. Would I be considered for the internship since I'm a minor and my situation is a bit different from other applicants? Any experience I can gain I would love to get, even if it's an just interview to learn what to expect later for IT interviews. Thank you for your time."

Currently finishing up the last semester of undergrad CS coursework and applying to the MS program at my University this semester. 

I'm in the process of hunting for an internship: doing several applications a day, reaching out to my network, etc (all the advice I see on here). I'm worried, however, because I'm just now getting into studying for technical interviews (using CTCI and Programming Interviews Exposed), and it's obvious that it's just going to take awhile to get up to speed. This sucks, and it's worrying me, but I only got into this about a year and a half ago and have to remind myself it takes time.

 So, I'm probably underprepared to get an internship and want to plan for the worst in case nothing comes up. Also my University isn't very highly ranked so the jobs aren't coming to campus like they might other places. As far as I see it I can: 

* Take the summer and intensely focus on interview prep in order to try and score an internship for next summer or some kind of co-op 
* Ask around my university and see if there are any research opportunities available over the summer
* Take a temp accounting job to earn some scratch while studying on the side

Just really interested in your guys' thoughts. Like I said, hoping (and working) toward the best outcome, but planning for the worst.  "

I'm at a point in my career where I have the opportunity to go down two very different paths, data science or traditional engineering, and I'm trying to evaluate my competitiveness in the data science field.

I know I'm lacking a lot of the more sophisticated skills like machine learning and advanced visualization, and I'm actively working on doing project work in those areas. What I've got going for me is several years as an internship and contractor as a data analyst, a good deal of database experience, some experience in Java and Python, as well as a master's program that has non-trivial coursework in statistics and decision theory.

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/z5QZj) is my resume that I've made to highlight myself as a data scientist candidate. Based on that resume, am I modestly competitive for data science internships? Or should I shoot for a more senior data analyst position first and then work my way up as I build the skills I need. Please excuse that the resume is a bit ugly looking, I'm seeing a resume review service this week for that.

I currently work at a factory. Job pays decent(not bad but not the greatest) but I really want to do something with my degree. Without getting into too much detail, I have a degree in the specific type of business that this business is. I have been complimented on my work output and work ethic many times by several managers. 

I've asked HR about job opportunities with the company outside of the factory because of my degree which is related to the business type. All they say is keep applying even if you think you're not qualified, apply for every role you would like. I am not having any luck. In the time that I have been there I have received two emails after jobs were filled, recruiter asked for my interests. I replied and never got an answer, several months later, here we are, still nothing.

This is getting very frustrating. I have proven to my managers that I am a great employee. However, I cannot land anything. Recruiters will not give me the time of day for INTERNSHIPS or entry-level jobs alike. I am not aiming at management positions or high paying jobs, I am just aiming at entry-level jobs some of which don't even ask for college degrees. I thought maybe I should apply for internships so that I qualify for those entry-level jobs later but same result, nothing.

I have been receiving occasional job offers from outside the company, some of them in management. I'm about ready to call it quits here and just going back to what I know, I can't keep passing on these job offers in hopes that some recruiter will one day notice me. Been staying the course because I wanted to work for this company and do something with my bachelor's but their inconsideration, especially from recruiters is very frustrating.

If you guys can give me some advice if you've been in a similar situation or you have advice on how to get noticed by hiring managers and recruiters from your same company, that would be great.

1. After the 30 - 45 min phone interview, how many more phases are there and of what type (video interview, in person with 4 engineers, etc)

2. Do they ask conceptual questions or do they ask you to implement something from beginning to end? How would that even work with a phone interview?

3. Any info on your experience, how you did on the interview, etc

Got questions about C/Matlab (arrays, matrix multipication, log implementation pseucode, floating point vs. fixed point), RF engineering (amplifier cascade, effective temperature, noise figure, intermodulation distortion, gain compression), MIMO, modulation schemes (QAM), antennas (power patterns and measurement, EIRP), multi-path fading, Doppler shifts, etc"

Graduated a mid-tier, top-40 university in June '17. 6 months internship experience from college.

For some context - When I accepted the offer in July '17, I was told that we are a Venture Capital firm. It wasn't until a month or so later that I found out that we are not a VC, nor do we even have any funds under management. We are an Investment Banking firm.

2 employees have joined since I began in July, but one quit within a month and the other quit within 3 months. We are a 3-man operation currently, and I am the only one who is here every day; the Principal and Managing Partner are here for roughly 30 hours M-F. 

My title is Financial Analyst, but the position is entirely sales-based, and I am not doing any of the work I was told that I would in the job posting, interview, employment agreement, etc. My duties are simply researching potential client firms and investors, getting their emails, and trying to get them to work with us. 

To top it all off, our Principal (the only FINRA-licensed individual) is actively resume-spamming and seeking other opportunities, and our affiliated broker-dealer informed us this afternoon that we are being cut off, meaning we have to find a new one and re-negotiate all current client agreements, likely at unfavorable terms.

Obviously, this is not an ideal situation. Had I known what I know now, or even what I knew in the first few weeks, I would never have taken this position. 

So what am I supposed to say to recruiters when I apply? I am often asked why I am switching jobs so soon, and I simply say there are questions related to the solvency of the firm and that I have to leave it at that. Should I quit? Is it okay to quit, and if so, what do I tell prospective employers? I am not disloyal, I work hard, I just want to get out ahead of our firm potentially going under for a myriad of reasons. 

My apologies if this is not the proper forum for this conversation; I am unsure where to go to ask these questions. Thank you all very much for your time &amp; assistance with this matter - I appreciate it.

I have all the classes that I need to graduate except a foreign language credit that I can take during the summer to get my degree. However, I am still looking for a job and don't have any leads right now.  

Background:
Senior
3.1 GPA at a top 50 Public University
Operations Internship with a Pharma giant- Summer 2016
Commercial Real Estate internship- Summer 2017

I want to get into Commercial Real Estate development (really enjoyed my internship) or the Real Estate sector of Banking. 

My question essentially is should I continue job hunting as it is and possibly land a good job with the chance of not finding anything for a while? Or should I try and get a really good internship this summer, take some classes to boost my GPA in the fall, and then also start reapplying in the fall with hopes of landing a good entry level job in the field.  I'm also pretty confident that I can land a good Commercial Real Estate internship this summer in a large market based on my experience.  

I wouldn't be considering this if my GPA weren't this low, I didn't have another class to take, and if I wasn't struggling finding the right job for me. 

I would really appreciate any advice. "
7xeb2c,3,2018-02-13,"Struggling with the job hunt, low confidence, unsure on how to be better",killergut,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7xeb2c/struggling_with_the_job_hunt_low_confidence/,"So I just graduated with a Bachelor's Computer Science degree and a Minor in Mathematics from University of Florida. Sadly I can't say I was the most proactive person so I don't have an internship under my belt, I'm not good with selling myself. I'm currently trying to find a job but I'm having a hard time, there's just a lot of pressure everywhere, my family, their friends, and just in general I'm kind of lost of what I should be doing.
In general I honestly know nothing about my self worth as a programmer, especially since I have no internships or anything to back it up. I've always had trouble making myself just coming up with ideas to write a program for, I know people always say ""come up with a personal project"" but I always struggle to come up with one. I'm not good with coming up with the idea for one, but if someone tells me what project I should make I can always do it and work hard towards it. This also reflects in my class choices, I always just picked classes that would force me to work on projects all the time, especially group projects and I can say I was practically working on projects for every class for the past year and a half. I always tried to work hard on those because I felt that that's where I really shined, once I had the goal in mind and the project destination in my hands I could just go at it nonstop until I completed it. 
But now that I graduated I'm trying to find something to work on, but coming up with a personal project myself is impossible and I'm trying to look into getting into Open Source since that seems easier for someone like me. There's also been a lot of pressure about pay, I live in Florida and every programmer has pretty much told me that Florida is a garbage place for a programmer, everyone around me is also stressing the salary really hard and I'm stressing about it. I understand where they're coming from though, they're mentioning that if I take a low salary now, it'll be hard to get payed more later, especially reaching 6 figures will be difficult if I take some crappy job in Miami for 50K. I'm garbage at negotiating since whenever someone calls me the first thing out of their mouth is ""How much money are you looking to make?"", before I even know what the job entails or what I'll be doing. So I always end up saying a low-ball figure below the average in the state to make myself look more appealing. I did get a lot of flak for this though, and no one in my family wants me to work in this state, they all say I should go to New York/Texas or anywhere else that will offer a higher base salary. But honestly I'm just worried that no one will take me, I feel like I'm just trash in general with no aim and nothing to show for myself and I can't negotiate. I know some of my own strengths, at least I think I know them? I'm relentless when I have a goal, nothing can stop me, aka if I had a job I know I'd be great at it because someone will tell me what they want a program for, no need for me to come up with the idea for it. I'm really good at teaching myself, basically what I had to do for all my classes since I never liked attending lectures, and in general I'm good with learning new technologies quickly. Yaddy yada, I have a good head on my shoulders but I can be a bit lazy sometimes especially if I don't have a solid goal, and I also lost some of the knowledge needed for programming, such as data structures and algorithms because I haven't needed to use them for any of the projects I've done for my classes.

So I guess less whining and here are some things I'm trying to do to get better.
Reading Cracking the Coding Interview, I'm working through it and will be trying to do it all with C# with .NET because everyone has stressed me that C++ isn't really going to cut it, so I'm trying to learn .NET. 
There are also a lot of paths to take in programming so I'm struggling with what to choose, honestly I'm just trying to get anything that will be good enough so I can hopefully get some experience and get some confidence. I'm also trying to find an OpenSource project having to do with .NET to expose myself. Also applying to places over Monster, Dice, Glassdoor, LinkedIn.

So what can you guys suggest that I can do to find my self-worth? I feel like my lack of knowledge in data structures and algorithms is making me feel down, so I'm trying to refocus on those, also moving away from C++ and moving to .NET and I also want to pick up SQL. So I basically feel like I have nothing, I don't know if I'm worth anything as a programmer really, since all I have were my school assignments (one of which I worked in a group with a real client), and those all went well, but for the most part I don't think any recruiter cares about them. I also don't even know how good I am at solving problems outside of those school projects, should I be trying to do HackerRank challenges? I also don't know how I should go about learning .NET and SQL. I know there are some open source .NET projects out there but should I really be jumping into that so fast, or try to do some tutorials? Should I just go ahead and do some ASP.NET tutorials or just look purely for a .NET/C# tutorial? Same thing for SQL, I would like to have the ability to learn it better and be able to incorporate it into something, because all I've worked with so far is MongoDB and FireBase, just simple querying for a website. So should I go and do a separate SQL tutorial first or try to look for something that does both .NET and SQL at the same time? I feel like I'm just spreading myself thin here and it makes me look less desirable since I've spread myself pretty wide and don't have too much depth. Is there also other books I should be reading to try to improve?

I'm also looking into how I can be better at presenting myself. I've had heavy suggestions to take a bootcamp in the area to learn how to negotiate with recruiters, such as when to talk about the salary etc because I've been making the mistake of always saying what I was expecting but low balling, etc. 

Also, here's a list of what I've done in classes in the past year and a half:


Trying to learn .NET and SQL now :/ (this is me now out of school)


Everything below is school stuff


Made a website with a partner in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, I mostly worked on JavaScript backend and some HTML

Made a game in a group in Unity 2D with C# with some game AI techniques

Took an AI class and wrote some programs for it in Python

Took a class about penetration testing, so worked with some pen test tools such as Metasploit

Made a Android App with a group using Android Studio

Made a program that has several encryption/decryption methods in C++ in a group

Took a networking class, so worked on some basic TCP/UDP connections, handshakes etc

Made a 3D audio project with a group HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Worked on expanding features of an existing website for a client (Issle.org), the website wasn't originally made 
well, we only added onto it, so don't shoot me if you see that's the loading times are god awful. 

A long time before that took one database class so foggy memories of SQL.

I basically listed the more important things that I found valuable, or at least didn't hate...

Now I feel bad for trying to put emphasis on doing my projects through school, because everyone wants to know what I did ""for myself"", but instead I sunk all my time into those projects instead.

At least putting all this in writing made me feel a little less down, I'd welcome any suggestions or advice you guys might have. Thank you very much and sorry for the wall of text.

This is my first time posting, please pardon my formatting.

Background, I work for a University. Our IT team is a very small shop, help desk has one full-time staff and 2 student interns. I am part of the networking team, but since help desk is short staffed I tend to help out when needed or when the student interns ask for help. I was also part of the help desk, but moved up.

$Intern: help desk student intern (recently hired)

$PhD: clueless faculty with a PhD (she also has this hate relationship with IT)

$Me = myself

Our $Intern picks up the phone call from $PhD.
    
   &gt; $PhD: I put my wireless solar keyboard under the light to charge, but its not working.

$PhD has a Logitech K750 Wireless Solar Keyboard.

The $Intern goes down to try and fix the problem. The $Intern comes back and ask $Me for help with this issue. Since I knew where $PhD office is, I knew that there was no direct sunlight to charge her wireless solar keyboard. $Intern went back to $PhD's office and got the keyboard. 

Once $Intern got back, $Intern and $Me went to the roof where it was nice and sunny. We left the wireless solar keyboard in the sunlight for 45 minutes to charge.

After 45 minutes, $Intern and $Me went back to the roof to retrieve the wireless solar keyboard. $Intern brought the solar keyboard to $PhD. Wireless solar keyboard synced to the USB receiver, and worked like a charm.

I guess $PhD assumed that leaving the wireless solar keyboard out by her window with no sunlight would have charged the batteries. It's a good lesson, that it's not like the solar powered calculators everyone used back in the K-12 school days. Those wireless solar keyboards are like the PV systems, where you need sunlight to generate electricity."

Education: BS in Computer Science from California university, will graduate next year

Language: English (fluent in technical areas, some slang she still doesn't get), Arabic, Spanish (B1/B2)

Relationship status: With 22 yo American BF (""John"") of 2 years (studying Physics from same university), but want to get married ASAP (like tomorrow) because of concerns from her parents about being ""pure"" and stupid shit

Visa Status: on F1 visa currently.

Background spiel:
Mary and John love each other very much yada yada yada... they want to be together forever (lol).  If Mary goes back to Saudi Arabia, she will most likely be forced to marry someone else and she does not want that.  Even with Saudi's supposed reforms that have recently been announced she is skeptical of making her home in a country that treats women like slaves (her words not mine).   Mary belongs to a Saudi middle class family and John belongs to an upper middle class family who he is NC with due to manipulative and narcissistic behavior.  

Mary has been working on some projects mainly using C, C#, Perl, Java.  In addition she has knowledge of MySql, Perl, Ruby.

Questions:  
1) Is it illegal for Mary to get married on F1 visa?

 
2) Does Mary then request a adjustment from DHS for change of status to green card?  Does John apply for her?  They're both students right now so only source of income for John is basically his part time job which pays $12 per hour and student scholarships/grants.  He has about $5000 in his savings account and another $2000 in his checking account.  


3)  What is a good resource for specifically this situation, that is going from F1 to applying for green card? 


4) Mary does not work yet, but is actively building a portfolio of her work.  She wants to get an internship but is not sure whether to apply because of this situation with green card.   What are the waiting times for green card or should she just apply under OPT? 

EDIT: They have been clearly thinking about marriage for some time, obviously they don't have money for some fancy wedding.

EDIT 2: She does not have her birth certificate.  She only has a Saudi Passport and Saudi National ID card. 

EDIT 3: Would scholarship money be considered income for John?  If so John has some pretty hefty scholarships...
            Also they have numerous evidence of their relationship, including photos, video (Mary just informed she has a sex tape.  Make of that what you will), class schedules that can prove they meet regularly, witnesses who are prepared to testify they are in a relationship, etc.  Also she has not left the country in the last 90 days.  Other items that may be of interest include John's tax return, Mary's tax return (0 income from working).  "

So my main concern is summer coming along and I have no work in my related field(CS). So should I expand to entry level positions, or get a bit more courageous for the internships I apply too.  "

7xgbjd,4,2018-02-14,Who to choose for letters of recommendation?,angelusfanatic,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/7xgbjd/who_to_choose_for_letters_of_recommendation/,"How do you narrow down who to choose to ask for letters of recommendation?
I know some people have a hard time coming up with 3, but I have several people who I know would all write great letters for me. I made great connections with professors during undergrad. 2 professors specifically said they would write me a letter if needed, before I even asked. 2 other professors said to let them know if I ever needed anything. All have been incredibly supportive and I know all of my professors would write great letters!
I majored in English and minored in Sociology.
3 of them are English Professors.
I took 3 classes with one. Two classes with another. And one class with the last one.
The fourth professor is a sociology professor, I took two classes with and he supervised my Independent Study.

I'm going to be applying for Grad School programs that are MPAs, MPPs, And MPA/JD joint programs. Just depending on the school.

I'm also working currently at a coffee shop and interning at a Non Profit.
I'm wondering if maybe I should even limit my letters to 2 academic ones and have a supervisor at my internship write the 3rd letter for me.

Any guidance on choosing who to ask is appreciated.

Am I allowed to just ask for letters and then read them all and then choose the best ones to send off? I feel like the letters are usually supposed to be sent directly from the person.

Also, I definitely can't just include a ton of letters right? Like they'd probably hate me and dismiss me for violating the rules if I just loaded up all the letters of recs I could?"

7xgou6,2,2018-02-14,"My life is spiralling down and I can’t help it. Every time I think I’m doing well, it gets worse.",wakagi,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/7xgou6/my_life_is_spiralling_down_and_i_cant_help_it/,"Three months ago I thought life was going well. I had completed a long internship in UK, had a great friend group, and an SO. A had a lined up job offer and was leaving the country for a few weeks to get my longterm work visa. So I leave my flat with one suitcase and go to my “home country” that I’ve never lived in before. Just happened so that my family had moved back there for a few months as well. Everything is great. I get to visit my family and do some remote work. Fast forward a couple of weeks, I hear the company I was going to work for has been refused my sponsorship certificate for an unknown reason. I get nervous and upset. But they appeal the decision and reapply. I’m trying to stay positive. 

Fast forward to Christmas. I get told that their application was rejected a second time. They will let me work remotely for another month and that will be it. So I lost my job. I tell myself, OK. Whatever. I’ll find another job. I visit SO for Christmas(we were in LDR) have a good time, come home and start looking for jobs. I call my landlord and tell him I’ll be coming in Feb to empty my room. (Because remember, I’m still paying full rent all this time.) I go and apply for a visitor’s visa, so can pick up my shit and say bye to all my friends. 

Come the end of the month, I have my “last day at work”.  The next day, my boyfriend of 3 years tells me on the phone that he doesn’t love me anymore, doesn’t want to see me and dumps me. I am devastated. I spend a day crying, but I gather myself and move on. I begin working on myself to get past the breakup, tell myself that losing everything I had is a chance at a new life. I workout, I read books, I keep job hunting. I buy my ticket to UK. My best friend says she will buy a plane ticket too and visit me while I’m there. I think OK. Good. I’ll have the chance to see friends, party a little, get things off my mind. 

Well, yesterday, I went to pick up my passport from the UK visa center and guess what I find out? My application-the one that had a 500 dollar non-refundable fee- has been REJECTED. The officer didn’t even give a real reason for rejection. Somehow they simply “didn’t believe that I was going for a visit”. I explicitly stated I was going back to pick up my stuff! I had more than enough money in my bank account! I could’ve done coke everyday and still would’ve had more than enough money! WTF?! So now I have to somehow empty my flat while being abroad! I don’t get to even see my friends anymore! I hardly got myself out of bed today. There is nothing I can cheer myself up with anymore. I just want to take a bunch of sleeping pills and never wake up again. 

Tl;dr I lost my job. Lost my boyfriend. And now I’m not allowed allowed to visit the country I spent my last 5 years in. Can’t even pick up my shit from my flat. Stuck in a place I abhor. FML

Well, half a hypothetical since the first part is true. I got into NEU with 22k. Assuming I get into Michigan, I probably won’t get anything since I’m OOS. Is it still worth it? My major is CS. I feel like Michigan is much more prestigious and the name carries a lot more weight when it comes to getting internships and jobs. I know your school doesn’t matter a ton for CS, but it still helps, right? Also Michigan seems like a better environment with a better campus and the kids seem more well-rounded than NEU. All that being said, it’s still a $15k difference all things considered.

My family can afford to pay for both, but obviously my parents aren’t thrilled at the idea of paying an extra $60k in the long run and I don’t blame them. My question is, should I try to convince them that Michigan is a better choice, or is there really not much of a difference?"

7xk0gf,201,2018-02-14,TIFU by flirting with a customer.,o-shiri,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7xk0gf/tifu_by_flirting_with_a_customer/,"So this all happened three years ago, when I was in my final year of college when I was about to finish my mandatory 5 month full-time internship at a traveling agency. I really enjoyed working there and they had already promised me an actual job there as soon as I would graduate. Since I was nearing the end of my internship and I had learned a lot about how to deal with customers and complaints, my boss decided to let me manage all the incoming e-mails. 

I should mention that I live in Europe and at the time when I was just 18, I really wanted to travel the world and I'd always wanted to live the American dream. I had daydreams about meeting an American guy online and me flying there and living happily ever after. Also, just like how Americans usually find a British accent attractive, I'd always had a thing for your generic everyday ''American accent''. So you could imagine how I felt when one day, I got an e-mail from an American guy that went something like this:

''Hello, could you please take my e-mail address out of your mailing list? I keep receiving these (my language) e-mails and they just remind me of when I used to date a girl from (my country), who then proceeded to throw my heart in a blender and hit puree. I would prefer it if you would stop reminding me of her.''

Me being the creep that I was, I looked up his e-mail address in our customer information file and I could see exactly when he was in my country and at which hotel he stayed. I felt really bad for the guy, and since his stay was long before I started working there and he was already back in the States, I figured I could make a throwaway e-mail address with a fake name and try to console him. I basically wrote something like ''hi, I don't know if you remember me cause you were pretty drunk when we met, but you told me to e-mail you because you didn't have a (my country) phone number and I only just saw the memo in my phone, silly me! xoxo (generic name) ''

By the way, I had decided to wait a couple of days before sending him this, just because I was afraid that he would put 2 and 2 together. He seemed to not remember me, obviously, and thought my story was pretty weird, obviously (in hindsight). However, he got curious and continued to talk to me just to figure out who I was. He started to question me less and less, and at some point we even started Skyping and basically talking all day every day. I eventually told him my real name, and told him I gave him a fake name because I hate my real name. Weeks (and lots of naked pictures sent back and forth) go by and I finish my internship with a perfect grade, and I decide to treat myself to a 4 day-trip to a big city about 5 hours away from me. This was the first time that I ever went to another country by myself, and to feel less lonely I was basically talking to him through my headphones the entire time when I was just walking about the city. I'd gotten really comfortable with him, in fact, a little too comfortable.

As I was walking about and looking at the architecture, he told me that he'd never met an 18-year old that was so into this stuff before (he was 27). I told him that I love traveling and that when I come back, I was gonna be working at the place where I did my internship. Up until that point I had always avoided talking about my studies and my internship, but I figured that we were so close that I could just tell him. After all, if I was gonna be with this guy for real I didn't want the whole thing to be based on a lie. So I came clean. And he got really fucking mad.

He felt like I basically contacted him because I pitied him for being dumped, and accused me of just talking to him to get a green card. He knew that I had my laptop with me and he told me to go back to my hotel room immediately and do all sorts of sexual stuff for him on cam, and if I didn't, he would send my nudes to my boss and tell her that I took his private information and used it for personal purposes. Obviously, if he did this I would not be able to work there and I couldn't really call the police cause we lived in 2 different countries. Also, they probably wouldn't help me cause it was kind of my own fault. So I went to my room and did everything he told me, pretty much during the entirety of my stay, completely ruining my vacation. When I got home, I couldn't do it anymore and I just told him I didn't care if he told my boss, I was still gonna be in college for 6 months anyways and I figured I'd just get a different job. I didn't think he would actually do it, but he did.

Not even an hour later, I get a very angry call, not from my boss but from my teacher. Apparently my boss had called him and withdrew my positive grade for my internship because I did something ''completely and utterly unprofessional and unacceptable''. This meant that I had failed that year, but since my internship crossed from the 3rd into the 4th year, this technically meant that I had failed both those years and if I wanted to continue to study there I would have to move 2 years back (if this makes sense, I'm really bad at explaining this shit). I was already dealing with depression and a lot of stuff was going on with my life, and I didn't really feel like showing my face around those teachers anymore, so I decided to just drop out. This led me into a spiral of starting an education, not being interested because it's just not the same as the thing I loved doing most, dropping out, trying something else again and dropping out again. Now, 3 years later, I once again enrolled at that same college to study the same thing. I have a lot of the same teachers, but now we can kind of laugh about it and just say that I was young and dumb. I did waste 6 years of my life though (3 years of initally studying there and then 3 years of starting something new and dropping out again). Oops.

TLDR; I interned at a traveling agency, hit up a guy who sent us an e-mail through my private account because I was a filthy Americanophile, he then figured out how I got his e-mail address and leaked my nudes to my boss which got me to drop out of college when I was about to graduate. "

The only problem being that it is 6 months long, and considering the details of my offer, I would need to take a break from school for at least a semester. As someone who is still learning how to code - my first experience with CS and coding came in college - I am unsure if I am currently even qualified for a job of this intensity. I personally am really grateful for this opportunity, but I am unsure if I am ready for it, both technically and psychologically. However, at the same time, it seems like a waste to miss this opportunity. Any advices?

Edit: So I heard back from my potential employers, and they said the internship could possibly split into 3 months during summer break and the other as CPT during school year. But, I would be unable to take any classes considering it will be full time commitment."

I want to further my career in this direction and have done a bit of research.

I want to work with

2. Automation
3. Cyber Security

* How should I map my career from here on-wards ? 
* Is there any path that allows me to blend in IT and a bit of coding ? (I am good at Python)
* Is cloud just a buzzword or is it the real deal of the future ?
* Which one is better for certification ? AWS or Azure ?

Pardon the pretty noob questions. I am new to this field and want to have a solid foundation before learning and growing on my own.

i have a pretty diverse writing skillset and a good bit of internship experience under my belt, so i landed a job with a local campaign for us house here in my college town early on.

i stuck with them after i graduated even though i was applying elsewhere-- nothing came through from october until now, though it wasn't until last month i upped my interview game and have actually seen the results of being more prepared.

i like my job, but i dont want to stay because:
1. low pay. like, criminally low for the hours i work. 55/60 hr weeks at 400/wk puts me at less than minimum wage, even though COL is low here it's still too little.
2. job insecurity. the campaign is doing well with visibility, but not with making money-- i genuinely don't know how long it will last. some days it seems really secure, like i may even get a raise, but sometimes not.

HERE'S THE THING: i got offered a job in D.C. at a consulting firm for 42k/yr plus 10k bonus at end of year. decent benefits, PTO, everything.

but i'm not sure about THIS because:
1. the role of the job is just not really my thing. i would gain experience, but i would probably not like it much.
2. 42k in D.C. is still low. 
3. iiiii.... don't really want to be in D.C. that much. it's expensive, it's a rat race. i got into politics and i don't like D.C. fuck me amirite??

now, my first inclination is to NOT take this job, stick it out at my current one for as long as it'll last, and keep applying to jobs i like better. i have a lot of different interviews and can easily see a couple of current ones turning into offers.

but thing is, i just cant be sure of my success in this job market. i'm not sure how rare this offer was. i keep feeling like if i turn this down, i won't get something else and then what if my current job goes belly up? 

i don't know what to do, guys. i don't know what i should pick-- security/$$$ over satisfaction?

• Work experience: 

Boeing – 2.5 years – industrial engineering internship, accepted into prestigious rotation program out of school (1.5 years project management, 1 year pricing) – one promotion

Amazon – 2 years –Financial Analyst – owned $2B P&amp;L 

Business Analyst at $120MM (yearly revenue) digital retail startup – ~6 months (will be ~1 year when I apply next fall) - acted as product manager for an analytics dashboard that we shipped to our customers. Otherwise, mostly write technical requirements and work with development teams to produce tools and services for our brand managers and partners. 

• Extra curricular: volunteered at Mary’s Place Women’s Shelter, have built a personal real estate rental portfolio and flipped houses for side income, grow microgreens and sell at farmers market (also for side income), regularly post career advice on LinkedIn, mentor undergraduate students – I think I can bolster this part of my resume before I apply

• Undergrad school/major: BS in Finance from large state university – 3.4 GPA

Activities included: portfolio manager for Investment Group that managed real money portfolio, 2nd place CFA Global Research Competition, Research Assistant (finance faculty), Student Ambassador to COB (led new student orientations), and held on campus accounting job

•Other: 
26 (about to turn 27), white male

References will be strong – Amazon Director (Ross grad or I can do Principal PM who’s a Fuqua grad) and CFO of current company (who I ‘report’ to now) – all have decent titles, but will be able to write solid, intimate recommendations

Will work hard on essays and have a decent writing background (probably can’t tell from my rushed shorthand here…) I’ll also apply R1 for my target schools. 

Stats

• GMAT Score (include breakdown!): scheduled – last Manhattan Prep practice exam was 720 (44Q/ 45V) – I don’t feel there’s much left for me to improve on Verbal, if I really dig deep I *think* I may be able to bring the quant score up – do I need to be closer to 740 to get into target schools?

MBA Info

• Target schools: 

(Super?) Stretch: Sloan, Haas

Target: Stern, Fuqua

Others considered: Kenan-Flagler (UNC), Scheller (GT)

• Goal of MBA: Slowly I’ve been getting closer and closer to product management. After trying to move laterally at Amazon into a PM role, I felt pigeon-holed to finance. The move from Amazon to this new startup got me closer to PM, with potential opportunities to come, but an MBA will accelerate that track and land me back at a big tech firm. I’ve researched top employers at Stern and Fuqua, and both Amazon and Google are high on those lists. Another goal of getting an MBA is to generally broaden my skill set – I haven’t helped my case (of being pigeon-holed into finance/analytics) by self-teaching myself SQL and VBA, and dabbling in R and JavaScript. 

I like the fact that Stern has so many different concentrations, so I can dabble in other subjects should I choose (e.g. Real Estate, Digital Media, Entrepreneurship, etc.), though I’ll concentrate my essays on the above desire to pursue product management. Entrepreneurship interests me too, and I appreciate that most of the above schools hold some type of business plan competition - again, my primary desire is a product management focus though. 

The cost of tuition at Stern and rent in NYC is a concern though, and I don’t know if I’m strong enough to qualify for admission, let alone scholarships. 


How do you feel about my background and above target schools? Any other advice, suggestions, critiques?

I'm a 22 white male from the US who is about to graduate university with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. I have grown up with a substantial amount of privilege, especially financially. I already have a fairly decent nest egg, with a small amount of inheritance expected each year for the next few years. and I've also been privileged to have studied outside the US 3 times during my time in university as well as an internship outside of the US. In addition I will be graduating university with no debt. I have been very lucky, with a lot of international experience and I am in a very good financial position.

My dilemma

There seems to be a big push from people around me my age to go and travel. However, I did that a lot during my time in university and feel being outside of my university during my time in has made me feel I haven't had the time to develop anything substantial, which makes me want to settle in a place so I can work on something and grow myself and my connections with people. Having spent so much time away during university made me feel I didn't develop too many strong connections. At the same time, I look very wistfully back on my time abroad. Am I wrong to want to enter a 9 to 5 job in the US? Should I keep traveling? Has anyone had a similar experience

Thanks in advance for any advice, I truly appreciate it. If you need some more information, please feel free to ask it, I'm an open book."

Throughout my life making friends never was easy. I'd often just be alone for a long period of time until someone made me comfortable. It seems like throughout my life those people who make me feel comfortable either stop hanging out with me after awhile, or they turn out to be a bad influence on me. I recently ended a friendship with someone who would encourage me to smoke and drink alot. I feel so stupid for letting him convince me that those activies were fun. Now that I no longer go to school, finding friends has been difficult. My life lately is work, then chilling at home. So the only potential friends are coworkers. The problem with this is, at my work it's a non-paid internship. They're only here for 3 months. I have a paid position, and it sucks that I see them go right when I really get to know them. I've been with this company since I was 17, and I will likely continue to stay here for years to come. I often get attracted to some of the female workers there but I'm afraid to make a move on them at the risk of crossing a boundary. I feel like there's just very limited places to find friends and a girlfriend in this situation. I don't like using dating/friendship apps. Can anyone relate/or give me some advice? Thanks "

What the two jobs have in common or very similar:

- 401k match, medical, dental, vision

- Commute: 15 min vs 20 min drive

Additional comments: 

- I live in SoCal with very high COL
- I did a year long internship for another pumps company using the same CAD software; I guess this is why I’m their top pick for Job A. I’m not particularly fond of pumps, but from my previous posts on here I learned that whom you work with matter more than what you work on.  
- I plan to work for 1-2 years before looking around, if not offered adequate raise. 
- Average starting salary in automation/controls engineering is much higher. This explains the salary difference. But I feel like I’ll be missing out the 3D CAD part that I enjoy and was the reason I chose to major in ME. I like job A a tad more, but the lower pay will put me at a disadvantage when negotiating raise or jumping jobs. 
- Both jobs involve electrical stuff, but job B significantly more. Not that I don’t like working with electrical, I’m just listing as a fact. 
- Cubicle vs Office: I’ve never had my own office before, but I guess it's nicer to work in an office. Any thoughts?

If I had got only one of these two offers, I would have taken it right away without having to think this hard. Lol. I did all my homework but still, this is so hard to decide. I have a week to think and let them know.

Any thoughts, any questions to clarify, please fire away. Again, be blunt if needed. 

I really appreciate all your inputs!"

I graduated from my Masters with a high distinction (81 average). I have 5 years experience in Sales and 2 in direct marketing.

I am having serious trouble finding a job in marketing/digital marketing, every single job requires some sort of experience. I am self-taught in the Adobe Creative Suite, Google Adwords and SEO practices. I have beginner knowledge in HTML 5/CSS. Unfortunately, aside from the Adobe CS it's very difficult to hone your skills in a lot of these tools/platforms without having your own public business with a website or product/service.

I'm starting to feel as if this field is too competitive or the bar of requirements has simply been set too high for existing jobs and am beginning to regret taking this path in life. Has anyone else been in this position with this kind of degree? Even the internships are competitive and have taken like 5-6 weeks to get back to me.

Also, if it matters, I am also an EU citizen as well. I'm not sure and doubt that the EU has more job opportunities than Australia, and then there are the language barriers. Just thought I'd mention.

Is it worth going to a local career advisor? Are there any other fields I could consider with the aforementioned qualifications and experience?

Thank you."

What the two jobs have in common or very similar:

- 401k match, medical, dental, vision

- Commute: 15 min vs 20 min drive

Additional comments: 

- I live in SoCal with very high COL
- I did a year long internship for another pumps company using the same CAD software; I guess this is why I’m their top pick for Job A. I’m not particularly fond of pumps, but from my previous posts on here I learned that whom you work with matter more than what you work on.  
- I plan to work for 1-2 years before looking around, if not offered adequate raise. 
- Average starting salary in automation/controls engineering is much higher. This explains the salary difference. But I feel like I’ll be missing out the 3D CAD part that I enjoy and was the reason I chose to major in ME. I like job A a tad more, but the lower pay will put me at a disadvantage when negotiating raise or jumping jobs. 
- Both jobs involve electrical stuff, but job B significantly more. Not that I don’t like working with electrical, I’m just listing as a fact. 
- Cubicle vs Office: I’ve never had my own office before, but I guess it's nicer to work in an office. Any thoughts?

If I had got only one of these two offers, I would have taken it right away without having to think this hard. Lol. I did all my homework but still, this is so hard to decide. I have a week to think and let them know.

Any thoughts, any questions to clarify, please fire away. Again, be blunt if needed. 

I really appreciate all your inputs!"

I am a computer science senior with a single internship under my belt. I will be graduating in December 2018, but I'm a bit worried about my job prospects. I have a pretty good GPA, but my github is definitely lacking. While i've done small side projects, most of my free time has been focused on teaching myself machine learning, since It's my primary area of interest and my school doesn't offer any classes in it. Should i focus on getting an internship for over the summer, or just focus on finding a software engineering job?

SAT: 1540(790 Math, 750 CR&amp;W)
ACT: 34
SAT II's: Math 2- 800, Planning on doing USH maybe?
GPA: (End of Junior Year, projected): 4.35 W/ 3.92 UW
The only STEM course I didn't get A's in both semesters was CALC BC, which I got B+'s in, but I took it as a sophomore, is that fine?

EC's (What I'm super worried about):
Computer Science:
Member and leader of Tech Club at school.
One of the founding members of an outreach program to teach Programming to kids at a local middle school.
Competing in ACSL (American Computer Science League) and may qualify for the national tournament.
Have been doing an internship with professors at a local university to develop an app.
Participated (but not won) in a few local hackathons.
May develop an android app of my own.
Peer Collaborator for A.P. Computer Science at school.

Speech &amp; Debate:
Officer of school team since sophomore year, will be president next year as a senior.
Have won several regional awards in Informative Speaking and qualified for the state tournament as a junior.
Will plan to host a tournament at my own school next year.

Other:
Volunteer instructor at a local Math Learning Center, will plan to eventually make this an earning position.
Other community service hours, which, combined with Math volunteering, is approximately 60 hours (and counting).
Member of NHS.

Other:
Commended Scholar (most probably).
Should have some great rec letters from Computer Science and Stats Teachers.
Hoping my essays will be great too.

I'd really appreciate any feedback, I'm super nervous especially regarding Extracurriculars because I've seen people write so much and don't know if mine are good."
7xnmsy,5,2018-02-14,What are some of the lower end jobs that are easier to get?,emilysza,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7xnmsy/what_are_some_of_the_lower_end_jobs_that_are/,"Ok, quick short story about me: I graduated June 2016 with a CS degree from a decent school, but only had a 2.6 GPA and no internships (I had a terrible work ethic). I applied for jobs for a about a month after graduation with no luck. Then I had a two serious medical emergencies that put me in the hospital for the most part of the last year and a half. During my hospitalization I didn't (but should have) work on a coding project, but I did manage to do some hacker rank and leetcode to try and keep my head in programming.


I'm no longer stuck in a hospital bed so I've been applying to Bay Area jobs for about a month now, but haven't had much luck getting replies. I also didn't keep in contact with most of my class, so I don't really have many connections I can leverage, but I did manage to get an interview at Microsoft through a friend though I didn't get past the phone interview which I kind of expected since I don't have much interview experience.


Now I'm thinking about focusing more on doing a code project so I have something recent to talk about in interviews. I'm thinking of doing the project in a new language so that it would boost my resume more, but I want to know which job i'm aiming for first. Through school I did the majority of my work in C++, and the rest mostly in C and Python. C++ is definitely my most confident language to work in. I did the relatively quick codecademy online tutorial for Javascript this week since that seems to be wanted on a lot of job postings, but I feel like the tutorial was very brief so it'll be quite the time investment to try and do a personal project in Javascript.

So before committing to this project, I want to know what are the lower end jobs that are out there. I live in central California, so right between the Bay Area and Los Angeles Area, but I am completely open to just moving out to the Midwest if those jobs are easier to get. I don't really have a preference for the line of work as long as it involves coding experience. I figure the experience is much more important than the money or location at this point."

Here are some quick stats:
- Undergraduate GPA: 3.2
- GMAT: 500 (27q/32v), 3 IR, 6.0 AWA (I know this is a gross score and I let NYU know I am retaking the GMAT for a higher score)
- Experience: 3 years of full-time work experience, 2 internships, lots of extracurricular activities
- Current Industry: Marketing
- Age: 24

I feel good about my recommenders, work experience, and essays. The focal point of my application is that I am looking to specialize in the Entertainment, Media, and Technology specialization. I currently work in theme park entertainment marketing and wanted to go to NYU Stern to go further my marketing career into entertainment media. I am hoping to leverage the fact that I am working under the NBCUniversal umbrella as an advantage. I also managed to submit my application in the first round.

I am a senior CompSci student going for my BA at a decent public university. I switched majors a little bit late so I have this semester and then an extra year of part-time classes before I graduate. My resume is *sparse* and includes:

* 3.0 GPA
* Java / C
* some unrelated work experience
* no internships
* no personal projects

I went into this thinking I would use personal projects to bolster my resume along with the classwork, but overestimated the amount of free time I would have to engage with said projects alongside coursework. Additionally, securing an internship is proving more challenging than I'd thought.

I feel that while my situation is not unique, I am lagging behind the competition before I'm even out of the gate. I have one summer and two laid-back semesters before I aim to enter the job market. My plan is to use this summer to make myself more marketable, and then try to secure internship for the fall or spring semesters. Is this reasonable? Do you have any advice on how I or someone in a similar position can become more competitive?"

-Practice (around 20)

I absolutely aced the theory part, I double checked everything and I have answered every question well.

On the practice part, I had to write an algorithm to do card shuffling (on the spot) and my algorithm wasn't the best in my opinion, but it worked.

So I'm considering research, or at least more interesting CS jobs. I've been accepted into a thesis-based Master's program focusing on mathematical CS (automata, algorithms, complexity theory, symbolic computation, etc).

Are academic CS jobs highly competitive? If I don't get one, would this look bad on my resume? I've also been accepted into a computational math program focusing on ML, and another in cryptography, which both interest me less, but seems like it would look better to many prospective employers.

**TL;DR**: What kind of CS jobs are out there that focus more on algorithms and stuff? Is there any demand in academia? Would a Master's in theoretical CS look bad on a resume for more regular jobs?

Thanks."

Currently I am doing an IT Masters Degree, and have 5 years of experience with an MSP (Got to Sys Eng I level). As part of my degree there is an Internship Component, and as I have relocated (family reasons) the old msp position isn't viable. My problem here is that I have two different offers from two very different companies and need advice deciding.

Company A:
An Engineering consulting firm, &gt; 100 users. They really, really like my resume, and beyond the co-op would long term like me to help implement standardization to their network (vlans, NAC, SCCM, etc). So basically I would have lots of leeway to build, design, and improve their systems. But downside it is pretty unstructured, without defined roles.

Company B is a Investment firm that works with high net worth people. Total Staff is &lt; 75 They already work with an MSP to coordinate their infrastructure and helpdesk needs. However they use a lot of specialized database and analytics software, so need local help for their custom thin clients. I would have access to VMware Hypervisor for all their server in MSP 'cloud', and admin rights to AD and local resources. Additionally, the role would involve lots of SQL/Database analytics (something I want to get in to), Vendor coordination and management, and some cybersecurity and infosec stuff.

So Thoughts? I know this is kinda scattered in formatting, but I still mulling it over, as both companies want me to stay long term beyond internship in ever expanding roles."

I've done a couple unpaid internships before and done interviews but this one has me anxious as I'm asking for double what I currently make!
Is that a good number?

 their torn love for both hardware and software related things. 

A big motivational dream for me personally has always been to leave my small European country to work for one of the tech giants and experience a completely different world. For software it's pretty straightforward (but simplified): have good cs fundamentals, do well in school and have something to show for and you will land solid internships during undergrad and be set at graduation. And every big company has internship locations at their offices around the world. 

But when I'm looking at hardware - internships seems to be pretty scarce and it's all US based. When I'm looking at Hardware Engineers on linkedin at these companies the majority of them seems to have masters or PhD's. If they're foreigners their internship experiences are from when they did grad school in the states. 

Is going to grad school expected and software is just the exception?"

General career advice?",Sockdolagerr,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/7xsc36/5_months_tons_of_interviews_1_lukewarm_offer/,"hey all, so i'm a 21 year old recent college grad (dec. 2017) who works in political communications. i basically do various messaging for candidates for office/political PACs/other groups.

i have a pretty diverse writing skillset and a good bit of internship experience under my belt, so i landed a job with a local campaign for us house here in my college town early on.

i stuck with them after i graduated even though i was applying elsewhere-- nothing came through from october until now, though it wasn't until last month i upped my interview game and have actually seen the results of being more prepared.

i like my job, but i dont want to stay because: 1. low pay. like, criminally low for the hours i work. 55/60 hr weeks at 400/wk puts me at less than minimum wage, even though COL is low here it's still too little. 2. job insecurity. the campaign is doing well with visibility, but not with making money-- i genuinely don't know how long it will last. some days it seems really secure, like i may even get a raise, but sometimes not.

HERE'S THE THING: i got offered a job in D.C. at a consulting firm for 42k/yr plus 10k bonus at end of year. decent benefits, PTO, everything.

but i'm not sure about THIS because: 1. the role of the job is just not really my thing. i would gain experience, but i would probably not like it much. 2. 42k in D.C. is still low. 3. iiiii.... don't really want to be in D.C. that much. it's expensive, it's a rat race. i got into politics and i don't like D.C. fuck me amirite??

now, my first inclination is to NOT take this job, stick it out at my current one for as long as it'll last, and keep applying to jobs i like better. i have a lot of different interviews and can easily see a couple of current ones turning into offers.

but thing is, i just cant be sure of my success in this job market. i'm not sure how rare this offer was. i keep feeling like if i turn this down, i won't get something else and then what if my current job goes belly up?

i don't know what to do, guys. i don't know what i should pick-- security/$$$ over satisfaction?"
7xsvlq,32,2018-02-15,Request for new Psychiatrists: Please call your patients back. (personal anecdote highlighting issue),Nostok,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7xsvlq/request_for_new_psychiatrists_please_call_your/,"Good day! Although for me it is not a good day. I suffer from Major Depression with psychotic features and today is not a good one.

My request is for new psychiatrists to understand how difficult it is (in the US) to find a psychiatrist, first, who takes new patients, hasn't switched to children only, that takes my particular insurance, and WILL CALL YOU BACK. This combination is almost never possible.

I have an anecdote to illustrate. In August last year, I almost committed suicide. My doctor and I had been gradually lowering my anti psychotic dosage, and I didn't realize that I was obsessing again over a certain thing. When the day came when I was finally told that thing would never happen, I was devastated. My whole world crumbled and I wrote notes, figured out who would find my body, made preparations and was about to do it.

Out of the blue a friend messaged me online. My thought at the time was, I'll never talk to her again, why not play a game with her online for the last time. Well, thankfully this distracted me long enough for me to fall asleep without doing it.

So the next week (it was Friday night), I attempted to contact my psychiatrist. This was a big provider in the area, (Let's call them Big O). First they suggest logging into the online portal and sending a message directly to my doctor. This didn't work because my doctor wasn't configured on the portal.

So my first call to Big O was to get the doctor set up so I can message him. I was told that he couldn't get on there because he was mental health. (This wasn't true, because my previous mental health doctor was on there. They change doctors every year (student doctors, i think they are called interns).
So I asked how do I send a message?

The operator said, ""I'll take the message and give it to the doctor."" No call back. Two days later I tried again to message the doc through the operator. No call back. Ok, how about move my next appointment sooner? Sorry, no available times.

So I took it upon myself to up my dosage to what is was before we started lowering it. The good news is that my work actually cares about it's people and understands taking a few days off for mental health crisis. So I did while I stabilized. Still no call back.

After about a week I was feeling ok enough to go back to work and just wait for my next appointment. When it came, I told the doctor the story. He said he never got any messages, and that I did the right thing by upping the dosage. (Why should I have to self prescribe?)

So I looked for another doctor. I found one, and the first appointment, I told her the story. She said she would be more available to me. Also that someone would call me for my next appointment. They didn't. So far I have left 3 messages on two different lines for my doctor or her nurse, over the course of 3 weeks and nothing.

I understand you are busy as doctors, but you have no idea what it's like as a mental health patient to get care. Please call us back, or even have one of your staff call. What is so hard about that?

Thank you for listening."

I'm new to Reddit and I'm trying to secure an entry level position in software development. I'd like some assistance from professionals in the field.

A little background: 
I've been in the Marines for the past 3 years doing server admin work. Ever since I got an AS, I've come to the realization that I enjoy writing code. As of right now, I graduate with a BS in the software engineer track of a computer science degree in March of 2019. 

I don't have any real-world work experience, but I've aced all the school projects I've worked on in C, C++, Java, and HTML5. I understand how object oriented programming concepts work. 

I have a few options in my last year in the marines:
 1. Take MSSA in January 2019 for cloud development 
2. Signing up for an internship with EBay in my hometown of Portland, OR. This conflicts in schedule with MSSA. 

with this in mind, my question to the experts are:
Should i focus more on an MSSA cert or an internship since they are in conflict? 

In relation to school projects such as database programs, how far off am I to impressing someone in a technical interview for an entry level position? 

How important is projects on github? I've only done schoolwork, so I don't even know if I'm ready to contribute. It seems like contributors already are employed in this field."

7xtmar,3,2018-02-15,Tied between two jobs,theantisocialburrito,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7xtmar/tied_between_two_jobs/,"Hi r/jobs! 

I'm in a tough spot and could use some advice. 

I am a marketing major, about to graduate in April. Previously, I was unemployed since November. After a slew of job interviews for marketing coordinators, I accepted a job for a staffing agency, doing basic internet research and eventually helping them with blogs and other marketing. I started this week, and so far, I'm enjoying it. The company is nice, and it is full time. I am paid $11 an hour and it is a very laid-back environment. I took it because I needed the money and I really, really enjoyed the staff. They really believe in my marketing skills and are excited to see what I can do for them later on. I don't expect to be doing any blog writing or anything for a few months, though. I'm mostly doing routine tasks that comes with the position, as well as some administrative assistant stuff. I am a little anxious about balancing different roles. 

A company I previously interviewed for a few weeks ago called me this week, informing me they wanted to make an offer. The job position is for a marketing coordinator, but it is part time, and after graduation, they'd potentially see about giving me a full time position. I'd be making $16-$18 an hour, 22 hours a week. This seems like an awesome deal, as I'm primarily looking for marketing positions, but I am worried I'll take this position, not be cut out for it/fail to fit the company's culture and end up unemployed again.  This seems like a fantastic opportunity, since it could really drive me further in my career and potentially turn full time. I loved who I interviewed with and it seems like such a cool place to work. They like my background and obviously see my potential or else they wouldn't give me the offer. 

I'd hate to leave my current company high and dry, but this is a big deal. I'm losing sleep over this and I'm not sure what to do. I really don't want to make a wrong move and screw up my future. I should add I'm moving into a new house in a few days and I don't want to be unemployed in a few months and not be able to pay rent.

One job is full time but not a lot of pay, and I feel very limited and like I'm settling. The second job is a part time internship like basis that could be temporary but offers me more pay and better experience. 

I'm so anxious about this. How do I approach this? I don't know who to choose or how to go about it professionally. I did not tell the second company I had a job only because I didn't want to lose the opportunity. 

Does anyone have any advice? "
7xtny7,1,2018-02-15,Feeling stressed and scared.,ertgbnm,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7xtny7/feeling_stressed_and_scared/,"I [M20] am having a rough time recently. Two weeks ago, my dad had a colonoscopy where they found a large tumor, and after a cat scan they have determined that it has spread throughout the colon and onto the liver. The numbers are not encouraging but my family is trying to stay positive. But now I am left with high uncertainty about the future and I am scared. I am a full-time student working 15-20 hours a week spread across 3 jobs on top of the 15 credit hours I am taking. In addition, I am an officer in a student organization, where my responsibilities have just continued to rise. I had a similar load last semester and did well, so I assumed that I could do it again. But now I am losing sleep trying to keep up with everything and I am just barely keeping on top of this shit. Add on top the worry that I have been experiencing surrounding my dad's diagnosis, and I don't even know what to do. 

I feel like I am trying to blame my problems on my dad's diagnosis so that I don't have to confront them. At the same time, I can't ignore the fact that I am operating unsustainably. Zig-zaging between campus and work, and now I am going home more often. I don't even know what to start unpacking what it is I should do. I can't just nope out of my responsibilities. I can't just quit working because I needed these jobs before my dad got sick and the future is only more uncertain. I just feel so stupid for knowingly putting this pressure on myself and then regretting it when it turns out that I asked more from myself than I can give. Now I am forced to break promises and disappoint people or fail at everything.

I don't want to jeopardize my education in all this either, up to this point my grades have been really good and I am on track to graduate on time. And this brings up another dilemma I have been facing, especially in light of my dad's diagnosis. At the moment I will graduate next May with 2 certificates. I've done so much work getting to this point, but I feel like I am no longer able to justify these pursuits without the ability to quantify their benefits. I only have 12 hours in the certs remaining, but if I dropped them I could graduate a semester early and save that tuition to help pay for my father's treatment. The certifications are computer science and business. I have really enjoyed the computer science classes and I was able to get one of my internships based on these skills. Depending on the perspective, I have already extracted the value from the CS cert, so there is no incentive to complete it despite how much I have enjoyed and benefited from it. 

By the opposite token, I have been thoroughly bored by the business cert and have not found any direct benefits from it, but I am so close and if the piece of paper does provide value to my career I should invest the last 6 credit hours into it. Sunk cost fallacy maybe, but that doesn't change the fact that the certificate is within my reach and there is probably no benefit from an incomplete certificate whereas there might be a benefit from a complete certificate. 

I'm left weighing long term financial pros and cons with moderate uncertainty about their values with short term financial demands in the form of tuition savings for my dad's treatment. On one hand I might be putting my family in financial jeopardy to get some extra pieces of paper that may even not help me in this life and on the other hand I could be leaving money on the table in the form of leverage for salary negotiations. Every time I think about this I just get frustrated because I can't make a rational decision. 

Sitting down and trying to make decision about my immediate and far future is scary and I feel like I can't talk about this to my parents because they will undoubtedly insist that I don't drop the certs in light of incoming financial stress, because that's who they are. I think it's just selfish of me to be stressing about this while they are dealing with problems that are so much larger than mine, so I shouldn't burden them with more shit either.

So, I guess the things I am looking for are. How should I weigh the decision between graduating a semester early and getting the certifications? What can I do to reduce the distress I have been feeling? General advice on dealing with my dad's diagnosis.

Thanks for reading. I initial set out to find some advice on what to do, but I found writing this post very contemplative and helpful to my state today, as a result the organization is a little weird and the post long.

I’m just so exhausted. I’ve worked and worked and gave everything emotionally and physically to my family.

Disclaimer: very long post

Age 0-7: 
My parent grew up poor in rural China. They succeeded by passing the National Exam in the 80ies. Back then just entering in an university will put you at the top of the social pyramid (high paying job, free housing, etc.) They worked and seek out opportunities in GuanZhou, ShenZheng...etc so I grew with my grandparent. But my warmest memories were with my grandmother (0-5) 

At 5 my dad decided I should start school (which even by strict Asian standard, it’s early. Elementary age is suppose to be 7). You start at 8AM and finish at 6PM. Homework until 9PM. I remember when I was 6, I would cry and cry because I was tired and couldn’t finish my homework and I wanted to sleep. Sathurdays I had extra classes.

At 7 my parent decided to immigrate to Canada. The first 2 years was great. School life was easier. But we were suddenly dropped on the borderline of poverty. My parent’s degree were not recognized. Their English is bad and their French was nonexistent. I did not speak French/English at all so making friends were difficult. But I was 7/8. But as a kid, as long as you play together, learning is easy.

At 9 my parent decided to open a factory (sweatshop). That was a horrible time in my life. They worked hard to complete orders so no time for taking care of me. Sometimes I had to help during deadlines. It would be midnight and I wanted to go home so bad. No help in school, basic lunch packs -my parent were absent. I remember I would cry silently in the factory because it’s been 3 weeks and I still didn’t have any school supplies. I didn’t have any friends either since I can’t play with the other kids and no kids can come to our home.  Yet they still have high demands on my grades at school. Since internet did not exist and I had no real entertainment, I studied and got good grades. 

Age: 11-12: They closes the factory and transferred off-shore in China. Things were looking better at least financially. But I just hit puberty and no one was there to tell me these things. Nobody told me how to buy a bra, or that I need a bra or tampons. It was humiliating. 

At this time my parent also decided to have another child. My sister was born and I was so happy because that means I won’t be lonely anymore and there will be someone else to shoulder their expectations.

Age 13-17: middle school -high school
They finally bought a house. But when we’re doing good money wise it was getting bad in their marriage. They would fight and shout and fight. They have fought ever since we came to Canada. I remember at 8 my parent asked me who would I stay if they divorced. I answered grandma.

Middle school was hell. I was basically  second Mom to my sis, Dad business got bad. Mom want to start her own. I was bullied but I still made great friends. Friends that I still have today and that I’m grateful for.

Age 16: Mom says Dad is having a mistress (true or not, I don’t know and I don’t want to know).  To compromise on her insecurities, they invested in another house. (aka since they put all the money there, he can’t stray). We’re in debt but real estate values stays (according to them)

Fast forward, Mom opened her own store since Dad business is doing bad. And then there’s even more hell-ish. I was basically preparing to college, full time student, part time cashier to pay for tuition, full time marriage counselor (Mom/Dad accuses each other of infidelity, among other things) , part time Mom to sister and part -time free salesperson for Mom. 

I remember I was so down one day that when I was supposed to take care of store for Mom I broke down crying and I said I couldn’t do it anymore and my mom got angry at me. In the end I went back home and I cried during the whole trip to home (1hrs.)

Age: 20-22: I finally saved up and used some funding from student loan to plan a trip to Paris (my dream) and get a master degree (my excuse to leave.) I did it. I’ve did all the paperwork by myself. I paid for all the admin fees. I paid for my airplane ticket. I left. Parent did help me, though, they paid for 25% of all the expenses for the projects. Paris have it’s own challenges. I paid my living expenses with my savings and with my internship. I was living with 545 euro + 202 euro per month.  Then I got a job in France. Which is hard AF. But the boss is a narcissistic asshole and I was overworked (exploited.) . And since I did not see myself establishing in that country I came back.

Age 23: I came back and tried everything to get a job right away. I did it. I got a job that was ok. It’s a good entry level job in a very nice company.  I was proud I could found a job in this market.  In that period I saw my parent fight again (worse, there were some death threats and I tried to protect my little sis as much as I can) and what made me really angry was my mom who said I did not contribute to this family enough. 

She once yelled and said they did everything for me. That coming  to Canada is because of me. That she regret listening to me (11 at the time) and gave birth to my sis. 

I did not have my period for 5 months after that. I though there was something wrong physically, I went to see the doctor and did hormones test. Turn out I was just stressed. I go to the gym now to decompress, it helped a lot.

Then my parent have problems again. They closed mom store (she wasn’t making money) but we have another left. They rented the old house for revenue and Dad business will be supporting only 1 store.  The plan was good (we make less money but enough for the lifestyle) and they plan to retire eventually.

Then my parent got their hand on a asshole tenant and did the thing the Asian Way aka try to negotiate with them and counted on human decency and not follow the law. Tenant (female) is class A scammer/bully. Mom got pissed and things escalated into lawsuits. They clearly said it’s none of my business. So I leave it there. However since they don’t know how thing really work, evil tenant escalated things and sued us for 20k while tenant delayed payment for 2 months. So now I’m involved. Again. Mom had enough and took a 3 months vacation to China. 

I know this is a another hurdle and we can walk through it. 

But I’m just tired.

At 23 (soon 24) I don’t trust people. I always feel any affection/ love is and will be conditional. Never had a boyfriend even though I would love to.  

I feel like 45 instead of 23. 

I sometimes envy my friends youthful insouciance. It hard to talk to my friend on these issues since they didn’t went through similar experience and I don’t want to be bring depression in a happy convo.

Today is Chinese New Year. We don’t really celebrate. We will have food, which I am grateful for, but I don’t feel the excitement or happiness. We actually never celebrate Christmas or birthdays or anything.

I’m tired and stressed and I just want someone to say I did well and it’s going to be ok.


It’s going to get better I know, but I’m out of strength.

7xu6tb,9,2018-02-15,Didn't get any intern offer at this point. Any suggestions?,heray14,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7xu6tb/didnt_get_any_intern_offer_at_this_point_any/,"About me: Hi reddit, I am a junior majoring in computer science. I am trying to get an software development internship for this summer. I attended two career fairs at my school, last September and this February. But I only got one interview out of them so far...

- My GPA is 3.6/4.0
- I finished some hardcore CS courses at my school already. Had some side projects. 
- I had work experience as IT support on campus.
 
Preparation for career fair: I followed some posts here:

- went to career center on campus and revised my resume twice
- had mock interview with career center as well 
- set up a github repo with some of my side projects
- looked up companies and positions before attending
- practiced top interview questions on leetcode

I talked with 13 companies during last career fair. None of them gave me an interview. I think that's pretty bad sign. And one of them rejected me two days after I applied online.

My question is what can I do at this point, as a last resort I guess, to try for an internship position this summer. And besides that, what stuff should I work on to make myself look more ""employable"" to the recruiters in the future.

I would appreciate any suggestions/ideas/opinions.

Thank you in advance!"

I started diving into how to prepare for the jobs I was looking for at the beginning of my first year, but am now struggling to keep my GPA up because my passions are largely what motivate me to learn and my projects inspire more passion than my classes do. 

My GPA is now around a 2.76 and I'm taking an easier schedule this quarter to help recover and get back on track after a rough fall quarter.   
Some of the projects I'm currently working on include:

-Programming a torque vectoring application for an FSAE electric vehicle(with 2 other people) 

-Researching (and hopefully developing) a generated adversarial network

-Arduino project for detecting atmospheric gradients in aerospace systems club(with 4 other people) 

-Learning python, ReactJS, and tensor flow (since my college only teaches c++ in our classes) 

-solid works design and arduino project for an invention in the augmented/virtual reality field(with 2 other people) 

I understand that companies are often looking for people who can handle many tasks at once and perform well in all of them, but I personally find it hard to devote my time and attention to classes when there's such a high quantity of information/skills to learn online that will probably prove more useful when I'm going for a job I'm passionate about. 

I'm worried that a low GPA will limit my ability to get jobs where I can be creative and really put all of my passion to good use. Where should my priorities be? I'm doing my best to learn how to reach my goals, and I am extremely grateful for any advice you can offer me.

Summer 2019 I no doubt want to intern in Chicago, and my plan for after graduation is to find a full-time position somewhere in Chicago. But for this specific upcoming summer, I'd like to stay in Champaign.

Is there any real benefit to choosing a potential internship in Chicago over one at Research Park? Will it give me a better shot of interning in Chicago next year at a different company, or as a sophomore is there not really a difference?

They told me to figure out the heat loss and a friend has to do the solar collectors sizing part.
The thing is, I'm not very good at thermodynamics, and I have no idea what to do with the data they gave which is the following:
-Volume of water: 3100 L
-Target temp: 40ºC
-Material of hot tub: Cypress wood (no special insulation, 0.06 m thick), I used a K of 0.096 W/m*K
-The system has no tank, the water from the tub will be directly heated by the solar collectors.
-The main purpose of the solar heater is to minimize the heat loss during the day, since the owner usually heats up the tub with wood, and he wants to switch to a solar solution to use less wood (and because the neighbours complained about the smoke). So the solar system is an auxiliary system.

I used a formula I found in https://thermtest.com/thermal-resources/conduction-calculator to calculate the conduction heat loss, but I talked to a friend who's a chemical engineer and told me the loss is greater from evaporation and convection. (I assumed it was negligible, since the tub is supposed to have the cover on most of the time.)

The heat loss I estimated was between 14 kWh and 18 kWh per day, I'm not sure if that's in the scope for a 3100 L hot tub, but highy doubt it.

So anyways, any help I can get, any formulas you can give me, I'd highly appreciate it.

Thanks for the help.

tl;dr: I have to calculate heat loss of a 3100 L hot tub made of cypress wood (0,096 W/m*K), 0.06 m thick walls, and cover is almost always on. Water should be at 40ºC ideally. Average daily temperature here is 18ºC summer, 10ºC winter."

The technical problems the company faces are pretty interesting, but it requires a lot of domain knowledge that I simply don’t have yet (this is my fourth internship, I’m not out of school yet). 

I feel like my stories are taking me a while to complete and that I’m a burden when I’m asking people questions. I’m prone to feeling incompetent so for me it’s really hard to handle when that turns out to be the case for feature work that’s more challenging and requires expertise I don’t have. I get so stressed about not being able to solve whatever problem I’m working on and it honestly makes me wonder if programming is right for me. On one hand I feel like this is a self fulfilling prophecy and on the other hand I feel like everyone knows what’s going on except for me. Sometimes my head hurts and I can’t focus because I’m genuinely anxious about whatever task I’m working on, since everything seems so new and daunting.

Another thing that kind of sucks is that all the other interns I’m working with seem really confident and knowledgeable, and this makes me want to hide my insecurities from my manager and team. 

Maybe I just needed to rant a bit but does anyone have any advice for someone in my position? I know I have a lot to learn and really I’m pretty clueless and that’s ok, but I need to start coping with the fact that programming isn’t always a breeze and I don’t know how to do that.

I’m an undergrad student in Computer Science. I went to a community college for a bit which kinda fucked up my graduation date. I have 3 semesters left after this, which means I also have 2 summers left to get some work opportunities under my belt.

So my questions:
Should I be getting internships both summers? I think I have one secured for this coming semester in IT, which leads to my next question.
Should I avoid internships in IT project management? These internships require less coding and more data organization, Microsoft office usage, blah blah etc.. Or should I take every chance I get?
Should I use one of the summers developing a project, in the off chance that I don’t get a solid software development internship?

My goal one day is to become a senior software developer/engineer at a big tech company.

Thanks guys!"

I'm a university student with a job issue.

I had a good summer internship last year and was able to develop a lot of skills and made meaningful contributions to my department. However, I did something silly that led to me getting fired near the end of my internship, leaving a bad impression on my managers. The mistake I made was that I left work an hour early because it was a very VERY slow day. Without revealing too much information, my job was to recruit patients for research from a clinic waiting room. Since there were no eligible patients in the last 5 hours, I thought it was okay to leave early since that's what all my other work partners do if its slow. However, my manager somehow found out that I left early and got very angry especially because she didn't know the others were leaving early too...........and that's how I got fired with two weeks left of my internship. This is my sketchy work background. 
I've quickly learned from this mistake and have matured from such failure. 

I  secured a comparably valuable part-time job during this school year to bounce back from my mistake. I was lucky because my workplace did not ask for references when they hired me so I never brought up my past mistake.  I am hoping to continue this job this summer. However, my manager requires that I have to reapply for the same position (resume, cover letter, interview, references) to make things fair with other candidates. I am asked for three references. 

My previous summer job is an important component of my application because of the accomplishments I made in the role (before I got fired). I'm pretty sure my manager expects a reference from that job since I talked about it so much. My current list of references includes someone who works at my current workplace (strong reference) and two other supervisors from volunteer positions (weak references). I can't use anybody from my previous workplace as a reference because they'll reveal that I was fired. 


The past is the past so I've been trying really hard to be a dedicated student here in order to prove that I can do good work; I've gotten a lot of praise from my manager...but I'm really scared that not including references from my previous job will raise a red flag and I'll lose the trust my manager  has in me :( 
 
How sketchy does my situation look right now for references? There's not much I can do right now about it,  I guess I'm just looking for reassurance and potential advice on how to go about this issue.

My situation: I tried spending my free time on CS things, but I think I am just unable to do it, it will drive me crazy, I want to have a life outside of CS, I want to pursue other interests like music and verbal language, and I want to enjoy the moments without work. I struggled at the beginning of school and now my weighted-average is atrocious, it doesn't matter that I'm doing swiftly in my classes now, and will do so until I graduate.

7y320o,3,2018-02-16,"Bare with me, I have 3 questions that are all related about Contracts, the Animal Welfare Act, and possible tax evasion.",helpmesavethem,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7y320o/bare_with_me_i_have_3_questions_that_are_all/,"Contract Questions: 
- How much trouble can I get for breaking a tiny contract about not using phones or taking pictures at my workplace, but these pictures contain evidence of them breaking the law? I work at a zoo in Wisconsin in Outagamie/Waupaca. Before I started working, they had me sign a small little blurb (2-3 sentences) on the bottom of the job application about not using my phone or taking any pictures at work. Everyone still uses their phones at work including the main zookeeper who basically is my manager. I have been using my phone to take pictures of things that break the animal welfare act (dead animals that were written off as ""sold,"" unclean pens, etc.). I'm going to report it and I want to stay anonymous since there are very few workers (although I'm sure they might figure out who I am and I am worried about what they will do when they find out). 
- Within 1 month of working there, 2 people were fired and 1 person quit. Can I argue that I didn't feel any job security here and that I needed evidence to prove that they were breaking the law not just my word, which would make the contract void? 

Animal Welfare Act Questions: 
- Where do I go to report animal welfare act violations? the state veterinarian? USDA? Wisconsin Humane Society? (Also will these places be able to keep me anonymous when I report?)
- Is there a way to see the veterinary care done at the zoo animals? A coworker said that the owners do not believe in vaccinations and animals have died in the past from diseases they could have easily been vaccinated against. Doesn't it say in the Animal Welfare Act that the animals should receive proper veterinary care, which means legally they have to be vaccinated? 
- What happens to the animals if the zoo is found violating the animal welfare act? I'm really hoping the animals are seized and sent to sanctuaries or AZA-accredited zoos. 
- Will photos of them violating the animal welfare act shut the zoo down or are the inspections done by a vet or USDA agent the only way for a zoo to be shut down and the animals seized? 
- The owners of the zoo are really old so technically it is the main zookeeper who is mistreating/neglecting the animals. Could they just blame it all on her and still keep the zoo? Because they know all of the terrible things she has done in the past but have kept her anyways so it would really be a shame if the owners still were able to keep the zoo. I know about the terrible stuff the main zookeeper has done in the past because of a friend who used to intern there four years ago, but she did not take any pictures. 

Tax Evasion Question: The main zookeeper claims that she gets her paycheck from the owners through their junkyard even though to my knowledge all of her work is related to the zoo... isn't that some kind of tax evasion? "

7y46wq,4,2018-02-16,"Positive internship experience, return offer, but the job did not materialize",idk_throwaway123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7y46wq/positive_internship_experience_return_offer_but/,"I interned (twice, on two very different teams) at a large multidisciplinary engineering company with lots of software engineering going on that is growing quite quickly. At the end of each internship I had positive reviews; at the end of the second one they told me they would definitely want me back once I graduated, but that they didn't do formal return offers until ~6 months before the actual job start date.

In December, I reached out to the recruiter I'd previously talked to when interviewing for my internships and started the process of rejoining the company after graduation. I said I would be interested in returning to either of those teams, but was open to other parts of the company, too. The initial conversation with the recruiter went great and he told me he was recommending me for an interview with five different teams within the company.

Two of them requested a technical interview and I sent off times I would be available. The recruiter said he hadn't heard back from the others, but that that wasn't unusual as they always take a long time. I scheduled a time with one of the teams that wanted a technical interview but it ended up being conversational with the manager of the team, and the other never got back to me about scheduling an interview. After that conversational interview the manager said he loved talking to me and thought I'd be great for X position, and that I should expect a technical interview in the next week.

It's now two weeks later. On Monday, I followed up with the recruiter and he replied almost immediately that he felt bad that he hadn't gotten back to me yet and would ""circle back within the next day with answers"" and would schedule more interviews. Then, today, I got an email from him saying that ""the feedback is that you are a great candidate for [COMPANY] overall and there may be opportunities elsewhere worth exploring in the future.  My main concern is that you were respected, followed up with and notified of our decision.""

Does anyone have any idea what happened? I don't understand what feedback he could be referring to since I didn't really even interview with them, and I'm pretty frustrated that I could have such positive internship experiences and reviews and then be dropped so abruptly like this. I feel kind of like I wasted my time interning with them since everyone I know pretty much is going back places they interned during school and I'm kind of worried about getting a job given how late it is now...

I'm also an international student (F-1 visa) and planning to stay in the US for work afterwards. 

My PhD research is going very well so far. I wrote my Master's thesis (in my home country) on the same topic, and thus came in much better prepared than some of my colleagues. I've since published some well-cited papers in our main area-specific conference. Last semester, I passed my dissertation proposal and my committee told me that I can graduate in about a year, or maybe earlier. 

However, this still leaves the task of finding a job afterwards, and that's where the problem comes in. It seems like our research field is slowly but steadily losing interest: 1) Less people show up to our yearly meetings; 2) The quality of the papers on our annual conference seems to be declining; 3) A number of industry partners have dropped out. And the companies that stayed, our research is often not their main focus, but more of ""let's try out if this works and could be useful in the future"". There's also a quite pessimistic mood among my colleagues about the future of our project. All in all, things just looked much more promising 3 years ago.

This makes it quite hard to use my research experience in my job search. It seems like I would have a much easier time if my PhD was in AI, Machine Learning, or even just SDN or Datacenter Networks. Something more practical than ""this is our great theory how the Internet should look like in 30 years"". 

Now, regarding my job search what should I do? I had following plans in mind:

1) Try to get a big-name industry internship to put on my resume. It was easy for me to get an internship related to my work in a government or non-profit lab. However, I had a much harder time applying to industry jobs (Big N + network-related companies). Out of 50 companies I applied to, the only ones to respond were either from personal referrals or related to my research. I got referred to one Big4, but failed the phone screen (didn't have enough time to practice LeetCode). 

My current best bet is one of the big companies that want to try out our research. I don't know if I can rely on that kind of position in the future, but maybe just having the name on the resume (+ connections I make there) would help? 

2) Try to get some research published in areas that are more appreciated by industry? For example, there are some workshops on the overlap between Computer Networks and Machine Learning/AI/Big Data. Any other suggestions here?

3) Maybe look into some of the data science ""bootcamps""? Like ""The Data Incubator"" or ""Insight Data Science"". Does anyone have experience with these programs? 

Any other ideas? Thanks for your help!

Stats

Undergrad GPA: 3.77 (Summa Cum Laude, Beta Gamma Sigma)

MBA Info

Goal of MBA: Strategy/Management Consulting

Target schools: Kellogg and Goizueta are top two primary targets for reasons explained below. I also plan on shooting applications to Harvard and Duke, With CU Denver and UF Warrington.

So, here's the scoop. I did my 4 years of military service right out of high school, enlisting when I was 17. I got out and immediately moved to Denver to pursue my undergrad using my Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits. I went to school year round, taking heavy course loads to earn my Bachelor's degree in only 2 1/2 years, in which I graduated last December (2018) 

I purposely hammered out undergrad in 2 1/2 years, which left me with exactly 13 months of benefits left on my GI Bill. Aside from 6k loaned out on my personal vehicle, I have no other debt. I moved to Texas to my family farm recently, so that I can minimize expenses and work on our farm, so that I can aggressively prep for my GMAT. With 13 months left on my GI Bill, I have decided that it is very rational to only pursue a 1 year MBA program. With my target schools offering Yellow Ribbon or being public/state schools, this means that I will likely be able to graduate from a 1 year program completely debt free, and have living costs funded by the GI Bill. So this is the primary goal of mine, and I want to hammer out my MBA as soon as possible, and be done with it.

Weaknesses: During my military service, and undergrad, I didn't have much opportunity or time to do any volunteer activities. Also, the heavy course loads during my undergrad did not allow me to do any internships, or gain any work experience in the business field, which I know are important, but I feel that waiting longer to pursue my MBA in order to obtain more experience doesn't outweigh the cost benefit of getting my MBA done quickly and moving my career forward, especially if I can graduate from an MBA program debt free, even if the program doesn't have near as high of placement as some more desired schools. I will note that with one of my startups that I am working on (I streamline startups for clients), that I have gained some experience in CRM, ERP, Business/marketing plan writing, Marketing, and some other back end business processes. 

Reasons I picked my target schools:

Kellogg and Emory: Only high ranking MBA programs that offer 1 year programs with nearly full funding in conjunction with Yellow Ribbon Program. I also feel the culture at Kellogg fits me well. Also, both have good placements into consulting.

Harvard/Duke: Both have a high military acceptance rate lift over traditional applicants, and I believe that both waive application fees, so might as well shoot some applications that way. Duke is most likely a no go unless I can get some sort of scholarship. Harvard is a long shot, but I wouldn't be concerned as much about carrying any debt, because, well, it's Harvard. 

CU Denver: New 1 year MBA program offers 10 month full time paid internship in conjunction with 1 year completion time. Not only is the experience valuable, but I did my undergrad there, enjoy Denver, and GI Bill monthly housing allowance (MAH) is tax free at 2k monthly. Keep in mind that MAH coupled with around 3k per month from internship and 1 year completion time makes this program very desirable in many ways. Placement is not so good but the internship would help.

UF Warrington: Has one of the best placements for MBA grads at public/state school, fully funded, and is only 10 months long. Cons are that Gainesville (Which I am familiar with) is in the middle of nowhere and the MAH is extremely low, around 700-800 a month.

Back to my GMAT prep. I was planning on taking the online Veritas Prep course, but may purchase the Manhattan Prep package for self study instead. I would like suggestions on what you folks think I should do with that.

I am also currently playing with a couple of start ups, but I am tied between pursuing those or gaining career experience working for an employer. Would like some feedback on this as well. I am planning on applying during R1 of this year, starting my MBA in June/August of 2019. That's only about 1 1/2 years of time between now and starting a program.

Sorry, I know that was a lot. I will answer any additional questions in the comments."
7y4xqk,3,2018-02-17,Questions for social scientists,payaramalama,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/7y4xqk/questions_for_social_scientists/,"Hey, y'all. 

I'm going to be graduating this summer with an MA in socio-cultural anthropology. After doing some more extensive research into industry jobs and methods in other social science departments at my Uni, I think I screwed myself a little bit. I'm looking for advice and encouragement. I'm terrified to find jobs. I don't want a PhD. I want to go into industry. 

Ultimately, I'd like to work research positions and they all call for knowledge my program does NOT teach--data science, R, SAS, SPSS, etc. My department scarcely prepared me for the IRB, and we don't learn qualitative analysis software--the latter two I've learned all on my own. I've been a TA and an RA. In undergrad I did internships and held down full time jobs. I'm not hurting on a resume for a LOT of jobs. 

But I feel angry because I didn't realize sooner to take advantage of what my program wasn't offered and now I'm scared because I'm lacking knowledge of these methodologies for industry social research jobs. What do I do? Post-bacc? Learn on my own? Go forth and see what professional development I can do? Or do I not worry about it so much? If you're a social scientist, what are your plans after graduating? Do you feel prepared? 

I have plans to expand my data science knowledge through a local program with a long waitlist, a local hackerspace that has people willing to help me, at least, and online learning. There's things like R that I can learn on my own. I'm thinking of taking classes at a local community college for non degree seeking students to build a knowledge base to bring to employers, but this is all time and energy I could have already spent in grad school. 

I'm feeling bummed and disappointed with myself, my thesis, and my degree right now. It's manifesting in anxiety about this lack of knowledge I have, so I come to r/gradschool in crisis. Anybody wanna weigh in? "
7y65yo,7,2018-02-17,Should I stay abroad or go back to America?,EmergencyExig,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/7y65yo/should_i_stay_abroad_or_go_back_to_america/,"Hi, I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this but I figured it’s kind of related to my career path.

So, I graduated high school last year - top of my class and also received my Associate’s Degree. Instead of going to college, I decided to take an internship offer at a community development NGO in a rural village in Thailand. I’ve really been enjoying the work I’m doing and I would love to have a career related to this field.

Despite this, I feel like I should still go to college and get my B.A. I’ve already gotten in to some pretty good schools in the U.S. and I applied to one school in Japan: Waseda University for a new English Degree program they’re starting this year for 40 students in social innovation.

I’m kind of stuck between going back to America or staying living abroad. There are definitely pros and cons to each and I’ll list the ones I have so far.

Moving to Japan - Pros:
- something I would really enjoy
- would learn another language, could leverage the unique experience on my resume 
- top school in Japan. Recognized domestically
- would be free (college in the U.S. I would definitely need to take out some loans)

Cons:
- degree is not as good compared to an American university
- id probably have to stay in japan to get a good job after I graduate (which isn’t something I’m against, but it’s hard to tell right now)
- might take a while to acclimate to a new culture 

So I’m already leaning towards going to Japan, but I’d like some of your experiences or opinions. 

Thanks!

7y7019,10,2018-02-17,I'm done. I don't have anyone else to talk to about this really. Apologies for wall of text.,Inheritance7,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7y7019/im_done_i_dont_have_anyone_else_to_talk_to_about/,"I've made another post about my depression and had a discussion with a redditor there which helped me a bit. I think he hasn't been online or something so he stopped replying so I thought I'll make another post. I'm a twenty year old male.  I've been thinking for a lot of time for the past few days and just wanted to share it with someone.

I hadn't exactly done any research about depression before so I spent the last couple of days trying to figure out how deep in it I was. I don't have all the signs of depression like difficulty sleeping or anxiety or difficulty in making decisions, but the symptoms I do have, I have them excessively. I feel worthless most of the time. I don't remember the last time I was happy, and I don't have the motivation to do a lot of things. I feel like I'm a robot at this point. I wake up in the morning to what other force me to do(classes). I have never woken up in the past 5 years at least happy that I'm awake. Maybe 1 or 2 times I actually got up with a bit of motivation, but other than I don't remember anything.

I feel like I am only able to things which have become a habit. I can't just make my mind up do anything. I feel like so useless. Everyone else does something useful. I've even made a list of useful things my friends do in their life, and all of them have some role in the group except me. I'm just a useless person who they probably tolerate for some reason. If I stop existing today, I'm pretty sure nothing is going to change in anyone's life. The worst part is that I fake that everything is fine. I have literally faked everything over the past 5 years. I act as if I'm happy, I act as if I'm motivated, I act as though I like living but I can't do it anymore. I just want everything to end. What's the point of living if you don't feel happy doing things you are supposed to enjoy. Am I supposed to fake it until something magically becomes enjoyable because 5 years of faking stuff evidently didn't help.

Sometimes I wonder if I'm just faking everything. I don't think it's possible to be a fuck up like myself after being brought up in really good conditions. Maybe I'm just using this as an excuse to being so useless. I'm a college student and im in a crucial point where I need to apply for internships and I am the only one in my whole college who hasn't started applying. I can feel my friends judging me negatively and they really should. Wtf am I even doing with my life.

In my other post I mentioned that the only thing that made me happy was this awesome girl who everyone likes and I have a huge crush on. We are decent acquaintances and a couple of hours after my post she sent me some meme out of the blue. This is something that should make me excited and give me something to look forward to, but I just feel the same. I don't want to feel this way, but any progress I make just seems futile because nothing ever gets better. Just like this girl, I know she isn't going to like me, I know she's too good to be dating a loser like me, and I know that I'm just going to feel like a loser anyways. I don't know why anyone would even like me. I read a lot of reddit posts about people having no personality, and that's fucking me. I don't get excited by anything at all. I am just really boring and uninteresting and enjoy nothing in life. Even writing this post has taken me around 4 hours. I'm that useless. I feel like I don't have an identity. I just feel so alien. I don't know who I am anymore.

I also think about bad things happening to me a lot. I sometimes hope that I have meet with am accident or that my parents disown me or my friends stop talking to me. I do this for a lot of the time. I feel happy that I am suffering sometimes because I feel like I deserve being so useless because I couldn't be successful after being given every opportunity to succeed. I didn't reach anywhere near the expectations that my parents, relatives, or friends have of me. I'm just a disappointment in everyone's lives.

Yesterday was the first time I actually looked at methods of suicide. I've always thought of suicide and have wanted to stop existing but knew that I would actually never go through with it. This is the first time I've actually searched for ways to do it. I'm so scared right now. I don't want to live really, but I don't want to be the reason other people are sad either. I know that my parents and friends will be sad for a bit if I decide to suicide and I don't want to cause them anymore pain than I already have. I just want my problems to go away. I just want someone to tell me it'll be alright. I want someone to say they like me. I want someone to say that I can amount to something in life. I'm so afraid that nothing good will ever happen to me. I just want someone to talk to, and not feel pity. I want to improve but at this point I have given up. I have a feeling that nothing will ever get better, only worse. I don't even want to be normal anymore. I just want to feel joy in doing something. I want to feel something other than sadness and anger and disgust. I'm so scared that I'm going to do something by the end of next week that will permanently mess me up. Please help me. "
7y710f,6,2018-02-17,Career advice and maybe a little encouragement,jon777ww,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7y710f/career_advice_and_maybe_a_little_encouragement/,"I'm reaching the end of a 2-year network technician program (I’m in France so the specific name of the degree is a “BTS SIO”). I had an internship at the same time, alternating between school and work. Coming into this field, I really didn't know more than the next guy about networking or the IT industry. Honestly, I got into IT for the wrong reasons probably; I was desperate to get out of washing dishes at a really crappy restaurant (please don’t hate me for that, I just wanted a job that I could tolerate). I feel like I've learned some things, but I've found it hard to focus on one subject within IT. 
So far, at school and work I've really just learned the basic stuff, switches, ip addresses, basic network setups, active directory, print servers, etc. A lot of things but superficially. We did some stuff on packet tracer with STP, VLANS, inter-vlan routing, setting up telnet (even though SSH is better we didn’t learn about it) DHCP, and all that jazz. I made a basic windows network in virtual box with W2016 and a couple clients, an AD with OUs and made a couple GPOs. I also setup an asterisk server at school – that was kind of fun. I made a bunch of badges so people can get through the turnstile and clock-in in the morning. I changed a lot of peoples’ computers too (PCs running XP or that just stopped working, that kind of stuff)
I feel like I’ve seen a lot of stuff but I don't really know how to go further and learn more. I admit I didn’t ask a lot of questions at work which was my mistake but the language barrier kind of played a part in that too. (French isn’t my first language)
I'm sorry I'm rambling. I guess what I'm trying to say is I think I need some career advice. I was thinking it would be best for me to get into some sort of support job before trying to be a fully-fledged technician (even though I’m still going to try to finish school and get the degree if I can). If a client asked me tomorrow to setup a print server or a DHCP service, I would know I how to make changes to it but not actually setup the entire thing and make it run with what network might already be in place - I honestly don't know if I would be able to do it, and if I could, do it well. 
My coworkers told me yesterday that I don’t seem to be very passionate about networking and that I should maybe think about doing something else, like helpdesk/support, web design, or that even maybe IT just isn’t my thing and that I should think of what I’m really truly passionate about (which is a whole other problem). I get what they were saying, but at the same time I didn't get much help from them either even though I was their apprentice. No specific missions or punctual things to be graded on, when I asked questions I had one coworker who would get mad at me or belittle me for not already knowing something. I just got discouraged from it all and kind of shutdown. Since the beginning I would just come to work and they expected me to find something to do on my own, that I would look it up at home and work 24/7. This is my first IT job and so maybe that's how it's supposed to be? Maybe I'm the one in the wrong? Maybe I’m lazy for wanting to come home and not think about work? I don’t know…
Anyway, I feel like these last two years, for whatever reason - whether that be my attitude toward the job or the laissez-faire management at work - haven't been super constructive for my career in IT. 
What I would like in my next job is to be able to start on a basic level doing support or something and learn more and work my way up. Are there any companies or leads anyone could give me? Even starting in a call center or something would be fine if I could find a way to keep making progress.
I’m just kind of floating around out here in France, kind of scared because I’m not really sure where any of this is coming to and I just want something stable and rewarding.
Anyway, thanks for your time if you made it to the end.

7y96zl,6,2018-02-17,They hired her instead?,joeyandersonottawa,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/7y96zl/they_hired_her_instead/,"Hey guys,

 

Have you ever left an interview thinking wow, they really liked me, I can’t wait to sign the offer! I’m going to tell you about my first interview, and what it should have taught me about basic social skills.

 

I was in an interview on a Friday afternoon at a small law firm back in college. We needed to do some field work for the program I was in, and this was a summer internship our professor had set up for a few of her top students. I was stoked, I was sure no one could interview as well as I would; I had this in the bag!

 

I sat down with the HR lady, and we chit chatted a little about what I was doing in school, and what my hobbies were. Keeping it light and breezy before getting into the nitty gritty of the actual job. I was killing it (so I thought!) She was super interested in the marketing events I was throwing for the universities &amp; colleges from my city. She even pulled out a few of the flyers online for the events, and asked me about the charities we partnered with.

 

What could go wrong here? This lady was super impressed with me, and we deep dove into all of my extracurriculars for like 30 minutes.

 

I left thinking, I got this, there’s no way anyone else had a great interview like that.

 

So I went to school on Monday, and my friend Melanie was telling me she had a great interview as well; we were both excited to hear back early that week. Monday, no call… Tuesday, no call… Wednesday, I step out of class and I have a voicemail from the same lady. “Hi Joey, thanks for interviewing with us last week. We’ve decided to go with another candidate, and will keep your resume on file for the future. Thank you, and have a great day!”

 

What just happened? Melanie was standing nearby checking her voicemail as well… Neither of us got the job. We were super pissed, and couldn’t understand why we were passed over. I can tell you, that HR lady’s ears must’ve been burning that afternoon because all we did was bash her decision for like 3 hours.

 

What we didn’t know at the time, another student from our class got the job! This girl was so shy and socially awkward, how could she have done better than us in the interview? I didn’t understand their decision, and just brushed it off thinking to myself, they missed out on me, and they’ll regret it!

 

Does anyone know what I did wrong that afternoon? I surely didn’t back then, and I can laugh at myself now because I wouldn’t have hired me either.

 

This law firm was looking for a summer intern… And here I walked in, a full time student, with tons of extracurriculars taking up a huge amount of my time. What the hell would a law firm want with a summer student that can’t do extra hours if needed? My time was my time, and I was proud to talk about it.

 

Here’s what I should’ve done if I really wanted the job, and probably what that other student did.

 

1-    Asked the professor who set up the interview if she knew the firms’ needs &amp; pain points. I agreed to interview knowing nothing about the firm.

 

2-    Walked in with reasons why I’d be a great fit for the job (even though these events were taking up a lot of my time, they were events I created to stay busy… I didn’t need to continue doing them.)

 

3-    Asked way more questions during the interview; all I did was answer her questions. I left having no real idea what the internship would entail.

 

4-    Followed up to thank them for the opportunity, and asked what I could still help with. I never even called back, I listened to the voicemail and that was that.

 

5-    Done some self reflection after the interview. I didn’t get it for a reason, and I blamed the HR lady instead of looking at what I could’ve done better.

 

6-    Figured out how to set up more interviews for another internship. Why did I put all my eggs into that one basket?

 

 

Do I still interview the same way? Of course not! I’ve learned the social skills needed to be successful with that first impression.

 

If you do the important work first, you can walk into that social setting a little more cool, calm, and collected.

 

Thank you,

Have a great day!

Because of that I was thinking of going to college to get a bachelor's in web/software development. With the financial aid there's a small possibility that I'd have to spend very little out of pocket, and they also have internship opportunities as well which I feel would help greatly for getting secured into this industry.  

But at the moment I'm concerned about the self-taught route. A few days ago there was a post about ""Who Killed The Junior Developer?"", which explained the diminishing job market for junior developers. If this is the case, I feel like being self-taught just may not be enough anymore. I know plenty of people have gotten jobs being self-taught, but is this still the case in 2018? Will it still be the case in 2019, 2020 and beyond? Is it still just about having a great portfolio/github/linkedin? Sometimes I get anxiety just thinking about this stuff since it seems like so many people are flooding into this field and I don't want to miss out. Or I end up browsing job postings just to see if there are any junior positions still out there.  

Ultimately I just want to be able to start making money with web development by the end of this year because I feel like I can do it. Every day I spend at least 3 hours to learn new things from Udemy and TeamTreeHouse and I am fairly satisfied with the trajectory of my skillset so far. Is this the path to continue with for now, and perhaps consider college next year if it hasn't worked out yet? Or will it be too late for the market? "

UCs do not superscore, but require all test scores - of one test - to be sent

  

**Letters of Recommendation:**

  

UC Berkeley requested 2 teacher recommendation letters from me. I sent recommendations from my AP Physics 1 and AP Calculus AB teachers’ of junior year. Both classes pertain to my intended major The letters should be good. In the crib sheet I provided my teachers, I included a lot of information entailing my passion for computer science and the skills/qualities I possessed in the class. That should have helped make the recommendations strong. My AP Calculus AB teacher had actually given me an award during my freshman year (I had her for 2 years) highlighting my strong qualities and abilities to go above and beyond in her class, so I know she can say good things about me for sure. Especially since my math grades were low in tenth grade, I'm sure my AP Calculus AB teacher's recommendation can only help me. 

  
  
  

**Essays:**

  

&gt; Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time.

  
  

I talked about my volunteering in the library where I worked with other kids and helped them develop. I talked about one specific example where I helped a boy who was struggling to make a kaleidoscope in one of the crafts events, and how it made me feel, and how it made the boy feel.

  

&gt; What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?

  

I talked about my skill in coding/computer science. The essay first had a hook of me getting hired for a software engineering internship as a rising senior, and then I tied it back to the journey which brought me to that stage - books, online courses, school courses, etc. I made sure to mention how the internship made me confident I would succeed as a software engineer and how I was eager to learn more. I also showed demonstrated interest and proved that the UCs were a right fit for me in this essay by citing a UCSD course I took and explaining how I got a good vibe from the professors and the course in general.

  

&gt; Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.

  

If you look at the google doc with my grades, you will see my horrible grades during sophomore year (specifically in Pre-Calculus Honors during the first semester). I used this essay to talk about what happened, what I learned from the drop in grades, and how I showed personal growth. The essay started with a hook of me anxiously opening my AP scores and being so happy when I saw the “5” I got on the Calculus AB exam.

  

&gt; Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?

I was born with a low muscle tone. I talked about how I didn’t let this (for a lack of better words) defect affect me negatively or classify me as someone different. I learned to ride a two-wheeler and swim at a very young age. I also started taking Martial Arts lessons in first grade and pursued it until my sophomore year of high school without giving up. I learned numerous life skills through Martial Arts, such as honesty, respect, responsibility, focus, determination, and to never be a quitter. This helped me show positive trends in school, which my teachers often recognized. I ended the essay by talking about how when I received my 2nd degree black belt in martial arts, I realized I was no less than others, but in fact stronger than many of the other testers since I had an adversity but didn’t let it stop me.

  

**Extracurriculars:**

  

*Coursework outside of school:*

  

1. Decoding AP Computer Science A - Udemy 
2. UCSD Java OOP (Object Oriented Programming) - Coursera 
3. JHU (Johns Hopkins University) Web Development - Coursera  
4. UMich (University of Michigan) Python - Coursera 
  

*Volunteering:*

  

1. Worked with kids in the library by being a leader and role-model, and helping them develop. 
2. Prepared lunches to feed the homeless. For privacy reasons, I will not state the organization at which I did this. 
3. Helped with planning, preparation, and execution of holiday events. For privacy reasons, I will not state the organization at which I did this. 
  
  

*Work Experience:*

  

NONE (I did have an internship, but I got paid under the table, and did not want to get in any legal trouble, so left this blank)

  
  

*Extracurriculars:*

  

1. Software Engineering Internship in silicon valley at one of the best web design companies in the nation. if I recall correctly, this company made UC Berkeley and Stanford's current website. 
2. Sunday Cultural Immersion Class 
3. Kumon 
4. Martial Arts 
5. Computer Science Club in School 
  

**Other Notes:**

  

I know that UC Irvine, UCSB, UCSD, UCLA, and UC Berkeley are all reaches for me. My GPA is bogging me down, and although that essay may help adcoms look at it less harshly (and the UCSD course which I took may help a bit for that university), the GPA is still going to be atrociously low. Could I get in? Maybe. Am I counting on it? No. I would like to know how much of a reach these universities are. Ultimately, it is up to the adcoms to decide whether I get in or not, but I just want to know how much I should get my hopes up for these universities. 

  

I would also like to know how much of a match/safety, UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, and UC Riverside are. 

  

If you would like any other additional information, please let me know! 

  

I’m really hoping to get into a UC or CSU for that thicc in-state tuition. So far, I’ve only received out-of-state decisions. 

  

Thanks!

  

**Decisions received so far:** 

  

- UT Dallas (accepted for Software Engineering) 
- Purdue (accepted for Web Programming and Design) 
- University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (rejected for Computer Science) 
- UT Austin (rejected for Computer Science)

**EDIT:** Regarding the time commitments for the extracurriculars: I spent TONS of time volunteering, TONS of time in the internship, a good amount of time in the CS courses, TONS of time in Martial Arts, a mediocre time in the CS club (but then again, the club only met once a week for half an hour), a decent amount of time in kumon, a good amount of time in the sunday cultural class (we meet for an hour on most Sundays). So even if it seems to you that I wasn't involved a lot, **I was**. The time commitments on the application show that."
7yaqwg,15,2018-02-17,Rejected on due to a lack of references,cse_loser,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7yaqwg/rejected_on_due_to_a_lack_of_references/,"I was in an interview process for a software engineering job, and the last step after my onsite was providing some references from my former/current supervisors. In the email that the company sent me, they detailed saying that they will contact the references to ask questions regarding me on who I am as a person and employee.

The thing was I had only 1 job before my current position, which was an internship 2 years ago. I contacted my old supervisors from that internship, and they told me that they barely remember me, which is understandable given how long ago it was and that there were over 10 interns on the team that year. They gave me the company's HR contact info to confirm my employment, but couldn't provide much more than that. 

I relay this information back to the place that I'm interviewing at, and then they ask for references from my current position. I told them that I didn't feel comfortable with that, and was given a rejection letter a few days later detailing that the reason why is that I wasn't able to provide reference from a former/current supervisor. 

Kinda bummed that this happened. Do you guys have any advice for situations like this for the future? Something I want opinions on so I have a better understanding on how to handle things like this."

I've fairly grasped the principles of programming, OOP, and data structures. I've played around with Java, C, and Python, so I'm kind of comfortable with each of them.
Now I'm kind of stumped on what to do next. 

Ideally, I think I'd be very interested in Data Analysis and that sort of thing, but at the same time I feel like I want to gain more ""general software"" experience to become a well rounded developer before diving into the data analysis part.

Should I take on Python and try on stuff like crawling social media websites and have some fun with that? (That's very interesting to me). Or should I try and build something with Java first (web app or something) to further enhance my general software development skills? ( I want to do that because I'm hoping to land a software internship this summer, and figured this would help sharpen my skills for that).

Any advice at all is appreciated! Thanks!"

Particle accelerators are amazing machines. Some of them are even leading the way to new and radical therapies for heart diseases. Considering their wide range of applications and potential to help people, I was eager to join a small, privately funded project while I was still in college, working my way toward a Physics degree. The position was an unpaid internship, but I would be getting course credits for it, which was another positive.

I was huddled with the group of students who had been accepted, though it was so early in the morning, not many of us were feeling talkative. The shuttle arrived on time and once we boarded I went back to sleep, not even waiting for the wheels to start rolling. I came back to my senses during the trip, and looked around. Most of the others were still asleep but a few of the other guys were staring out the windows.

It wasn't much longer before the bus stopped outside a rather ordinary looking concrete building. We were ushered through a security check, and then into a classroom. We were given a quick orientation, introduced to the heads of the projects, Doctor Herrin, and Doctor Walker. They talked for a few minutes each, but didn't reveal any huge information. We were given a tour of the facility next, which woke me back up after nearly being lulled to sleep by the droning voices of the men.

The facility was amazing, the level below the one with the lobby was full of technicians and computers, the overhead lights dim, and the room slightly cold. We didn't spend long here, and our tour guide barely said anything, moving us back out into the hallway and into the elevator once more. The next stop was the break rooms and where the on-site staff lived. The rooms were nice and there was a large television with surround sound.

Finally we rode down another level to see the accelerator and the control room. The massive, circular tube glittered under the lighting, taking away my breath and that of the other newbies, I'm sure. The control room was just as amazing. I was only half paying attention to the words flowing from the woman who was leading our group's mouth. We were then fed a decent dinner, and sent back to the Campus on the shuttle.

I was still too excited to sleep when I got back to my dorm room, and paced the floor between random internet browsing sessions until I did pass out shortly after midnight. I woke up before my alarm went off and showered thoroughly but quickly. After getting dressed, I bounded downstairs, making my way to the nearest coffee pop-up, before walking back to the the bus stop to wait for the shuttle, other people appearing at random intervals. 

Some of them had coffee and looked just as excited as I felt, and there was a slight buzz of conversation, though I stayed disengaged, not purposely. I was daydreaming, staring at the sky and the masses of fluffy clouds. The sound of the shuttle engine approaching called me back to my senses, and I stood up, stretching out a little as the vehicle pulled up to the curb, then boarded the small bus, eyes staying open for the entirety of our ride.

There wasn't much to see in the way of scenery, but that just gave me an opportunity to fantasize more about exactly what the goal of our project was. Thoughts of creating something life saving or even world changing dancing through my young mind. The vehicle stopped at the building and we disembarked, going through security and were instructed to go back to the class room. I was getting kind of impatient to get started, but kept my frustration to myself, fidgeting in my chair while we waited for one of the project leads.

Both men entered the room, and split us into three groups. I was in the second, and was told to follow him down to the accelerator level. My excitement spiked as the six of us walked into the hall after the first wave of people, leaving four alone in the room. We were taken down the stairs and shown an evacuation plan posted on the wall just outside the door. We were also shown the locations of Fire Extinguishers.

Another safety class was given, and this time I paid full attention to what the man was saying, but I'm not going to bore you with it. I was shown to my station, and given a quick run through of my exact duties, which included staring at a video feed, looking at a computer screen, and pressing a button if I noticed anything anomalous. That was the first time I had ever seen one of the massive, circular tubes powered up.

The feed from the inside of the machine was almost hypnotic. The particle appearing as a tiny point of light that whizzed through my field of vision almost too fast to comprehend after its second trip around, gaining speed. That was when they released the quark into the tube, sending it in the opposing direction to the charged object. I watched as they passed by each other, gaining speed with each revolution until they finally smashed into one another.

There was a flash of light and the images on the monitor shuddered. The computer started spitting out numbers faster than I could read them. There was nothing strange that day, that I noticed and after I helped go through the data with a woman who barely spoke three words to me, it was time to board the shuttle home. I fell asleep with far more ease this time around, but woke up no less eager to return to the building.

I arrived at the stop early again, sipping a coffee. Despite the caffeine and the adrenaline buzzing through my system, I fell asleep on the ride again. I was still a bit sleepy as we made our way through the metal detector. There were no special directions that morning, so we continued to our work stations. The first collision of the day was very similar to the one the day before. We shut the machine down and  took a break.

There was barbecue for lunch that afternoon, which was a welcome surprise. We ate outside, in the mild spring warmth of the hillside. I found a tree to sit under alone, and walked back inside before most of the others, using the toilet and washing my hands, then face. When I returned to my section of the control room, there were a pair of men installing another piece of equipment, plugging that in to my terminal.

Doctor Herrin showed up, and explained that we would be doing a new, rather exciting experiment working with a new type of quark, which hadn't been named or classified yet. The new equipment would help me to regulate the magnetic field within the tube itself, allowing us to prolong the life-span of the new particles these quarks could create. They had strange properties but tended to decay quickly, leaving little residual data behind.

I started getting even more excited than I had been before. This was far more cutting edge stuff than what I had imagined. After the men in the plain drab green uniforms finished their task, they disappeared through the door. There was another forty-five or so minutes of down time before they started the machine again. I waited for the button on the new console to turn blue before I pressed it, and a matrix of lightning arced through the chamber before disappearing. A readout appeared on my computer monitor, showing the charge level of the containment field.

I pressed the intercom button after clearing my throat, my mouth suddenly slightly dry as anticipation rolled through every part of my mind and body. “All green.” I said, just as I had been instructed to do. They released the other, nearly invisible thing into the tube and it began to speed up, just as the particles earlier that day had. None of my readings spiked, or even changed that much. The thrill of witnessing something new washed over me again.

The collision took place, and there was a deep boom that was accompanied by a near nuclear-bright flash that had me seeing spots despite the filtering on the lens of the interior camera. When I finally blinked my vision clear, I saw something in my monitor that I still can't totally explain. The object was small, about half the size of a grape, and a strange hue that was almost but not quite black. The shape was hard to define as well.

I initially thought it was a semi-sphere, but it elongated and danced, seeming to vibrate as it hovered in mid air. I broke its hold on me, pressing the intercom button. “Doctor Herrin.” I said, unable to keep my voice from cracking. “You need to see this.” He replied and I turned my head to check the charge of the electrical field, which was still at full power. I started to relax a little, even though I couldn't keep my eyes off the strange object in the accelerator. 

When the man appeared next to me, his reaction told me that we had accomplished his goal, or at least the first phase of said goal before he said as much. He rushed back to the main control room, starting the second part of the experiment. Another particle was introduced into the device and began the acceleration process before being guided onto its collision course with the strange, almost crystalline object.

When the tiny streak of light finally did impact the shimmering, shifting mass, the entire building shook. Another flash of light happened and this time my eyes took a little longer to readjust than before. When I was able to look at the screen with the video feed, there was a miniature lightning storm happening inside the tube. The phenomena was surrounding the strange, shifting thing, and then suddenly it seemed to fold in on itself and then disappear.

That was when a small rip in the fabric of reality itself formed in the fun house that the interior of the accelerator had become. I could barely comprehend what I saw beyond the darkness in that tear, but I was eternally grateful when it closed. Things still didn't look normal for another full minute and then I heard an audible snap, much like the breaking of a dry tree branch, and things normalized. They were starting to cycle the machine down.

I was making notes in the computer, namely the timestamps of when the strange activity was on the video feed when something glimmering to my right caught my eye. I turned my head, and was surprised to see a dime floating about three inches from the top of the counter. My hand started moving toward the button for the intercom, and other objects in the room began to levitate as well. Pens and paperclips performed acrobatics in front of my eyes.

I was mesmerized for thirty seconds and managed to shake myself out the stupor, pressing the button at long last. I was informed not so politely that I “wasn't the only one with gravity issues”. That was when I felt some of the pressure in my back and knees lessen. Aches and pains began to fade after a few minutes of moving around the room under the lessened atmospheric pressure. Breathing was a little bit easier as well. Chairs began to lift from the floor, barely at first, just hovering above the tile. They began to rise a little higher after a few more minutes passed.

Within twenty minutes I was practically wearing moon shoes. When my feet left the floor I panicked a little, but got myself under control. Doctor Herrin and a pair of men I had never seen before literally drifted into the room. “So it's just as strong here. We need to check the other levels.” I nodded and we basically pulled ourselves along any ledge we could catch as we moved into the hallway. We had to basically walk along the wall with our hands as we began rising higher.

To be honest, I didn't mind the weightlessness much, and neither did many of the older members of the staff. Many of them could be overheard saying that their arthritis was barely effecting them as they cut cartwheels and flips in the air. Doctor Herrin eventually sent me and another intern to check the lobby. The lessened gravity was still present but a bit weaker. I could actually touch my feet to the ground again.

I was hesitant to go outside, but I did so, keeping hold of the handle on the door for longer than necessary. The further I got from the building, the more normal the pressure on my body became. My left knee started to ache a little bit, as it often did in the morning, the result of an old baseball injury. I made my way back inside, and down to the level that the doctor was on to report my findings, glad to find that things had stopped rising toward the ceiling on the lower levels. 

Doctor Herrin didn't look amused as he stared at the computer monitor bolted to the floor, hands using the sides of the kiosk to regulate his height. He seemed more pleased by my news that the gravity was far more normal in the lobby and suggested we move up there before connecting his tablet to the machine, downloading the data onto the portable device before we moved back toward the elevators, again hand-walking along the wall.

We got to the lobby and took a hallway I had barely noticed before, into a singular, dimly lit conference room. The whole room had a creepy vibe to it. We sat in the modern chairs, and the doctor showed us some rather disturbing spikes and dips in the magnetic field inside the accelerator which we had somehow managed to maintain for hours. That was when the earth began to shake rather than just the building. 

We exchanged perplexed and worried looks before leaving the room again, heading for the elevator. When the doors opened onto the accelerator level, things were noticeably different. The chairs and assorted odds and ends that had been freely flying had began bobbing, as had a few of the people unlucky enough to have been caught in the hallways. I watched one man get slammed brutally into the floor, his knee snapping on impact.

I had hit rather hard myself, as had the other intern, though nothing broke, the doctor nearly landed on me, hitting his back and shoulder awkwardly. The gravity lightened up again and we went from walking to floating once more. This time we did hit the ceiling, though we were all prepared, raising our hands to divert ourselves. I cut a flip as I entered the control room and almost immediately regretted it as gravity returned as soon as I completed the revolution.

I landed hard enough to hurt my good knee and hip. My left knee practically exploded with agony. Walking and breathing were difficult, but I couldn't tell if gravity was increasing, or my leg was just that injured. I cleared the tears from my eyes and noticed that other people were having difficulty moving around as well. We got to the machine that controlled the Magnetic Field, and I barely understood the flood of numbers on the black background. “That's not fucking good.” Doctor Herrin said just before we slammed downward again.

I was ready this time. When my feet hit the floor, I let myself crumple, and it was remarkably hard to even sit up, but I managed to get back to my feet. There was an ear-splitting rumbling sound and the building shook again, the sound echoing off the concrete walls loud enough to cause my teeth to ache from the vibration. Literally everything -  myself included seemed to shudder and stretch before snapping back to normal proportions.

I started to cough, barely able to sip air. My eyes felt like they were going to burst and my heartbeat was labored. Survival instinct kicked in. I started inch-worm crawling my way into the hall, glad when the grip of the invisible force began to lessen again. A few of the others were following me once they regained the ability to move themselves. There was a short moment where we began to float again, though not as high as before, able to kind of moon-bounce again.

The next gravity wave hit and the building itself began to sag inward. I looked back as my eyes bulged and I felt something go in the gelatinous orbs, though I could still see. I could see blood coming from the man nearest the control room's mouth. He was gasping and wheezing audibly. Blood started pouring from his nose and I felt wetness running from my tear ducts and nose in thick rivulets. I again half army-crawled until I reached the elevator.

I used the rail in the car to pull myself to my feet, leaning heavily on it, and pressed the button that would take me up to the lobby just as I felt the grip of the crushing force lessen once more. I stepped through the door, and pressed the button that would send the lift back down to the accelerator level before I pressed the evacuation alarm button, running out into the thankfully completely normal gravity outside.

I didn't stop running until I physically collapsed, luckily on someone's front lawn. I passed out, and woke up in a hospital. Almost all of the blood vessels in my eyes had popped. I had multiple minor stress fractures which the doctors were baffled by, and continue to be so. I wasn't going to open my mouth and risk being permanently silenced. I don't know how many of the others made it out alive besides the forty or so people including security on the first floor.

I never went back, and I don't stay in one place too long but I had to get my story out somehow. Just know if you live near one of these machines, even one say, in the basement of a college laboratory, they are dangerous, unpredictable things.

I want to switch my major to IT, and make CS my minor. I would love to get a job in cybersecurity, but my current CS program has almost zero focus on that side of computers. If I were to change to IT, I would learn about networking/socket programming/security, and have more free time to do things that I want to do. For example, I would like to go for some security related certs while studying IT. 

I do not believe I could work on any certs while doing CS (at least with my capabilities). I have a good gpa in all my CS courses + math courses (3.5+), but I am struggling to stay engaged at this point. I really do not want to continue to have to code (for classes) for hours upon hours a week. I feel burnt out at this point with coding. 

I am not interested in software development at all. In fact, I would detest a job in software development after college. I really like cybersecurity. But in my current CS program, I am/will not learn almost anything about security in my remaining semesters. I have become proficient in java, C, and python. So I personally do not feel that I need to continue with CS on that side. I won't give up on coding at all, in fact I would keep continuing to improve my skills. But I just hate the idea of having to program for classes.

I will also have a cybersecurity related internship this summer, so I'll gain some experience in the field.

If I follow through with my plan, by the end of college I should have something like: IT BS degree, CS minor, 1 or 2 security related certs, and cybersecurity internship experience.

I really dislike having to program so much at this point, I want to learn a lot more about security. But as it stands, I don't know if I could handle it with my current amount of work. Plus, the IT program provides insight into this field.

Would my resume look better for security related companies with a CS degree, or an IT degree with a couple of certs and a CS minor?

Like I said, it's not like I will be leaving college without any coding experience. Just have CS as a minor. I have taken many of the upper level CS courses and math courses, but I just want to learn more about the cybersecurity field.

Classes I have taken: Calc I &amp; II, Linear Algebra, Discrete Math I &amp; II, Data Stuctures, Computer Architecture, Systems programming.

I feel that with the classes I have taken, I am proficient at coding, but have learned nothing in the field I want a career in. Please give me some advice. Would my plan be a bad idea?"

I am currently an undergrad CS student at a top 3 school in Canada looking to graduate in a couple years. After graduation I want to enter the industry and live a life as a full time software developer. However, eventually I want to pursue a Masters at some point in my career, and I am worried I might not be able to do so with my low GPA. 

Some info about me:


- My GPA is around 2.9, if I do very well in my next couple terms of school I might be able to bring it up to a 3.0.


- I have worked 5 internships, with one being in Silicone Valley and a 6th internship at a big 4 company coming up this summer.


- Preferably, I want to do a Masters at a respectable institution, but I am aware that my grades are very low to even be competitive.


I am okay with doing a Masters online, since I am unclear where I will be located in a few years.


What are my options or chances of getting accepted to a Masters program? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I am wanting to start down the path of getting a nicer IT job and setting up a career and im unsure of what my best route is going to be.  Here is a little Background:

-Early 30s, Male

-Certificate from respected Community College in Cyber Security, will be upgraded to an Associates in about a year, my last few core classes are proving hard to work in my schedule.  Also I have started some of the networking classes, details in the comments below

-1 year of Helpdesk for a company that subcontracts ISP calls, very solid overall metrics and Performance reviews, also I coded some tools for the company and have access to their ""sandbox""

-Summer internship for a very unique DOD cybersecurity project

-Decent Rankings in every IT competition ive entered (Cybersecurity, Network Admin, Software dev)

-Tons of Self-Development and homelab stuff

-No Certs

-Medium city close to a Military installation

The problem im finding is that in 3 years I have seen 500+ security related jobs, and only 1 has not absolutely had to have a CISSP to get in, so there is NO entry level security jobs here.

The company im with now I have nothing left to learn, most times I am teaching my superiors things and Ive learned all I can learn about ISP side helpdesk.  the company has an internal IT department, and I have a good relationship with everyone that matters, I interviewed a while back for an internal IT helpdesk job but their career path is not logical to me because after commissions I would take a 35% paycut to start in internal IT helpdesk, with no clear position available after that, So its time to move on.

Moving is an option to some major cities in the region, but would like to avoid moving if possible.  The good news is there is alot of Sysadmin, Networking, decent helpdesk opportunities, and im not opposed to working helpdesk in an environment where I can pickup new skills or increase my current knowledge and get official experience to put on my resume.

As for my homelab and self-development I started with an intranet for our house, then added a wiki.  Lately I have been leveraging VDI and other virtualization to play with lots of test environments.
 
So Im guessing getting a cert is going to be my best way forward.  If I had to choose between the Net+, Linux+ and Sec+ exams (or another if you wanna suggest one) which one is going to get me in the door fastest with most companies?"
7yfuuu,3,2018-02-18,Flunked out of school with Depression/ADHD. How can I get back on track &amp; start looking for internship?,throwawayandaway232,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7yfuuu/flunked_out_of_school_with_depressionadhd_how_can/,"This sub has been a great help for my internship search in the past, but I now find myself in a new dilemma.

As of last spring, I was a sophomore CS student at a top 10 university with a software engineering internship lined up at top defense contractor. Unfortunately, I fell into a long depressive episode (likely caused by then undiagnosed ADHD that I’m now receiving treatment for) which led to my academic dismissal from school that semester. I was still able to complete my summer internship doing admittedly mediocre work, but my depression only worsened until the past month or two. As of late, I’ve been trying to get back on the horse and have started taking courses at my local community college with hopes of returning to my original university this coming fall. 

With my efforts to get back on track, I am seeking advice on how to try to land an internship for this summer. I know I’m quite late in the game and my situation probably leaves me as a mostly undesirable candidate, so I don’t really know where to begin this time around. I started applying for Summer 2017 jobs in September and had already had accepted my job offer by this time, but I have yet to submit a single application this year. To make matters worse, I feel like I have lost the small network I had built because I was completely withdrawn for most of the past year. My first thought was to attempt a return to my old company, but they have a rigorous background check process which would certainly show that I had flunked out of college. With those possibilities ruled out, I was hoping somebody would be gracious enough to help steer me in the right direction and answer my questions which I’ll list below. 

Even though it’s so late in the season, would it be in my best interest to quickly throw some projects together prior to sending out applications (I’ve hardly touched any of my projects since last spring) or should I just apply ASAP? 

What kind of companies do you think I’d have the best success with? I was thinking I might have more luck with startups that align with my interests/past work as I would imagine they’d be less likely to look into my educational status and recruit later in the application cycle. If it’s worth noting, I currently live in the DC/Baltimore area and could easily move back with my parents in NY for the summer. I am also open to relocating as long as my pay is enough to break even with rent/living expenses.

If I do choose to focus on startups should I cold-email companies looking for a position even if they don’t have any postings for internships?

When applying, is there any way I can cover up my academic status without being dishonest?

Is it even worth searching for an internship at this point in the season and with my situation or should I just focus all my energy on getting back into my university?

Being this is likely my last summer before graduation (if I return this fall, I would graduate in two semesters + a summer course or two), how much would not having an internship this summer hurt my post-graduation job prospects after being an intern last year?  Keep in mind that this would be coupled by my abysmal GPA that was mostly killed by the semester preceding my dismissal.

I apologize for this post being long and all over the place, I’m just feeling a bit overwhelmed at the moment. I really appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and/or offer advice!"

Please read.,CS-StudentNYC,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7yfyis/in_need_of_advicejust_graduated_but_i_dont_feel/,"Let me start off by saying that this situation that I'm in is very important to me &amp; I don't know what the best way to handle it is.

I'm in quite a predicament &amp; I need some advice. I just received a Bachelors Degree in CS in December 2017 from a state school. Unfortunately, I half-assed a lot of the early CS classes where you learn the fundamentals of programming. I have a few not really-all-that-impressive projects, no internships, 3.53 GPA

Nevertheless, now I'm in a position where I feel like I need to spend a considerable amount of time brushing up on the fundamentals before applying to jobs. However, my friends &amp; family think that I just need to be more confident in myself and just start applying. 

What should I do? Has anybody been in a situation like this? What's the best way to handle it? What resources would you use to go over the fundamentals? I'm not learning the concepts, I just need a very thorough ""brush-up""

Have taken now 2 years of the research class/program offered at my school. First year was doing DNA prep and bioinformatics analysis with the Waksman Student Scholars Program. Second year continued with Waksman but also did an independent research project, published in an online journal for social science. Applied for a few research internships this summer 🤞. 

ECs: 
Editor-In-Chief for the yearbook
Section editor for the newspaper
(Both 2 years)
Science Olympiad since middle school (school went to states twice and I placed 5th in forensics once)
Class Prez in sophomore year
National Honor Society 
3 year Handbells Ringer

Volunteer hours: 100-something from a local library over two summers and a few Saturdays

I can’t drive (too young) and my parents are busy with my sister so I don’t have as much access to extracurriculars as other kids do. And we’re not really connected to the Asian community so I don’t benefit from those sweet connections. I know I’m not very special, I haven’t cured cancer or really won any awards or gone out for programs. I feel like I’m the only one who cares about my educational experience so I have to look out for myself.

Rutgers Honors is already on my mind because I’m so familiar with them. I’ve only been on one college tour (Yale) with hopes of completing my Ivy League+MIT+Stanford hoodie collection by the end of senior year, despite not having very good hopes for them. Where else should I look? All that college spam mail isn’t very useful."

I've been having some second thoughts about my major recently and I thought it would be a good idea to get some perspective here.


I've been looking for ways to beef up my resume (A lot of people in my college tend to take internships around this time) and I hear a lot that doing things like personal projects, CTFs, etc in your spare time is really important. I have been interested in doing infosec projects in my spare time since I still have a lot of prerequisite classes to complete before I start any infosec classes, but when I tried doing these side projects, I didn't feel motivated to continue doing them. The area that sounded most interesting to me was malware reverse engineering, so I gave malware unicorn's RE101 tutorial a try, finished it, and didn't really know where to go from there. After that, I started reading [re4b](beginners.re), found it really daunting and lost interest after a few days.


I haven't felt interested in any other areas of infosec (admittedly I haven't spent a lot of time looking, my coursework eats up a lot of my time and motivation) so I'm thinking there's a decent chance I'm not cut out for this field. Should I start looking at other majors or should I try some other infosec stuff even if it doesn't sound like it'd be my sort of thing?


The second question I have regards work/life balance with infosec careers. I read a lot that people in this field need to spend  time outside of work doing research, reading up on articles, doing personal infosec projects, etc. On average, what percentage of your free time do you spend doing infosec related things?"

My research is going well so far, and I'm expected to graduate in about a year. Leaving with a Masters would also take me about a year (more coursework, since I can't transfer as much), so at this point there's no reason not to finish.   

However, my research area is losing interest and there is little direct relevance to industry: Only a couple companies interested in our project are left, and I'm not sure how long they'll stay.

Now, my goal is to find some research-related job in the US after I graduate. Since there's little opportunity in my exact field, I'm thinking about other options. **I had the following ideas in mind:**

**1) Try to get 1-2 industry internships, preferably at a big company.**

It's much easier for me to find an internship related to my work in a government or non-profit lab. But how much do they help for industry research positions? Or even SWE positions?

How important is the size/recognition of the company? How useful would a name like Cisco, Intel, Microsoft Research, Google Research be for my future job search? Or is the actual job experience of the internship more relevant?  
 
**2) Try to publish research in areas that are more appreciated by industry.**

For example, there are some workshops on the overlap between Computer Networks and Machine Learning/AI/Big Data. Would it make sense to delay my graduation to publish something related to these topics? 

**3) Look into some of the data science ""bootcamps""?** 

Like ""The Data Incubator"" or ""Insight Data Science"". Does anyone have experience with these programs? 

Any other ideas? Thanks for your help!

P.S. As it was suggested to me earlier, I made this post shorter and more to the point.

7yhqm6,2,2018-02-18,Don't know what to do this summer and really stressed,calmdowntoughgirl,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7yhqm6/dont_know_what_to_do_this_summer_and_really/,"There are three places I could possibly be this summer: the city where I go to college (west coast), the city where I grew up (east coast), or Europe. 

I originally planned on getting an internship on the west coast at an architecture firm but things fell through and that is no longer an option. However, my friend already agreed to sublet to me for cheap and I could try and find a job at a cafe or restaurant or something. I don't have an assured job there at all, and employment in this city isn't guaranteed. However, I'm in the process of slowly relocating to this city and spending the summer there would help me to find a permanent residence and perhaps a steady job (as opposed to one just for the summer).

I could go back to the east coast and stay with my parents and work at this cafe I used to work at (I know they'd hire me back for the summer). The problem with this is that, while I know I'd have a job, my whole life is on the west coast now and I don't have any friends or support network in that city, and I generally find myself really lonely when I'm home. I worked in this city last summer and was quite depressed and lonely. But I know I'd be making money and I liked the cafe I used to work at.

The last choice is really just a pipe dream - I'm currently in Italy and I have European citizenship and I speak Italian so could technically try and find a job here and stay for the summer. This is the least likely scenario, I can't decide if it's even worth pursuing, but is also my dream.

I know it seems stupid but I'm actually quite anxious. The internship falling through really screwed with a lot of my plans and now I feel like everything is in flux and with every option I am giving something up. What would you do?"
7yi7c0,2,2018-02-18,"Recently got very interested/committed to learning as much as I can, I feel comfortable with “core Java” but I am overwhelmed with what to learn in my free time now, what’s an efficient path?",LoganRLX,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7yi7c0/recently_got_very_interestedcommitted_to_learning/,"So I am a sophomore currently and I am taking “Java-2”, it’s called Intro to OOP-2 though. I am also in an assembly language/architecture class, currently learning C until we get to more in depth assembly language itself. Anyways, I have read through the entire book for the java class already and I want to keep learning/familiarizing my self with anything that going to help me master Java. 

So it may seem like I haven’t researched this but I have, and I can’t figure out what I really should start with. I don’t have an end goal/motive other than just trying to learn things that can help me before I get a job or internship. I am overwhelmed with the varying opinions and just want some guidance :-). What do you think I should learn next, commonly used frameworks/libraries? If so, could you give me an idea what maybe 5 I should focus on and in what order? I’ve heard everything Spring MVC, Hibernate, Guava, GSON, JUnit (I have done some uniting testing with JUnit 4 for class but certainly not enough to be proficient or to “know it”), JavaEE, etc. you get the point, there is a ton. Where do I even start? Or should I focus on something completely different? I am overwhelmed and want to do whatever will benefit me but feel lost so any guidance is helpful. 

As a side note, I didn’t think about internships until recently, is it too late for me to try and find a internship? I have only taken one other programming class before (intro to OOP-java) and don’t have any other experience so I feel super under qualified compared to most interns I have read about plus due to being a sophomore who switched majors to CS this year but will be graduating in Spring 2020, this only gives me two more summers to get an internship before I graduate. Next semester I am taking Data Structures, Discrete Mathematics, Software Engineering, and Web Development, so till then I feel like there’s no reason for a company to give me an internship, do you think that’s true, especially since I am not a freshmen. 


TLDR: Feel like I know basic OOP &amp; Java to a good level, but I am overwhelmed by how many choices there are to start learning next, so what would you recommend, frameworks?, another language?, let me know :) I have been practicing just to improve in general but I want to expand my knowledge.

I currently make 77k.  A quick google search reveals that the average for my area is 93k.  Recently I learned that we hired an intern -&gt; associate SE for 75k.  Another intern -&gt; associate SE for 80k.  I started at this company making 63k in 2014 which I now know was very low.  My manager's all tried to increase my salary because they themselves admit it is low(current manager as well).  They put my salary into review 2 years ago but I was capped with a 2k raise because I had already been promoted that year and given another annual raise.  The 2k more put me at a 15% increase for the year.  Which at the time was my company's cap without going to the CEO for approval.
Glassdoor shows that Senior SEs at my company and location make 125 - 130k.  

As far as work performance, I went from an intern -&gt; Senior software engineer in 3 years and am generally regarded as a hard worker.  I have been on 2 huge projects for my company that have put us in the black for the past few years.  My manager and I have a great relationship and just recently he acknowledged my low salary.  I figure now is the time to ask for the raise because my manager seems thrilled with my performance and I just finished a huge feature that my company is expecting to be very successful. 

Thing is, I love working where I do and don't want to leave.  I also don't want to damage the relationships and good reputation for this raise.  I'm thinking that I will initially offer 105k but be willing to settle for 95k.  About 20k over what Im paid now. 

Can anyone offer some advise or strategies I can undertake to ensure a successful discussion? Thanks! "

I’m a Euro guy studying software engineering in Prague and hopefully finishing my bachelor studies next year. I have been reading this sub and honestly have slightly mixed feelings about software engineering career prospects in Europe.

I’ve been fortunate enough to have got internship experience at three companies - a startup in Portugal(alive and growing), mid size product company in Prague and Shopify in Canada where I will be returning also for upcoming summer. I worked almost ultimately in web development, both front but more back end in Ruby so I consider myself a web developer - Ruby engineer.

I like the idea of working in Berlin or London as I love these cities. However, I have no clue what kind of compensation I could expect with my experience, being a new graduate. Furthermore, the numbers in the threads regarding these cities on this sub are not very motivating since 30-50k € brutto I make as an intern in Canada, and they even provide housing &amp; catered food. 

I would greatly appreciate any suggestions about what direction to take.

Also, what are some better Ruby companies in Europe?

Thank you very much"
7yj04b,15,2018-02-18,What are your thoughts on a contiguous 4+1 year B.S to M.S Computer Science program?,HilariouslyLargeBong,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7yj04b/what_are_your_thoughts_on_a_contiguous_41_year_bs/,"I'm currently a Junior at the University of California, Santa Cruz and the school offers a contiguous degree program in which I could get a Masters in CS with just 1 extra year of schooling. But I'm unsure if this is the best move for my future because I'd be graduating as a Masters student with zero work experience and I just don't know how marketable that is. So i've written out the following list of Pro's and Con's to help form a decision but now I just need advice from someone, specifically from recruiters, interviewers, and people who hire new grads.

**PROS**

* No disruption between work and school. Meaning I don't have to go back to school after already working and the knowledge I need for my graduate courses is still fresh in my head. As a grad student I'd be taking courses on things like Machine Learning, A.I, Advanced Algorithm analysis, etc. These courses involve a lot of the math and skills I've been learning about in my undergrad courses (like Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, Algorithms and Analysis of Algorithms). All of that would be fresh in my mind and I wouldn't have to study all of that again 

* In my head it sounds like I can finally apply all of the math and theory that I've been learning so far! Stuff that everyone says is important as an undergrad but you never do anything useful with as student.


**CONS**

* I've already planned out my schedule for the rest of my Bachelors Degree and I have zero free quarters to take on an internship. I'm basically going to be at school every quarter, including summer sessions, all the way up till I'd be a grad student because I just have too many General Ed's + upper divs to finish in the 2 years since I started here (I'm a transfer student and this is only my second quarter). That leads in to the next point...

* How *marketable* is someone with a M.S in Computer Science yet they have **no internship/job experience**? How does a new grad with a Masters and no intern experience compare with someone with a B.S + internship experience? (Technically I'd have some research experience and work experience as a TA but no industry experience).

* Cost, obviously I'd be paying for this myself although I would make some money as an undergrad TA. Clearly not as good as having a company that I work with pay for it partially or fully. (How common is this anyways?)

And then there's other things like all of my fears of:

* Being only good in theory and not a good programmer in practice. 
* Being *overqualified* for entry level/junior positions in the sense of holding a Masters and *under-qualified* for not having the work experience 

Honestly with the schedule I have to follow it seems like I have 1 of 3 choices: 

1) Graduate with a B.S in Computer Science with no internships but possibly a small project or two.

2) Graduate with a M.S in Computer Science with no internship experience 

3) Extend my B.S graduation date by an extra quarter to fit in time for an internship or personal project.

Long post but I need some advice from people who aren't my college advisors, graduate advisors, or my peers. "
7yjg77,8,2018-02-18,I am currently studying CS and I am looking for advice.,M4J0R_CH335E,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/7yjg77/i_am_currently_studying_cs_and_i_am_looking_for/,"Greetings, Reddit. About a year ago I got out of the Military after eight years being a jet mechanic and started going to school for Cyber Security this past Fall. I haven't chosen a focus yet, but I am intrigued about Network Security. Lately I have been trying to teach myself some extremely basic stuff and I came to realize I need some further guidance because I don't even know where to start.

So, I take a criminal justice course (My school pushes all Cyber majors to minor in CRJ for Forensics because its their creme de'le creme) and the class is pretty split. It is consisted of mostly juniors with some freshmen. I am among some of the freshmen and my professor is obviously aware, but it gave us an assignment to do that is geared toward juniors. The assignment is to seek out potential organizations, companies, firms, etc. and get information about internships - my professor does this so that the juniors can prepare to start looking for internships because it is required in order to graduate. My professor figures that it would be good for us freshmen in the class to look into this as well (I don't disagree).

So by now you're probably asking ""WTF does this have to do with Cybersecurity"". Well, here is the kicker, I called this place that seemed appealing to intern at. I told the guy what I doing a project blah, blah, blah, and this guy started talking and he was feeding me JUST enough information that I should learn before interning, or at least, what should an intern already know before working for him. I asked him about certs, specifically Network+ and Security+ from CompTIA - he said they were basically trash. He told me ""I don't give a shit what school you graduate from, if its Harvard or MIT, but if you walk in here with a OSCP cert, I will hire you on the spot because then I will know you did your 'homework."" 

I know I want to be a penn tester because I believe, in my opinion, that this line of work is going to be beneficial in the future. but after talking to this guy and doing a little research on the OSCP test for the cert its obvious that this guy wasn't bullshitting. 

Now, I'm not saying I want to work for this company, but after looking at some things that he mentioned I am even more intrigued to learn, but I don't know where to even start. 

What are the crypto languages that I need to learn?  What books should I consider reading? Should I focus on programming? Should I focus on coding? Whats the difference? Are the languages universal? I understand that people use Kali, but why? Why Kali and not Mac? or PC? I know people use PC to dual boot Kali, or just boot Kali straight up from USB - or some type of Linux variant. Are there terminal simulators that are available instead of just running a live Terminal and risk messing my computer up? How did you guys learn? I am only familiar with the very basic concept of- ""If you want a computer to do something, you need to know how to talk to it"" and Operation Systems have basically made ""talking"" to your computer a lost art.   

My school is a liberal arts university, but they're money maker is really criminal justice and financial fraud investigations, but it is also ranked 4 (or 6 idr) out of the ""Top 10 Schools"" in my state for cyber security, but I think thats because they push Forensics --hard, to go hand in hand with Criminal Justice and they do have a good programs for Cyber Forensics from what I can tell by talking to other students already working in the field. (which is funny to me because some of the students i've spoke to know how to extract data from a M.2 SSD, but don't know what a PCIe 1x slot is) So I have a little bit of doubt whether or not I will be able to learn what I need to learn to eventually become a white hat and I want to start learning this now, rather than later, so I have the experience I need to be successful. 

Currently, I read CompTIA's fifth edition of Security+ when I have some free time and I have Network+ on pre-order since the ninth edition is coming out sometime in June, or July. If there are some other book suggestions I can read and some other simulator resources out there I can practice messing around with the command line, that would be awesome if you could pass that info along.

1) I want to improve my GPA for grad school
2) This would allow me to finish my double major in Applied Math

My question would be is taking an extra semester that much of a detriment to grad school admissions?  I'd be going to a Masters first because I'm not sure yet whether it is in my best interests for a PhD.

Another thing I'm wondering about is how the internship situation would work out for me.  For the summer before my last semester, that would be another summer where I'd be available to intern.  For the summer after that, it's a bit unclear since I'd have a few months between my last semester of undergrad and my first semester of grad school.  I'd definitely plan on going to hackathons here and there on the weekends, but I'd have nothing on the weekdays.  Any means (internships, part-time developemtn jobs) of gaining experience during this long gap?"

Haven't done anything!,DrPotato2301,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/7ykt3w/rant_have_a_midterm_exam_and_a_project_submission/,"I just wanted to vent some frustration out to help with getting the thoughts out of my head. I apologize if the post gets long. I'll add a TL;DR in the end. 



I'm an international grad student and I'm working as a part-time intern in a startup which pays me $16 per hour for 20 hours a week (can't work more than that because of international student status). I had a certification exam two weeks ago (paid $300 for the exam and $150 for study materials + practice tests). But I kept procrastinating till the end and I failed the exam. The $450 is gone for good as the online study materials and practice test expired last week. I probably have to spend the same to take the exam again. My 1.5 weeks pay was gone for my first try at the exam. And I have to work for around the same duration to make enough money to take the exam again. 



Because of that, I got into the phase of where I hated myself which lasted 2 days. And the next day, my attitude changed and I had a huge motivation boost to work harder and not to repeat the same thing again. I started to make schedules in advance and was sticking to them. 



Guess what! The motivation from that incident didn't last too long. And here I am writing a post in the middle of a similar cycle which most likely will lead to a similar ending - fucking up a midterm exam and a project report submission. Anyways here goes: 



I had planned to study for the midterm 1(worth 15% of the total grade) and work on a project and its report(worth 30% of the total grade) during this weekend. I've been taking my medication as prescribed and have been in an empty breakout room in my university, where I can study without any distractions. It really helped me focus a lot but on the wrong fucking things! 



But, here is what I did yesterday: 


* Wasted around 6 hours playing Dota 2 with my friends 
* Went to the university around 5 pm to study yesterday and found myself an empty breakout room. 
* Organized the practice questions + answers in a single word file.
* Collected a lot of materials to work on the Project and organized them. 
* Spent 2 hours on Facebook without even realizing I was on Facebook for so long. 
* I'm having a housewarming party next Saturday and I spent more than an hour inviting people and around 2 hours creating a party playlist. 


I started feeling hungry around 10.30 in the night. So I went back home had food and tried to sleep. But I wasn't able to sleep and I started watching random videos on YouTube. By the time I got to my senses, it was 3.30 in the night. I shut down my phone and went to sleep.


Today, I woke up at around 11 in the morning and this is what I did: 


* Went to get my groceries for the next week. 
* Taught my roommate about vaping 101, taught him how to use his first vape and helped him find deals for e-liquid for his vape. 
* I came to the university, found myself an empty breakout room and I practiced 2 of the 40 practice problems. I got a phone call from a  friend from undergrad and we talked for about 40 mins about how things are going with both of us and made plans to meet up during the spring break. 
* Once I was done with the call, I didn't go back to studying and instead I started watching a few videos about how to deal with the awkward stage while growing my hair from my current crew cut(I'm a guy) and the other things that I have to know about growing long hair. (I've been thinking about reading about this for a while and the thought occurred to me out of nowhere right after the phone call) 
* From there, I moved on to watch videos and researched about reducing the acne scars, researched about Microdermabrasion, derma rollers, face washes, scrubs and DIY home remedies for reducing the scars. I made an Amazon list of things to buy to help with the acne scars. 
* I spent about 5 hours with the growing long hair and acne scar reduction stuff. 
* Realized that I wasted the past two days and that I probably won't have enough time to prepare well for the exam and give my best in the project. I started feeling self-hatred for wasting time and anxious because of the lack of time. And I ended up spending about an hour on r/GetMotivated and r/ADHD to try to calm me down. It worked a bit I guess. 



It's past midnight already and I have to study for the midterm exam from 3 pm - 4.30 pm, and work on the Project submission(have to do data exploration, build a multiple regression model and write up a report) at 7 pm.



I'm currently in the final semester of my graduate program and I cannot afford to fuck this up. I'm gonna try and give my best! At this point, with the time available for me, I'm hoping I'll be able to get at least 50% on the midterm and at least 70-80% on the project report. 



So, I need around 8 hours to prepare for my midterm 1 and 4-5 hours to work on a project + report. Gonna pull an all-nighter once again. The thought of wanting to read about how to pull an effective all nighter just came to my mind. But not going to act on it. I'm going to start studying right after I post this. 



FML LOL! Idk whether to laugh at my situation or hate myself because of the situation I'm in. 



**TL;DR: I haven't started studying for the exam(worth 15% of total grade) at 3pm or work on the Project(30% of total grade) submission at 7pm, but ended up falling into hyper-focusing on the wrong things, started feeling shitty about myself wasting the whole weekend and spent some time trying to get myself to calm down from self-hatred for wasting time + anxiety because of lack of time.**



P.S. The cycle of procrastinating &gt; fucking up &gt; self-hatred cycle doesn't happen when I'm at work,  or with homework, assignment or class tests at school. This happens only before some important school stuff like midterm exams, finals or project submission deadlines. 


Edit: Done with the exam. I'll probably score around 50% to 60% in the midterm. I could have scored more if I had listened to what the prof was saying in the class. Apparently, we were allowed to bring a cheat sheet for all the formulas but I didn't know about it. I tried to memorize all the fucking formulas and I ended up forgetting half of em during the exam. Since we had a midterm and the report submission on the same day, someone had requested the prof to push the deadline and the new deadline is Wednesday. I'm gonna finish the report and send it to him tomorrow. Not going to procrastinate anymore!"

It was full of blood, tears and a lot of stress. I never thought about giving up but some days were just horrendous.

Anyways- my last semester has probably been the most stressful so far-not so much about work load, but Senior Design takes a ridiculous amount of time, looking for a job is almost a part time job in itself and it is very frustrating!

I have a very good resume, 3 internships, a co-op but still, they don't care how much you know, if you can't click with the hiring manager somehow, you ain't getting no job.

If you are a sophomore or junior, you better be getting those internships. I know more than a few people that graduated without internships last December and still have not found a job.

I would rather give you a realistic perspective on things than fill your mind with bullshit, so just to recap:

* Internships/Co-Op's are VERY important

* Senior Year is going to suck!

* Start looking for a job at the end of the semester prior to your graduation semester- a lot of companies will say ""Sorry but we need someone right away"" It does not matter, if anything, I got a lot of practice interviewing, made a lot of important connections between last December-February, build a database with emails, contact names for several companies and I will reach out to them in a couple months.

I want to make a substantially larger project than I have ever made before. I have a personal interest in this project and it would actually be somewhat revolutionary (there are only 3 products in this niche market and all of them are roughly 6 times the price). It won't require any skills I lack / am not interested in, as it is an offline application (I don't like web dev), so it will be more difficult for me to burn out.

Being a CS major, I have done a lot of very low level programming, but nothing really high-level. I can't think of any programs for the average user which will print the memory address of each character in a string lol.

I am picking the highest-level possible visual scripting language specifically designed for prototyping audio applications, and I want to plan out as much as I can.

What is a good way to plan out a medium-sized program? Assuming I knew the visual scripting framework right now, I think it would take a couple months, at 5-10 hours a week, for me to implement the full version, and it would take roughly half that to make a decent demo.

I think a high level of abstraction/encapsulation should be possible, and I want to abstractify as much as I can, so that I can only build 1 component, test it thoroughly, make 16/25/81 instances of it, make a program which manages what goes on those voices, etc.

The framework I am using is high level. My program is more or less a copy of software designed to run on microcontrollers decades ago, except that I plan to run it on a proper CPU. There are countless tutorials for the framework I am using. I am not sure what would be the best way to plan it out, however.

Any advice on how to plan out a medium-sized program? I have a gut feeling that if I program in an orderly fashion, rather than making the visual equivalent of spaghetti code, it will be a lot easier. If I do not plan it well, I will likely give up.

7ypozy,3,2018-02-19,Who here is struggling long after getting a BA they couldn't use and lacking experience to boot? Do you have solutions?,sewdeficient,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7ypozy/who_here_is_struggling_long_after_getting_a_ba/,"I'm writing specifically to older long-term unemployed people or people who have gone through what I'm talking about, having spent so long unable to get solid references, work experiences, and footholds into work that your degree is a complete waste. 

If you're going to give me generic advice...I have a career coach for that. I am not going into this as a new searcher - it took a very long time just to get bad experience in a pool with younger, better experienced candidates who don't have gaps. 

I'd actually really like to talk people who went back to school in the hopes of changing their shitty BA/post-ba experiences and I assume there are some in this sub. 

If you went back, having blown your undergrad experience - did you have an easy time getting internships? In what field? Are any of you in NYC that want to message me? 

I'm basically trying to undo the past by going back to school and worried it's impossible b/c I *still* won't get internships and I will be what I am now - entry level. Bachelor's students with 4 sexy internships or a job &gt;&gt;&gt; someone who mostly has temp experience on their resume. 

The exceptions might be programmers - not cut out for it. Thinking analytics of some type - still scared. 

After undergrad I went to grad school (not my idea) for teaching and worked unpaid as a childhood classroom teacher's assistant for years in a not for profit that never put forward the likelihood of hiring me. I am entry level at 30; and I'm stuck in a loop of horrible temp jobs.

It took me literally five years and being recruited from an excel workshop to get any staffing agencies that took on my friends handily to call me. For most of the last 2 years I've gone months either in horrible, unstable jobs paying 13/hour or in jobs that were literally only data entry. No direct interaction with anyone but a 25 year old supervisor; limited training; no real references or important responsibility in a role that would exist in that or another office.

And that means my cover letters and resume are toilet paper, even though I've had my college career office review them. The best I can do all advertises being a loser. 

Most of the time I have been unemployed or doing primarily menial work. I dress it up on my resume, treat each assignment like a FT job and opportunity I talk about the office systems I've used and what for, I ask to add my supervisors as references and ask them, point blank, what goal or project I'm helping them meet. I smile. I leave ""thank you"" cards - I'm probably putting myself at risk b/c sometimes I tell some of them if they want me back in the future...

It doesn't matter at all. I've come to absorb a reality - someone that hires a person like you for a temp would never want you as a permanent employee. And I know ft employers want full-time experience. Considering I'm relying on recruiters to get me in the door, I often lack experience for *those* low level admin or entry level assistant jobs in accounting, payroll, HR, etc. and what little experience I've culled together as a volunteer. 

I am so fed up and so scared of being in this place at 40 that I'm seriously considering going back to school to be more attractive to the sorts of companies where I'm often a temp - usually for marketing and sales. But I'm not trained for more; I'm expected to show up, do my shitty menial tasks, and stay out of the way. It feels like a horrible joke reading up about companies and their histories that would never hire me. I am scared shitless I will be a 30 year old would-be intern and get the same treatment as I do seeking perm. jobs. I occasionally apply to internships now and hear nothing. 

...I honestly don't even understand how new grads who don't have incredible previous experience outside of STEM intern at all for something like operations or office work. 

I have a lot of volunteering experience and keep getting passed down the horrible line of shitty temps and call center jobs.  I am afraid if I go back to school with my current shitty resume, I won't be seen the way a stellar undergrad is; rather I will have the same experience I do now and be completely ineligible for internships I wish I'd have known how to pursue a decade ago. The competition is so stiff it's insane; I suspect bachelor's students will always be chosen by the sheer effect of their youth.

Every job I apply for myself - radio silence. I know once employers see ""contact admin"" on my resume - that's it. Into the garbage. And the really awful irony is that sometimes my shitty temps send me to interview for direct hire for **horrible* companies paying 16/hour, often ridiculous, poorly outlined positions in dumps or offices one rung up from MLM schemes, asking for years of experience and office systems one needs a membership to learn. I am a shitty candidate for the temp jobs my agencies find me...because all I have is temp experience.

They're started sending me....jobs that pay 12/hour, with shifts from 6AM from 6PM. Courier jobs for 14/hour. 

I know what roles my friends got through these companies. Eventually they got solid jobs with actual training into a role; I don't know if my agency refuses to place me or if those leads are gone, but whatever it is - it makes me feel hopeless and like a piece of complete dog shit. I've jumped through many ridiculous, humiliating hoops for a full fledged office assistant job; right now this is probably the 30th time this year I'm begging people on my alumni board and recruiters who ignore weekly emails for 2 weeks of work. 

The admin jobs my friends got through these places never actually listed and might well not exist anymore.  

New temps contact me off Indeed and Linkedin once in a while - same shit. My resume goes in a database for tax breaks for something.

If employers for FT jobs don't recognize where I worked, it doesn't matter. And as a temp - it's shitty experience all over the place, even if I try to relate it to the role at hand on top of basic concepts.

The nature of temps with a liberal arts degree that isn't STEM is that I get less training than an intern; paid as much; and cost much more. 

Are any career changers or people like me, who just didn't intern and had to rely on what they could get, dealing with this? Who are scared of the same shit, specifically because they'll be judged as shitty job candidates, not legit intern candidates? 

Did anyone escape this...without necessarily going back to school FT for something like programming or just getting lucky (esp. for people who have solid resumes in something white collar/office based - that descriptive applies to all of my classmates, including those who went to grad school or got psych majors first....they get into UX or consulted and learned programming from their friends at a VC or an incubator)? Did you figure out how to turn things around and revamp your career? (Don't just tell me to get a certificate - I have. The secret trick? No job placement. I think if I go back now, at least, it will be be non non-degreed courses in better colleges than my local CC, but I'm scared of the same shit. Blow a lot of money; take a terrible course (in CC, a solid number of the students were mentally ill and shouted over the teacher in class); no job leads or guidance.

TL;DR: I wasted my time in undergrad b/c I was dumb, didn't intern then b/c not in a good place/was exhausted just keeping my GPA up (even with summer courses). I want a permanent job sooner than later or to be on the path and feel like I'm trapped and going to be punished for that time in my life because of the loop of age, being a ""meh"" human being in a sea of candidates for the same roles, and only having menial temp experience in shitty places. Even if I go back to school. 

A shit resume and being old and entry level b/c you're  switching streams in a job market full of inevitable ""rock stars"" follows a person.

I was originally studying (pure) Math with the intention of going on to graduate school, but as I started doing Math research I ended up doing a lot of coding and pretty much fell in love with it and decided to add a CS major and go into the workforce after school instead of a graduate program. So I will graduate with a degree in CS and Math, though my coursework in Math will be much more extensive (many optional upper level courses including graduate courses). 

I have a summer internship doing SWE lined up, but I still feel lost as what I am actually interested in working on and what to do to best prepare myself for a career after graduation. Ideally I would like to work in something that is a bit more ""math heavy"" but still a CS career. I am having trouble identifying these kinds of jobs (besides suggestions to get an MS/PhD and go into ""AI/Machine learning""). What kind of CS careers / keywords should I be looking into?

I am often advised to work on personal projects or put things on GitHub, but I have no idea where to come up with the ideas for these projects. I don't have any strong draw to a specific field, I feel I don't know enough / have enough experience to say I enjoy anything more than solving the puzzles that come along with my class and research assignments. How do I go about gaining inspiration for personal projects?

I spend most of my free time on HackerRank/LeetCode or just screwing around with Linux distros, but I would like some ideas on ways to focus my efforts to be more beneficial, as these activities don't seem to be building to specific besides interview prep.

So in summary: How can I figure out what i'm interested in (in regards to personal projects)? Are there math heavy CS jobs that don't require a graduate degree and assuming there are, how can I find them and prepare to work in these fields? What else can I be doing to help set myself up for a successful post-graduate career?"

I would've stayed at my current job which was sort of a specific form of QA testing (accessibility), but they're offloading most of that and I'm pretty bored there now in terms of actually using and developing technical skills. Hence, job search. Dev is the natural step forward for the degree I'm getting, but I'm pretty green to anything else out there. 

I'll ask r/cscareerquestions too, but they compartmentalize this stuff into days of the week it seems.

I'm going to graduate this December and I'm still struggling to find an internship for this summer. I have a intern offer from a former huge tech company, but the issue is if I take this intern then I have to take the return offer (very likely to have return offer), but I know the package is quite low compare to FB or Google or LinkedIn etc. in bay area. Or I can decline this intern offer then I might get a better offer full time offer from the companies I mentioned half year later. Then I probably won't have any intern this summer within US. I only have one internship outside US before.
The situation sounds weird but please give me some ideas according my problem."
7yrb10,2,2018-02-19,How do I deal with my full-time unpaid educational internship?,FnafMissingLink,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7yrb10/how_do_i_deal_with_my_fulltime_unpaid_educational/,"Hi everyone, I can hope you can help me out. I'm currently a 22 y/o full-time Msc student, while also having a part-time job in the weekend. I have quite some trouble with time management and guilt.

Let's start with my studies (mainly my internship). For my Msc degree I have to attend both courses, and pursue an unpaid internship as well in the meantime. As of writing, I'm at about my 2nd month of my 6 month internship. I'm happy with the content of my internship as it's a very interesting research where I can recieve some important practical skills for my further carreer. One of these practical skills in particular takes time to learn (at about 2 months for the average student), and my daily supervisor said I'm on a good way. My daily supervisor herself is a very nice person that explains the practical work well, works quite hard herself and is really focussed on her work. I have a very strong helpful nature, and pick up her tasks for her wherever I can (like setting up stuff for her, preparing stuff so she only has to perform it, and looking after the daily tasks)
However, there are 3 problems I have with my internship, and they are all related to the time demand of my internship and my guilt. 

First of all, my internship demands alot my time. Although the agreement upholds working hours of 9 to 5 (monday to friday), I find myself running up till 6 to 6.30 almost everyday before I can go home, and I still have to travel home for 1.5 hours. The thing is, I don't mind at all to stay late every once in while, however, it's becoming a very consistent pattern which really harms my free time, and my other courses. The thing here is, I want to show my dedication to my supervisor as she also tends to work overtime and I'm quite naturally very helpfull, however I sometimes feel like shit by the time I get home and only have such a little time to relax a bit, while also having to read articles for the internship and study for my courses. For the weekends, I work a part-time job on saturday (and I can't say no if my boss asks me to also work on sunday), which sometimes leaves me exhausted on sundays. I don't even have time to go do sometimhing fun or shop for new clothes because by the time it's sunday, I just want a day I can relax and also keep up a little with my studies.  

This brings me to my second point, my courses. Although my daily supervisor knows that as a student, I still follow courses outside of my internship, she tends to forget about it. This goes as follows. On a monday morning she already kind of plans out my week, and after obdiently listening to her, I eventually have to stop her and say ""but I also have a course today and that day"", to which she disappointently says ""oh yes I forgot"" and tries to schedule things right around my courses (which causes me having to run between the courses and my internship). To make things easier, I decided to drop some courses and pick some part-time courses that overlap with just the first month of my internship (currently it's the last week for both of the courses) so I could focus on the internship afterwards. However that means that monday to wednesday (the days of these courses) I find myself running in between them, while also desperatly trying to keep up the learning work. However, my daily supervisor doesn't really seem to know that I actually have to study for the exams as she eagerly throws me some articles that I have to read, while also expecting that I work on my research proposal. I did mention occasionally I have to study for the courses, however I still find myself feeling guilty that I can't put as much time in my internship. Especially when she looks disappointed to me after I say I have to go attend courses. For now I've dropped other courses because it makes me feel guilty not being fully available (to which I also keep promising to her: ""After these courses, I'm fully available"" to sort of make up for it), but I have to make up for the necessary points next year. It also makes it difficult for me to ask for a free day to attend some other events, as I feel guilty because I already took alot of my time by interupting my internship with my courses already. However, at the same time, I don't feel like my internship should be a full-time job at the cost of my studies. At times my courses where also some sort of a break for me from the internship, but after this I will really have to only work on my internship everyday full-time (with the overtime I've already mentioned). But then again, I feel like I mess up an opportunity if I mess up this internship. It also makes it hard to dump it, as it would delay my study and I would probably get a bad notion from the institute (which is directly related to my whole university). 

Lastly, my daily supervisor and my responsible supervisor. I've already told you about my daily supervisor. She's very nice to me, which makes me feel extremely guilty for not being able to fully invest time in my internship. At the same time, although she mentions I do progress in the practical skills nicely, she becomes quite disappointed if I mess up something, and I feel extremely guilty because it hurts her own planned experiments (and I want to help). I also recently quite a strong drawback in my practical skills where I messed up my experiment to which she also was quite disappointed. It's not like they are major mistakes (and they are sometimes a little out of my hand) but I feel guilty all the same for delaying her. And it's not like she makes it obvious that she's disappointed, but I can sense it by the way she acts. 
As to my responsible supervisor. It also makes it hard to confront her about it, as I would feel too guilty as she's been nice to me, and also already adapted the projected a bit for me. My responsible supervisor is actually from another institute, and thus my project is a collaboration between the institute of my daily supervisor and my responsible supervisor. Which makes me more or less the connection between these institutes as I will do merge both of their individual work. Although the workload of my daily supervisor is already alot, my responsible supevisor also wants to put his load on me with a project that is more out of my boundary (but fits with the work of my daily supervisor). My daily supervisor already sort of arranged for me how they will share me for their individual work, that I will merge, but it really puts alot of pressure on me as they expect me to translate the others works to them as I'm the only one that will work on both projects simultaneously. It almost feels like a full time phd position where I'm responsible for the merging of 2 projects. It causes pressure and guilt in case I can't live up to it. 

I hope you guys weren't as thrown around by this as I feel by all of this. I don't want to say I'm a hard worker, but I'm always prepared to help and I'd love to dedicate myself to my internship. However, I feel that at some point people abuse my nature to get more out of me, as I would feel guilty to not do a little more. I'm afraid my unpaid internship is turning into a full-time job, and that the load is becoming too much for me to bear. It truly pains me to think that I can't even take the afternoon off to finally go buy some new clothes for myself, or to go ice skating again (which I've been wanting to do all this winter, but couldn't do once because I work all day, all week) . It also makes me afraid for what is to come once I really go into research myself and think I would have to do this for a long time. I've done an internship before, but the institute I worked for back then wasn't as competitive as this one.

I feel my guilt is at the basis of this, but I'm not sure how to deal with it, and how to come to terms with my internship. I don't want to say my life is a mess, because it isn't by all means. But I feel like I'm losing grip of my internship while it keeps demanding for more. I hope you guys have advice to deal with my feelings, while also getting more grip on my internship. I keep telling me that it's an unpaid internship and that I don't really have an obligation to them, but it doesn't seem to help.

7ys28x,1,2018-02-19,Do I put a project on my resume that's incomplete and something I won't finish until 6 months?,HexadecimalCowboy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7ys28x/do_i_put_a_project_on_my_resume_thats_incomplete/,"I'm making a project in Java and I'd say it's pretty impressive. However, it's not fully complete yet and I don't think I will be able to complete it until maybe August (due to school, internship, and stuff). It *looks* complete but if anyone looks at the code (which I do intend putting on Github) for about 5 minutes they'll know it's not complete. But which recruiter looks at Github anyway.

If asked about it in interviews and stuff I can explain how it (would) work and what libraries I used on it. I think I would be able to say ""still in progress, I'm looking to improve it"" if someone does catch me but if I say that it already can do something it can't, I may be in trouble.

Do you think I should do it? It'd make my resume stand out more I think because it's sort of a cool project. My projects section is OK, but there's one project I made a while back which now seems very mediocre, so replacing that with this would be a good idea.

Thanks!"
7ys3ok,6,2018-02-19,"Want to dropout of college to self-teach, struggling with motivation towards school but not any other work. Somebody PLEASE point me in the right direction.",WishIWasOnACatamaran,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7ys3ok/want_to_dropout_of_college_to_selfteach/,"Hey everybody. I tend to use this sub as a resource every now and then, and direly hope that somebody can help me.

I am struggling very hard to stay motivated towards school. I took two years off after high school, and in that process discovered a passion for programming. Eventually I decided school would be the best avenue forward if I wanted to become skilled and achieve my ultimate dream of running a technology solutions company. All started off well. By the end of my Freshman year I finished with a 3.9 GPA (damn 89.6 in Econ with a stickler of a professor), had been chosen as ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) President the following school year, and had a job with the medical colleges IT program as a student assistant IT delivery analyst. Next school year rolls around, and started rough after some lady issues right before the beginning. I eventually found myself very behind and decided to drop 4 of my 5 classes in order to save my GPA and attempt to reorganize myself. In the time following I started an internship with the IT department at the #1 private employer in my city, and though in hindsight this is the mistake that led to my current state, I felt I was moving forward. I finished my one class with an A.

This semester comes around, and I am taking mostly the same classes I should have last semester. ACM stuff is going well. However, work has become increasingly more demanding. Due to my inner need to always be working a job, I put it as a higher priority over school. Before people (understandably) jump down my throat, I need to emphasize that this is truly the first decent (for me) paying job at a place I have respected since I was a little kid, and everyday I went there it felt like I was living a dream. 

I am now very behind in my schoolwork. My school has a withdrawal limit of 5 classes in a degree course, anything past that counts as a WF. Withdrawal deadline is in 2 weeks. I have already shut off any social activities to stay focused on school. However, I am very much struggling with the idea of continuing my college education past this point. 

I have projects that I want to begin working on, and increasingly feel that I should be dedicating time towards those rather than school. I feel this is me looking for an escape, but I know that isn't a realistic way of looking at things. I have an opportunity approaching to pitch my ideas to a very well respected firm in town, and even if that doesn't work out know that I will get the opportunity with somebody else. I want to begin iOS development. I want to eventually finish school, but just don't feel that it is benefitting me right now.

Somebody just tell me I'm being an idiot millennial and to dropout and pursue development of these apps will likely end with me falling on my face. Tell me that finishing my CS degree is the best way for me to secure my future as a tech entrepreneur because in order to do that I need to be able to sustain myself with a reasonably paying programming job, regardless of whether I enjoy that job or not. Half of me wants to apply to the Thiel Foundation, and the other half just wants to jump off of a bridge (metaphorically)."
7ysexh,5,2018-02-19,No Internships: What are my Chances?,Capital-,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7ysexh/no_internships_what_are_my_chances/,"Hello everyone! This is probably my third time posting to this forum and I would just like to thank everyone who has posted answers to my previous threads. I have received fantastic feedback and I do appreciate it! 

Information:

* 2 Years experience as Customer Service Associate
* 2 Years experience as Shift Supervisor
* Currently work as a Student Technology Support Technician (10 months)
* Proficient in OOP
* Proficient in Java, Python, and C
* Completed various side projects in Adobe Actionscript (haha, fun)
* Been programming since I was 12
* Maintained a 3.8GPA overall in CS curriculum
* Currently run a web design business on the side (using Webflow)

At this point, I just need some reassurance that I'm not going down a bad path. I absolutely hate customer service / the Technology Support Technician job. I currently employed as a student worker simply to pay bills, not because I enjoy it. 

I've known from day 1 that I've wanted to go into software development, but I have not been able to find any jobs / internships in my area. 

As a college senior needing multiple classes over the summer, I must stay local in order to go to school; however, this has limited my options to four tech companies that are willing to hire interns. And, I missed the boat for those.

Any suggestions? I plan on moving to a metropolitan area when I get out of school in order to go to where the jobs are. For others who were never able to secure an internship, were you still able to find jobs once your graduated?"

I think I should start telling you how I got here. I finished my bachelor's in Computer Engineering last year. My university didn't have partnership with big companies and my city is really underdeveloped in this aspect, so in the third semester of my bachelor's I thought it would be a really good idea to apply for an undergraduate researcher position. Don't get me wrong, my advisor is probably one of the smartest persons that I know. I learned a ton with him, but his field of research was too theoretical, and at that time I didn't think that'd be a problem, because compared to my colleagues I was definitely an outlier, I had to read tons of papers, I had to understand really difficult and obscure subjects, it was all working on my way. I spent 4 years being an undergraduate researcher at my university. I even went to a French institute to do research there for a few months.

After I finished my bachelor's, I noticed that I have no working experience to put on my resume. I tried to find a job, but in the end I was only being considered as an intern. I struggled a lot with the fact that I'd still need my parents money to survive, so the best option for me was to accept my fate as an academic and I went to Europe to do a master's in the theoretical field that I've mentioned before. I got homesick, got really depressed because I'm already 23 and still need my parent's money to survive and felt no motivation to study. Zero. Last week I decided to quit the master's program and came back to my country. 

Now I am unemployed, and I'm living in my parent's house again. I think I'm gonna apply for another master's program in the next few months, but in the meantime I want to do something practical in order to add that to my resume and probably get a job so I will be able to live by myself. I've always dreamed about a job in finance, but I think that's out of my league since I don't want to do a PhD and most companies seem to care a lot about this aspect. After all the search that I've done before posting here, my only chance to get some experience is to contribute to open source projects or to really accept a job as an intern. I'd prefer the first option over the second, because I really think I need to study a lot, and now I really have time to do that. What do you guys think? Is there any other way out of my current situation?

Thanks a lot for reading all of this.

My HR person was asking me if I’d be interested in a full time position and I am, but I can’t see how they could possibly want to hire me. That HR guy doesn't know what my work is like, he just knows that I'm getting along with people. I’m learning a lot but they are not making their money’s worth with me. In case any of you are wondering, I was VERY upfront with them about my experience. I’ve been assigned a project in C#/.NET and that’s not even on my resume. My main problem is that I just don’t understand the code base at all. Documentation is outdated and there isn’t exactly a guide I can lookup in my spare time either. I’m eager to improve but I honestly don’t know how. I’ve been working on a project that’s mostly independent of the team’s work and it revolves around an open source library. I understand how to use the library and I understand the requirements of the project but I have no idea where my code goes. I have a template set up for me based on the company’s existing code and all I know is what folder my logic goes in. It doesn’t seem like the team cares all that much. They’re all really nice and always happy to help me but when I’m assigned tasks, there is little I can manage on my own. My manager tells me what to do and I feel shitty going back to him without progress. Is this common? I’m the only engineering intern there. Is there something I can do in my own time?

Intended Major: Finance

Academics: Ok, here I am a bit worried. Currently I am a junior, and my combined UW GPA of all 3 years is 3.76. I had a 3.78 UW GPA with 2 Honors classes 9th grade, 3.5 UW GPA with 2 AP and 4 Honors classes 10th grade, and now currently I have a 4.0 UW GPA with 4 AP's, 1 Honors, and 1 regular class. I have a 1600 SAT score, 800 Math 2, 800 World History, and 800 US History SAT Subject Test Scores. The thing that worries me the most is my sophomore year GPA, because I got hit hard adjusting to a very rigorous courseload coming from my freshmen year of high school, struggling alot. I fixed all of this by junior year, and currently have a 4.0 UW. Sophomore year, I thought I could coast by without doing any hard work, which lead me to a 3.5 UW GPA. I'm mostly wondering if I would be academically qualified for Wharton. Again, my overall UW GPA is a 3.76, and my W GPA is a 4.15.

AP Scores: Grade 10 - AP World History: 5, AP Computer Science A: 5, 
Grade 11 - Currently taking 4 AP Classes (AP Calculus AB, but planning to self study BC exam, AP US History, AP Statistics, AP Psychology), didn't take AP Exams yet.

School Type: I go to a private school, ranked 7th in my state.  

Extracurriculars:
Grade 9: Co-Founder/Co-President of DECA, Member of FBLA, Member of Finance Club, Secretary of Model UN
Grade 10: Co-Founder/Co-President of DECA, Treasurer of FBLA, Member of Finance Club, Secretary of Model UN
Grade 11: Co-Founder/Co-President of DECA, Treasurer of FBLA, President of Finance Club, Secretary of Model UN
Grade 12: Not there yet.

Awards:
Grade 9: Honors 250 Hours Community Service Award (From my school - did very meaningful community service leading a group of middle school kids, could talk about this in my essay), Honors Roll
Grade 10: FBLA States 1st Place in Introduction to Public Speaking, FBLA Nationals 1st Place in Introduction to Public Speaking, Honors 250 Hours Community Service Award, Honors Roll
Grade 11: So far, I have a Best Delegate award from North American Invitational Model UN, DECA Regionals 1st place
Grade 12: Not there yet. 

Rec Letters:
I plan to get letters of recommendations from my AP Calculus AB and AP US History teacher, both of whom I talk to very frequently, and have developed a strong relationship with them over the course of this year.

Hooks: My brother will graduate UPenn Wharton's Class of 2018 (this year). Hopefully this counts as a legacy, and will kind've give me a boost. Other than this, I have no other hooks.

Essays:
Currently because I'm a junior all I know is, I plan to spend a couple months on my essays, and will be applying Early Decision. 

Conclusion:
Thank you for reading this. Hopefully, I plan to win awards in FBLA States, FBLA Nationals, DECA States, DECA Nationals for the rest of this year. In addition, I applied to TASP 2018 and the Wharton LBW Summer Program 2018, and hopefully I'll be accepted. I am also planning to start a business around spring break (Already planned this out), and I can highlight this in my essay. Finally, I plan to get a selective internship this summer revolving my intended major, finance. My strengths are definitely my SAT Scores, hopefully compensating for my UW GPA.

It's a pretty big tech hub so I thought it would be relatively easy to find a well paying internship at a big company given my previous experience and skills.

Turns out I was wrong and a lot of companies (including American ones) are only looking for local Israelis for internships, or don't have internship programs at all. Still, I applied and was accepted for a program that places Americans in CS internships in Tel Aviv.

Sounds great, right? The problem is that there's a large upfront fee ($2500 though it covers housing) and the average salary for their interns is just above minimum wage. If I decline it, I'm fairly certain I'll be able to find an internship here in the Bay Area that pays 4x more with no extra costs, but then I have to spend another summer in the Bay.

I'll still be ok financially taking the low-paying job, but it will kind of pain me to end the summer with roughly zero net profit once everything is added up instead of taking another job and making ~15k or so.

Has anyone made the choice to take the vastly lower paying job? I really want to get out of Silicon Valley and experience someplace new before I probably spend the rest of my life here, but is it worth it? Thanks!"

From outside everyone thinks I am doing amazing, life looks perfect on paper, but I'm totally burned out on everything.



Throughout college I worked my ass off working IT related jobs/internships the entire time. Poured the past 4 years, my entire life, into furthering my career. I'm about to graduate with my IT degree in a couple months and it should be the best time of my life, making good money at a good company. However I have lost all motivation/work ethic. Could care less about my current internship turning into a job post grad. I am scoring tons of interviews through applications and recruiters reaching out but they continue to go poorly because I couldnt give a damn about whatever position. Hell have taken up drinking and smoking to make it through each 8 hour day. Feel I am on the edge of a breakdown everyday I am sitting at my desk. Was 10x happier working my retail job 3 years ago making less than half what I make now. 



Unsure how I am gonna grind for the next 40 years doing this....

What do I do now?",Zaemz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7yxpv4/ive_made_many_many_mistakes_i_cannot_finish_my_bs/,"I was thinking about using a throwaway. I'm not, because I need to own up to who I am and how I've thrown a decade of my life down the pooper. I need to accept it, learn from it, and move on from it. I already know the gravity of my situation and where I am in life. If anyone is willing to offer advice, I'd greatly appreciate it.

I have been trying to get my undergraduate degree for ten years. I started at a two year college. I have a general associate's degree, but can't complete my undergrad. 

It's a really long story, but because of mental health complications along with being low-income my whole life, I had many distractions and interruptions in my priorities. I tried to finish, couldn't after 3 years. I took a couple of years off and tried again. Still couldn't, but I've since run out of funding and can't afford to pay out of pocket anymore. 

When I don't have to work I do well, but unfortunately not working is not, and has never really been, an option.

So, I'm now at a spot where I'm just going to be working and paying back student loans. I have an internship at the moment that ends in May. I have 2 previous years of professional experience writing software.

I'm at the point now where I just want to have a family. I'm very tired of being a student and being ""entry-level"". When it comes to being a developer, I'm interested, capable, dependable, and can write code. I spend a lot of my free time learning and growing. It's not that I'm not truly interested. I'm just not good with the structure that university demands. I think if classes were just 40 hrs a week of lab/workshops then I would have done better as I do very well in an office environment.

I don't know where to go from here. I have a few options that I can think of off of the top of my head: 

1. I can wait it out, pay down my loans, and try again in a few years. 

2. I can just suck it up and try my best to put myself in a position to be able to find work without the degree.

3. Or, I can try to find an online-only, part-time program so that I can truly take my time to finish.

If anyone's been in my position before and got out of it, I'd appreciate if you could share your story. 

I understand that, in the end, hard work is what's needed. But I'm unsure of where to direct my focus.

Thanks for your time!"

I got accepted by NEU for MS in bioinformatics. When I am still waiting for other school's offer, like BU, I would like to listen to your experience of MS in bioinformatics at NEU?

To be honest, my goal is to find a good job with the degree in Boston area. I am an international student, so I am much more interested in career opportunities with this degree from NEU. I will be so glad if you guys could share your experience. How was your Co-op internship going? Where did you go for the internship? What did you do as an intern? Where do you end up right now? How is working experience? 

I really appreciate your time for sharing your valuable experience that could not only broaden my view, but also help me in the future.

Thank you so much.

We had a bunch of extra monitors so I was setting up second screens for a lot of employees. Most of the set-ups were fairly routine but this one lady, who I'll call Marie, was unintentionally hilarious. She's late 20s to early 30s so I expected her to have some basic knowledge about how computers work. For context, she had one monitor and a laptop at her desk before I set the second monitor up.


Me: Alright, I finished setting up the second monitor, you're good to go.

Marie: Oh ok, thanks!

Me: Do you need anything else before I head back?

Marie: Um, do I still need my laptop since I have the second monitor?

Me: ...Yes, you still need the laptop.

I was speechless for a good 3 seconds. It's 2017 I thought we were past the whole ""monitor = computer"" thing. I wondered if she was joking for a second but one look at her face and I knew she was completely sincere."

7yzbbe,0,2018-02-20,MSME Right for Me?,hadsox,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/7yzbbe/msme_right_for_me/,"I'm not sure what my odds are getting into a program in the region I want to live after I complete my undergrad. But I'm even less sure about if completing a masters degree is the right decision.

Here's my summary:

BS in Physics with minors in math and CS, GPA 3.2
After I graduate I'd like to move to Boston. I've visited there and LOVE the environment. I really want to work in the space industry one day. Building rockets and or designing the systems used in space. (ie asteroid mining or colonization). I have a some research experience, been working with a professor for 2 yrs and have a couple publications in data analysis. And I've had a summer internship at a local cyber security company. I have not taken the GRE yet, but was thinking to take the PGRE. I know my experience is a little scattered and doesn't show a lot of focus. Which I can agree with. I've learned a lot of various skills in my physics program, research experience, and internship. But I'm unsure if they would surmount to being ready or qualified to work in the aerospace field. 

Enter the MSME. 

What I would want to gain from said degree is the focus and skills I think that I need to succeed in the field that interests me (aerospace). I was looking at BU's MSME program and they have a variety of classes that I think would allow this, but it's hard to say with just their course catalog at hand. 

Really what I'm asking here is: The people who have obtained or are currently obtaining a masters degree - Do you feel you have been learning specific enough skills to apply to your chosen career path?"

The shutters were drawn throughout the apartment because the light was starting to bother my eyes. It all made me flicker about nervously, yet with joy, barely any light crept in. All of which made me happy.

An eerie peace a solitude, yet any minute I knew they would be knocking on my front door asking questions. Police cars were heard swarming about in multiple directions. Panic was in the streets. Children were crying. Chaos itself seemed to be overtaking the world outside those apartment doors. It was a tiny place, but my world as I knew it very soon, would come crashing down or blowing up.

Such a little place was enough for one person to become very much cramped up. I rented it with cash under an assumed name Kamron Dull. Though my real name is Erik Damned. Yes I have a weird and wicked last name. Other than my name and my physical deformity something else has followed me around all my life.

I call it the voice. It is something I fear, yet also respect. The same voice I have heard in my head for as long as I can remember. Time after time it would order me to do things, otherwise in my life which I might never do. In the times of my life which I have been all alone, there was only my mother who was around, besides her the voice was all I had. It was sort of like a semi- silent invisible friend. Nobody knew about it. And I never told anyone either. I can still remember the day the voice introduced itself.

''Hello Erik, I am going to be your friend. Your only friend.''

Which instantly got me up jumping with excitement, because I had no friends. Other people might paint this voice as something evil, but it always seemed as if it was the lone guiding truth in my world. It was everything I knew to be right and true. Never did he think this voice could steer him wrong.

A lot of people had unsavory opinions of me as either being very nice, a little too nice, or outright crazy. Either way something was wrong with me besides my severely disfigured face.

Other than my deformity, the last thing I needed was for people to see me as being insane. Using my brute strength I pushed myself away from the recliner I'd been sitting in waiting for them. I was also waiting for the voice to tell me when to go to do my thing in the bathroom. I had to be ready for when they got there. Time was ticking away faster by the moment, a sense of dread was drawing closer with each passing second.

As I stood there for a moment I stared at the bathroom which was just four feet away in the tiny apartment. Sliding my hand into the darkness of the little room, my hand fumbled around for the switch, the only source of light was the half broken mirror. When I turned the light's on, the bathroom did not seem to fully light up. It was dim at best. The best way to describe it was, a hole in the wall.

It's all that I could afford, I'd been planning this with a strict budget for a long time. And everything was about to set off like a barrel of explosives, all while the voice was telling me to do. I had a list of things I had to gather from the local store. The voice told me to get these things and I'd get a reward. For every single task which I completed. And what I mean by reward is a reprieve from the bugs, because any time in my life when I don't do what the voice says, wherever I am, I see them start. They come at me in droves and when they get on my skin they pinch, and they burn. It's almost like acid is crawling along my skin.

Over the years mom brought me to a Doctor but they could not explain it. It looked as if something had been chewing on my skin, even unexplainable little marks were visible on me. Everyone always said I was doing it for attention. Though no matter what happened, I never revealed the presence of the voice. I was told if I did, I would regret it for the rest of my days.

She even took me to a priest once, before we started going to the church we went to. They could not find anything wrong with me either, they said I was normal. Hearing those words actually made me happy and safe. As far as the voices influence was concerned I was not sure if I should take it all as a threat or a promise.

I just did as it said because I did not have any friends. And the voice besides my mom were the only people in my life. There's also the fact when we went to church, and all of those folks felt sorry for me, they told me that they loved me. I knew they were full of shit though. But I took their pity, their checks of charity and they lying tears nonetheless. I even tried to pray to their so-called god.

But nothing ever came to me. All I had was the voice. I never told anyone about it, even to this day. It just did not feel right in doing so. I was mostly scared it would go away and I'd be all alone. As I stood at the mirror and gazed into my own eyes, I could hear the faint sound of whimpering in the other room. Well at least, I could swear my ears were telling me as much. The medicine I'd been on since I was younger caused me to hear things and see things.

I was even told I had to be careful because of so many delusions which I could, or maybe even would find myself falling into. As I pulled the razor out and spread the shaving cream all over my oddly shaped head, so I could cut off my long locks of hair, many thoughts went through my warped head.

For years I worked as a gas station attendant, I put in long hours and walked to and from work and back home. My boss Greg, the manager of the little gas station always seemed as if he was on the edge of giving me more responsibility. The main reason I chose this line of work was because from birth I was born with a disease called Proteus Syndrome.

My face was disfigured. I looked like a living breathing monster having jumped straight from the silver screen, or from the pages of a horror pulp magazine. I knew I was not going to grow old and become a winner with the ladies. Did I care? Nope. I just wanted to find a job, anything I would be good at doing. Another goal was to be accepted and to eventually try to find happiness.

Working at the gas station was my life. All the while I was saving for something big, I was not sure what it was, but it would change my life forever. All I knew was I had saved a lot of money, every single time I looked at it the smile grew bigger and my pride swelled more with each passing time. The only sad part was when I'd go take each clump to the bank to deposit. Though the amount in my bank account by now had gotten a hell of a lot larger. I'd lost count.

And when I went home I listened to old Led Zeppelin records all the time. Some people made fun of me when they caught me singing in public. Momentarily It'd bother me, but for the most part I'd go on about my day walking to the gas station to do my shift, without a care in the world. I mean a majority of the time I enjoyed my job. I would have to say my favorite part of my job was on Friday's when I'd get to see the girl of my dreams roll into the gas station. It never failed.

It was always a few minutes close to 5pm, and they'd roll through. Every single time they did I could smell her perfume damn near a mile away. It was apparent when she was around I was like a dog in heat.

I remember the first time I saw Mary, it was like yesterday. I suppose if there was a heaven, walking through those pearly gates, meeting her would be something along those lines. Now can I say I was in love with this girl at first sight?

It's possible, but honestly, it was more like a psychotic connection which could not be put into words. It was a raw and powerful, hypnotic sickness.

This sensation was toxic it yet, dangerous. As if the two of us could pop off, and go do something crazy, perhaps like burn the world down and get off together all while doing it.

The first day when we met, and they rolled through. I bumped into her by accident in the convenience store. And it was similar to the sort of moment in you'd see in the movies, you get lost in the woman's eyes. Well as she looked into mine, I did get lost, but there was also the overbearing sensation of toxicity, which I could not resist about her.

''Excuse me.''

Mary was trying to not sound rude as she looked at me and did a cute little thing with her hair which I liked. It seemed like for a moment she was almost captivated by my small town Tennessee looks. And when I remembered I had a massive growth on my face, maybe she was just staring at my cheeks which looked like a swollen volleyball.

Either way, she was speechless. They went to some University which was out in Eastern Tennessee, Knoxville I believe because of what I read on their license tag. It was not far from here. I could tell they were the well to do types, because of the vehicle they drove and some of the clothing they wore, it was all white and orange. All I could gather was they were some fancy girls.

They would roll through here, on their way to what knows where. All I cared about was being able to see her. Usually when I'd be gawking at her the voice would say things making observations.

''You know I could help you get her. You have to muster the courage to do something.''

''Nah, Mary would not take too kindly to me saying all of those things to her, besides she's a regular customer.'' But then came the day which I mustered the courage to do as the voice had commanded.

My record player had broken one morning. There would be no singing back up to Robert Plant for a while. And on the way to work my custom button up, gas station clothing was ruined when some prick decided to drive too close to the side of the road I was walking on.

It got mud all over me, which meant I'd have to work in front of customers dirty like this. I could try to go home but the last thing I wanted was to piss off the boss, not to mention losing money did not sound appealing to me. All I could see in my head was a bundle of cash. And the big unknown thing the voice was driving me towards.

To this point in Mary's life, things had been perfect for her, but for me, I'd had my share of mistakes. Everything had been planned out for her and laid out neatly.

Her father was a lawyer and he'd already lined her up an internship at his law firm the following autumn. She had a silver spoon in her mouth since she the moment she was born. Thus a free ride to college. I only know all of this because of the many conversations I'd eavesdrop on, I wonder if it technically makes me a stalker.

One day when the girl's rolled up to the station I could hear them arguing over who had to go into the gritty place to get the list made out and to pay for the gas. I can't even begin to count on my fingers and toes of all the times they'd been to the gas station. And how many times they'd all come in together like a swarm of sexy, making noise, buying gas and spending money as if it was going out of style.

But today seemed like a much different day. They looked out of the windows of their big black fancy SUV, it looked as if nobody was in the gas station. But I was looking out from the bosses office through some skinny window blinds. He left for a few hours and went out to lunch. I kept hearing the voice.

''Now's the time.''

As if it were some broken record playing with a purpose over and over in my head. This was the day which would change things forever.

I could see the girls playing rock paper scissors, as if they were really debating who had to go in. Mary had obviously lost. When I saw her exit the SUV I got excited. But I heard the voice again.

''Now's the time.'' And I kept wondering, now's the time for what, stop being so damn cryptic.

And as if the voice was an actual person standing next to me I heard whispers of gibberish flow into my ear. I knew not what was meant with such actions, but the reaction to it was overwhelming for me.

And then it happened. The bugs started flowing out of nowhere. While I made my way over behind the main counter where the cash register is I watched Mary walk into the store. All the while more and more bugs were growing in mass. They made their way towards me and I sense them pinching and biting me. The pain continued to get worse and worse.

Tears poured down my face like a damn rotting waterfall. I closed my eyes. And before I opened them. I heard her sweet voice.

''Excuse me'' Mary cleared her throat as if trying to raise her voice to be heard.

''Can I have these packs of cigarettes, Erick is it?'' I opened my eyes and there she was. The girl of my dreams, she was standing right there in front of me. And I kept hearing the voice.

''Now's the time.'' Which was being said over and over, all while getting louder. I even mumbled some of the words aloud but in a whisper. But apparently Mary heard me.

''Excuse me. Come again? Mary asked as she looked at me as if I'd lost my mind, but I did not speak loud enough for her to make out what she thought she may have heard. She leaned in towards the counter at me.

''You hear it too?'' Mary wondered as she looked at me and her eye's got big. All of the bugs were disappearing before my eyes. Every little bit of pain was going away. And I heard the voice as plain as day.

''Yes. Now I will tell you word for word how to do this, please listen and do as I command.''

Mary's eyes were looking at me making lone singular blinks as if she was trying to understand what the hell was going on. Her jaws were flapping away chewing on gum while trying to make sense of the situation.

She leaned in towards the counter further, pulling at my shirt and laid a huge wet kiss on me. I had to check my pulse while our tongues were swatting away at each other. The main problem was, I could not tell if this was real or not, because before I could swear I was making out with a girl at a country fair. And it turned out I was open mouth kissing a pit bull, for years people would mess with me about what had happened at the fair. I almost did not hear the end of it.

Out of the corner of my eye I could see her friends staring at us. Mary shoved her right hand into her back pocket and yanked out a piece of random paper. And on the paper she was writing something, when she handed it to me, my face lit up like a Christmas tree.

She gave me her phone number. No girl had ever done this before. Mary proceeded in giving me a massive tip on top of the amount for everything else which she was buying. ''Call her.'' And so I would. I watched Mary leave the gas station and drive off with her friends.

When I got home from work later in the evening, a box was on the table waiting for me. I walked past it. The only thing on my mind was Mary, and her phone number. I mean I was not in love with her, but there was just this insane toxicity between us which I could not get over. I wanted something, I could almost taste it on my lips.

''Pull it out, go ahead and do it. You know you want to.'' And so I did. I pulled out my knife which was shiny and sharp. I rolled up my sleeve and made a huge slice into my arm nothing too deep.

Enough of a slice through my flesh, so the sensation would have an impact on me, which it did. The cut was lined up with my many other cuts which I'd made over the years. And they had all also healed over time. Scars were all over my body. Some people might believe its a strange thing, but to me I use it to cope with life.

My mother brought the box up to my bedroom. ''Sweetie I bought you this. I know your other record player broke, so I wanted to bring you another record player.'' I tried to be civil and positive about the situation, but my mind was drifting elsewhere.

''That's nice mom. Thanks, will you put it over there?''

Out of the corner of my eye I could sense my mothers gaze hovering over me like an undying magnet.

''Are you going to open it?'' I did not answer her I laid on my bed in a trance staring at the ceiling with a big smile on my face.

A few hours later, she knocked on my door again.

''Supper’s ready. I made your favorite, stew.'' And again the same, complete silence. Hours past and another knock.

''I'm going to bed I left you something out to eat.'' Her footsteps sounded both tired and lonely. They reminded me much of my own. It was maybe 2 or 3 am, I crawled out of the bed after staring at the ceiling and went to the kitchen to eat some stew. Still I barely had an appetite after everything which had happened earlier today. The next day when I woke up, I was awake before mom. I rushed towards the kitchen and I made breakfast. She was shocked yet a bit saddened when she walked into the kitchen. For years she'd always done this for me. I was dressed in the nicest clothing I owned.

''And where are you headed today, dressed so fancy?'' Her eyes again were once on me like a magnet.

''Word for word please.'' I looked at mom as I was finishing up with her eggs.

''Well I was awake late looking at some college material on my computer. I've been figuring the amount of everything which I've saved. And I figure I'll be able to enroll at UT Knoxville next week.''

The look on her face was something along the lines of somebody punching her in the gut.

''But we talked about you wanting to live here for a prolonged period of time. I am your mother and your caretaker. I don't believe you going to college is the best thing for you sweetie. You'll get into trouble and meet girls.''

My eyes rolled in an instant. The normal one and the one partially covered by my swollen cheeks.

''Well, what if I want to get into trouble and meet girls?'' I took a sip of the black coffee I had made. Mom was impressed but I could see from her body language, she was afraid to admit as much. As my mother was sitting down eating the breakfast I'd prepared and enjoying it. I handed her something that I printed out from my computer.

''Oh, and there's this.'' I handed her a pamphlet for an apartment complex not far from the college. She almost choked on her pancakes, her eyes became watery and red. She knew this was serious.

''Oh my. Working there all these year's has made you all grown hasn't it?''

As she was listening to me and looking over the pamphlet, she got all caught up in everything and thus she forgot to ask me when I was moving out. From there I went to the gas station and I quit my job. When I checked my account and saw the full amount.

I believed I had enough money in the bank to weather whatever storm might come my way. I mean I had enough money to get a college education, and I could go to the college where the girl of my dreams was going.

And I even had enough money to pay for a few years of rent. Life was going to be different. It was going to be good. The best part was, during all these years when I'd ''test'' the voice, I was sensing the bugs would bite me and not long after they'd back off.

I mean for the most part I did what the voice said no matter what, but there were times I did deviate from plan. And did I pay for it dearly with sensations of pain which I can not presently put into words, well at least not pleasant words.

Mom had gotten me a cell phone months back. I'd already had my stuff packed. I did not return home during the night to say goodbye to her.

She kept calling and texting my phone to see if I was alright, to see if I wanted to come over for something to eat. I did not reply. It did not take long for my voicemail to fill beyond capacity. I was getting dozens of calls, texts, and voicemails from my mother.

She was worried, at what had overtaken me to do all of this. She even asked about why I quit my job. Her mood went from happy and supportive to sad, angry and questioning what my motivation behind all of this was.

I mean, the entire time I worked at the guess station I was living at home with my mother. And now came the time which I had saved all of this money, I'd met someone and decided to move away and follow my dreams it's as if I am the bad guy, or perhaps it's like I've committed some crime in my mother’s eyes.

The same day I was moving out of mom's house I was moving into a tiny apartment which I'd found and it was walking distance from the UT campus in Knoxville. I could go see Mary whenever I wanted now. I'd never been so happy in my entire life. I'd been calling her off and on for a while now. She'd always tell me that she'd get back to me. And then the voice would say things to me that it said that she told it. And how can I not believe what the voice says?

For a better manner of speaking, the voice was how we communicated. A little message here, and a little message there. For the most part, the voice has always been right. And the times when the voice has passed a message along with her it's always been right.

Right now the best thing of all is the bugs, their bites are going away. I don't even see them anymore when I feel stressed out.

I ended up applying for a job as a janitor at the campus when I enrolled. They told me as a member of the staff I would receive a discount for enrollment which only made my life better. It meant I would be able to save more money and get an excellent degree while going to school there.

When I moved into the apartment, before I could unbox anything, the voice had already used my hand without saying anything to me, to write out the list. I was never even aware of any of the items on the list. It was a very odd list. I had to go buy... ''ropes, chains, razors, shaving cream, a sturdy chair, a nail gun with plenty of nails, bleach, and a hell of a lot of plastic. And a box with a black marker. And I was told to write on the box, not to open it until a specific date.

From there I did as I was told. I got a lot of strange looks when I did all of that. But after I went about my business going to class, doing my janitor work and I was making excellent grades, my life was clicking on all cylinders.

Even though people still did stared at me like I was a freak, I didn't care because I was happy. And most of all, I had Mary in my life. She'd still text me and let me know that she'd get back to me, and the voice was always passing messages between us. So things were great.

This sensation was changing from psychotic and toxic to perhaps something along the lines of infatuation or more, but could it be? I'd never dealt with anything like this before. After months of being at school, mom called me I picked the phone up and listened. She said she was proud of the grades I was making, and I should come home for Christmas since I'd missed Thanksgiving.

She did not seem too happy when I told her I'd made plans with Mary. Mom seemed dumbfounded.

''Who's Mary?''

Without dwelling on the subject, I was sure I'd told her about the girl of my dreams who happened to be hearing the same voice I was, but I wasn't about to tell mom any of this.

''Goodnight and goodbye mother.''

And with that I hang up the phone. Before I ended the conversation I'd try to come home for Christmas. It was a bit of a half-truth. And the voice was creeping back in.

''It's almost time.''

As the week's stepped slowly towards Christmas, there was a chill in the air. But the chill was not the from the snow or ice which had been falling. I sensed an eerie darkness, something cold and strange.

A few days before Christmas I found out the grades I was making were putting me on track to have the highest grade point average on campus. And with a little more hard work I'd have the degree in management in no time, which I'd signed up for.

On the morning of Christmas Day, under my tiny makeshift Christmas tree, I opened the box the voice had told me to put away for a certain day. I'd even gift wrapped it to myself. In the box without my knowing it, the voice had used my hands to write a note, but I did not see. In some weird way it had gained physical control over my body without my knowledge. The note read.

''Go into the other room and smile at what I have left for you.'' As I walked into the kitchen my eyes nearly bulged from my head and out of their sockets. I saw Mary tied up in a chair. She was drugged and out of it. And for some strange reason she was choking on something.

''You're going to have to cut her all over to get the ropes off of her, she's only going to be able to swallow so much.''

I shook my head. But swallow so much of what? I tried my best to cut the ropes which were tied around her ever so tight, but it felt like a lost cause. In the process I had accidentally cut her a few too many times, and myself.

The more I tried to cut her loose, the more her eyes would roll in the back of her head until her body laid motionless in the chair, and then nothing. She was gone, dead. Right there in my kitchen. And worst of all, I had no explanation for how the girl of my dreams who I'd been talking to through the voice with messages over the past six months, had gotten there.

As I looked her over I realized the cut's were not the only thing to cause her death, the thing which she had been choking on, also contributed to her death as well. For hours I moped around. I kept wondering what I was going to do. I sat in the kitchen in a chair opposite from where her chair sat merely inches away.

My eyes were consumed with the sight of my beloved, covered in now dried blood and guts seeping from her body from all over. The sight was almost too much for me to bare.

I sat down and watched some television. I figured maybe I could come down and forget about all of this. And my worst fears were confirmed.

She had been missing for two days. Nobody had seen her, but if anyone did, campus police was to be notified immediately. I was in a daze, not sure what was real or fake. The med's I was supposed to take, I had forgotten to take them, yet once again. I closed the blinds because the direct sunlight was killing my eyes, especially with all of the snow that had fallen here lately. Snow blindness is no fun.

I pushed myself away and out of the chair I'd been sitting in, and walked into the bathroom. While I was using my razor and shaving cream to shave all of my hair off of my head, because the voice told me to, the sounds of sirens were getting yet louder. And it this was when a familiar sensation came creeping back, the bug's had returned. They rushed into the apartment bathroom.

''You didn't do it right, you never do.'' I looked around in a panic.

''But I tried, I really did this time. I did exactly what you told me to. Word for word as always. I always do as told. Please don't leave me.''

The profound sadness and guilt in my town of voice was utterly alarming. Sounds of heavy footsteps and crying from all directions were surrounding me.

''Won't be long now.''

As I stared at myself in the mirror at my now bald head, my eyes drifted towards my arms which were covered in cuts, hundreds of them. I practically looked like an extra for a horror movie at this point, there was the blood all over my body. My eyes were bloodshot red from crying, and from being so upset.

It was at this exact moment, I heard the sound which changed my life forever, the knock at the door. ''Open up. Knoxville Police Department.'' The knock's from the Officer on my door were repeated over and over. As I walked past the kitchen I turned my head away from Mary's dead body in guilt, because I knew this was the end of me.

I'd never see my mom again, and she'd never see her parents again because I had obviously killed her. Everything which I had worked and saved for, because of this, it's been all for nothing. All because I am the real true monster which everyone has always believed me to be, from day one.

When I opened the front door of my tiny apartment, the cop had a shocked look on his face.

''Son, are you alright?'' I had my head pointing towards the floor in shame.

''I'm sorry, I did it, I did it all. Please go easy on me. I don't remember anything. The voice he said to do it all, he's said to do it all from day one.''

Tears burst from my eyes like a faulty dam. And as if a bolt of furious thunder had come lashing out towards a helpless animal. The voice let me have it. It cursed at me for the first time in my life.

''You little shit, this is the end of you. What were you told? You do what I tell you, and you don't EVER tell anyone about me. But no, you had to go and tell the cops, of all people.''

The cop looked at me clueless for a moment. ''Are you okay?''

My eyes were solid and locked in a trance aiming towards the ground with my hands at my sides.

The Officer could see something was dripping from them. He would have seen the cuts on my arms but I had thrown on a dark blue button up long sleeved shirt, before I opened the door. The officer pulled my hand towards his face to inspect it. His eyes got big as he saw the large amounts of blood which were on my hands.

He checked both of them thoroughly. I heard him speaking into his little radio as he stepped away. ''I think we may have found her. Or at least a suspect. Over.'' When he walked back towards me, he made a subtle pushing hand on my chest as if to push his way into the apartment, which was right behind me. I wanted to let him in to the apartment to admit to my guilt, but at the same time I was ashamed, because every bit of this would end be the nightly news in Knoxville, and in the newspaper, embarrassing both of our families. Ruining my life for damn sure.

They'd send me towards shit creek without a paddle for Murder One. The bugs, by now, were biting me so hard the pain was burning me seriously. And the voice was whispering nasty things into my ear It wanted to do to me once I was in prison. When the cop walked into the apartment I was told to stay in the living room. He walked into the kitchen and his reaction was one which was shocking.

''Hey, come in here.'' I walked into the tiny kitchen and saw a single chair with rope hanging off parts of the chair and towards the floor. Blood was everywhere.

A piece of odd looking paper was stapled to the chair. It was a picture. I saw the officer snatch the picture from the chair, it was partially covered in blood. When he cleaned it off, I could see a snapshot of Mary smiling. He pulled his radio towards his face and tears were in his eyes.

''We got him.'' Without hesitation he proceeded to cuff me and read me my rights. ''Our new D.A. is gonna have a field day with you boy!'' The CSI came in and gathered all of the evidence they could. The story made the news. Mary's body was eventually found, in the back of a drowned car which was pushed into a local lake.

She'd been tied up, with cut marks all over. The cause of death had been ruled a homicide, from the massive amount of blood loss, and from drowning. It was all a massive embarrassment for both of our families. For me, everything was circumstantial at best, there was no body.

All they found in my tiny apartment was a ton of the dead girl's blood and nobody knew how it got there. The cop's had ran tests and it all turned out to be her blood. When I sat with my mom who was ashamed of me, during a talk with my defense lawyer.

It was at this time which I discovered they did not have much at all on me, in fact my greatest defense was my cell phone which I always carried with me. It had only been pinging in my apartment as well as at school, and never anywhere near the location which Mary's body had been found. But after all of this, it did not matter.

Mary's family was well connected her father was a lawyer. His firm was mighty powerful. And the judge knew her family well, practically grew up around her as family. I got the book thrown at me, thus I was given life in prison without parole. 100 years to be exact.

As I write these words I am waiting for my time when I take a ride on the lightning, and I am looking forward to it, because finally these goddamned little bugs will be burnt to hell and this voice will be burned out of my damn head forever!

The worst thing is knowing in my heart I will die as an innocent man. All of which because I listened to the voice of this unknown asshole in my head, who turned out to be an evil son of a bitch.

Yes evil won here, but I’ll get the last laugh hopefully. Moral of the story Alex, if you hear a voice in your head and it happens to control evil little burning bugs, ignore the voice and kill the bugs."

7yzw37,1,2018-02-20,Potential in Massachusetts with / without a degree?,Mummelpuffin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7yzw37/potential_in_massachusetts_with_without_a_degree/,"TL;DR at the bottom.

First of all: I know, having a CS degree is *always massively helpful*, and that finding a position, even an internship without one will always be very difficult.

That being said, the opinions of r/cscareerquestions seem to vary significantly when it comes to the feasibility of getting hired without that degree.  Of course, part of that variation comes from different assumptions regarding actual job readiness which I hope to mitigate as much as possible through any means necessary, initially through LaunchSchool.com, which is... bootcamp-like but far more interested in producing competent students then pushing them out in a certain timeframe.

Otherwise, I imagine that the variation in potential interviews with / without a degree is somewhat location-based. Presumably Massachusetts is heavily degree-centric no matter what sort of position you're looking for. Would I be correct in assuming that? 
 
Launch School generally focuses on web development (oh boy...  I know, it's hideously oversaturated but I find Launch School's philosophy to reasonable to care).

TL;DR:
For those who have worked in the Boston area, all things being equal, do you think it's reasonably possible for someone without a degree to get their ""foot in the door"" for a backend / fullstack focused web development position, for an internship at a decent company at least?

7z04ve,2,2018-02-20,what should I do?,isteponmushrooms,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7z04ve/what_should_i_do/,"x-posting from /r/depression

My name is Gabe. I turn 19 in June. I'm a transgender guy. I live in France. I've lost will to live.

I haven't been to public school since I was 13. I got homeschooled because of depression, still graduated. I'm working now, as a graphic designer. The work is good. My coworkers are nice. I have some plans for the future, I'd like to be a tour manager.

I broke up with my boyfriend of a year last december which led me to a suicide attempt and a week of forced institutionalization. This happened again last week. Another week in the hospital. I can't stand it, I hate it. I lied to the doctors so I could get home and rest at home instead. I don't have to go back to work until the 3rd.

My friends are slipping away from me. They're all getting significant others, better friends, new jobs. I talk to very little people, even when I start conversation, people drop me. I don't feel entitled to replies, but it hurts.
My parents support me and they're the reason I haven't truly done anything drastic yet. My mom has bad mental health and losing her son would make her life hell. But lately I've been feeling past that point of guilt.

I have planned a trip for late june-early july. I would be going to California to meet an older friend to drive me around and follow my favourite band. I even got a VIP ticket to get to meet them. I did this so I could tell them how much they have changed and helped me these past few years. I'd like to ask if they'd take me as an intern for tour managing next year, but I don't think I'll have the balls.

I feel like I won't make it to that point. It's hard to wake up. It's hard to do anything. They switched my meds (paroxetine to zoloft, valium, depakene) and I cannot walk correctly, I lose balance, get vertigo, collapse in the stairs. So I've been spending my time on the couch or in bed. I do nothing. I listen to music.

I used to be a musician. It was my biggest passion in life. I wanted it to be my whole life. I think I had a talent. I played every instrument and I loved it all. I didn't care what anybody thought. 

I lost all of this. I lost all will to play, now playing is a chore, I hate everything that I do. Yet I finished up an album with my ex, but I got in an argument with him today because it's only a side project to him and he doesn't care about my feelings (how I'd like to see it come out, because it's a reason for me to carry on). He can be extremely selfish. I'm glad we broke up. 

I'm writing all of this because I have no one to listen to me. I bother my ""friends"" with my depressing words. I think more and more seriously about suicide, not even the idea of the California trip is redeeming it. Waiting months seems impossible. I don't even feel like going back to work, I'm not gonna be productive. It's gonna be breakdowns in the break room again and puffy eyes in the morning. I have to set up a big, stressful festival for june and it's already stressing me out. I don't want to do it at all anymore, but I need the money for traveling and drugs. It's all that makes it worth it. 

Given I make the trip, that means my work contract has ended. I'm left with some money. From there, depending on how I feel, I will visit my friend in Denmark or I will buy more drugs and alcohol. It's how I have planned I will do it if I have to do it.

I can't pinpoint when or where exactly I lost the will to live and when my life became this. Sleeping and doing nothing. When I work, all I do when I come home is sleep. I don't eat in the evenings. I'm fat enough. 
I don't want to see doctors anymore, the hospitals tire me. Doctors don't know anything about me and I'm too tired to tell them everything. They think their pills will solve it all. They might. I will see.

What do you do when you don't enjoy anything, nothing seems worth it, the guilt has gone away, and it feels like the gates are finally opening up for you to go?

I've never felt so lost. I've never felt so alone.

Thank you for listening."

Tutoring- I tutor kids at my local library weekly whenever I can to build connections with my community
I regularly attend events in support of minorities and those in the LGBT community. 

Job/Work Experience:
Worked at Taco Bell for the past year

I had the opportunity to be an intern at both a technology company called Infinite Media as well as a laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor.
My tech internship was during the summer, and I created the basis for websites and blogs, while I am still currently at cold spring conducting an experiment based on the decision making processes of rodents. My neuroscience internships takes up the bulk of my time, as I travel 40 minutes from school 4 times a week, but it's extremely filling. I'm extremely honored to be around such renowned scientists, no matter the distance it takes to get there. 

Personal Statement: I think my essay was a 10/10. I decided to take a risk and steer away from the contemporary ways of writing and wrote a story about the time I jumped into a puddle as a child. Yup, lol. I wrote about how I was a shy kid growing up and used to be ashamed of my background. English wasn't my first language and many people taunted me for that, and I one day I told myself ""If I can do something crazy like shamelessly jumping into a puddle with people around me, that'll be the first step I take to branch out and be more confident. So, I took my own dare and after diving into that crater-sized puddle, nothing was ever the same. 

My supplementary essay for Harvard was even sillier. I wrote about my shoes. Hahah, yes, my old torn up running shoes that I constantly wore as a middle schooler.  You'd be amazed how much I could pull out about my treasured shoes. They've not only carried my feet, they've walked many roads filled with despair, excitement, and hope. I'd give it a 9/10/


Letter of Recommendations: I was so surprised after receiving copies of my LORs after submitting my common app. They were better than I could ever imagine. My Ap Physics teacher, Band teacher, Lang teacher, and my Professor at the lab I'm interning wrote my letters. Each showed different angles of me and portrayed how I was seen in different lens throughout various departments. But what intrigued me was that all of these different teachers had a single thread that made each letter unique to only me. And I loved that!!

Interview:
I only had an interview for Harvard, and it was THE BEST!! Here's a link of me describing it on reddit- https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/7v3b46/my_harvard_interview_was_the_best_i_could_ever/?sort=top

Other
Applied for Financial Aid?: Yup

Intended Major: Psychology

State (if domestic applicant): New York

School Type: Average

Ethnicity: Black 

Gender: Female

Income Bracket: 125,000

Hooks (URM, first generation college, research, etc.): 
I guess I would say some hooks would be being a published author, my activism and identity in the LGBT community, and being a minority with my childhood setbacks.

First some background: I’m a physics student looking to move to France after I get my bachelor’s degree (am currently a sophomore) with the goal of eventually becoming a citizen. Now even though I’m a physics major I’ve shifted in the direction of computer science after discovering I have quite a passion for the subject. I don’t want to change my major for fear of delaying my immigration further, but I’m working on a minor in CS and am also practicing and studying programming on my own in the hopes of finding a job in programming or working on a master’s in it, depending on which works better for me. I’ve managed to land a position as a TA for a computational physics course that uses Python, so I know that I’m at least getting somewhere.

The options I’m looking at are as follows:

A.	Try to get a work visa for a software development job as soon as I finish college. As far as I can tell, this would be pretty difficult without further education or an impressive amount of internship experience or personal projects, though I’m going to try to do those regardless of what option I end up choosing.

B.	Get a master’s in France for computer science or (preferably not) physics. The thing I’m most worried about with this path is money. I only have a few thousand dollars saved at the moment and I’ll have about 20K in student debt when I graduate. My dad (who has paid for most of my tuition) says he’ll pay off my debt for me. I don’t know if he’d be willing to support me through graduate school, but either way it makes me anxious to rely so much on his generosity when he’s close to retirement and has already spent so much for me.

C.	Marry my boyfriend, who is a natural-born French citizen. We’re both willing to do this, but I’d rather go for another option if possible. Although as far as I can see this would give me the ability to work. Actually this seems like it’s probably the easiest option.

I’m also not quite fluent in French yet, but it’ll be a couple of years still before I graduate so I’m not too worried about that. My boyfriend and Duolingo have been helping me learn.

Any thoughts on my options would be appreciated, thanks."

I am a student soon graduating with a Graphic Arts Associate in Arts. Most of my classes are now online, and I am trying to find a full-time job in large/mid-size tech company. I have experience in retail/marketing/branding at 3 different companies, each spanning a year except for an internship. I recently interviewed for a job I really love. My friend works there and recommended me. I passed all interview stages (which included a written test and 3 separate interview with a team captain, office manager, and head of HR.) I would say I did decently at two interviews (although I was awkward and nervous). But, I feel like I really connected with the office manager, so that was good. After this process, they let me know the next steps would be to meet together, decide if I go through a background check, then meet again after the BC and either offer me the job or not. Through talking with the office manager, I found they are hiring about 30-50 employees for the position i applied for (customer solution specialists). I do feel that I am qualified. They eventually did send me a BC to fill out last thursday 2/15. It is now Tuesday night 2/20 and I haven't heard back. Background check should be fine. My friend who works there and recommended me actually has an arrest for possession of weed on his record. I have a totally clean record. I'm super nervous even though I've been to countless other places and been getting interviews. This is really the only tech startup in my area and relocation isn't a feasible option for me. 

What are my next steps? Should I follow up at some point? (After the last in-person interview I send out a thank you email) Do you think that I have a good chance?

How do you deal with the anxiety of waiting to hear back from a job? Any tips for a really nervous, soon to be grad? (unfortunately doing another low paying/unpaid internship is not an option, really strapped on cash. I have little / no family help and live on my own.)"

My school recently started an 'official' Co-Op program, where you stay over the summer and take a semester off to work as an intern. I took classes over the summer and fall last year, finishing my third year, but unfortunately didn't manage to get a job for this Spring.

I feel so worthless, after all of my hard work, having not gotten a job. I was really excited to begin getting some experience in my field, but extremely disheartened now that I'm essentially unemployed. I know many others in the program, some of which who cheated off of me during the semester (and got a zero on those tests, as well as an academic strike), who got jobs, and now it feels like all of my sacrifices were worthless. I'm sure many of you understand how you feel after a semester ends, and taking so many with no breaks at all has really fucked me up, socially and emotionally.

I'm not really sure where to go from here. I'm going to apply to a bunch of summer internships, but spending last summer at school instead of working for some company seems to have put me behind others in terms of experience. I'm worried that at this point in my education many companies would prefer experience over GPA, and working so hard for my GPA seems like a waste of time right now. I would have been better off partying like those who actually got jobs.

Anyways, I was hoping to maybe get some advice from those who have been in a similar situation or work in a similar field. Thanks. "

I introduced a large project concerning a customer service AI and have been the only person working on it and now my project is finally taking off and is going to go into user testing (super excited). 

I love the job, but i don't see myself working in this company after graduation because the company relies a lot on .NET and proprietary technologies which I'm not fond of.

But I am thinking of applying to some other companies that focus more on development but I'm not sure what's really out there.

I took a temp job within the pool doing something similar to what I was doing when I first started there. But to put this on my resume, I just that I worked at that university with the dates of my employment and a brief description of some of my duties.

Is this even something I should contact the recruiter about, and send an updated copy of my resume, or not even bother?

I do plan to save the majority of the money I earn so I don't have to worry about the upcoming bill later this year.

**Long story short**: I've been leaving the IT companies world to live the dream of indie game developer. Unleashed is my first big project, and it will probably define how I'll live in the future. That's why I've made a demo that you can download to test Unleashed in its current state. See below for the links.


&amp;nbsp;


**Full story**: I believe I'm not the only one in my case; living games as a passion since my childhood, dreaming of making my own someday. I've done my best to go towards this goal, and I ended up in an IT engineer school. I've been able to learn a lot until I got my diploma, but the internships I had left me with a weird feeling. I was like ""is this really what I wanted to do? I mean, this has nothing to do with game development, and... I don't feel like I belong here"".


&amp;nbsp;


I've still tried to continue this way, while making video games on my spare time. But then Unleashed appeared in my mind. At first, it was just developed as a hobby. Then, I started spending all my time on it, putting all my guts in it even though it killed what was left of my social life. I was in an IT company and I told myself ""I'll never be enjoying it. I can't continue like this without trying to do what I want"". But you know, I had constraints: parents that paid studies so I get this diploma, girlfriend that expected me to have a good salary... So living as an indie was a social suicide. 


&amp;nbsp;


But I did it. I left my job, endorsed my responsibilities in front of my surrounding and said ""Let me give this a try. I don't want to live like this if I haven't even tried to do my thing"". I didn't tell the entire truth though. It's hard to say to your family that even if you have pretty much everything to be happy, you kinda feel depressed. Because everyday I was telling myself ""So is that my life?"". It can seem stupid to complain knowing that some people live way worse than I do, but I was like ""Why couldn't I be happy? I'd like to try"". Being a 9 to 5 employee would not allow me to find happiness, while spending dozen of hours and even working at night would be fine if it is for game development.  


&amp;nbsp;


And that's where it led me now. Almost a year later, Unleashed has reached a state where it can be shown to the public, and hopefully you'll feel all the efforts that were put in it. There are two versions: one for Windows and one for Linux.


&amp;nbsp;


To talk just a bit about Unleashed, it is a 2D RPG set in a dark fantasy world. You'll find traditional RPG elements such as open world exploration, inventory and team management, but also sandbox features like crafting, harvesting, housing. The battles are turn based, and you will use creatures representing either a sin or a virtue to fight in 3v3 battles. We've decided to replace the traditional fire/ice/water elements by sins &amp; virtues. It is of course still a dev build and you should expect bugs and unfinished elements.


&amp;nbsp;


If you want to take a look at what the game looks like: [Game's early trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6zAHkCpyiE)

What are all of your thoughts?

Side Note: I would be with 15-20 other interns at IBM and about 50 other interns at CDK Global (if that even matters at all).

As of right now I feel lost. I’ve passed all of my classes but if you ask me to fix a computer I would have no idea where to start. Sure check certain components and if the cables where in but after that I am lost. So what I’m looking for is have I wasted 3 years and 15k in loans? Should I stick out the last 4-5 classes? I am trying to get an internship for the summer will that help me understand where I am ?

I have toured as a musician with Broadway shows since graduating, including several international tours with a pretty high-profile company overseas. I'm trying to make a major career change from performing to software development. My biggest concerns are (1) if I don't include this, I don't have much professional experience to note (certainly none in CS) and (2) will making note of a career change make me look flaky?

Thank you very much for your time. I'm very happy to have found this sub.

EDIT: I might add that I'm specifically applying for internships at this point."

I have narrowed my offers down to two. One from a smallish aerospace company where I would work on signal processing algorithms for radar, image processing and other things for unmanned aircraft. The second is from a national lab (United States) where I would be working on writing electromagnetic and plasma physics simulation codes.

I have worked on computational electromagnetics research for over a year now and enjoy it enough to consider pursuing a PhD in it or something related. This makes the national lab opportunity very enticing. On the other hand, The aerospace job is more of a typical engineering job (something I have not held yet) so the exposure would help me decide if jumping straight into a job after my BS is a good idea. The national lab would be more of a position to show me what a job after a PhD is like.

Last to mention, the location of the aerospace job is really cool (San Diego), whereas the national lab is not as exciting (although still not a bad place). The financial package at the aerospace job is also very good and I haven't gotten official numbers form the lab yet.

I got my bachelor's in applied math, and decided that I wanted to switch gears and do computer science because it seemed much more practical and interesting to me. 

I've become very interested in Machine Learning, both because of its exciting possibilities and because I feel that I am well suited for the field, given my background in math. Is it mandatory to get a PhD in ML in order to get a career in it? A PhD seems like a huge time commitment, and I'm starting to get a little burned out on school and would like to work in industry if possible.

If a PhD is not necessary, how should I best spend the rest of my time until I complete my masters in order to get a career in ML? I'm taking pretty much every ML class I can get my hands on in grad school, and I also recently started working ~15 hr/week at a small company where I'll be doing webdev/mobile development work for them. They've hinted that they might offer me a summer internship if I do well, which would be great as I have pretty much no work experience on my resume. However, between my classes and this place I have basically no time to work on personal projects, research opportunities, or interview prep.

TL;DR What should I, a masters CS student, prioritize in order to get a job in AI/Machine Learning?

* Taking many machine learning classes and doing well in them
* Getting work experience doing webdev/mobile dev (not ML related)
* Working on ML-related personal projects
* Practicing interview prep/questions and trying to get a ML-related or some other kind of internship over the summer
* Hunting for opportunities to do research before I graduate
* Looking into getting a PhD"

I am a Junior CS undergrad on the East Coast but have not been limiting my search based on location. Being an international student I understand it's harder/costlier for companies to hire me but I am still looking to get *some* experience before I graduate.

Most internship postings I come across on Indeed, Linked-in, Handshake or even directly on an employer's site seems to require work authorization, US citizenship or permanent residency.

It looks like one of my first big projects will be on predictive maintenance (specifically on building a monitoring system for their existing models) and I wanted to get a head start. Searching my school's databases has done okay at becoming familiarized with some of the basics of PdM, but I'm wondering if anyone can help with some of the details. 

I'm not too familiar with the specifics of the data just yet, but we essentially have a stream which collects data on the position of each axis of each robot, as well as a few other attributes (I want to say current flowing through each axis? Torque? Something like that). From what I understand the models are essentially unsupervised, as its cost-prohibitive to allow failures to occur.

Anyway my three main questions are:


* 1. How would I go about creating a feedback loop for PdM?
* 2. What metrics could be used - if the data is unsupervised like I  suspect it is, then obviously accuracy/precision/recall/f1 are out. My guess so far would be to use uptime/downtime, or some sort of dollar savings relative to preventive maintenance instead of predictive. 
* 3. How best to visualize these. I'm guessing this monitoring system is intended to be client-facing, so on top of developing understandable metrics it will be important to have useful visualizations. Also interested in knowing what kinds of tools are companies using to produce these visualizations.

Thanks in advance for any help or advice. If anyone with experience in PdM can direct me toward any especially helpful papers/atricles I would really appreciate it!"

- Don't take any extra classes and spend that time doing research or working part time instead
- Some combination of the above two.

7za9zn,5,2018-02-21,Being confident about job prospects with a math degree and not looking back,codingmath,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7za9zn/being_confident_about_job_prospects_with_a_math/,"Hi,

This is rant-ish but I see a lot of other people doing that here and listeners give insightful answers so worth a shot. 

I am a math grad student and I am leaving with an applied math masters in May from an average tier but big university. I did undergrad at a small liberal art school with good regional rankings but not so famous. I started off as a CS major but didn't like 'love' it. Math on the other hand was my favorite. Calc 1,2, and 3 that I had to take for my CS classes in freshman year made me feel like a hero. I used to prompt answers in class, tutor for those classes while taking those classes. CS just annoyed me with all those compile errors.

I decided to double major in math and CS, but as the semesters went by CS just became uninteresting and math felt more intellectually stimulating. My math grade row was all As and Bs while my CS grades were Cs and Bs. I felt unmotivated when we were doing assembly language coding. Theoretical CS and discrete math was fun tho(any CS that had to be done on paper and not on compiler). By senior year CS just gave me depression. I was 9 credits and a capstone away from finishing the CS major when I just decided to not do it and apply to math grad school instead. At the time it felt like the right decision since CS just gave me depression and the classes I had left to take were all taught by this one professor that everyone hated who had bad teaching style and even people who loved CS and aced all classes got Cs in his class( eventually he got fired).

I came to grad school but didn't really like it. It felt as if the math that I was studying(ODE, Real Analysis, Topology) was too hard and had no real applications besides teaching and maybe govt jobs(that I am not eligible for since I'm international). Grad level linear algebra and probability are the only classes that I have taken that I feel(or have been told) will be 'useful' to me if I do a dual math/cs career.  The only other path that was shown to me was financial math but I took math of financial derivatives and found it boring. I thought of actuarial science for a little bit but after spending a summer teaching CS for a summer internship, refreshing CS on my own, speaking to software engineers working the Bay Area, CS just started to seem interesting and fun. I came back to grad school and took a software engg class with undergrads over here and loved it. We made a web app, did scrum and agile stuff. I started hating all the hard math assignments and starting coding all the time. 
Now I grind leetcode 'for fun', reading DS&amp;A, CTCI/EPI hoping to come back to a career in CS. I am getting some interviews but none in the Bay. I feel not finishing that major has set me back and I just can't shake this feeling. I mean, at the time CS was just depressing but I guess after studying hard graduate level math that has no real employment ops made CS feel easy? I don't know what changed in me but I just can't shake this regretful feeling of not pursuing BS-CS or MS-CS. 
How do I just let go? I try to tell myself that nothing bad has happened as I still have a STEM degree after all. I have a couple interviews lined up for a software dev position at a couple banks in 3 weeks. None of them are my dream jobs(I still dream of the Bay) but I should be grateful and work towards acing them and then work my way up but I just can't. I keep regretting going to school for math for another two years, TAing undergrads some intro level math instead of doing something that enhanced by job prospects in todays tech world. 
I am taking some online data science and machine learning courses these days on coursera and udemy as I only have one class left to take for my degree but that makes me feel even more wasteful towards my schoolwork. Like how these courses feel more useful than all that time and hard work spent doing real analysis homework.

Part of me thought of trying to get admission at a top tier CS(machine learning) PhD program after a year of working as a software dev to assuage my guilt of making bad career moves but that's a far fetched thing. I want to find a way to be happy and content with myself and my life choices right now and peacefully finish my degree and go through these interviews."
7zaeen,0,2018-02-21,Is it too late for me?,_RETLAW,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7zaeen/is_it_too_late_for_me/,"I’m currently a junior at a university in a large Midwest city studying business management with a concentration in sports, as well as a minor in marketing. I’m 16 credit hours from graduating. I’ve held internships for my schools athletic department and a small time professional team in sports marketing capacities. I’ve also done a summer consulting experience in California working with another small time professional sports team. 


I’ve played sports all my life and near the end of high school I realized I’d like to turn that passion of mine in to a career. Through my work at internships, I’m realizing now that a marketing/management route might not be what I was meant to do. 


Ever since I took my first statistics class in high school, I loved it. I’m a very average student, but it was probably one of the only classes I excelled in. I never gave any thought to majoring in computer or data science, I thought I just wanted to work in sports and that would make me happy. 


I was doing some research on internships today for marketing. There is a company locally that does industry leading work in sports analytics. I don’t know exactly what it was, but it was an eye opener for me...”Why would I want to do a marketing internship for an organization who does some really cool stuff? I’d rather be the one doing the analytics.”


So I started doing some research in what I can switch up between now and graduation to at least gain some understanding of computer science...changing my major is out of question. I can change my marketing minor to a computer science or data science/analysis minor (crammed). Graduate school can be an option.


I just want to learn about this industry, I know I have a passion for analytics. I’ve never done computer science in any capacity though.


I was telling my uncle all of this over dinner recently and he explained that his brother is an EVP for an insurance company in the city and a lot of what he needs is data analysts and such. He wants me to meet him and believes he would be willing to help me out and open the door in to the industry for me. 


One day I want to work within sports analytics, but I know I can’t expect that right away. I know I need to learn, work in a different industry and create a portfolio/network for myself. I get all of that. I just don’t really know what my next step is.


I guess I’m just at a crossroad and I really don’t know what to do and would love some advice.


TLDR: I’m nearing the end of a degree that I don’t think I want to be in necessarily. I have no educational background in computer science/data science. I don’t know what my next step is. "

[ a metal chair is pulled out and the female takes her seat. she is in the room with a male who is strapped to his chair. ] 

DR. V: ( to second party with her ) You look awful. 

0198: My name is a number now? You guys don’t waste time making people feel like shit. 

DR. V: Is that what made you look this way? Huh. ( pauses ) I don’t see why you’d take it so personally. Is the number offensive? I’m asking so I can make a note of it for later. 

0198: My name is █████, dammit! 

DR. V: I’ll have to edit this now to keep your name from being audible. 

0198: Why the fuck are you the one doing this? I was always handed off to Dr. Z because you could never— 

( dr. v sighs and begins to tap her pen against the metal table. ) 

DR. V: Dr. Z is more patient with new employees than I am. I would rather all of you arrive here already trained and knowledgeable, but, apparently, that can only happen if the people experience this work hands-on. 

0198: Why am I even in this situation? I did everything I was asked to do. I never broke any of your rules! 

DR. V: Lying is an ugly habit. But, that’s my opinion. So, I’ll just ask this once, are you sure you want to stick to your current story? ( she sighs ) I don’t care either way. Honestly, I wanted to just terminate you. But, it’s the twenty-first century, my colleagues have changed things over the years. 

0198: ( after a long moment of silence, he clears his throat ) I wasn’t looking for it. It just— 

DR. V: ( finishing his sentence ) ...popped up out of nowhere? I’ve heard that one before. The first two times, sure, I entertained the idea… 

0198: I thought it was some kind of joke! Jesus, I didn’t even think about any of it until I started thinking about it all! 

DR. V: Everyone is aware of it, you’re just the one idiot that seems to think you’re in a fantasy novel where you’re the only one to stop the apparent danger. 

0198: Do you— do ANY of you actually do any good? Do you? What the fuck is even in that bottom level?!

DR. V: If I told you, I’d have to edit it out of the audio. I don’t want the extra work. 

0198: What are you going to do to me? Kill me? 

DR. V: ( putting her pen down and leaning back in her chair ) Detached. 

0198: What—

DR. V: That’s one word that I’d use for myself. I’m going to be very honest with you, █████, and that’s something I rarely do. But, for you, a man who I thought would have been dead after his first day, I’ll entertain the idea of being as honest as I can be. Or, at least as honest as I can manage. 

0198: I’m going to die… 

DR. V: When you came here, what was the first room they showed you? I suggested 0005, but, that was considered too much. “Ease them into it.”, that’s what L said. So, which was it? 

0198: ( quietly, almost a whisper ) the girl… 

DR. V: That’s no better, but knowing if someone can handle that sort of situation is important, I guess. 0019. She wasn’t mine to handle, I think I was still working with Z on 0012 during that time. You see, 0012 seems docile enough, but, it only became that way after we realized it missed the moon. ( chuckle ) Any idea what it was like to tell Z that I was going to put in a window? 

( a small pause, dr. v seems to hum in response to an answer 0198 didn’t give ) 

DR. V: You start to piece together what he is actually feeling after a while of working with him. But… ( she tries to gather her thoughts ) Right. 0019.

0198: How old is she? 

DR. V: How old does someone have to be to get pity from another? 

( 0198 is silent, as if slowly realizing what dr. v means. ) 

DR. V: Mm… You had a daughter. I suppose 0019 felt they would gain the most pity from you with that idea. However, I wonder if you would want to know what she looks like to me? 

0198: I don’t think you would pity anything. You don’t look like you pity anyone but yourself. 

DR. V: I suppose you feel I deserve that. But, if you knew as much as you think you do, you’d know the answer. 

0198: What, does she look like a vacation to you? 

DR. V: She can’t take on those kinds of mirages. No, when I first was introduced to her, she shifted her form several times. I think she was confused, most of her go-to forms weren’t getting her anywhere. Not with me, at least. 

0198: That proves my point. 

DR. V: She isn’t a child, you know. She’s fairly old, actually. I believe her age is around ██ years, but that’s an educated guess. Gray hair, long and down to her knees. I asked L why they hadn’t bothered to get her a chair to sit in, and she gave me a puzzled look. As if I knew something even she had forgotten about. 

0198: Wouldn’t ...I mean, she’d get pity in that— 

DR. V: Logical thought remains at times. You see a child and consider the life they won’t get to experience if they continue to reside behind a thick wall. Or, in her case, with her hands cut off and her lips sealed shut. Shifting for visual response was the best she could settle for given her other tricks were dealt with accordingly. 

0198: Her mouth— it’s sealed shut?? What the fuck— 

DR. V: I guess she didn’t let you see that. I’d of personally let her keep her mouth. Sound canceling headphones could fix that, but, like I said, I wasn’t involved with her. She has a chair in her room because of me. She’s in pain. 

0198: Maybe because you fucks cut her hands off and— 

DR. V: ( ignoring him ) 0019 is suffering from her own stigma. A secondary side effect that must have manifested between the time she was captured to even now. I know she didn’t feel that pain her entire life, she wouldn’t have been so uncomfortable and pitiful if she had lived with it for so long. 

0198: How do you know she didn’t just find the one thing that got you to pity her? 

DR. V: That’s a clever boy, now you’re showing your smarts. 

0198: So? 

DR. V: █████, I said I was going to be honest with you. And, I’m afraid I was lying about something… but, never mind that. I’ll answer your question. I know it wasn’t a mere trick because I could see the one thing that told me she was in pain. 

0198: What was it. 

DR. V: No one bothered to give her a change of clothes during her time here. If they had seen the blood that trailed down from her stomach, they would have bothered to look for her kin before it was too late. 

( there’s a moment of brief silence. 0198 seems to be processing what was said. ) 

0198: ...what the fuck… 

DR. V: I had some of the interns perform a ceremony and cremation with her present. It doesn’t make her like this place, but it gained me some of her respect. I’m not a complete monster. 

0198: ...What… did you mean by you having lied to me before? 

DR. V: You didn’t find anything special, █████. Not in regards to knowledge, at least. But, if you hadn’t been so curious, maybe you wouldn’t have been in this situation. 

0198: What situation? What— ( 0198 begins to become more panicked ) What the fuck is going on?! 

DR. V: We can be cruel. I know that, but it’s apart of the job. I mean, it’s not like we decided to make a petting zoo. But, I suppose the pity I have now is knowing 0019 could have been without her pain. Now, she’s going to hate me. It’ll be like any other day. 

( 0198 is no longer listening, instead, he is trying to get up from his chair. he is tugging at his restraints and screaming. he is resorting to vulgar language before he is heard to be in extreme pain. dr. v continues to speak normally despite this. ) 

DR. V: The baby was interesting. I felt like I owed it something, which is odd, I never felt much over what we keep here. I think it even thought of me as a parent. 

( 0198’s screams are loud, and his anguish is obvious, until there’s a sound of flesh tearing apart. then nothing. ) 

DR. V: Truth be told, it couldn’t be content with just having it’s odd form. It wanted more. Even knowing it would kill it… 

DR. Z: You could have let me handle it. 

DR. V: This is my lesson, so why make you do it. I’m already going to be dealing with the paperwork, unless… 

DR. Z: No. 

DR. V: Eh. Worth a shot. 

[ END OF AUDIO. ] 

Note from Dr. V: 

“I apologize for my weakness. In the time we have all been working together, I was always the one being distant. But, I guess I have my weaknesses. I won’t allow this to be a repeated event. As of ████████ ██, 0019 has been terminated. I made the decision with Dr. Z. The room she was in will not be reused. It will serve as my reminder. When we try to be humane, we should remember to plan two graves.” "

I reviewed my resume many times and have tried to re-write things to either be more concise or sound more technical. Meanwhile, my equally capable classmates are getting roles that they didn't really have much track record in. They seem to be interviewed with generic technical questions and then being placed in some specialized role. Something tells me that I'm just not having the right strategy when I apply. 


I completed a software developer position last summer and then did a small Engineering internship that was semi-technical at a large well-known company, but doesn't really require a CS background to do (mostly repetitive computer work requiring attention to detail). I managed to fluff up my work there by emphasizing all the technical/analytical work. So my work experience was exclusively at 2 fortune 500 companies. I thought I had a good background with these 2 jobs + technical projects + 3.5 GPA + a few achievements, but I can't seem to get interviews for roles that I qualify for based on the job description. I live in the Bay Area and have been mostly applying to large companies because I absolutely love the work environment, culture, and compensation at large companies. 

I was wondering what I could do to improve my resume which consists of: (1) Education + 3.5 GPA (2) My 2 roles (3) All the significant group projects I worked on at school + 1 personal/1 hackathon winning project (description+tools used) (4) 2 merit-based achievements. 

How could I do a better job describing my personal projects? How badly is a 1.5-page resume hurting me vs a 1-page resume?"

7zeouq,1,2018-02-22,Boss is taking advantage of my fellowship position and working me beyond stipend hour limits without compensation.,Saraisa23,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7zeouq/boss_is_taking_advantage_of_my_fellowship/,"I was advised to cross-post here from r/relationships. I'm in New York City.

If this should be referred to a different subreddit, let me know. So I've recently graduated. During my last semester, I started a paid fellowship at a small company (about 6 employees), that's well respected in my industry. The school pays me my stipend. It covers my rent short of $50. My parents send what they can for food while I transition. My boss is a successful alum of my university. After I graduated my boss offered for me to continue the internship since I didn't complete the hours to receive the full stipend. She also said I could be trained and take over her production assistant's position for March while he went to visit family overseas. Every time we trained she would beam and say how excited she was to see us become a great production team.

At the end of January, I completed the hours to receive the rest of my stipend. My boss said she'd extend my internship as an alum and the school would continue to pay me. As February progressed we had a large industry event to prepare for. I usually worked 3-4 days a week. My boss asked me to start coming in 6 days one week, and then the next week I worked 8 days straight. I did this expecting more hours to be reported to the school and to be paid accordingly. When I tried to confirm my hours with the school, they told me that they can only pay the first stipend and that's it. Anything beyond that was out of their hands. My boss also ignored emails to confirm my hours from me and the school. When I asked her about it yesterday she played dumb and said she knows nothing about my hours. She asked why I had to get the school involved (maybe because they pay me??) and she told me to go talk to the production assistant about my hours. When I asked him he said she told him to stop discussing my hours and stipend with me!

When she finally confirmed with the school it was only for a little over half the hours I worked for January and she wants to hold back the rest of the stipend until I finish working for her in March. Along with that, she changed the conditions for March. She only wants me there two half days a week. Not full time anymore. She said, ""That should be enough time for you to find something else."" I was holding onto this for so long, hoping to have a good first job out of school in a high position. I feel so taken advantage of. I want to quit and just get my full stipend and pay my needs for March while I look for other work. I also want to demand she pay me for the hours I worked beyond the stipend. I did so many things preparing for the event especially since most of the office caught the flu.

I just don't know how to not leave things on a sour note. Or if that matters. I want a good reference on my resume and I don't know if I should bother demanding those extra hours paid or just collect the remaining stipend and go. I don't know how I would even go about asking that she pays me those beyond stipend hours. She wants me in again next Wednesday now and I don't feel its right to continue to work another day for her. My mom wants me to report her to the Department of Labor but I feel that may be drastic and leave me worse off.

I'm not a bad employee. I'm on time, I'm respectful and enthusiastic. Everyone says I'm sweet and get along well. I always stay after the time I'm supposed to leave. My boss complimented on all the work I did for the event and the precise skill of it and said she appreciates having me around. Now it's as if she pulled the rug from under me. Because I see through her now and how she took advantage of my position for free labor and I think she's pissed and being vengeful. All because I asked why she wouldn't confirm my hours.
___________________________________________________________________________________________
tl;dr: Continued a paid fellowship after graduation. Boss promised me a full-time position and worked me beyond stipend hours. Boss lied about extending fellowship for continued payment. Boss won't confirm all hours with school. Boss withdrew full-time position plan. Boss owes me money for hours worked beyond stipend limit. Should I demand the money for hours worked beyond? Should I quit now for my own moral sake? Should I just take the stipend and accept it? Should I report her to the NYC Dept of Labor?"

I currently am in the process of finishing my first 3 month internship in contracting/construction side (Civil engineering) in a small-ish family run construction firm. The internship is unpaid but I need it for experience/hour requirements as part of my course/degree (not in the US).

Now, I am probably expecting an offer soon to stay on by the boss and it will most likely be paid work (if it isn't, I'll probably just decline by default), however the problem is that I don't really enjoy the work environment and the team (somewhat). 

I feel as if my directing manager holds some kind of prejudice against me for no real valid reason (that I know of). He isn't an approachable type and is quite somewhat intimidating to me as a newbie, so I don't actually feel too comfortable in this learning environment. I.e: It is hard for me to ask questions as I feel he will snap at me or feel irritated at my presence. Or, whenever he periodically needs something from me, but has never formally introduced it to me, he just gets cranky. It's like getting mad at a dog for not 'sitting' when you've never shown it how to sit ever. Most of the things here have been self-learn for me. 

I don't interact much with the manager nor my boss, because I am mostly on the project site, but I think the boss is pretty neutral to me unlike the manager (They are brothers). I don't see them much as mentors as they've never really guided me on anything. Furthermore, working with the site-crew/labourers etc is sometimes alright/friendly, and other times they are pretty distant/rough/blunt which can make the day go worse than usual lol. The office staff are pretty friendly and neutral, but they are more for admin and accounts type of work, so I don't really go to them for help if I need to.

Anyway, the point is, should I decline this internship or just 'tough it out' since experience is hard to come by and it could easily worth more than my own personal feelings of dissatisfaction? I would expect a lot of people to say to tough it out, but it is hard to enjoy working at a place you ultimately don't really like.

Cheers fellas! 

TL;DR: Unpaid internship (not in US). Might receive an offer to stay, but unsure in whether  choosing to stay or not. Not enjoying the work environment and team that much, which is the main reason. But if stacking up 'experience' is worth toughing it out, then so be it?

I'm starting to get worried now, because I'm spending much more time and effort applying than ever before, but am getting fewer interviews.

You may have noticed that I haven't mentioned Java yet. I accepted jobs that use different languages because they were offered to me and I wanted the experience. But ideally I would like to get a job as a Java developer. Unfortunately I don't have any professional experience with Java, other than a brief internship. Despite this, it's probably my strongest language. I've used it a lot in college, but I'm missing that crucial real-world experience.

Here's my question: What skills can I teach myself to supplement my Java knowledge? Most Java developer positions have requirements like REST, Spring, Hibernate, Jenkins, etc. There's a ton of these wacky-named technologies, but I have experience with almost none of them. There's not a specific company or position I'm aiming for right now, so I'd like to know which skills would be the most effective at making my resume more appealing.

I've also been looking into getting a Java certification to make up for my lack of experience. How valuable would that be in the eyes of prospective employers?

Thanks in advance for the help. I'll check out the resume threads as well and probably submit mine there for more advice."

7zh65w,2,2018-02-22,Career change from lawyer to CS advice,Xentavious_Magnar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7zh65w/career_change_from_lawyer_to_cs_advice/,"TL;DR:  Am lawyer.  Don't like.  Want CS career.  Learning on my own.  Intership/job questions at end.

I've been a practicing attorney for about 8 years and I just haven't been feeling it.  I'm good at what I do and I can pay the bills, but there is essentially zero career satisfaction.  I've been using edx to scratch the itch of learning new things pretty much since I discovered it and one day a little over a year ago I stumbled upon CS50x.  It looked fun, so I signed up and got started.

CS is everything I thought I would get as a lawyer, but seemingly without the bits that suck the life out of me.  Learning CS and doing coding problems on my own have become my new fun-time activities instead of video games and tv (for the most part; let's not get crazy).  I have now taken quite a few CS and math classes, mostly as recommended by [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science).  I have no illusions that I will end up with the same education as someone who received a formal CS degree, but I have definitely learned a lot and can see a dramatic improvement looking back at my earlier attempts to code.  I also already have a bachelor's and an advanced degree, so the lack of gen ed requirements is really irrelevant.

My current work schedule is about as flexible as I want it to be since I run my own solo-practice firm.  I would like to try getting a PT internship that I could work into that schedule while I build a CS resume before ultimately making the full transition.  I would also like to see what sort of requirements different internships have so I can pay attention to that when planning my future course of study.

With the background out of the way, my specific questions are:

(1)  Where are the best places one goes to look for CS internships?  Since I don't have a career services department to work with, I'm a little in the dark on what is/isn't a good starting point and I'm unsure how to evaluate the results of my google-fu.

(2)  Are PT internships even a thing?  I live near the DC metro area so there are loads of CS jobs.  From what I've seen in my searching so far, though, I'm seeing pretty much all FT.  Any suggestions here?

(3)  Do I even need to bother looking at internships, or is that not something mid-30's people do and I should just jump into applying for junior dev. positions at some point?  If I did that, are there any good resources I can be pointed to that discuss showing my knowledge despite my lack of professional CS experience or relevant credit-earning degree work?

(4)  Besides continuing my self-guided education, building up my git repository, and maybe applying for internships, is there anything else I should be doing to improve my career change prospects?

If you've read all the way to here: thanks!  Computer science is a passion that I discovered much later in life than I wish I had, but I'd rather find it now than never.  I daydream about never again having to prepare for trial or deal with chasing down an invoice from a deadbeat client.  A CS career won't be a non-stop parade of unicorns and rainbows, but at least I'll love what I'm doing.  Any help the community can offer will be greatly appreciated."
7zh8lz,63,2018-02-22,Sick and tired of garbage work/life balance and work culture in the SF Bay Area. What can I do about this?,1008_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7zh8lz/sick_and_tired_of_garbage_worklife_balance_and/,"I graduated from college in 2014 and I have been working in the SF Bay Area ever since. I went to a top 10 CS school in the east coast and am originally from the DFW area in TX. My had no internships in college but my work history since I graduated has been as follows:

* Jul 2014 - Mar 2015: Software Engineer at Big N in south bay
* Mar 2015 - Jul 2016: Software Engineer at large telecom company in south bay
* Sep 2016 - Present: Software Engineer at fairly well known ""unicorn"" company in SF

I've been working in the SF bay area for the last 4 years and I am honestly so incredibly burnt out and tired of companies not giving a shit about employee work/life balance. At the Big N I was at, we typically worked at least 10 hour days. Factoring in the commute time, going to the gym to stay healthy, and getting enough sleep, I literally had 0 hours of free time during the week. By the weekend I was so exhausted that I just rested most of the time. 

At the large telecom company I was at, there was such an insane amount of company politics and exploitation of team members that I was borderline about to become a whistleblower. We were expected to work on weekends more often than I would have liked (this shouldn't happen almost ever unless there is a serious emergency IMO) and employee morale was extremely low as people feared being fired for the smallest reasons.

At my current company, we have spaced out meetings so we basically need to work 12 hour days. At least we get free breakfast, lunch, and dinner. However, I seriously dislike that you need to essentially be a ""member"" of the company culture here, or else you will not fit in and it will not look very good. You are basically expected to interact with your coworkers outside of the office on weekends, otherwise there is a lot of hostility created in the office and I have seen it impact employee performance and ultimately lead to not-so-great things. But again, I don't want to work 12 hour days. I have things I want to do outside of the office.

Personally, I do not want to be in the office any more than 7-8 hours per day, but in my experience as well as the experience of several of my good friends in the SF Bay Area it seems that it is very difficult to find a job that values work/life balance. Across all 3 of my companies, work/life balance has been absolute trash. In fact, I am quitting my current job in a few weeks after I finish this project. I am going to take several months to travel and visit my family.

What can I do about this situation? Are there places in the US that value work/life balance that I could look into moving to? Or are young developers just exploited here in general? Should I perhaps look into moving to a country with better worker's rights? I'd love to hear some input.

I've applied to 50+ jobs, and with the single exception (only got as far as a second phone interview), I've gotten nothing but silence or automated rejection emails.

My GPA is a 3.01 - not stellar, but above the cut off for many companies. I have multiple years of internships and work experience, albeit with small (sub 15 employees) companies, not well known names. None of it seems to matter. I went to my schools career fair at the end of January and I thought I had some good conversations with employers who took my resume and seemed like they were going to call me (one even asking my availability that week), but no one followed up. The closest I have is a former internship from a few years back, who asked if I was interested in discussing possibilities there when I emailed asking to use him as a reference back in September. If worst comes to worst I'll follow up with that again, but the pay was low and I'm really looking to move out of the state I'm in, so I'm not particularly keen on it.

Coming into this year I thought for sure I'd have a job by the end of January, at worst. ""I have lots of experience and valuable skills, I'll be fine!"" Yeah, fucking right. It's almost March and I'm not even interviewing anywhere.

Am I fucked?

I repeated that year but during the second year I still wasn't recovered.

So  essentially I sat no exams in my first attempt of third year.

During my second attempt, I didn't sit the first semester.

During the second semester (2017), I had to take all the classes, 3 exams in April and 3 in August, as well as I took a research internship (high-end cutting-edge position) at a research firm for 3 months.

I essentially have a 2.8 GPA right now due to failing 1 exam and nearly failing another out of 6.

---

Due to failing 1 of the exams in August, I had to take this year out to resit it, I got a 4.0 in it but sadly they only use the first grade, so I am stuck with the average of 2.8 for the 3rd year.

---

Thankfully the 4th year is weighted 3 times as much, so I need to get an average of 76% to get a 4.0 or a 63% to get a 3.3 GPA.

If I work hard I should be able to get close to a 4.0, maybe a 3.8 or something of the sort.

---

My issue is that I've now been at uni from 2013 - 2019, how do I explain 6 years of university to employers? and how do I explain my grades going from a 2.8 to a 3.8 in 1 year? 

I can't even get internships right now due to my 2.8, so I will only have about 6 months of work experience, none of which is in a CS field.

I’m in my last semester of my undergrad in Bioinformatics and Computer Science, and I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for about 7 years now. I know that this is a common thing in the sciences, so it’s safe to assume that someone out there in my field has been in the same boat. 

I’m finding it so hard to keep going. I had a plan when I first got accepted into my programs, I was going to get published by 20 and get accepted into a master’s program and T.A. to cover my tuition. But an inability to hold down 2 part time jobs and research while remaining a full time student pursuing 2 degrees, along with supporting my family and the occurrence of a personal trauma led to everything toppling down this time last year. My GPA plummeted, I couldn’t complete my research project, and I lost my jobs. Now I just want to graduate and end strong and obtain a job in industry. I keep trying to recover, I had an internship over the summer that went really well, and that was great, but the fall semester did not go the way I needed it to, and I’m recognizing the same patterns for this semester. I’ve so many late assignments, and I feel anxiety over the assignments that I haven’t finished every time I start on a different one, and I don’t know how to be productive anymore. I had started taking medication for anxiety last September, but it severely limits my ability to read, which sounds weird but I’ve found it can take about 3 times as it normally would to process the information, which obviously hinders my ability to do the work that necessitates the medication.

I guess I’m just looking for someone to say that they went through something similar, maybe supply an uplifting story and some strategies to get on track.

7zil16,1,2018-02-22,Should I drop out of PhD to pursue concept-art?,TheFifthHuman,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/7zil16/should_i_drop_out_of_phd_to_pursue_conceptart/,"I am a 3rd-year PhD student in Computational Neuroscience. Making art—digital art in particular—is my favorite pastime. Of late, I’ve been thinking of dropping out of PhD and pursuing a career in concept-art: is this a reasonable thing to do, or is it too much of a gamble?

Rather than going on a long ramble about things, I’ll try and list all the conflicting factors at play.

I. RESEARCH
- I’m in my late 20’s, and am 2.5 years into my PhD program. Previously I did a Masters in computer science.
- Largely speaking, I used to like the kind of work that I was doing (which has to deal with developing mathematical models to analyze brain signals). 
- Of late, I think I’m losing interest: I have trouble focusing on one problem for more than a week; and even when I am working, I feel the urge to take (longish) breaks every hour or so.
- I have a tendency to get stressed under pressure (e.g. when I’m nearing a deadline). Lately, the stress-levels have increased to the levels that sometimes I cope by completely avoiding the situation (and missing deadlines, losing grades etc.)
- The general decline of interest has affected my productivity levels: naturally, this has started to affect my relationship with my advisor.

II. MENTAL HEALTH
- For the past year and a half, I’m under treatment for mild, recurring depression and anxiety-avoidant personality traits. This might be contributing to the troubles mentioned above.
- I am a little concerned that trying to hang on to the PhD program might further deteriorate my mental health.

III. ART
- I am fairly good at art but not formally trained in art. Lately, I’ve been trying to self-learn the fundamentals with the help of online-videos and some art textbooks.
- My interest in art and design dates back to early childhood. In fact, after Bachelors, I seriously considered joining a design-school for Masters: eventually I ended up taking the research/academia route.
- Sometimes I sketch for hours without a break, which stands in sharp contrast to my terribly short attention span when I’m at work.
- I’m confident that I can train myself to competent levels in making concept-art and illustrations. However, I have very limited knowledge about the industry at large.
- For the short-term, I think I’ll be able to find trainee positions, internships and contract work in art and design: however, I don’t know how things will hold up in the longer term.

I’m going to ask my therapist for her suggestion, but I would love to get a general, big-picture perspective as well: which is why the purpose of this post. All things considered, what do you think would be the best course of action?"
7zinle,117,2018-02-22,The biggest factor of your success in CS and Software Engineering? Mindset.,PersistencyIsKey,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7zinle/the_biggest_factor_of_your_success_in_cs_and/,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I've been subscribed to /r/cscareerquestions for a few years now.  It's helped me greatly through the entirety of my undergrad at a mid ranked public university in the northeast US, and I'm hoping I can contribute to the community by sharing my experiences. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When I started my undergrad, I was fairly interested in CS - I dabbled in building sites as a kid, and some light scripting. But truth be told, I was way more interested in partying rather than learning djikstra's. In spite of slacking off, I managed to land an internship that freshman year working for a multinational telecomm company in Beirut. I got it entirely from networking; I joined the innovation society at my school, and made my interests in CS known to a peer. His dad ended up being the hiring manager at the company, and that summer turned out be an incredible exposure to professional software engineering as well as the beautiful country of Lebanon.

  
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The next summer, I ended up working for a tiny marketing company as a network admin. I spent my ""internship"" working for free, wiring network cabling through asbestos ceiling tiles, helping coworkers operate their e-mail, and other menial tasks. The experience was very humbling, and this is the first instance in my CS career where I had to use my secret weapon: **mindset**. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Despite the relative success of my first year, I was completely unsuccessful in getting even past a phone screen with over 100 applications, and so I took the job I could because I knew that I needed to make the most of the circumstances I was in. I asked my manager for permission to create a web-based internal ticketing system for the employees to use, and he approved. I came away from that summer with an additional few months of software engineering experience solely because of my constant effort to keep a **positive mindset**. I can't stress enough to you how easy it would've been to become frustrated with that situation, but ultimately I managed to salvage it by reframing what I wanted to get out of the experience: a bitter summer of regret or furthering my career.  

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Summer of junior year was even worse: I had spent the year studying abroad, and it really hindered my job search. I worked for a fledgling startup, bootstrapped by one of the founders' day job. I was paid terribly, didn't have any engineers to learn from or work with, and I felt really unsure about my prospects for after graduation (especially because I kept reading this subreddit!). 

&amp;nbsp;

I spent that year grinding leetcode obsessively, studying system design, networking, applying constantly, practicing interviews. After 8 months of job searching, 4 final round failures, hundreds of applications, I was graduating without a job. I felt depleted, especially considering my classmates were heading to Youtube, TripAdvisor, etc. On the day of graduation, I got my first job offer. It was in NYC for 65k as a Software Engineer for a web dev consulting company (with a stipulation that I'd get a 5k raise after 6 months). It's not the job I wanted, but I could foresee a future where I would make the most of this, just like my prior internship experiences. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I was put on a project I didn't enjoy at all, working with healthcare tech and doing a bunch of data related engineering. It wasn't what I had envisioned for my time as an Engineer - I thought I'd have cool perks, work in a modern framework, and get paid handsomely. I forced myself to consider the ultimatum: a bitter tenure of regret or furthering my career. I chose the latter, and took my job seriously despite not enjoying the work at first. With my mentality allowing me to persevere, I found a deeper appreciation for working with big data, creating analytics, and being a domain knowledge expert. My 6 months flew by, and it was time to get the raise that was promised to me when I first signed on - except my CTO pulls me aside and says it isn't the best time, the company needs to land new projects and I should wait until annual review time in a few months. This left me feeling extremely bitter, that my company couldn't even spare 5k that they had already contractually agreed to, especially considering a wage of 65k in NYC as a Software Engineer. I ended the year feeling depleted yet again, unsure of whether the mindset was going to save me this time.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I gave it a shot and started sprucing up my resume, reaching out to recruiters, and studying the job market in my area. My annual review comes and goes, the raise is never even mentioned. It didn't bother me, because I had just received an offer to be a Data Engineer at a fintech startup making twice what I was at my current job. The work that I'll be doing is practically the same that I was doing at my first job for 65k. My mentality during my tenure allowed me to engross myself in the work, and make the most of it. And that mentality has now gotten me close to everything I wanted from my CS career. I get to work on a product I'm really interested in, with a bunch of perks, and a great check. 

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:**&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I've had a lot of failures, roadblocks, and bad decisions throughout my undergrad and CS career. None of that mattered in the long run, and the only way I was able to stick it out for that long was because I forced myself to consider the **positive outlook** on any situation. If there's anything to take away from my experience, it's to make the most of your circumstances. Don't take any opportunity you get for granted, and keep persevering to get what you deserve. "

Am I being to aggressive?",Muhammed4060,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7zixdc/negotiating_a_salary_using_a_previous_offer/,"TL DR: software engineer in the DC area. Is a 70k offer from 2 years ago + 18 months work experience + a TS clearance allow me to reasonably ask for a 83k salary without coming off as too greedy/aggressive.

There is a small company that I did an internship for in college. They made me an offer straight out of college, but i turned them down for geographic reasons. I am planning to move to the DC area and have been interviewing a number of companies. The small company interviewed me and is now ready to make me an offer. They have asked for my salary expectations and am a little unsure of how to approach it. I think its important that fight for a higher salary, but don't want to seem unreasonable.

Looking at glass door, it says the mean salary in the area for software enigineers is ~96k, and the mean for software engineers is in the upper 80s. This is a smaller company with incredible benefits and an amazing work atmosphere, so im not sure i could reasonably expect the average. 

I plan stating that 83k would be a fair compensation for my skills(I ultimately want 81k), and work experience. Given their previous unnegotiated offer of 70k 2 years ago, it would be around 73k today accounting for inflation. I will have had 18+ months work experience and a security clearance. I would consider that to make me worth around 10k more. Is that a reasonable line of thought.

Should I frame this a certain way. My gf agreed me, but my father thought I was being too aggressive and should mention the cost of living in the area. Any opinions you guys could offer would be great.

7zj0kw,5,2018-02-22,Which internship should I accept? PM vs Backend,throwawawawawaway17,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7zj0kw/which_internship_should_i_accept_pm_vs_backend/,"I already have internship plans for this summer, but I just got another great offer that I really wasn't expecting and now I'm having trouble on deciding what is best for my career, since I can see myself really enjoying both jobs. I've never really posted in this subreddit before, so I apologize if I'm breaking any rules or posting too much info!



Background about me:

* I'm a senior undergraduate student at a top CS program in the US. I've previously interned as a backend software engineer at one of the big four, and I plan to return there as a full-time software dev in the fall (I enjoyed my team, which I will most likely be returning to, and I think the name recognition will be super helpful for my future).

* I originally pursued an internship at Company A because I've always wanted to try TPM-ing or project (not product) management at a tech company, and long-term, it's a role I would prefer over software development. I also chose it because I've never worked at a small company before and thought it would be a good experience.



Company A (already accepted two months ago):

* **program** management intern for 14 weeks

* small company (~500 employees) in a smaller city in the Midwest

* 4.6 rating on Glassdoor

* would be the company's first and only PM intern -- I'm not sure what they have in mind for me because they probably don't really know yet either, but the job description involved (1) working with an engineering team and one product manager to help them work efficiently on their projects and (2) working with non-engineering teams to work on things like timelines and general workload.

* there would be around 7 undergraduate software interns at that location



Company B:

* backend software engineering intern for 10 weeks

* mid-sized company (~1000 to 5000 employees) in a large city in New England

* 4.2 rating on Glassdoor

* would most likely be working on teams related to personalization (involving some data manipulation with hopefully machine learning or the infrastructure around those programs)

* deadline to accept: one week (yikes!!)

* there would be around 4 other undergraduate software interns at that location



My current thoughts:

* I'm pretty neutral when it comes to salary and compensation, and I am confident that I'd fit in with both companies, as I like both companies' cultures. (If you're interested in the names of the companies, PM me.)

* As for the companies themselves, I use both of their products daily and would enjoy working on both of them. However, I'm way more passionate about Company B's product than Company A as it pertains to my interests more. So basically I'm really passionate and excited about PMing at Company A but I'm also really passionate and excited about Company B's product.

* I know it's not really a great thing to back out of an offer once you've accepted it (especially since I'd be the first employee of my kind at Company A), but Company B really appeals to me. It seems really hard to get jobs from them, internship-wise and full-time-wise -- the whole recruitment process for Job B took five months, and I think I just got lucky. This could just be impostor syndrome speaking, but a lot of my arguably-more qualified friends didn't even hear back, and even on this subreddit, it seems like a lot of people haven't heard anything. Additionally, due to the location of Company A, I don't really see myself working there in my future, so I'm not really concerned about losing future job prospects if I do go back on my acceptance (unless I REALLY like PM-ing there, which could honestly happen because Glassdoor and other articles indicate the Company A is an amazing company to be a PM at).

Unfortunately, this division rarely hires interns and more importantly their recruiting goes through the parent company's recruiting process, which at this point has ended.

7zjhs8,0,2018-02-22,How can I set myself up during college to give myself the highest possible chance of success in this field?,dreymatic,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/7zjhs8/how_can_i_set_myself_up_during_college_to_give/,"Hi, I'm a Junior so maybe this is still a bit farsighted. However, knowing the only reason I may not attend my dream school is due to lack of preparedness and knowing just how important those two years were (9th and 10th) I have been very curious and interested in making sure as I go to college I will know what I need to do and be able to prepare to make college as great as an experience for me as possible and be able to set myself up with a decent, well-paying job when I get out.

(Disclaimer: I love computer science and programming I'm not just going in for the money, but I do respect the amount people in this field can make)

So let's get the obvious typical statement out of the way: I want to work at a big-time company within 5-10 years of graduating from college, I'm pretty sure like everyone does lol. Intel, NVIDIA, Google, NASA, Boeing; you get the gist!(No social media, this may be an unpopular opinion but I don't see how investing your career into something like social media is a very smart idea doesn't seem like that'd be a great place for job security) In college what are the best practices and habits I can make to get into industry out of college and into this big business as quickly as I can?

Now I know a few already and they're already being thought about, but if you'd like to add more information about these particular subjects I'd love that just as much as any new tips. Here's what I know so far:

- Network Network Network, get to know people attend tech conferences and presentation

- Somewhat the same but; Get internships in relevant work experience, thankfully one of my top 3 school preferences is within 15 miles of Y12 in Oak Ridge Tennessee and they frequently pick up interns from the school out of major like computer science. So maybe I can get one of those pretty easily!

- Get good grades but don't make it such a burden that you don't get to do anything else to prepare yourself for a career

- Create things!

Here's my plan (you'll all probably laugh at how optimistic this is):
I know for sure I'm either doing Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or Computer Science. But even if I do electrical I'll pick up a CS minor so no matter what I'm for sure gonna get some sort of CS education because I just love this field and want to expand my knowledge. There's a bunch of places I'd be interested in internships at that I'm going to try and prepare myself to possibly get an internship at. The obvious: Google, NASA, SpaceX etc that almost everyone probably applies to and the not so obvious like Y12 that I spoke about before. I'm sure I'll learn a lot more about internships as I get closer to college and actually in college. I know I want to try something, take some sort of risk with a business; sure this sounds stupid but I love trying things if an idea comes to me or my friends at the right time in college and we have the resources available to try to start something new I'm going to do it. I want to attend hackathons starting this summer, obviously not so many that it'll take away from my schooling but enough to get out there and know people and maybe create a thing or two. 

Overall I want to work closer to the hardware. I'm not really a front end kind of guy design isn't as interesting to me as the theory and logic behind everything. I'm a huge computer guy that's why tech companies like Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, etc appeals to me. I know the reality is probably more than 70-90% of the people who get a computer science degree won't get to go into a company like this but I still want to do everything I can to try. I'm coming to the end of high school and the only thing I regret thus far in life is not trying hard enough at the things I love.

Edit: I've already (somewhat) started building a little portfolio. I'm currently working on website development for a local and small nonprofit. It's not entirely programming related but I hope to eventually over this summer once I get a break overhaul the website with my own custom CSS and javascript instead of  running off WordPress and a little CSS customization. I'm also in contact with a local politician who is interested in me helping out with the social media/website of his campaign.

Thanks for any help!

7zlpxx,3,2018-02-23,Should I drop out of PhD to pursue a career in concept-art?,TheFifthHuman,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/7zlpxx/should_i_drop_out_of_phd_to_pursue_a_career_in/,"I am a 3rd-year PhD student in Computational Neuroscience. Making art—digital art in particular—is my favorite pastime. Of late, I’ve been thinking of dropping out of PhD and pursuing a career in concept-art: is this a reasonable thing to do, or is it too much of a gamble?

Rather than going on a long ramble about things, I’ll try and list all the conflicting factors at play.

I. RESEARCH 

	⁃ I’m in my late 20’s, and am 2.5 years into my PhD program. Previously I did a Masters in computer science.
	⁃ Largely speaking, I used to like the kind of work that I was doing (which has to deal with developing mathematical models to analyze brain signals). 
	⁃ Of late, I think I’m losing interest: I have trouble focusing on one problem for more than a week; and even when I am working, I feel the urge to take (longish) breaks every hour or so.
	⁃ I have a tendency to get stressed under pressure (e.g. when I’m nearing a deadline). Lately, the stress-levels have increased to the levels that sometimes I cope by completely avoiding the situation (and missing deadlines, losing grades etc.)
	⁃ The general decline of interest has affected my productivity levels: naturally, this has started to affect my relationship with my advisor.

II. MENTAL HEALTH

	⁃ For the past year and a half, I’m under treatment for mild, recurring depression and anxiety-avoidant personality traits. This might be contributing to the troubles mentioned above.
	⁃ I am a little concerned that trying to hang on to the PhD program might further deteriorate my mental health.

III. ART

	⁃ I am fairly good at art but not formally trained in art. Lately, I’ve been trying to self-learn the fundamentals with the help of online-videos and some art textbooks.
	⁃ My interest in art and design dates back to early childhood. In fact, after Bachelors, I seriously considered joining a design-school for Masters: eventually I ended up taking the research/academia route.
	⁃ Sometimes I sketch for hours without a break, which stands in sharp contrast to my terribly short attention span when I’m at work.
	⁃ I’m confident that I can train myself to competent levels in making concept-art and illustrations. However, I have very limited knowledge about the industry at large.
	⁃ For the short-term, I think I’ll be able to find trainee positions, internships and contract work in art and design: however, I don’t know how things will hold up in the longer term.

I’m going to ask my therapist for her suggestion, but I would love to get a general, big-picture perspective as well: which is why this post. All things considered, what do you think would be the best course of action?

I have a question and any honest answers/stories that can comfort me would be greatly appreciated.

My question is: Do any of you ever feel stupid at work? Do you feel inferior to your peers or feel like they think you're an idiot? Have you ever felt like that in your career?

I am asking because I am currently in my 3rd year of a BSME degree and I'm doing decently with a 3.4 cumulative gpa and a 3.64 major GPA but I honestly feel like sometimes the knowledge that I have does not reflect that GPA. I have no doubt worked my butt off to do well in school, but I often feel like I don't know a lot of things that I probably should know.

Anyway, I also notice that many of my peers have a decent understanding of many concepts i have forgotten. I sometimes wonder if my success is a product of working countless problems until my fingers bleed or whether it is a result of my intellectual ability.

I am currently working an internship and I often feel like the engineers think I am a moron at times for not knowing things that they think that I should know. I also interviewed for a big aerospace company for an internship position that I really want but the position would require putting a lot of theoretical knowledge into practice and I am not sure I feel qualified for it.

Is this a confidence issue? Am I not retaining things that I should be retaining? Am i not getting the education I should be getting?

Any kind words of advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your time.

A little background first, a couple of years ago I left college after my sophomore year because I had still not decided on a major and up until that point I was only taking gen eds to fill my schedule. I returned last spring after a 3 year hiatus and will graduate next year with a CS degree.

Given the fact that I only have 1 year of CS related coursework and the only project listed on my resume is from a hackathon I did last month, I was surprised when my first application response was from a highly competitive tech company, which I managed to make it to the final round but did not end up getting an offer. That was my first and only tech interview, up until a phone interview I had today. During this phone interview the recruiter only asked one question and then stopped the interview after my response to ask ""Is this your first phone interview?"" The recruiter went on to say that my response was great but that I sounded nervous or unsure of myself when answering because I kept saying ""um"" while speaking and it was becoming distracting, but then said ""how about you visit your career services department at school to practice for this interview and we will schedule a new phone interview for next week to start with a clean slate.""

I was totally surprised that the recruiter would actually care to call me out and give constructive feedback, but was taken to a whole different level of confusion when offered to start anew on another day. Is this a fluke? I would assume that if I bombed a phone screen that would be the end of it, but the recruiter wanted to give me another chance. What was even stranger to me was that they also mentioned the fact that my resume shows I hardly have any project experience which already sets me back behind other applicants. 

On the one hand, I am incredibly thankful for being given the option of starting over, but I also just don't know where to take it from here. If anything this makes me more nervous now! Clearly I will work on being more articulate but I can't help but feeling like it'll all be in vain since they mentioned my resume isn't as strong as their other applicants.

So here is an overview of my current situation:

* 29 years old
* Stable, secure, above average salary, comfortable job (5 years experience) 
* European
* Master degree in Finance (but few experience)
* Speak 4 languages + 2 years of studying Chinese
* Very studious

So my current job is a generalist management function with little intellectual challenge or possibilities to learn/apply specific knowledge. 
Now I have always been interested in computers and can code a little, but since my mother always pressured me not to do anything with computers (that’s another long story), I ended up with a degree in finance. To be clear, I always enjoyed studying finance. 

Since I’m hitting 30 it’s time to take a more specific course in my career, but I’m scared to do so. I’m feeling that once I would choose a path I will regret not doing something else later. I’m interested in tons of things; finance, programming, data science, electronics, mechanics, woodworking,...

Currently, I’m leaning to an IT-career, but I don’t want to become a code-monkey either since I lack the experience and don’t feel like I’m born to do so. I have some strong communication, analyzing and drafting skills. I think (but then I again what do I know) that for example IT-audit might appeal to me.

In a couple of months I’m going to China for 6 months to improve my Mandarin while doing an internship, but I have yet to choose a sector/company.
Furthermore, one of my hobbies is investing in the stock market. So although salary is definitely not a main driver, it is a factor to consider.

Lastly, I think my dream would be to become a pro at something and build up my own company.

Anyone who is (or has been) in similar situation that can give me some advice?

It would be immensely appreciated.


**TLDR: Think it’s time to choose more specific career path, but afraid I might regret it afterwards.**

7zo6js,8,2018-02-23,just unexpectedly broke down yesterday from what I'm realizing now is an overwhelming amount of stress,Spacetron9000,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7zo6js/just_unexpectedly_broke_down_yesterday_from_what/,"I guess a little bit about myself would be helpful. Sorry in advance for the wall of text. 

I'm a senior Computer Engineering student who is a little over two months from graduating in May. I work for the school as a TA, but I rarely get over 2 hours/week because the guy in charge of the TAs hired a bunch of them and now apparently can't afford to give them all a decent number of hours. Other than that, I have no steady income. My school schedule makes it such that it would be really difficult to find an internship relevant to my field, since I essentially spend all day at school every day. I'm very doubtful I could find something relevant for after hours, nor am I sure that I could even work a night job without impacting my education. 

Yesterday I woke up and I felt just fine. I did my morning elliptical as I usually do (I'm currently trying to lose a significant amount of weight) and went to class, and one moment I'm working on a lab and enjoying what I'm doing, and the next moment I feel nothing. The rest of the day just kinda goes on for a while in a bit of a blur, until I get home and feel unusually heavier getting up the stairs. I just kinda lay in my bed for about 30 minutes staring at the empty space in the closet. After that, I ended up walking into my roommate's room and just kinda broke down crying. 

I still feel pretty awful this morning, but now I think it's because I know why. Before I broke down, I don't think I realized just how much pent up frustration I had at my financial situation. I'm frustrated about a lot of things, really. It's an even longer story, but I at one point six months ago had a serious windfall and I ended up spending almost all of it after I had to replace my car and got scammed into buying a fraudulent used car that wasn't at all what it seemed and I couldn't possibly get anywhere near the amount I spent on it back, and then bought another, actually working, used car. I planned to use that windfall to carry me through my last year at engineering school, but it completely fell apart and I guess I'm both frustrated at how I managed to fuck it up, and concerned that my current school schedule is preventing me from working even a temp job for the few months I have until graduation. 

I think the worst part is that I feel like yesterday was a huge step backwards for me. As last year went on, towards the end of it I started feeling more and more upset, especially after the car scam thing happened. When 2018 began, I told myself I was going to leave those thoughts behind and work on improving myself both physically and mentally, and started losing weight. I don't want to stop losing weight, obviously. I started last semester and then stopped when the car scam thing happened because I just felt so overwhelmed, I fell off the wagon. I don't want what happened yesterday to stop me again. 

I know that's a lot to go through, and I always feel weird about venting or complaining about my problems, but I'm starting to wonder if maybe I might be clinically depressed or suffer from anxiety. I say this because I also suffered from serious anxiety/depressive episodes/thoughts of suicide in middle school. I no longer have suicidal thoughts, but I'm just scared for the next time I'm going to break down out of nowhere when I think everything's okay. 

What do I do?

Now I am breaking all sorts of contract laws by posting this on dark web, but after seeing what happened to Kayla and Kyle I can't stay on the sidelines any more. 

You see, the goal of the phobius institute is to see how far the company can push the boundaries of a persons fear. The original experiment was to see if the serum we were using could alter a humans psychology. It was used on people who already had a sever phobia of something. After the patient was given the serum, they went into a coma only minutes afterward. 

It took the company many years to figure out what the problem was. They finally realised that the subject had been subjected to so much fear, that they brain shut down as a safety mechanism. 

So last year, Phobius decided to tweak the serum and started to look for subjects who had no fear. They figured that if a subject had no fear, there would be less of a chance of the subject going into a coma. 

That was when Kayla came into the picture. She seemed like the perfect subject for the program. Everything seemed to be going well. The company purposefully made the elevator as old a rickety as possible to make the subjects be more on end.

We weren't exactly sure what would happen once the subject drank the serum. We were a little concerned when Kayla fell asleep. We all thought that she would go into a coma, just like all the previous subjects. 

Instead, as everyone watched the monitor. We watched as Kayla shot up in her chair. All of us in the observation room, jumped up ourselves. What was once a calm and collected female, was now a nervous wreck. She asked what year it was, which all puzzled us except for Mike. Who talked to her for a bit before he unlocked the door. 

Once she left the building we all thought that, that would be the last we had heard of her. Then we heard the crash. 

There is something that all of you need to know. Phobius has there own mental hospital. Every patient that the institute has ever had,has ended up in the mercy institute for one reason or other. Now there are two more patients in the hospital. It seems like there will be even more patients heading there soon.

Oh... I am being called into the observation room. I will update you more once I get back from subject 3C going through the experiment. Speaking of which, this water tastes very funny.

1 month later

Ugh, I curse Phobius for ruining my life. When I had last talked to you, they had drugged me with the serum. They had found out that I was about to blow the whistle on their whole operation. Now I am getting help from a friend of mine. 

I realized that once you fall asleep,you experience your worst fears. I found out that mine was the fear of being ugly. Now I had always been very self conscious about my looks. Up until that point however, I didn't realize how much I cared about how much I cared about my looks. 

Now everytime I look into a mirror, I only see a hideous version of my formal self. No matter how much makeup I put on, it does nothing to change how I perceive myself. It has gotten to the point now where I can't even look at myself in a mirror anymore. I had smashed all the windows in my room and don't bother to put makeup on anymore. 

Well the looney bin people are coming to take me away to the hospital. I won't give them the satisfaction of taking me to that crazy place though. I am going to end my life the way I want to. My friend managed to smuggle a small pistol into my room. You won't have to worry about me using it on anyone other than me. 

Just like Kayla and Kyle, I will warn you to stay away from Phobius. They are a dangerous company. Now if you excuse me, i'm off to the washroom.

Failing tests.,anevar,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/7zp20y/struggling_under_class_load_failing_tests/,"Hey guys/gals. I know we see a lot of these posts out here about people failing tests and classes and struggling, and unfortunately this is going to be one of them.

So this semester I'm under an 18 credit load, dealing with an internship hunt (mandatory by my school), and trying to keep up my credit in an honor society.

And at this point, I've just cracked. I've been having tests in every class staggered out over a couple weeks, and I've either failed or just barely passed all of them. My circuits test this morning I got maybe a 40 on? My boundary value problems test on Monday I got a 53 on, and all of my other tests are just barely making a C.

All of my performances are suffering like this and I just don't know what to do. I've already conceded dropping BVP because I probably can't pass it but I can't just keep dropping my failing classes or I'll get my financial aid cut.

But at the given point I literally can't do any more for my classes. I'm doing work or studying almost around the clock, I'm barely sleeping from stress, and I'm just stretched so thin I don't know what to do.

Alright /rant. I needed to vent about all of this

7zpmp6,1,2018-02-23,Picking a new IT title,Vanguard470,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/7zpmp6/picking_a_new_it_title/,"The company I work for is rebranding as part of a change in our affiliation network. In the process of doing so, most of the employees are getting title changes to align more closely with what they do and their respective counterparts to the corporate titles. I'm looking for a bit of advice on picking a title that accurately reflects what I do and my experience level. As well as one that looks good to the outside world if I look for other opportunities.


My background: I'm 26 and have worked for this company for 5 years with little previous experience. My current title is IT Advisor. I do everything from high level meetings with the CEO about the direction of the company and how IT can align its scope and strategy with the company's goals. I then also put together project proposals and seek out vendors if needed and design projects to push our technological standing forward. If I get approved, I then implement the project and if it's not a third party/managed solution, then I maintain the system put in place. I also maintain the servers, emails, network, phones, and desktops for 1 main company and 2 child companies. I am the sole person in the company doing IT related work. The main company has about 40 users mixed with employees and regular onsite agents/contractors. The agents are BYOD so I have to interface their devices with our systems which gives me a variety of types of devices to maintain (Microsoft and Apple, phones, tablets, etc). The 2 child companies are remote and have about 20 employees between the two. Each company has it's own infrastructure and some shared server resources, printers, phones, network gear, etc. I also do third party consulting for companies we work directly or indirectly with that need help with technology but don't have enough work to justify hiring someone full time. I do this for a variety of sizes of companies, mostly on a contract or hourly basis. 


My experience is 5 years here and a summer as an intern doing similar work for a college in my area with some branching into fiber termination and basic data entry. I have a bachelors degree for MIS Business Analyst and 2 minors and a certificate not related to the technology field. I have a certificate in ITIL Foundation and am looking to get certified in Microsoft and VmWare technologies but haven't gotten there yet. 


I'm leaning toward a Systems Admin and IT Consultant or Systems Analyst and IT Consultant. I have a lot of say on what it ends up being but want to make sure I'm setting myself up for success in my career. I also want to make sure that my title reflects my position as well as my experience. I feel that the Systems Admin covers what I do internally from an upkeep and maintenance portion of my job and IT Consultant reflects my availability for external work. However, the Analyst reflects my interaction with officials in the company and my overall say on direction for IT. My office manager wants whatever my title ends up being to reflect both sides of internal and external and is okay with me having two titles to achieve that. 


I know it probably doesn't matter that much but I wanted some feedback on what I do vs what my title is. Let me know what you think. Thanks in advance!"
7zpn5k,1,2018-02-23,I feel extremely lucky to enjoy programming,salary_share,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7zpn5k/i_feel_extremely_lucky_to_enjoy_programming/,"I have read a lot of stories on here about how difficult it is to get an internship or entry level job, and I wanted to share my story as someone who has maybe a little different experience than a lot of the people on this sub. Warning: anecdote incoming.

I am currently in my second semester of a Master's in Computer Science at a fairly prestigious engineering school, say second tier below MIT, CMU, CalTech, etc. To be honest, I have no idea if we are well known for computer science or not, since computer science and programming is only something I've been interested in for the past two years, and I came to this school to be an engineer. I spent my undergrad at this same school, completing degrees in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, and I even completed about half of a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering. Let me tell you about my experience trying to get a job in the Aerospace Industry. I have always kept meticulous notes about my job searches, so I am reading this directly off my spreadsheet:

Freshman Year: 84 applications, 1 interview, 1 offer.
I only got an interview and offer because of a family friend who worked in quality control on construction sites. During the interview he didn't ask me any questions about myself, he spent the entire time asking if I was sure that I wanted the job because it wasn't a fun job. (He was right).

Sophomore Year: 217 applications, 3 interviews, 0 offers. 
Luckily, my boss asked if I wanted to go back to quality control because he couldn't find anyone else to do it. And so I did.

Junior Year: 47 applications, 3 interviews, one offer.
Didn't apply to many this year since I got the offer early in the year and accepted and stopped applying immediately. This time the job is actually related to my field of study and somewhat enjoyable.

Senior Year (Last Summer): 102 applications, 2 interviews, 1 offer. Maybe surprisingly, this internship was in a fairly respectable role, think Big N of the Aerospace Industry. It was actually this job that solidified that I would rather be a software engineer than any other type of engineering.


I am a top student. I have always had grades in the top 15% of my school, I'm in all the honor societies, I participate in design teams at school. This is the reality of the Aerospace Industry. It is incredibly competitive and cutthroat.

A little over a year ago, with essentially no programming experience whatsoever, I decided I would much rather program for my career. And so, Last fall, I started a Master's degree in computer science. Before I started, I was almost entirely self-taught (besides a little MatLab knowledge needed for engineering) I spent every day after my internship teaching myself how to program, and even spent any down time at work practicing as well. So last fall, I started searching for software engineering internships for the first time. Let's compare my experience:

This year: 34 applications, 7 interviews, 5 offers.
I stopped applying pretty early for obvious reasons. One of the interviews/offers, I didn't even apply for, they contacted me on LinkedIn. To me, my resume looks like I barely know how to program. I thought I was going to have a very difficult time finding a job. The different experiences I have had in recruiting in different industries absolutely blows my mind. Across four years, I have tried to negotiate intern salary, completely unsuccessfully. This year, 4 out of 5 of my offers were raised by more than 15% simply because I said I had a better offer. And these offers were already (before negotiation) about 30% higher than my highest paid engineering internship.

It is for this reason that I feel extremely lucky to enjoy programming. I enjoy it far more, I have an easier time getting a job, and I can get paid significantly more. I am still in awe every day since I signed my offer about my different experiences, and every day I am so happy that I discovered the joy of programming. Thanks for reading."

I'm a 46 year old recent graduate who is *desperately* trying to get a grown-up job for the first time in my life after having worked in retail for far too long.

I've gone through the resume critiques here ([my resume](https://i.imgur.com/QYJSBvi.jpg)) without getting much feedback on it.  My LinkedIn account isn't getting any views, my applications don't seem to even be getting looked at...

I look at job postings and see things that I have no clue about, like frameworks, front-end, back-end, stacks, etc.  I know that I *can* learn about them, but they weren't a part of any of my course work.

Additionally, I'm not sure if I'm giving my GPA properly.  My full GPA from start to finish is 3.53, but that includes the 4.0 I had in getting my Associates Degree.  My core courses only have a 3.075, but if I include my CS electives, it goes up to a 3.22.  My transcript doesn't split things up like this though, so I have no idea how I should be presenting it on my resume.

The reason for the lowered GPA is the fact that I had to take important data structures and algorithms classes online.  I *sucked* at online classes, so it seems like two of the most important classes in my curriculum ended up half-assed.  Big-Oh notation scares the hell out of me...

I rushed through college, my goal being to graduate ASAP to get into the workplace as quickly as possible.  I think I made a mistake, because the class overload meant that I didn't do any internships.  That, plus the fact that I'm not putting any of my previous retail work on my resume (it would hurt me more than help... Trust me when I say, I *sucked* at it), seems to be making me unhirable.

One thing that I have going for me is that I can go *anywhere*.  I have nothing tying me down (the benefits of having no life...).  Unfortunately, that's made my job search incredibly scattershot.  There's no focus to it... I have my search set to five locations right now and worry that expanding it further will just turn my search into a chaotic mess.

I've seen posts on here give averages of about 1:10 interview to application ratios.  I've sent out easily 100 resumes and the only callback that I got was from a local staffing agency.  I stay in regular contact with them, and the only thing they say anymore is ""we don't have any positions right now... Try again next week"".

This isn't even saying that I'll even be passable when I interview.  I just purchased Cracking the Code Interview to help out but I don't know if my weakness in data structures and algorithms will make it a pointless endeavor.

I'm scared as hell right now.  I feel like I'm doing everything *wrong* and need to readjust before I end up back in retail (a job whose stress level *literally* (as in early-life heart attack) almost killed me...), having wasted the past 3 years.  I don't mention the age and health issues anywhere in my job search (I'm not that dumb), but they're contributing to my increasing depression right now."

Last fall, I started taking night classes at UM Dearborn as part of an eventual career switch into software development.  I've worked for 7 or 8 years in a niche public sector field, and the requirement to constantly move to progress in my career (low density in any given area) is just too burdensome on my wife and I to continue.  I got more and more interested in Computer Science through some limited programming in my current role, and after discussing it with some programmer friends, decided to start taking prerequisite classes.

I asked a professor for some advice regarding how I might proceed, and his answer was suprising.  He suggested I just take the classes I need to develop a base skill set, and not worry about actually finishing the masters. From his perspective (he's a lecturer, not faculty, he has a programming job elsewhere), he said he looks for 1) Any degree, 2) a good enough level of programming knowledge, 3) problem solving skills, and 4) likability.  

Complicating matters is that I need to find a position that can come close enough to match my current salary (mid 50's) when I make the switch, since we have a house and my wife is pregnant with our first child.  So it'd be tough for me take a low paying internship.

At what point should I start feeling confident enough in my skillset that I can try to get a job?  Are there any benchmarks that you would suggest I cross?  I think I'm a pretty good student, and believe I could make a good programmer, but its just hard to feel confident in when I cross the threshold to being good enough to put myself out there.  I know my natural inclination is to believe I need a degree to demonstrate my qualifications, but I don't hold that standard over people when hiring at my current job.  

Any thoughts are appreciated!"

**How much programming would be involved in such a project?**
I was told that I will be using Java, and use a platform to for integration (Denodo,TIBCO) it seems like there is a lot of systems integration involved data virtualization. Is the java used to connect to data sources? How is SQL used for something like this?

**Will taking this internship open doors in Big Data and Data analytics?**
I am not a math/stats guy, only taking the 4-5 required math classes for a CS major. That being said I would like to pursue a career in data, however is there a spot for someone in Big Data who only has basic math skill?

Thanks guys if anyone has experience with this your insight would be greatly appreciated."

So I've fallen for an Intern at my job. She's 1 year older than me. At first I thought it was a simple crush, but soon I couldn't stop thinking about her. She was in the same department as me, but 1 week after I transferred to the night shift (where she originally worked), they moved her out to a snack bar. I barely know her, I thought she was very pretty when I first met her, but that was it, I didn't care at all. Soon I found out that she was actually very friendly. That's when I started feeling that way. So on Valentines, I gave her some chocolate, didn't want to give flowers since it would seem too serious and it might creep her out. She accepted it. A few nights later, she came to eat at the buffet where I worked. I didn't notice her until my Friend pointed her out. She tied her hair and wore a hat. It was as if she was hiding from me since in my time working there, she was the first customer to keep her hat on the whole time. My Co-Worker came up to her and talked to her about me. I asked my Co-Worker what she said and she was said that she said ""Then why didn't he just ask for my number?"" I don't know if that's true though since I have a weird feeling that she's just trying to push me to try harder. Then, my other Co-Worker came up to her as well and said ""Heyyy, did you know someone likes you here."" The girl I liked replied with ""I know, *** (The Co-Worker who spoke to her before) told me"" while hiding her face with her hat in my direction and blushing at the same time. I didn't know what to think or feel about that since through my eyes, it seemed as though she was trying to avoid me. A few days later, my Co-Workers wanted to go drinking since it was my birthday. They told me to invite her so I did. Sadly, she said she had plans to go eat out with her fellow Interns. While we were talking, I also asked her how the Chocolates were, but she said she has yet to open it since she was busy. On my birthday, we were drinking, I got so drunk to the point I started talking to one of the Interns about her. Just after when I knocked out from the alcohol, he said ""Oh her? She's texting this guy."" After hearing that, one of my girl Co-Workers said ""WHAT?!?!"" and called him to the party. Turns out, they argued. It wasn't actually the girl I liked who approached him, it was him who approached her. The next day, my Co-Workers told me about him. Some of them called him a fuck boy. This made me scared as hell. Just a few days ago, I've had suspicions that they were out together, but my Co-Worker thinks I'm over thinking things. My other Co-Worker is saying that she's passing by us a lot in hopes that I'd talk to her, but I find that ridiculous. It's been about probably at least 8 days since we've had a proper conversation. I still don't have her number. I don't know what to do. All I know is, she makes it hard to breathe, I can't eat sometimes, I can't sleep sometimes, I can't focus sometimes, and I couldn't even watch Black Panther with my Bro properly cause she was on my mind for almost the whole movie. She's all I think about on my days off too.

To sum it all up, I gave her chocolates, she hasn't opened them, she showed potential signs of interest (Asking why I didn't get her number, blushing, but this is all information from my Co-Workers, I don't know if it's true), a fuck boy, who probably emotionally hurt one of my Co-Workers, is texting her, I have suspicions that they hanged out (my Co-Worker thinks I'm over thinking) and I haven't talked to her in a while. Also I still don't have her number and she's going home(she's a different ethnicity from me, she's not from my country) in the summer.

Please give me advice on what I should and should not do, I've decided that I do NOT want to give her up. I don't care if she has to leave and I have to leave for college, separating us for a long time. I don't care if I have to wait for her for years because of college and the expenses of visiting her in her home. Please don't say ""Move on, there's plenty of fish in the sea"" because I truly do not believe that. I believe that no one in the world is replaceable. Also, why is it that I feel so strongly about her? Please help me before I lose her...."

It feels like you're literally doing nothing beyond just doing assignments and studying for exams (well, arguably there's time lost on goofing through social media). Weekends and even holidays like reading week have to be dedicated for schoolwork--I ended up not going to a few hackathons that accepted me because of this. Tbh I am missing my co-op in summer 2017: despite being busy in work hours, weekends and after-work hours were all mine (I managed to hang out with people to different places, play board games regularly, develop my website from scratch, and do a bunch of cool math stuff). 

The pay off? I have a decent average (90+) every term, which is worth it if averages are really really important (I managed to switch into CS even after the process became way more competitive, and got a research position before WaterlooWorks started). I do want to go to grad school, and tbh I am targeting those that are extremely competitive in admissions (which means grades are important). But at the same time I am also hoping to get great internships (I plan to do something other than on-campus research just to try out new things), and so I have to find time to work hard on that (like doing a project). I tried applying to jobs outside of WaterlooWorks in Fall 2017, and judging from the outcome (4 interviews out of ~60 applications), it seems like my CAV almost didn't help me. So I started thinking whether these two aims (top grad school vs great internship) are not compatible and I have to choose one. 

Beyond that, I do want to have a work-life balance in my undergrad journey. I told myself that I want to be ""less nerdy"" at the beginning of this school term, but thinking of assignments and tests just rendered this (nearly) impossible. Is it because I treated things too seriously? Or is it because I didn't really manage time well?

You can say that we should give our 100% to schoolwork because we are ""full time student"", but full time employees often don't need to spend time working on weekends (well, overtime is another story, though). 

Anyone wants to contribute their thoughts? Thanks a lot!"

Here's a little background.

I graduated 1.5 years ago and since then I'm employed as software engineer at a large company. The first months were smooth, I learned a lot and completed simple tasks. However a few months ago the senior engineer in my team and our manager left, so I was assigned a new manager (we are a pretty small team). We were getting along fine with my old manager and I was completing my tasks on time, however we started having some controversies with the new one. 

- The first time he caught me browsing a forum while I was waiting for my files to build (that takes 10-15 min) and asked to see me in his office. I thought this behaviour was acceptable as other people browse websites that are not related to work, but fair enough. Since then I stopped checking anything that's not related to work on my computer. He said that doing this is unprofessional and makes myself unproductive (although we are a small office and rarely have clients coming in - communication is remote).

- The second time he asked to see me in his office was on Friday when I was leaving work. He wanted to know how many hours per week I work and  asked me what what time i arrive and leave the office. So I let him know the exact times. He refused, to believe me, made up that i arrive later than i told him as he ""check my chair and looks around"".  I commune by train and it takes me a long time to arrive and return home so I know my exact times and I corrected him. In the end he accepted my version.

- So we concluded that I work a little bit more than an hour less than the hours in my contract, not counting some time in the morning before i go to the office when I work from home. I had the impression that since other people are flexible with it, often take time for sports activities, and often work from home, this number was flexible as long as the work gets completed, but he insisted that he is sure everyone else works the contracted hours and I don't. Note that I do not take any breaks such as lunch break while i work except to get some water or toilet so that really makes my work time compact and I made that clear. But fair enough, I accepted to increase my work time by a little over one hour.

- He threatened that working this number of hours will affect negatively my annual review.  I replied replied that I work productively, but he called me delusional. None of my previous managers in my internships or university mentors have had any complaint about my productivity and on the contrary, they said i'm hard working and smart.  On top of that, learning curve in our company in steep ad even senior engineers take months of training. Plus, recently I fixed an complex issue our product was suffering from for years as I was asked, and offered a few possible solutions for another one, along with completing other small tasks.
I always had a feeling that he doesn't really like me and uses the above as a reason to threaten me, but I may be wrong.


My questions:

- In your workplace (particularly engineers), do you have to stick so close to the number of hours per week? How important is that number?
- How can I show him that I'm productive when he doesn't acknowledge it?
- As a result the atmosphere in the office feels hostile for me and it feels like my work is not appreciated, I cannot enjoy what I do as much. What should I do if things escalate, how should I address the issue and to who? If things stay this way I will have to consider changing job.

Thanks for reading :)

I'm studying CS at University and I've been able to land some pretty decent internships. But as I continue my degree I can't not pause to ask myself what I want to be doing a few years down the line. Right now I guess my goal is to be an SWE at some pretty great company but I'm confused on what I should do after that? I was talking to my uncle and he really urged me to do a PHd cause he said the work I do will be more meaningful and there won't be a lot of people who can do what I do (cause of how specialized I'll be) -- I definitely see what he's saying and it's an option I want to consider but I was wondering what my other options are. Here are a few paths I can think of.

1. SWE at good company --&gt; Senior SWE --&gt; Principal SWE --&gt; Engineering Manager --&gt; Director of Engineering / Software Architect?

2. SWE at good company --&gt; Product Manager --&gt; ? (not sure what comes after this)

3. PHd --&gt; Research/Engineer at some good company in that field --&gt; ?? (not sure what comes after either)

4. SWE --&gt; Senior SWE --&gt; Save loads of money and try a startup

I was doing software engineering for some nuclear units. If you For those who are interested to know what I was doing keep reading this paragraph, if not skip to the next one. In short I was mainly working on the HMI side and mostly I was responsible for software migration, meaning they already had a working software programs that control/monitor those nuclear units, but the software they were using was no longer supported by Windows 10, therefore they had to use a different software to control/monitor the units. I had to make sure those projects were working on the new software as they are supposed to.  

A little info about myself, I have a terrible GPA (2.76), my entire time in school was extremely stressful, because I suffer from clinical depression and anxiety. I applied to this internship knowing that there is a 0% chance I will get accepted, it's a great company that I never thought I had a chance to work in, somehow I got a call to schedule for an interview. I was interviewed by two managers over the phone at the same time, they asked me about my resume and several technical questions, a week later I get the job offer. 

My internship lasted about 3 months, during that time, I think I did a good job, I finished all the projects they asked me to do and didn't give them a hard time. Several times I was asked by some people there to come back and work for them after I graduate, the person who mainly was asking me to come back wasn't my manager, as far as I know he was an employee, but he talked as if he had authority because he even told me what salary they would give me. Back in that time, I wasn't actually very interested to work with them after I graduate, mainly because I wanted a job near my home (I had to relocate for the internship). 

By the end of my internship, the team lead who basically was responsible for training me and interacting with me gave me his email and phone number as a reference and even asked me to email him if I'm interested in coming back, he told me to shoot him an email and ask if they have open positions. My direct manager (whom I've only seen a couple of times during my internship) was nice with me, and even gave me a tour for some buildings that I wasn't allowed to be in to show me some nuclear units and stuff like that. By the end of the internship, I emailed him my personal email and asked for his (we use protected email servers that we don't have access to outside the company). But he never replied to me. I'm not sure if this is a bad sign or not.

Anyway, during this semester I've been applying everywhere with no luck, I only managed to have one job interview, and the interviewer was not pleasant at all with me and even said some racist remarks (after the interview it was clear to me that from the beginning he wasn't interested in hiring me). 

After that experience, I've been feeling pretty down and started losing hope in finding a job, after having some deep thoughts, I think it's a good idea for me to work with the same company I had an internship with. My only problem right now, is that if I emailed my reference and he rejected me, I would get extremely depressed about it, as I feel like this is my last hope of finding a job. 

What I need advice with, is how should my email format be? Should I straight up tell him I'm very interested to work full time for them? Or is that too direct? I was thinking of asking him if they have open positions that would fit me. I don't know. My mind is all over the place now and I'm really stressed out over this. Any advice would be great. And sorry for the rant.

801emj,39,2018-02-24,I need some help finding an entry level developer job.,kokopelliturtle,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/801emj/i_need_some_help_finding_an_entry_level_developer/,"Hi there-

I recently graduated from Penn State with a degree in computer science and a minor in math. It has been about two months since I graduated, and I still haven't been able to find a full-time gig. I am worried about making payments on my student loans (both private and federal), so I would like to land a job ASAP.

I started applying to jobs in late September 2017. Since then, I have applied to 70+ jobs. In a few cases, I have been close to landing an offer, but I have ultimately been unsuccessful thus far. I'm hoping to find a job within the greater Baltimore area so that I can continue living at home for some time. Like I said, I have a lot of student loans so this aspect is pretty important to me (I would be open to working remotely, but am not sure the best way to go about finding a remote position). Also, while I was in school, I did not study cyber security or web development. This is something that I deeply regret because I realize now that these areas are in such high demand.

Most of my experience is in C++, but I have some experience in other languages such as Swift, Python, Java, PowerShell, etc. I have a few personal projects on my resume, along with several technical internships. I am extremely stressed because my parents are constantly berating me about finding a job. I worked very hard to get my degree, and I am unhappy to say that I feel like it wasn't worth it. I struggled through some of my tougher CS courses because I believed that I was earning a very valuable degree. Now that I've graduated, I feel that most companies are looking for engineers who possess very specific skillsets. On top of that, I don't know which technologies to learn because it seems that each company wants a developer who is familiar with their specific legacy technology.

Right now, I regret studying computer science, and wish that I studied something less challenging. I am getting desperate and I have started to look for any full-time job, even if it's not a technical position.

I'm just not sure how to spend my time, and I really need to get a job soon. I fear that becoming an expert in something (web development, machine learning, data science) may take a decent amount of time, and that even if I were successful in learning a new technology, I still wouldn't be qualified for those jobs for another month or so.

Please, any advice is appreciated.

801kl1,12,2018-02-24,"48k a year ""Junior Test Engineer"" or keep looking?",kevzilla88,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/801kl1/48k_a_year_junior_test_engineer_or_keep_looking/,"**Story**:So I am a recent Cal Poly (B.S. Computer engineering) grad and have been looking to find a job in San Diego county. I sent out my resume a little over a week ago to about 6 positions in the SD area and was lucky enough to hear back for 3 of the positions, 2 positions being in the same company. 

The first company (Company A) I heard back from was very quick to respond, calling me back the next day(Friday) and scheduling a phone screen for Tuesday (Monday was a holiday). After the phone screen, they then wanted to have an in person interview the next day again but due to me not being in SD at the time we scheduled it for Friday. 

On my 6 hour drive down to SD for the interview, I got 2 more calls from 2 teams of another company (Company B), both wanting to have a hiring manager interview me over the phone. Times were then set for the following Tuesday and Wednesday. 

My interview with Company A was pretty easy and went well, the interviewers seemed genuinely impressed. They then sent an offer the same day via email for $48k ""Junior Test Engineer"" (Which is actually high based on their glassdoor salaries for the position) with meh benefits and need an answer ASAP for I am suppose to start in 3 days.

**Dilema**: Should I take a sure thing with company A ($48K)? From all my research, their offer is far below market value even for entry level engineers. I know Company B pays much better (about $37 an hour or $77k a year) and the position is more inline with my interests (Associate Software Developer).

I also have various other positions that I have yet to hear back from or have not sent my resume to yet. I'm in no dire need of money now and have no issue waiting, but i guess im just afraid that i wont get any offers in the future better than Company A and I will be kicking myself for not taking it. I'm also worried I might get stuck at Company A or that taking a low paying job will negatively affect my future earning potential. 

Is $48k fair for someone in my position? My parents think I should decline and try for Company B/ keep sending out resumes.

**More Info**: I didn't do amazing in school (2.64 GPA) but it was mostly because I didn't apply myself very much especially freshman and sophomore year. I usually found the material to be pretty easy and intuitive and I did very well when I did apply myself. My grades also improved as I moved on to higher division classes, junior and senior year.

I did not have internship experience but I put a lot of work into my senior project with Lawrence Livermore National Lab developing a materials testing machine (C and microcontroller) and GUI control software (Python). (They even hired me over summer to keep working on it) and they were very happy with the results. 

For me, Company A was kind of ""low hanging fruit"" but now imposter syndrome and FOMO are kicking in and idk what to do.

801t8r,6,2018-02-24,SOP feels disingenuous and I don't know how to fix it.,blindnumbering,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/801t8r/sop_feels_disingenuous_and_i_dont_know_how_to_fix/,"Hi.  I've been lurking on here for a several months and I made an account to ask about my statement of purpose.  My bachelor's is in math and I am applying for an MS in finance.  I graduated 2 years ago and was not able to get a job using my degree.  The only job I got (or even had an interview for) was at a mortgage company doing data entry on loan apps.  This is what got me looking into business / finance.  I am currently taking classes at a community college to cover all basics.  While this is the new direction I want to go in, I lack a definite, clear career goal / path.  My first question is it ok to say I have a strong interest and am open to whatever (poorly worded, I know)?  Every example or guide says I need clear goals, but I don't have that.

My second question is about why I want the degree.  Job hunting is not going well for me.  I had to leave that mortgage job after 9 months to help my mom care for my grandmother.  Nana passed in December.  I am job hunting again but I am hitting the same road blocks as before.  I can't even get a job similar to my old one.  One interview in two years - I have only been applying to entry level or internships ranging from data entry to receptionist (just got rejection yesterday from an internship saying I need more experience).  I haven't even heard back from the retail jobs I applied for.  Maybe I just am awful at writing resumes and cover letters, but I need a job.  I feel like the only way to even get anyone to look at me is an advance degree but saying I only want to go to X school because they have the degree I want is not going to work.  Every attempt at making this nicer feels incredibly disingenuous and forced.   

That's a lot to take in and I am sorry if it's too long and convoluted.  Basically, I am desperate and really need this degree to happen, but my best reasons are I really need a job and X school offers a degree to help me get one.  I know that will not work.  I am applying to ASU, U of Minn, Colorado State, Michigan State, and Pittsburgh.  I do like all of them and their programs, but I am having a hard time explaining why.  I guess the final question is, should I even bother applying if I cannot definitively answer career goals and why I want those schools?"

I recently graduated in CS in December of last year with a 2.5 GPA and I have had an internship since 2016, which ends next month. I have gained almost 2 years of experience with the following: troubleshooting systems in Windows, Web applications (HTML/CSS/JS, C#, SQL Server), SSRS reports.

I have been applying to jobs since the day after I graduated, but I haven't found much really. I keep getting calls from companies that offer roughly 12-week training, but I am looking for an entry-mid level job, not a training company. 

Does the experience I have now with the internship not cut it for entry-mid level work? Should I take an offer to do training? What do companies with entry-mid level positions look for in a candidate? Is it normal to go almost 3 months of job searching out of college with no offers and minimal interviews?"
8026lx,1,2018-02-24,Disillusioned about Silicon Valley before even starting.,shabangcohen,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8026lx/disillusioned_about_silicon_valley_before_even/,"I just graduated after studying CS and am having a hard time finding a job.... yes, it's one of those posts. 

I went to a good school and have a past internship &amp; projects, so I've been getting a bunch of interviews at presumably prestigious companies in the SF/Bay Area. And been rejected at various stages of the process. And I’ve been pretty bummed out about it--the fact that finding an entry-level job is so hard. And that I’m always competing against the best people from the best schools and being beat out. 

But I realized, even though I’ve been applying to a shit ton of places, I really haven’t been trying my hardest, studying for interviews or working on side projects as much as I could be (I just graduated, so now I have all the time in the world). 

And it’s because I don’t actually want to live here. I went to high school in Palo Alto, and honestly I’m not as hungry to get these jobs because I don’t have this dream of living/working in Silicon Valley that many CS grads do. The area is familiar to me. People here seem to pride themselves on having limited social lives. It seems boring that almost everyone is in the same industry and constantly talking about their jobs. Everyone is very much the opposite of well rounded. 

People who have been at it for a bit are more grounded, but it seems like a lot of people my age have a huge ego, lack of empathy and a ‘brogrammer’ mentality. I feel like a lot of people are surprised that I’m a girl and not into ‘geek’ culture at all and did CS. And they sometimes expect me to prove myself to them even though we are the same age with the same credentials, just because I'm not a canonical engineer. I just want to improve as an engineer, work on a product I think is valuable, and actually have a life outside of work without people breathing down my neck like “I started coding at 13 so I think I’m better than you”. 

So for me at least, Silicon Valley culture seems kind of toxic. But it’s hard to set my sights on other places when this is where I grew up. And everyone always talks about wanting/trying to COME here, meanwhile I’m talking about wanting to leave. The bay area is obviously like the mecca of tech, seems like it’s the primary place to start/advance your career in the industry, and even when I search for other locations I feel like ALL the companies I look at are in Silicon Valley. 

So how do I find a job somewhere else? Ideally, I would want to move somewhere in Europe or Tel Aviv (I have an EU passport), or maybe New York. Europe would be amazing because I'm 22 and when else will I be able to fit my life in a suitcase. But the new grad positions I have seen in other countries are looking specifically for students already in those countries. Does anyone have advice for getting out of the Silicon Valley bubble, finding a software engineer job abroad, etc?

Or comments about why the bay is actually great. That’s fine too.

On the 28th my school is having a tech career fair (I live in a big midwest city) where it's tailored towards ECE and CS. Some big names coming are Google, Motorola, BMW, and some other lesser known companies. The only internship experience I have is in supply chain/logistics, and I'm currently teaching myself iOS app development and web development (Swift, HTML, gonna move onto CSS and Javascript next), but don't have any projects and feel that telling the companies that I'm learning these things wouldn't do me any good.

Any suggestions of an alternative to the 8 to 5 office gig?",CommentsAreCancer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/802n7t/awful_experience_at_first_job_out_of_school/,"So I landed my first job out of college at an independent software consulting company. Pay and benefits were shit but the lead engineer was enthusiastic about teaching and the company was happy to accommodate personal time. I was genuinely stoked to be a part of it because I played an important role creating new software and was learning a ton about development. All that changed when they hired a new, ""CTO"".  
  
Guy's startup was failing and he was hired while trying to hock it to the owner of the company. Guy talks the Silicone talk, but the cracks started to show immediately. Guy has a vendetta against OOP, ideas that aren't his, and tech outside of his experience. Loves his 5000 line app.js file though. Egregiously underbids a contract we had planned by hundreds of hours, then blames it on us, for, ""training"". A banking application he said he could, ""program in a weekend"" without so much as reading our white sheets or my notes from consulting with the client or understanding the process the client wanted. Insists we use a stack we had no experience with and a document db to represent what amounted to 4 small SQL tables. Because microservices.   
  
To top it off he's the pompous alpha type and actively fostered an atmosphere of pissing contests, needless blaming, making commits at 2AM, and niggling others' ideas for no constructive sake. Even getting red-faced angry and outright confrontational over mild misunderstandings, come to find a pattern of that behavior on Glassdoor, left by an intern at his previous company. Final straw comes down to, ""I'd like to occasionally forego my break or come in early to leave an hour early to pick my kids up from daycare."" To which he responds, ""it's the man's job to provide for his wife..."". He backpedals, writing me an email at 10 PM, a flowery 6-month review without consulting the people I'd actually been working with. His idea of constructive criticism being complaints about shitting in the morning and brushing my teeth at work.  
  
To my knowledge the banking app still can't generate the core functionality requested by the client.   
  
I tendered my resignation without actually having another job lined up. I could not take it, the 8 to 5 was killing my soul. The notion of giving assholes like that time I could be spending with my 2 young kiddos makes me want to puke. I've been applying for jobs and I even applied for graduate school but my heart isn't in it like it was a few months ago. Don't get me wrong, I fucking love programming and engineering (mathematical) process. I have a lot to offer but I'm just, eh, shaken.  
  
I left on good terms with everyone else in the company. Now I'm looking for ideally a part-time job or basically anything flexible. I'm not afraid to work hard, I have real experience, interview well, have a real degree, etc, but I simply can't seem to shake this bad experience.  
  
Any words of wisdom, suggestions, rude-awakenings, etc are welcome. How do I get back on a horse knowing the last thing I want is to chase a carrot on a stick like a cartoon character? What if this kind of job or working environment isn't for me but I still want to make software?  
  
Edit: I know I sound whiner after reading this. I'm going to leave it for now though in case someone has some good advice.

They say prior experience helps, but for someone like me who doesn't, I'm not sure what options I have. People say I should do some side projects, but I am also unsure as to what kinds of side projects (or how complex must they be) that employers are looking for.

And as an undergrad, do you think it's feasible to get a CS-related part time job as early as now or should I just wait 'til I graduate before looking for a stable, full time job? The latter choice allows me to just concentrate on my studies and get good grades (idk if that matters to employers or not). But the first choice allows me to earn up even a little and gain experience and something to put on my resume (although I am unsure what CS-related job positions I can apply for given my inadequate experience).

Its been a year, 3 month internship, 9 months getting paid, that Ive been working as a consultant (College). Originally I didnt become an employee because I wished to go back to school the next fall (University). This allows me to have super flexible hours during exam time and what not. They did it because its cheaper for them.

My skills before coming to the job encompass App development (iOS, Android), PHP,Oracle SQL, HTML, CSS, JS, Swift, Objective-C, Java, C#, Cobol, RPG/LE.  

Now that Ive worked there Ive added T-SQL, Visual Basic, Xamarin.

Because of my app development experience I got put on a Xamarin project. Strictly speaking Im essentially team lead. Officially QA/Support guy who deals with the clients is the team lead. If this project is successful more xamarin contracts will be coming though. Ive seen the list and some them can take upwards a year. 

Employees of the company get crazy benefits (salaried):

- 3 weeks paid vacation, last christmas they were given an extra 10 days that did not contribute to their vacation time.

- Paid days off on their birthdays.

- Health Insurance (Im still trying to figure out what they get but I believe they have dental too)

- Half days. The boss just says randomly guys you can go home at lunch time. 

- For every day worked on a weekend they get 2 days off.

- Paid lunch of course.

- Free food (I also partake)

My original rate was $20. Its now $25. I get no benefits. A few months back I was offered a PHP job for 70-75K. It was full time so I didnt take it. It offered full benefits. I used that to get my raise. I originally asked them to up my pay $30. They said they couldnt do it right now but offered 25$ and would look into the 30$ when yearly evaluations come around. I was more than happy to take it.

From my understanding Im not getting paid fairly (based off the benefits). But this is my first real job so I do not know. Im an integral part of the team since Ive worked on 2 projects so far. If I were to leave they would have to retrain someone else and they would have to find more Xamarin devs. I work in Montreal.

I will have minimal CS work experience maybe an internship or freelancing this summer and I have been working in construction the last 5 years.
I am unsatisfied by the lack of challenge in the program so I am wanting to transfer to OMSCS. This semester I am taking (remedial classes): DS&amp; Algo, Discrete math, and OS. The Semester set to end mid May and grades turned in by end of May.

 So my question is, in order for me to  gain the best chance of admission should I wait until 9/1 deadline to apply or apply 4/1 and list current classes as In progress? I can definitely see that the admissions team would want to see a more concrete background with grades submitted since I am from a different industry/major. I would like to apply as soon as possible but being patient here may save me some time and headache?

What do you guys suggest based upon experience?"
8074ww,1,2018-02-25,Making the most out of my shitty job + the last couple of months of college,whatIsJob,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8074ww/making_the_most_out_of_my_shitty_job_the_last/,"Hey everyone
I'm a current senior who's looking for Full Time roles as well as part time roles for before school ends (which is in mid June). 

Since the beginning of the school year, I've gotten interviews/screens/coding projects/coding assessments from 15-20 companies. This includes on campus interviews with Facebook/Microsoft/WeWork, coding assessments from Google/theTradeDesk/ServiceTitan, phone interviews with Qulatrics/Dell/Cerner/DoorDash, onsites with Tallan/Synoptek, recruiter calls with Procore/OpenTable, etc. etc. and many more. 

The point of this post isn't to brag about how I've gotten these interviews; it doesn't matter since I never passed them. 
For most of the year, and still now to a degree, I've been very frustrated due to my lack of ability to pass a technical interview (so it seems). I actually passed it for Tallan, but something that I did during the behavioral section indicated to them that I don't handle criticism/feedback very well so they rejected me (this was very frustrating because it came at the same time that DoorDash rejected me for not doing well enough on their phone interview). :'(

During winter break, I finally got my positive response: a local startup wanted to hire me for an internship after one behavioral interview. I was excited at first... and then I realized that this company would be underpaying me at $15/hr, with two other engineers that are FTs (both getting paid 55k/year or so) who don't have a lot of experience either. I've been here for two months now and everything that my CEO has done has indicated to me that it doesn't really seem like he wants to invest in his engineers. It is rather frustrating. These guys didn't budge when I asked to negotiate my hourly pay.

I took this job because I had nothing better, and wanted the money &amp; experience. I don't hate it per say but multiple times a week I find myself getting really bitter over the fact that I'm at a place where I feel like ""bottom of the barrel"" talent go to; but I'm trying to stay positive.

I have interviews scheduled with Dell (again), Redfin and a few more coming up over the next couple of weeks. I'm still applying.
I don't know why I can't pass an interview; maybe its statistics. I know for sure that I get really nervous during technical interviews. Most of the time I just try to be myself and honest and let everything else do the work; I think I'm pretty good at communicating.

But I don't know what to do about this shitty startup that I'm in, why I deserve to be here, why don't I deserve better, etc. etc.

I'm graduating in June and I have some options as to what to do but I just wish I had more offers.

Anyone have any advice?"

I know I'm super new, and though I want to create something so bad, I feel I hardly know anything. At the moment I'm working full time while in school part-time, and along with several hours of commuting each day, I don't have time for much else outside of studying enough to keep A's in my classes. I should mention I work in a completely unrelated field. It's simply a job to get by for now.  

Anyways, I'm dying to learn, dying to create, dying to do as much as I can. I genuinely enjoy the skills I am learning in class, the ability I am developing to create, the problem solving that comes with programming, everything. But just like every other person, I have no fucking clue where to begin when it comes to creating something outside of class.  

After this semester, I have 2.5, maybe 3, years left of school before I graduate. I want as much relevant experience as possible, ideally 2 internships. Year round / part time work would be amazing as well. But I honestly have nothing to put on my resume besides a few relevant courses and a bunch of completely unrelated work experience. I want to build stuff for not only the sake of learning, but as something I can put on a resume to show employers I at least have genuine interest in this field and the ability to learn outside of class. I want relevant experience as soon as possible, but know I can't get it with my resume as is.  

It's not like I'm shooting for a big 4. For the time being, I'm simply worried about shedding this 40 hour a week unrelated job so I can spend my time at work doing things relevant to this field. I just want a decent job when I graduate, and then I can worry about moving to a prestigious company down the road, if that's even something I'm yearning for at that point.

So, how do I even begin? Is it bad to follow along line by line with a few tutorials just to get the idea of how the process works? I know everyone says to take a problem I have in real life and solve it, but part of the issue is.. I'm not even sure what's really possible.  

Sorry if this was long / rambling / out of line with the sub rules. If so, let me know. Otherwise, I'd love to hear any advice people have to offer!"

I am currently a senior in college, 22, Graduating in May with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Business Finance.

I take the A plus Certification exam in March so I expect to have that before I get my degree. 

I live in the Washington DC area and would like some guidance on the best path to become a Network Administrator from this point forward. 

I currently have experience with various Virtualization Softwares and even have my own little virtual mini network setup with windows r2012 and some virtual windows 10 workstations all backed up with Raid that I just play with to keep myself familiar, a couple apps under my belt (stuff with Xcode) and have experience running my own simple databases with filezilla\NotePad++\MySQL. 

I had an internship in Tysons Corner in my Junior year, however I did not learn much if I’m being honest with myself about the time I spent there. I was an IT intern but wasn’t allowed to fix issues really, the most I did was get familiar with the ticketing system and help the lead troubleshoot every now and then.

I was thinking the best path forward might be to obtain a help desk position in order to rack up experience while I study for my Net+ (however recently Iv’e been reading I should skip the Net+ and go straight for the CCNA?)

Either way I figured asking some reddit veterans for some possible guidance couldn’t hurt.

Thank you in advance.

80a1ra,163,2018-02-25,I got the job! Here are some stats and things I learned from 50 applications over 6 months.,TheZachster,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/80a1ra/i_got_the_job_here_are_some_stats_and_things_i/,"I did it! I got a full time offer before my spring graduation. During the time, I kept a spreadsheet to keep track of all the applications and unique passwords. An additional benefit of that is that I was able to make some pretty graphs relating my applications and what was successful. If you just want the graphs, here they are.  
  
[Pretty Graphs!](https://imgur.com/a/LsdLj)    

Not included: Indeed Jobs and school job board positions that did not require cover letters/I didn't submit one as well as career fair recruiters I did not apply online to.
    
  
Here is some of the raw stats: [link to numbers here](https://imgur.com/a/xIQh7)

 A non-negative response was any response that progressed me in the application process, but didn't necessarily mean an internship. This included things like ""hey can you send us your transcript"" or ""Hi you've passed initial screening, we'll pass your resume on to technical hiring managers"" and things like that where I was given feedback that wasn't a 'no'. Company websites were companies that I specifically sought to apply to, rather than opportunistically seeing who was at career fair or on indeed.com. The job I took was from a companies site.  
  
Background:  
* 3.1 gpa from a good ABET mechanical engineering program  
* Applied from late August 2017 to early February 2018  
* Created 35 total cover letters from fill-in-the-blank template I made.  
* 3 summers interning at 2 different companies  
* Interesting extracurricular not related to engineering  

Overall I had the most success with career fair and virtually no success through job sites like Indeed.com. My school has 2 engineering career fairs, 1 per semester, each with 2 days. I made sure to apply online beforehand to about 5 companies per day of career fair and thus had so many companies I was able to speak to at career fair. By applying online beforehand, I was able to skip the steps about them explaining the job and get into talking about what I was the best fit for the position. My resume was pretty strong as I had it looked over by my career center and countless friends. I had 0 interest in engineering project teams over my time at school, but got heavily involved with my campus radio station which took up a similar time as people spend on project teams.   
  
I found that by the end I had gotten used to interviewing and was able to crush it. There are lots of the same questions asked in behavioral interviews so by interviews 4 and 5, I was all ready to answer almost every question. If you're currently interviewing, get your anecdotes straight for times you failed, dealt with bad teammates, had a technical problem, etc. Overall I applied to and heard back from a mixture of medium-large companies. I did not care about location when applying.    
  
I had some down times that you just have to get through. I interned with the same company for 2 years and was not offered a position despite good reviews from 2 different supervisors and mentally thinking I'd get and take the job. I found about this in October and it was pretty demoralizing. I also had one interview where after emailing them after not hearing back when they said they would, I was told they forgot to tell me they offered someone else. Ouch. I came into the job search expecting to have to submit about 100 applications 7 interviews for 2 offers, so I wasn't too far off. If I wasn't very happy with the offer I got I would be still looking right now.   
  
I accepted the first job offer I got, from interview number 4, for a competitive salary in a cool rotational program. It's a company very similar to my previous experience, but located in a different location (one that I actually preferred).
  
  
  
So this is just the standard bragging excitement post, but I figured I'd try to give back with some stats. Feel free to ask questions and i'll try to help. I can try to give pointers on resumes, but will not be posting mine."

In 1,5 years I will be graduating as an accountancy and tax specialist. School is going really well and lately I've been looking into getting some part-time job as an accountant and also applying for my internship for 2019.

The only problem is that I'm not very confident in my CV. The thing is that I tried 2 other studies before. I studied a semester of law, but didn't like it and spent the rest of the year working in a factory. The three years after I pursued a master's degree in literature and linguistics. Although I liked it initially and my grades weren't too bad, I really started to dislike it in the following years, mostly because it didn't give me a fulfilling feeling. I never felt like I was working on something real while, for example, studying medieval texts.

I then made the difficult decision to quit and start something completely different. I really love it and want to find a good job, but I'm afraid my 4y gap will deter a lot of recruiters and interviewers. 

For now, I listed both studies as ""Degree not obtained"", but I feel it might attract too much negative attention. I thought about replacing those lines with ""completed 1st, 2nd years, etc."" or just writing nothing assuming a recruiter will get that I couldn't have completed a 5y degree in 3 years...

I also thought about going the other way around and stating in my cover letter that I have finally found something I love and that I did learn something from the previous years since I actually did as well.

I'd love to hear you guys' imput here.

Thanks in advance!"

80dzpu,1,2018-02-26,Should I completely change my career?,buurd,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/80dzpu/should_i_completely_change_my_career/,"I graduated from college 4 years ago with a bachelor's in psychology.  Since then, I've been primarily working with kids and currently work a very stressful job that is relatively close to my area of study.  I've been at this job 3 years and my experience there would definitely get me any other job working with kids, so long as I don't need a license or masters.  However, I'm kinda burnt out from the whole thing, and when trying to think about an actual career I want to do, it's hard to think about anything related to psychology or working with kids that I would want to do for my whole life. 

After giving it some thought and doing some research, getting a degree in IT sounds like it wouldn't be too bad.  I could get an associates degree at a community college nearby and based on what I've read, an associates degree in IT + a couple years experience is just as good as a bachelors degree. 

The only problem is that I'd be starting over completely from scratch.  I like computers, and generally can figure out computer things relatively quickly (built my own computer with help from my roommate, can generally troubleshoot my own computer problems without needing much help) but as far as actual experience in the field, I have none.  I'm worried that even after getting the degree, I'll be so inexperienced in the field that getting a job will be impossible, and it kinda sucks that the 3 years of extreme stress I've put myself through with my current job will in no way help me get an IT job.  

I don't want to wait around too long to figure out what I want to do; I'm 27 and want to get married to my girlfriend some day, adopt a child, and we can't do those things and live comfortably with me making ~$17.50/hr.  My girlfriend is currently in school getting her second degree, and I want us to both have decent paying jobs so that we can do things in life without feeling excessive stress on our finances.  

I plan on meeting with an adviser at the community college to discuss my options and figure out which path I want to take, assuming I do decide to go back to school.  Game programming sounds the most interesting to me, but I wonder whether other specializations would allow me more job opportunities.  The school I'm looking at offers a number of different paths, and aside from game programming I think I would also enjoy computer programming or software testing. 

 My main concern is the ability for me to get a job with this degree; I would not mind staying at my current job while I'm in school and maybe even finding an internship first to build some experience if I need to. This is all just completely unknown territory for me and I feel kind of lost.


By the way, I am trying to add flair but when I click ""edit flair"" all I see are a list of colors but the actual titles aren't showing up, so I don't know which one to click."
80eo19,1,2018-02-26,[ASK] Why are most semiconductor companies hiring freshers as interns only?,LongjumpingFactor,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/80eo19/ask_why_are_most_semiconductor_companies_hiring/,"Most job postings I see online on company websites and on job boards only seem to have internships for new college graduates. The minimum amount of experience I've noticed they look for is 2 years. Isn't this exploitative as they won't need to provide interns benefits(paid leave/medical/etc.) like they do for regular employees?

PS: Is it possible to get into this industry now that I'm currently working (less than a year) as embedded software engineer? (the level of expertise required for my work is too low, feel like I'm not learning enough). I'm more interested in work that utilises subjects like digital design, control systems, computer architecture, FPGA, and on programming stack, C, C++ and Python."

I’ve read a lot of posts and almost always the responses start off with how “you’ve got so much to live for” without acknowledging that the OP is genuinely in a very bad situation.

To put it simply I am beyond fucked. To start off I have absolutely no friends. I have barely spoken or seen anyone in person for months. I have barely gotten out of bed for the past month. I am long term unemployed. I am 25. I have never been able to hold down a job. I spent New Years Eve alone. For the past who knows how many years. I spent my birthday alone. 

I finally got a very prestigious internship last summer which I had to quit because my social anxiety was so bad. So that bridge is burned. There is no way I will get a job at that organisation after quitting the internship. 

I’ve gone to school to study computer programming but my social anxiety is so bad I can’t stand working in an office with colleagues sitting by me all day. I literally feel paralyzed like I can’t move. I’m supposed to finish school this year but I can’t do it. I have to take a ‘people skills’ class where they talk about dealing with ‘difficult people’. I can’t do it. I’m going to either fail or drop out. Or kill myself, which is looking more and more attractive every day.

No job history. No experience. No degree. 25. It’s over. I honestly want to be dead but I don’t want to experience dying mainly because I think it will be painful but there are just no other options for me at this point. Although from the research I’ve done overdosing on opioids should be pretty painless.

I don’t even know why I’m bothering to write this. Maybe a small part of me thinks my family might find this when I’m gone and it might give them some insight into why. 

If you are actually reading this I don’t know why, I’m probably not going to read the replies. 

I honestly think if I get through this it will be a miracle. I don’t think I will."

Now I am currently job searching but it seems like most companies want applicants who have some sort of industry experience already. I've worked on couple different projects with a group to showcase skills and the technology I am familiar with, however, they do not show proper industry experience since they were personal projects and not with a proper company. Full/part-time jobs want more experience even for some of the junior roles. Startups want more senior role type applicants. Larger companies want CS degrees for an applicant of my age and fairly recent grad. Companies looking for internships want new grads who have a CS degree, therefore, reject me right away. Maybe my whole perspective is wrong, and I'm going about this the wrong way idk. I'd love to hear some feedback on what I can do moving forward in terms of at least getting my foot in the door.

So I'm a freshman college student and I've been offered a 16-month internship at IBM (software development in Cloud). Obviously I'm very tempted to take it, as it seems like most everyone at this school would kill to have this opportunity.


That being said, I'm now very concerned about how this will affect my future.


Do you think this opportunity would help or hurt a college freshman? Obviously getting early industry experience would help me a lot and spruce up my resume, but at the same time it would slow down my progress to Junior year - which is when most companies apparently hire interns. Also, all the other attention I got for summer opportunities was from companies with nowhere near the prowess of IBM. What would you do?"

When I graduate, I plan on going on to study something related to computer technology or engineering. As such, I need slightly more rigorous courses than the average. 

The catch is, my district offers a technology academy, where I can take a 3 credit HS course, and also earn 16 college credits. The class I'd be taking is CISCO Networking DE, which earns me a .5 GPA boost as well, but it takes up an entire day in our alternating block schedule.

So far, I've taken:

7th:

Algebra 1

French 1

8th:

Geometry

French 2

9th

Algebra 2 

French 3

English 9H

Earth Science H

Intro to Marketing

PE

Pre-AP World History

10th

Precalc

French 4H

English 10H

Chemistry

Marketing 1 (I skipped a level of it)

PE

AP World

Biology (Online)

11th (Current):

Computer Science 1

French 5H

AP Lang

AP Environmental

Astronomy (Online)

Marketing 2 (Highest level)

AP Econ

AP US

Now, for 12th grade, I have a few different sets of options. First would be the (semi) typical path of:

AB Calc

AP French

AP Lit

Physics

AP Comp Sci A

Then 3 random electives, probably Aerospace 1, a Tech Ed classes, and then maybe AP Stats? 

This would be good in that it's traditional, but beyond that... I really don't think it's a great move, and is kind of a waste of a year, especially when I can get a weighted, credit-bearing course.

My other choice would be to do the CISCO course (Where I feel I'd enjoy myself more and learn more), and then take fewer electives; That would look like this:

CISCO at the tech academy

AB Calc

AP French

AP Comp Sci

AP Gov

English 12 (Online)

Physics (Online)

The strengths to this would be I probably learn more, as the CISCO class is infinitely more useful to me compared to my other list (The tech academy kids get *tons* of internships with local companies, often paid too). In addition, I'd be much more likely to do better in both physics and English, because our online classes are pretty easy (But you still learn quite a bit), and I wouldn't be cramming my schedule full of somewhat useless electives.

So yeah. Can you guys help me figure out which is best? Thanks.

**TL;DR:** I got a research internship at a research lab that I believe will be worth billions. Because I have a business background I have been instead put on the business side of things and am the only employee or intern working on this. I gained the owners trust and have practically unlimited access to the financials which are incredible. I love the direction of the company and the owner has already taken two undergrad students and made them integral parts of the company and is very generous. I believe if I can continue impressing him on the business side of things, he may bring me along with him. I’ve made some typical managerial analyses on excel which impressed him but need to keep it up and stay useful meaning I can’t run out of impressive things to do (otherwise I’m expendable). What can I do to really shine?


**Background Info:** 
In an extraordinary series of events, I stumbled upon and got an internship at a biotech start-up I knew very little about. This company has a lab at my university. 
I already have a BS in business and am working on a second degree so when I told him that, he had me begin looking over financials and interpreting spreadsheets and cleaning things up. It seems I hit it off with the owner, and on the first day, upon signing the NDA, he gave me pretty much uninhibited access to their financials, projections, financial structure, etc. I was absolutely blown away not just by the financials, but by the potential and generosity of the founder. I am so excited about the direction of this company and their direction they are going and want to become a bigger part of it! Think Nobel prize cure cancer type stuff (I know, you probably think its too good to be true but just humor me here).

The company has maybe 3-6 employees and all of them are scientists (2 are undergrads). There are several undergrad lab interns. The owner has an uncanny natural ability for fine aspects of business but mostly just goes off his billionaire (yes, with a B) friend's and board members advice. They have the resources and structuring to make the leap.

They are just finishing the R&amp;D phase and will be going to the implementation phase soon.
When I looked at the business plan spreadsheets there is a lot of good relevant data and estimates but they weren't put together in ways that gave him the valuable information he needs. I spent the first few days re-working the numbers and making the spreadsheets much more valuable, clean and calculating key managerial info that will help them out big time. As with most bio-med companies that make it out of the R&amp;D phase, profitability is hardly a challenge, their financials are incredible. The owner was impressed and appreciated my insights. 

**Here’s the deal:**
 I want to make myself invaluable so that the owner will keep me on and offer me a job and allow me to invest in the company. He has literally given away about 6% of his company (that I honestly believe will one day be a household name worth billions) to his 2 undergrad students who have worked for him for years, that’s the kind of person he is (is it the best business move? Not, but he’s already rich and as they move more and more towards monetizing their research they will tighten up). He is very generous, so I am confident that if I can really impress him (using the limited business background provided by a BS in business mgmt) he may allow me to invest in the next round of funding and bring me with him on the incredible journey that lies ahead.

I am the only person currently working on the business aspect of things right now. What can I do to make myself standout and be invaluable?"

He has literally given away about 6% of his company (that I honestly believe will one day be a household name worth billions) to his 2 undergrad students who have worked for him for years, that’s the kind of person he is (is it the best business move? Not, but he’s already rich and as they move more and more towards monetizing their research they will tighten up). He is very generous, so I am confident that if I can really impress him (using the limited business background provided by a BS in business mgmt) he may allow me to invest in the next round of funding and bring me with him on the incredible journey that lies ahead.

I am the only person currently working on the business aspect of things right now. What can I do to make myself standout and be invaluable?

80kkut,4,2018-02-27,Should I continue to intern for a company that can't afford to hire me on?,Silver_Frost08,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/80kkut/should_i_continue_to_intern_for_a_company_that/,"I’ll keep this relatively vague in case the Tesla Big Brother is watching. I graduated college December 2016 with a degree in mechanical engineering. I’ve been interning at this place since July which is when the company opened its doors.  We make parts for Tesla so it’s very much a manufacturing environment. Pretty much all I’ve done is train the operators and develop work instructions for all the processes. I went into this internship with the sole intention of getting my foot in whatever door is supposed to open next. 

So my 90 day review happened in November and they told me they didn’t have a position open so I’d continue to be an intern until the end of the year and then they’d review me again. And now it’s almost March and the company has fallen flat on their face. They recently laid off all the operators (about 40 of them) for three weeks. Engineering and maintenance are the only ones untouched. I forgot to mention there’s two other interns as well who are currently attending college. With all the operators gone, there’s about eight of us who are a part of engineering. I feel bad for the operators since a lot of them live paycheck to paycheck. I have a feeling many of them won’t be coming back. I mean who wants a job that could lay you off on a weekly basis? There have been several occasions when they announce mandatory twelve hour shifts at the very last minute. Last minute as in the operators are clocking out and management says, “By the way you’re all working twelve hour shifts seven days a week.” Oh, you want the holidays off? Nah you’re working cause Tesla is working.

And now I’m having a crisis. A part of me wants to leave since I really don’t want to go through the trouble of training an entirely new crew. A good chunk of the crew that got laid off has been here for several months, so they know their way around the place. You know there’s a point where the operators pick up on little things you can’t teach them and seeing them go feels like a waste of time and money. But hey I don’t blame them for leaving.  I think since I’ve started working here, I’ve seen fifty people come and go. All the operators are employed through temp agencies (including me) so they can leave or be fired on a whim. 

The other day I was talking to another engineer and he said I should accept whatever full-time employment they offer me. He said I can use the salary they offer me as a negotiable tool for my next job. But who knows when that will happen. Even HR got laid off. I really don’t want to hang around while this company tries to get their stuff together. Let’s just say we’ve had way more downs than ups and honestly, I don’t remember the last time we were going uphill. Tesla has us continually reworking our entire inventory which consists of roughly eighteen hundred parts. This has happened several times and by this point I figure our company should specialize in reworking Tesla’s goofs. 

The engineer who gave me advice did have a good point though. Getting hired on would look good on my resume since it shows I’ve stuck things through since the beginning. But he also said I should be getting paid much more since I have a degree and all. The program manager here didn’t even know I had a degree and I don’t think he ever saw my resume. The current engineer I report to replaced my boss back in December since he couldn’t take the stress anymore. We reckon the reason I haven’t gotten hired on is since the company is using my intern title as “cheap” labor. They recently slashed eight employees at another facility due to the “challenging business climate”. And now at my place, management wants to staff the very minimum amount of people depending on Tesla’s requirements. So one week we might only need 20 people to make 150 parts while the next week we might only need eight employees. Like how would you even market a position like that? I reckon since the operators are temps they’ll realize this place isn’t very stable and they’ll look elsewhere. 

Any advice is welcome. I’m just trying to make sense of this mess.

I chose a position at the same big four accounting firm that my dad works for (same service line, same office, etc). While he did give me a referral, I still applied and went through the interview process (with three individuals who did not know the connection with my dad) just like all the other candidates. 

While I know that I have a respectable background and interviewed like everyone else, I can’t help but feel like I used him as a crutch.

a) i already asked for an extension, how long is appropriate to ask?



b) should i even be considering this position?

I am currently a senior getting a degree in Information Technology and an Intern for a company for the past 
year. 

Since this is my 2nd internship I quickly grabbed the ropes and began doing the same work as a normal tier 2 technician within the first month. Recently my boss has been throwing me projects more related to the business side of IT and what he is doing adding on to my normal technician work. I currently do more than some of my coworkers who work as full time employees here. I took the reigns for one of the transitioning projects between different phone systems that no one else wanted to tackle. I asked my boss for a full time position however he said that currently it is not possible however there is a possibility to work here full time for the future. Since i'm an intern I'm also getting very bad pay (minimum wage). I really like the atmosphere here but it feels like I am being used more than anything.

So, is there anything I can do here? I recently talked to my boss last week about a raise but he has yet to come back to me. Should I start sending out my resume and see if I get anymore opportunities or wait to see if things change?"
80nr8s,1,2018-02-27,Extremely torn between two different internships for this summer,wolfyking2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/80nr8s/extremely_torn_between_two_different_internships/,"One of my internship options is for a software engineering co-op position at Thomson Reuters through Maverick Software Consulting in Minnesota (working with DevOps engineers and learning that style of work). The other is a summer research internship through NASA called SARP (Student Airborne Research Program). Here, you work with other students in one of four disciplines (I believe the four research areas are: vegetation remote sensing, ocean remote sensing, whole air sampling, and atmospheric chemistry). For the first week or so, you are in a C-23 Sherpa plane decked out with data collection equipment, and the other 6-7 weeks are spent at UC Irvine doing data analysis.

For a little background, I was doing chemical engineering/environmental science for the first 1.5 years of college, and switched to computer science last year. I am so torn because I have been wanting to do this NASA internship for two years now, but I know it's not extremely related to what my career will be in (software development/web development, not 100% sure on that thought. I'm getting a BS in Computer Science). I would have the opportunity to do a lot of data analysis using Python/R and such, but other than that, it would be environmental science research. I have also been wanting to move to the West coast for pretty much my entire life, and spending a summer working with NASA in California sounds (and has been) like a dream.

I technically already accepted the software engineering position last week, but I just heard back from NASA yesterday. I know the co-op would provide better experience for what I will eventually (probably) be doing as a career - and it's not like I don't want to do it. I'd be living right outside the Twin Cities for 6.5 months, working a super flexible 40 hrs/week with ample vacation time for a half-year position, and the work sounds interesting. I'm just so conflicted because working for NASA has been such an ethereal dream the last few years of my life and now it's so real...I have no clue what to do.

What do you guys think? Would I be jeopardizing my future career by taking the NASA position over the software engineering position? "

I know she broke with her boyfriend because he cheated on her, let her dream about a future together, then going to his other girl. She had been cheated on a first time two years ago and then attempted suicide. But her family send her to the hospital and I went to see her (it was my birthday and she called me the day before I visited her).
Last month, she was sad about her (ex-)boyfriend and I tried to comfort her. She told me she won’t tried to harm her, because she didn’t want to go back to the hospital.
I thought she felt better. She found an internship that seemed to interest her, she was going to move out with her sister (she lived with her boyfriend before the breaking-up but now she couldn’t afford a place for her alone).

Now I don’t know what she’s doing and I want to help her... I ask her sister but she doesn’t know too (they were going to move out this week, so she would see her later). And I don’t even know why I came here to ask for help...

I would love to have a formal opportunity to do some coding this summer, but I'm really late to the game on applying for internships.

80p1ga,8,2018-02-27,At the end of my rope in my current position. Any advice for getting out of it? [x-post from /r/cscareerquestions],datasciencecareerq,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/80p1ga/at_the_end_of_my_rope_in_my_current_position_any/,"I'm a statistician by trade.  My entire academic background is in statistics, including an advanced qualification.  I have done no statistics at my current job and I'm at the end of my rope.

I've been at my current job since May 2017.  It's my second job directly out of college.  I was laid off from my first job during the ""golden handcuffs period"" (I owed them money if I quit before a year) because they didn't have any data sciencey work for me to do.  I was essentially a DBA there even though I’d keep suggesting reasonable analyses and easy ways to make their infrastructure more data driven instead of heuristic.

I brought up my concerns about wanting to actually do data analysis when I took my current job, which is at a small team in a satellite office of a main office.  My boss is a very smart person with strong statistical credentials.  He's also annoyed at the lack of the statistical work, but is staying around because he expects it to show up.  This company is pretty early in the process of building serious data infrastructure.

The only statistics I've done are one quick demo analysis in the beginning and another that took a few months but was cancelled due to internal factors (I had no results at that point).  At both jobs, people are aware that I know advanced statistics, but I've always been stuck doing other work.

I have been doing literally nothing but demoware and basic dashboarding since September.  I've done some coding tasks because ""Oh you're the data guy and I'm a senior guy, do this vaguely related data thing that isn't statistics.""  I've been making mockups for PMs to show at conferences.  The work I do is *very* high visibility, but has no statistics involved, which is why I'm annoyed.  I do the work, but I've been miserable because it has very little relation to what I want to be doing.

Unlike my boss, who has a considerable resume, I have little experience actually doing statistics.  I had an internship as an undergrad where I had no mentorship and they didn’t know what to do with me so they kept moving me from random task to random task, and a statistics REU where I was literally one of two students who was assigned a non-statistical project.

It's particularly frustrating because I like literally everything else about this company.  My boss is awesome, my coworkers are super nice, everyone is super positive, and I can work remotely one day a week.  I'm well paid (honestly, more than I should be given the work I've been doing) and have great benefits.

I have a performance review next month.  I'm expecting it to be fantastic given that I've repeatedly gotten compliments on my work.  There's a machine learning team that I talk to a lot (outside the context of work) that's doing a lot of work I'm interested in, like voice and image recognition.  I would like to leverage my positive performance review into being able to do more machine learning work because I like this company.  Otherwise, I will quit after I hit the one-year mark and find a job that will actually allow me to build models, rather than being a glorified dashboard and demo guy.

How should I best ask to move to machine learning when the dashboarding work I'm doing is so vital?  If they don't let me transfer teams, how can I leverage my current experience into a new job where I'm doing actual *data science*, rather than making and maintaining dashboards for other people?  I've done some coding here, and have good SQL skills, but I've found that my background in those areas has made me a ripe candidate for ""code things that manage data and do basic BI stuff"" roles, rather than the more technical, advanced statistical roles I'm interested in.  My current thought is to emphasize my statistical background, make it clear that I want to be doing *analysis* work, and to point out that I was able to handle high visibility, high impact projects that require talking to stakeholders in the past."

TLDR: Student in his 4th year that's really sure that 90% of what he's done while pursuing his degree is not what he wants to do for the rest of his life. Advice?

So I just found this subreddit (a f***ing godsend). I'm currently struggling with a bunch of issues in regards to my major choice and its implications for the rest of my life. Light topic, I know :). 

To preface, I'm currently at a very well reputed institution in a damn good software engineering program. I'm currently a fourth year out of five total years. I've been doing decently in software engineering and currently am finishing a minor in Statistics. I pretty much have a 3.0 on a 4.0 scale overall and a 3.4 in-major. I've enjoyed *parts* of all of my major specific classes but, with one exception, never more than half of the class.

One of those five academic years is devoted to internships / co-ops. I have currently completed that full year before I needed to (two extended summers and one full extended semester of co-op). Even though I finished the requirement I decided that I would like to take another co-op this semester to see if I could get more experience in the software industry as a developer. I found a co-op that I thought I would really enjoy and immediately took it. I am currently at this co-op; and I am absolutely despising 80% or more of what I do.

For those of you that are Software Engineers (if there are any) I'd hope that you might sympathize with my grievances. I spend most of my time each day working out issues specific to Windows, MATLAB, and Visual Studio. I frequently have to refer to the obnoxiously lax and incomplete documentation for those systems. The last thing that I *ever* want to do is spend 8 or more hours a day trying to figure out why the umpteenth run of a particular build isn't working  because of some horseshit visual studio specific post-build event issue. It feels, in a really shitty way, as if the authors of Visual Studio and the design of Windows were meant to f**k engineers up down and sideways with poor design decisions. I know that this is an opinion that many people malign, as most people seem to have no problem with the Windows dev environment(s) at all, but I seem to have a particular aptitude for running into problems with it. With any Unix based OS / dev environment I have close to no problems that actually discourage me.

Ok, so now to the actual meat of the issue.

I don't want to develop in this environment for the rest of my life, nor do I feel really rewarded for solving most of the problems I come across on a daily basis. I came home from work today and the day before, where I didn't do a whole lot, angry enough to come close to punching a hole in the drywall. This also happened at my job a year ago. I don't know if I should attempt to change my major, change my attitude, or just stick it out. I don't truly enjoy my classes, I loathe going into work when I have problems that I classify as 'horseshit' , and I don't want to spend 8 hours of my day on my ass doing something that isn't worth that sacrifice of inactivity.

**My questions are the following...**

1. Should I switch majors without knowing what exactly I want to go into? I'm currently leaning towards Audio Engineering, which has enough music, activity, problem solving, and math / computer knowledge / stats to fit the bill. I could also lean towards music performance (spent 11 years playing percussion, 7 years on the fiddle, 5 years on piano, and 5 years on guitar and love all of it). At the same time pay, my already invested money / time, and the difficulty of transitioning at this point are discouraging me.

2. How should I go about finding what I'm really interested in at this point? I enjoy sailing and teaching sailing. I enjoy teaching coding. I play video games (sometimes to excess, on the side). I've played music since forever. I enjoy reading and editing immensely (again, sometimes to excess). I could choose any one as a career, but the job prospects are pretty goddamn slim in each. I'm a dab hand at most things I take a liking to, but I never attain expert level as there's always something more novel or interesting to garner my fancy.

I apologize for the essay and I hope that at least a few of you have the grit and determination to read it through :). I thank anyone who replies (or just reads it and leaves) in advance! If you need any clarification, elaboration, or more in-depth description of my circumstances just ask. I'd be happy to elaborate, as this is not the whole story at all (it would take way too many words and way too much space to write out in full).

Cheers,

It's my life's passion.

I've made software for rendering fractals, games for my calculator (programmed in C: pacman, 3d raycasting maze game, connect4 engine, etc), neural networks (I made a genetic algorithm which produced a neural network which scored 4000 in flappybird), websites (I programmed one for my school's NHS program from scratch), CPUs in minecraft and logisim, an assembler for a SUBLEQ OISC, my own programming languages, etc.

That said, I can't seem to find the recognition I wish I had for what I've been doing. I've applied for some scholarships and never advanced in any of them (I guess they don't really value the dream of being a theoretical computer science researcher). The only scholarships I could find pertaining to computer science were for minorities and the poor (and unfortunately my situation does not permit me to utilize the latter). 

The best recognition I feel like I have received for something was an internship as a data scientist for http://thetileapp.com/, but after returning I felt a hole in me. Apart from that, nobody besides the people at which I shoved my work in their face has given me any recognition. And I understand why -- it's hard for someone to understand how much work I put into a finished product. That's where it would help to have someone who I could collaborate with, but the only other person who seems to program at this school doesn't seem to be interested in collaborating.

This is coming after my girlfriend received a major scholarship, one which I had applied to and never passed the first stage. I feel happy for her, and it makes me feel like a terrible person to think the way I am after she has just achieved something so significant. 

I've been feeling this way for quite a while now, and all I can do is reflect back and realise how I wasted my senior year by not applying to scholarships like mad and by looking for one that fits me. I'm getting tired of high school and just want to see my work pay off. I used to not care about the recognition and just program for fun, but now that it is time to leave for college, its hard to think that way when I feel pressured to go out achieve greatness. I just don't know what to do at this point"
80sthj,3,2018-02-27,Need Advice on Workplace Situation,csci_throwaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/80sthj/need_advice_on_workplace_situation/,"Greetings,

I'm in a bit of a corner with my current job with very few people to turn to for help so I figured I'd make a throwaway account and ask for some advice here. Here it goes:


So basically I graduated from college last semester and accepted a full time position at the place I've interned at for the past two years. I would say about 4-5 months of that internship consisted of ""bottom of the barrel"" stuff that nobody else wanted to do, but the rest of the internship was spent doing professional-level work. By that I mean I was expected to be producing code at the same quality and pace as a full-time employee.


The vast majority of the internship was a positive experience. I gained a lot of experience, made a decent salary, and generally enjoyed most of the varied work I was doing. However, this past Fall things started to go downhill.


Basically, the company is rapidly expanding and picking up more customers and every department aside from IT is growing. What this means is that an overwhelming amount of work is being piled up on my plate with unrealistic, decided on the fly, deadlines. This has started to negatively impact me by inducing loads of stress and a constant loathing of having to go into work. Basically, this is the kind of environment I deal with:


- No matter how big the task is, if it's assigned to me I am the only one to test it and review the code. That means if I have a tight deadline and the scope of the task is massive, I inevitably miss a few things. And when my boss catches the smallest misstep (ie, missing a minor bug or deviating slightly from the norm in the rush to finish it) I get chewed out and the entirety of the blame is put on me. To top it off, occasionally when these small issues arise I'm met with ""the quality is more important than how fast you get it done""
- Leading off that point, we have a specific program that is specialized for a specific company. This company is an extremely large client and dozens of people rely on the work we do for them. Again, I am the only one testing additions to this program (which aren't written by me) and I have been explicitly told several times by superiors that essentially I absolutely cannot miss a single thing or else I will be responsible for the consequences.
- Aside from using source control, the organization is very messy. We usually have 5-10 different projects going on at once, and the only method we use for keeping track of issues or TODO items is a chat client. I tried suggesting the use of a project manager, but the answer I got was essentially if we start using one it has to have enterprise support. One year later and there's still no sign of one anywhere in the near future.
- Work/Life balance is messy and inconsistent. I start at 8AM and most days I don't get out till 5:45ish (not terrible, I realize), but if there's ""critical"" work (that always likes to suddenly appear at 4PM) that needs to get done I am expected to stay in the office and rush it through to completion. There are several times a month I will not get out until after 6PM, and occasionally I will be working till 7PM or even later on occasion. 
- Most recently I had to leave slightly early for an important personal event and my boss claimed that I needed to start leaving an hour of wiggle room at the ""end"" of the day and that I cannot expect to get out at a consistent time. This was said (and repeated in the past) despite that fact that I almost always leave after 5:30PM.
- As of late, my boss has become increasingly snippy with me. If I have to leave early or work remotely he gets upset, even though I will frequently come in early and work through lunch to makeup this lost time.


I want to leave as these past few months have been leaving me increasingly miserable and fed up with work. But being a recent college grad, my concern is that leaving this early despite having interned here for two years will leave a bad taste on my resume. And on top of that, I plan on moving within 2-3 years which translates to another shortish stay if I were to switch companies.


Am I being unrealistic with my expectations or should I start looking elsewhere?"
80sybu,7,2018-02-27,"Should I trust my uncle to help me pay for college, and if so, how do I ask him for help?",RhyanHawghor,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/80sybu/should_i_trust_my_uncle_to_help_me_pay_for/,"So, I'm a junior in high school right now, and I'm starting to plan for the future. I currently live in Arkansas, and I hate it. I was raised in a quasi-cultish church, that was exetremely Evangelical for a good chunk of my childhood, until my parents finally switched to a much more relaxed church. From about the ages of 10-16, I my life was full of guilt, anger, confusion, and lots of sleepless nights. I'm an agnostic now, and I've mostly finished the process of growing up and sorting out all of my personal beliefs.

The problem is that now, I feel like my world view is mostly incompatible with living in the Bible belt. I've developed a huge interest and love for things like philosophy over the years, but I have absolutely nobody to talk to about any of it. It seems that everybody just lets the Bible answer all of the big questions about life for them, and they don't ever think about them.  It's just so hard for me to find any like-minded friends, and I've become exetremely lonely. I also have had a lot of trouble with girls. Any girl I'm interested in always turns out to be exetremely religious. While I have a girlfriend currently, we've both agreed that we're going to have to part ways when she goes to college in August, and even she is a Christian, but a very, very liberal one. I was also super lucky to meet her on a Reddit thread, where we were both complaining about living here in this state.

I'm just very scared what my future holds for me. I'm afraid if I stay here in Arkansas, I'm never going to find any close friends or get another girlfriend. I just don't feel like I belong here, and I desperately want to leave, and I want to leave as soon as possible, which is why I'm really hoping to go out of state for college. The problem with that of course, is that going out of state is going to cost me a shit ton of money. The only way I can get out of here without drowning in debt is if my exetremely rich uncle helps me pay for college.

My uncle is a millionaire, maybe a multimillionaire, and he has offered to pay for me to go to college in Chicago, where he lives. I've always been almost like a son to him. He isn't married and he has no kids, and his social skills are really bad, so I'm like the closest relationship that he has. My parents however, have been warning me not to take him up on his offer. Keep in mind though, that I have not yet told them I'm agnostic or why I want to leave the state. My uncle has occasionally said he would give my parents money in the past, and then changed his mind, although it's never been for anything exetremely expensive. I think once he said he would help pay for a vacation,  and then he decided not to. My parents have also told me that it isn't a good idea to give anybody that much control over me. My parents have an pretty negative view of my uncle though, because he isn't a Christian, and he's gay. I suspect that the only reasons that they have much of a relationship with him is because he can help them when they need money, and because he's formed a close bond with me and my siblings, although I'm definitely his favorite.

Currently, I'm very torn about what path I should take. I really want to leave Arkansas, but I know I won't be able to unless my uncle helps me. I'm not really afraid of him changing his mind. I know he cares more about me than probably anybody, and I don't think he would do that, but the chance that he'd do that is still there, and if he does, I'm pretty much fucked. What I'm mostly worried about is that I'm not sure if I want to give my uncle that much power over me. If he pays for my college, I'm going to owe him a lot, and I'm not sure if he'd abuse that power. Since he's such a wealthy, intelligent guy, he can sometimes try to get me interested in lots of carriers that may be considered prestigious, or just things that make lots of money. When I was young, he would often try to do things and get me presents that might make me want to become a doctor or a something else that he thought was important. I remember that when I was ten, he bought me a computer on the condition that I would promise to use it to try and learn python, which a dabbled in just a little, but never really got into.  Currently, my plan is to major in philosophy as an undergrad, and then go to law school, or get a PhD in philosophy if I turn out to be really good at it. I'm not sure if he'd like that plan.

Once I was talking to him about maybe taking a gap year in Chicago, just so tuition would be cheaper, and then he told my parents about this plan he had for me, where I'd be an intern at his work during the day, and a waiter at night. My parents didn't like this idea, and they thought it was quite manipulative and scary that he has a whole plan like that, without even asking me. I told him I didn't like this idea either though, and he hasn't talked about it since.

I'm just not sure what I should do. I want to leave this place so bad. I'm so lonely and depressed here, and I think if I leave, I'll finally be happy, but I'm afraid that maybe it just doesn't matter where I go, and I'm just going to be like this no matter what. Maybe I'm just weird and unlikable.

Should I trust my uncle to get me out of here? I'm just really not sure.

I'm planning to tell him everything about why I want to get out of here next time I see him, which should be in a few weeks, and I'm hoping he'll agree to help me make up for all the money I'd be losing from leaving the state, but I'm not sure exactly how to ask him for so much money. I also want to make it clear that I don't want him to control me, but I'm not sure how to without seeming greedy and suspicious.  If anybody could help me that would be great.

I'm really scared. I don't want to be sad and lonely forever.

Sorry if this post is kind of rambly/messy. I wanted to get this finished quickly because I'm freaking out about the future and I just want to stop."

However, I will have to stay in with someone and because of my anxiety, it will be a stressful thing for me. To be eligible to stay in a single room, I would have to provide some form of Medical documentation.

Sadly, I have read that this is a bad move (disclosing your mental health), as companies can terminate your employment at anytime, for any reason. However, the one I'm working at has amazing culture, and I'm trying my best to sound as humble as possible, but it is a rather large and well-known company, which makes me wonder if they would be more ""open-minded"" about these kind of stuffs? (mental health, LGBT, yada yada..)

Of course, if this is a bad idea, I could ask some to give me a stipend instead so that I could rent out a place by myself. (I'm not sure if 5500$ for 3 months is enough for the Bay area coz I've never been there myself.)

I have been out of school so long that I am not even passionate about marketing but I’m not sure what else to do with my life. I don’t have any design skills which most marketing jobs seem to want nowadays. I have an old shitty computer that won’t let me download much so I can’t just pick up a design program and try to learn it cause my computer won’t let me download programs like Illustrator because you have to have the newest version of windows and I still have XP plus my computer acts up when I download certain stuff so workin on getting a new computer. I’m in my mid 30s so I don’t have time to waste. I need to get out of my current warehouse job ASAP for mental health reasons. 


Also, I barely remember anything I studied in school, so I would need to get some books to refresh my knowledge. Any suggestions would be helpful. Also, is it gonna be virtually impossible for me to get hired anywhere after not using my marketing degree for several years? Is my degree a waste?"
80xlwm,2,2018-02-28,Lost as a young man,thatwrist439,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/80xlwm/lost_as_a_young_man/,"This might seem hella incoherent and disorganized but here goes -

I feel fucking lost. I'm a student whose currently taking about a year off doing internships and getting experience in the ""real world"". This has been challenging obviously, being completely responsible for myself and my successes and failures - but its a fun kind of challenge and I enjoy it for the most part. But I feel like I've had some realizations about life that have been uncomfortable for me to accept.

First of all, ""adults"" (I dont really consider myself an adult yet) are much more egotistical, emotional, and insecure than I realized. It's like highschool just spilled out into real life, there's cliques and drama and like this really weird social power struggle. Nobody knows what the fuck they're doing it seems - and they will fuck you over if it means making their life easier. And there's like tribalism and weird shit all the time, its like people need to feel included and powerful and on the right team. 

Speaking of tribalism there's some shit on the website that's got me reeling. How do subreddits like the_donald, redpill, latestagecapitalism, ect. ect. even exist? There's so much echo chamber and tribalism in those places its fucking depressing, like theres no way you can have an un-biased discussion there. Why would anyone want to be apart of that?? Are people just drawn to the extremes of ideologies sometimes because it makes them feel more in control? Or are they just weak so they need to bias and echo chamber to feel that ""power"" that comes with being right and apart of the right team? Or am I the one thats weak? I feel like I see so many comments that just serve to boost their own ego, like trying to be right and gain other's respect, then to provide a discussion. 

Speaking of extreme subreddits, I visited many of them looking for answers to my lost feeling, and a most of them have at least a few points. For example - the red pill ideology. Many of the ideas are plain disrespectful and seem to stem from resentment towards women - but I feel like they have some points. I feel like women prefer strong willed, capable, rock solid men, competent men – which is something that is preached at redpill. Which is perfectly fine and understandable. But then you have these ""shit tests"" that the red pill talks about that I've definitely noticed in my relationship. These shit tests are served to kind of fuck with you or rattle you to see what you're made of. And in my experience women (to much generalization here?) definitely do this to measure you up, maybe see if you’re “made of the right stuff”. Maybe this is biological, it seems to make sense from like an evolutionary perspective. Or maybe I'm an idiot I don't know. But I feel like women expect this super-capable, emotional rock of a man, and when a man cracks a little bit or shows any insecurity there is a loss of respect. But I consider my S/O so be a great friend as a well as a lover, but I know from experience that when I start to show some cracks I can see the flame damper just a bit. Maybe she isn't even aware of it. So I feel like I can't open up about any insecurities and complaints to her, and as a man i feel like I can't open up to my male friends either about things like this, so who the fuck do I talk to?

In the world it seems like things are pretty fucked up - Trump is an incompetent, narcissistic pussy, and there is so much bipartisanship its depressing. Politicians take bribe money and take part in corruption, knowing that their actions have terrible effects on the common people. Or do they know? But it's like we can't even trust our leaders or believe in them as people. What kind of example does that set? Who can I look up to anymore? It's like everyone is flawed as fuck and only stands for personal gain. And everyone just wants to feel safe and secure, or have that perfect mate, or perfect job, or have some power to feel like they're worth something. 

And there’s so much disagreement on how society should operate - climate change, feminism, mens rights, gun control, mental health, Hollywood, capitalism, wars – who the fuck is right?? It’s like people just latch on to a camp of thinking and just stubbornly never move away from it. And they will terribly mistreat people to support their cause. And there’s so many fucking idiots who buy in into anything they see without any semblance of critical thinking or discussion, and they’re so fucking loud and obnoxious and egotistical.

And I’m starting to see that my parents are flawed people as well, that have mis-judgments, and ignorance, and prejudices (along with their great traits of course). I guess everyone eventually realizes that but its tough. 

Basically, I don’t know who I am really, or what principles I should upkeep, or where the world is going, it seems like there is little genuine compassion out there, I don’t know what it means to be a man, or how an ideal relationship should look like, or how society should operate and who is wrong and who is right and who I can trust even sometimes. 

And I feel like it’s dangerous for a young man to be in this situation, with little direction, and I want to steer the ship in the right direction amidst all the storm.

I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, maybe r/getoffmychest would be better, but yea that’s some of what’s on my mind, if you read this far thank you.

The job is 8 months, and would probably give me a lot of valuable experience in development before graduating. I got the phone call yesterday and they said to call back today to discuss terms.  

However, I have an interview tomorrow with a MUCH more renowned company tomorrow for a 4 month internship in more of an administration role. I think it would be a lot more exciting to work at this company (and I'd have to move), but the experience wouldn't be as valuable.

So I can either:

1) Reject Company A in hopes that I get the job at Company B, which I guess I have maybe a 20% chance of getting
2) Accept Company B's offer, because it's still great experience and I don't have to move
3) Ask for a week to decide on Company A's offer while I wait to see if anything comes from Company B. 

I think #3 would be ideal but I don't know if this is professional, the company seems to want to hear my answer soon.

80ya45,1,2018-02-28,Help/Advice/IDK. Can't get Associates Degree with 78 credit hours at community college despite meeting 25% requirement...,tawjmp,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/80ya45/helpadviceidk_cant_get_associates_degree_with_78/,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm **bolding** specific points to make it a quick read, can't TL:dr because to many details are crucial to the predicament. 

So my wife originally **went to two universities**, and despite a 3.8 gpa, an internship, and experience she was denied entry into the nursing program at both schools. She decided to **go back to community college to finish her A.A.** and then go back to a university for something else. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She spoke to **4 different adviser's during enrollment, 3 financial aid people, the Transfer Center, and the graduation people.** One of the adviser's actually **did her registration (choosing classes) FOR HER**. All of them **ensured she would graduate in May** at the end of the semester. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For her actual **A.A. degree**, all she **required was one Physical Wellness (P.E.) credit**, and she was done. We knew, however, that she **would need 25% (15 credits)** from the community college in order to receive a associates degree from their.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She had taken **one half-time semester (7 credit hours) one summer** a few years back, and **this semester she took 14 credit hours**. We asked lots of questions, I did lots of digging to find every bit of public information to make sure everything was good. And time and time again all counselors assured us that everything was golden.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She set one more appointment to discuss dropping one of her classes (I work at this community college, but I'm in the I.T. department, so I know this teacher is TERRIBLE), and **they informed her that she would not graduate, regardless of whether she dropped the course or not**. They're now saying that **she must have 15 credit hours TOWARDS the degree she's working toward (A.A)**, despite the fact that **all 4 different adviser's ensured her that by taking classes toward a different degree (A.A.S.)**, that it would fulfill her **25% of community college credits requirement**. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On top of that, they basically said there is **nothing they could do**, because she **already has 59/60 credits** for the **associates of arts**, there is physically **NO WAY for her to graduate from this community college**, despite having 20 credit hours. **Not even with retakes**. None of this would've been the end of the world, had she not already been in these classes for 2 months, paid out-of-pocket, ensured by countless staff members, and above all that, she was actually following the graduation/class-planning guide that one of the advisers made custom for her. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Anyways, alot of the information we get from staff each time contradicts each other. The website sucks, and doesn't really specify anything. So, **what's our move**? **Any advice**, or people who have **gone through something similar**? Do we **have any grounds** to stand on? **Any documentation or official policies**? **S**h**o**u**l**d I **abuse** my **powers** as **a** desktop **support** manager **and** turn **all** the **adviser's** computers **back** to **Windows** 95?

80yq7k,3,2018-02-28,I am not sure about what kind of internships I should be applying for,hueyduck,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/80yq7k/i_am_not_sure_about_what_kind_of_internships_i/,"I am currently a second year student at a university that integrates internships into the regular 4-5 year college experience. I am pursuing a combined Computer Science and Computer Engineering degree which more or less comes out to be a software engineering degree. I am also minoring in design and entrepreneurship, and these two minors show what I am more interested in. Ideally I would like to start my own business during/after graduating this undergraduate program, and I want an internship that will give me the best background experience to learn on the entrepreneurial side of CS.
What types of internships should I be applying for? Are mobile/web development/front-end/UX/UI jobs not as rewarding as back-end development jobs in terms of what I may learn? I live in Boston so there are many start-ups that have open positions, and I think a start-up would be good experience, but I am all ears."

My gpa is horrendous with my finance major gpa being a 2.01, and my overall gpa being a 2.7. I did not enjoy this major and figured out too late in college to switch (i had no idea what to switch to) I did three internships with a regional bank in their collections department. The internship did not require a college degree, (anyone graduating from highschool could have worked this job.) I hated working there due to being at a computer for at least 8 hours a day and getting yelled at by customers regarding their finances. I am going to be graduating this spring and currently do not have a job. I just feel so lost right now and I feel like my gpa will hinder my ability to get future jobs.

What is your advise on getting internships and search for jobs? I was a Data/Information management major for a while before changing to CS in my junior year. I have internships as a data scientist and can write crawling/data analysis codes, but it's nowhere near the level of actual SE work.

As a result, of course, I cannot find any SE internship, though I do hear back from companies offering data analytics positions instead.

I'm graduating after this Fall quarter. How do I quickly ramp up my skills to be ready for a job hunt?"

80zqhw,9,2018-02-28,How's CS/SE at Mcgill? Advice greatly appreciated,apartgill,mcgill,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/80zqhw/hows_csse_at_mcgill_advice_greatly_appreciated/,"Hey, I am a second year student at the University of Alberta who was interested in transfer to Mcgill for computer science/software eng. I am honestly fed up with the UofA's CS program so I was looking to see what your input was on the CS program at Mcgill. I am a relatively inexperienced programmer, having only picked it up after starting university for context, and am looking to work as a software engineer/developer upon graduation. I will list Some issues I have with the U of A and then hopefully you can provide feedback on these areas at Mcgill.

1) U of A lacks a co-op program, only having a internship program (glorified job portal in which pretty much have to find jobs independently). I see Mcgill doesn't have an internship/Co-op program either so must all the job/internship-hunt be done independently?

2) Do Silicon Valley companies, or other larger tech companies recruit from mcgill or is just primarily local/smaller companies? How common is it for students to land internships with ""Big 4"" companies? Obviously, i know ""star"" students/prodigal programmers can land internships at these companies regardless of university, but how is it for just the above avg CS student to be able land internships, esp at bigger companies?

3)(BIGGEST CONCERN) Poor quality of teaching at the U of A, with many profs seeming disinterested and just poor instructors, and essentially leaving students to figure it out for themselves. Additionally, the classes are very theory intensive and difficult, with minimal applications covered. How is the quality of teaching at mcgill, and is the course material more practical, in addition to just theory? I understand theory is important, however esp for courses like algorithms I feel at least some applications/programming would be useful. At the U of A, a lot of key courses, i.e. algorithms, Operating systems, networking are taught very poorly with long, outdated assignments; how are these at mcgill?

4)How is the student life? U of A is a commuter school, so was looking to see how Mcgill is for school spirit and campus life. Is knowing French a necessity?

5)I see there is a SE and CS major in CS. Would anyone be able to provide the differences between them? Also, are there software engineering project courses for both? How are the courses for more research/theory based fields like machine learning?

6) What is the approximate size of classes at Mcgill for cmpt 2nd year and on?

7) U of A classes seemed to be geared for those looking to pursue grad school, research(i.e very theory heavy as mentioned before, etc). Is this the same type of feel at Mcgill, or does it seem to prepare you for industry?

8)Would you recommend Mcgill overall, and do you think it has prepared you well for after graduation (job prospects/satisfaction, knowledge,etc)?

Thanks for taking the time to help me out."
80ztxl,0,2018-02-28,IBM vs. Shopify Internship,ImJustPro,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/80ztxl/ibm_vs_shopify_internship/,"I'm a second-year CS student at an unknown school in Canada and this is my first internship so I'm pretty excited about my options. I'm torn between these two.

&amp;nbsp;

IBM:

-$23/hour

-Toronto (Markham)

-$500 housing stipend (one-time)

-12 months duration

-4 months testing automation, then back-end development

-Wouldn't work full-time

&amp;nbsp;

Shopify:

-$28/hour

-Toronto

-$500 housing stipend (one-time)

-4 months duration

-Software Engineering

-Free lunches and awesome office

-Would love to work full-time after

&amp;nbsp;

They're both similar in pay/experience and both positions are working on stuff I like. I'm leaning more toward Shopify since it seems like an awesome work environment, and I'd be glad to work there full-time later.

The only reason I'm stuck at this point is the name value. IBM is obviously widely known, but I'm not sure about Shopify. They're a large Canadian company and well-known/reputed to our CS community, very difficult to get into (read that they only hire 0.3% of interviewees) and is considered a top company to Waterloo students (I don't go to Waterloo, just what I've heard) but I'm not sure if it's known by U.S. companies? The goal is to score a BigN internship for my next term.

Company A offered me an IT business analyst position. It’s in the location I’d like to be in, but they told me there’s no programming with the job. It paid $21.50. So not exactly what I want to do, but it pays well and is in the location I want to be. 

Company B hasn’t offered me anything, but the HR guy has been leading me on by saying everyone I interviewed with was super impressed but they don’t have the green light to make an offer to someone quite yet. There would be programming and it’s in an even better location that Job A. The pay is $15, so not quite as much as Job A. 

Company C also hasn’t offered me anything, but it’s exactly what I’d like to be doing. However, it’s nowhere near the location I’d like to be, and it pays $15-$20. 


Should I accept my current offer, or wait for something else? I have several applications out to companies that haven’t gotten back to me yet too, so it’s possible I’ll have more interviews soon. "

I don't know if I phrased it correctly so I'll try to explain:
