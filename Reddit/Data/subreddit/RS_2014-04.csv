Insights Please!,bringmysonicsback,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/21vpt1/thinking_of_switching_from_me_to_cs_insights/,"Hey guys I'm sure you answer these types of questions all the time but I wouldn't ask unless it was really bothering me.

I'm 2 years into my ME degree, almost enough for a minor, and starting to think that Computer Science might be a better fit. I have an internship where I do very basic programming and I enjoy it very much.

Basically, I want a bad ass job. I just want to be fascinated and challenged for a living with MINIMAL REPETITION. I'm told that CS opens more doors and the job security is certainly much better. Level of difficulty is no concern.

What do you guys think Stick with ME or take the ME minor and pursue CS?
What cool stuff could I do with a CS major and ME minor?

Thanks!"

Long story short I am taking a Java class and I am doing really well on it but I feel like I am not competent enough yet. We were assigned a Battleship game project and given 2 weeks to do finish it, I was able write it in a day but the problem is the code is…well not very good, most of it if not all is hardcoded. I have tried to improve it but it I just can’t think of a better way to write it. There is also the fact that I don’t have any experience while I see most of the people on this subreddit have had internships by their junior year. I am worried about my future...honestly I don’t know if I have what it takes to be a software engineer. Am I worrying too much? Or am I right in being worried? Sorry if I sound like an insecure college punk but I don't have any friends in the CS field and have no idea how I am doing in terms of having what it takes to learn how to be a developer."

I am looking for an internship but I am finding it hard to create a resume. I haven't really done anything extra-cirricular and I don't have any official experience in the field. 

- I'm currently a Junior (transfer student).
- My GPA is 2.4, 2.9 in my major, and 4.0 in my MIS classes.
- Associates degree in Graphic Design (3.0 GPA) and some transfer business classes in which I had a 3.4.
- In High School I was in Vocational school for Electronics. Did extremely well.  
- My only work experience is a retail job for the past 3 years. No real accolades but I'm cross-trained throughout the store and I was selected for a full-time position to interact with customers during our store's remodel. I really don't want to put down a retail job but it's my only work experience.

That's basically it. I haven't joined any clubs or anything because I basically work after classes and can't make meetings. I have experience with computers (As should anyone in a major dealing with computers) and have fixed computers for payment. 

I don't know how I could use what little I have and not have someone laugh as they throw my resume in the garbage."
21wd9a,4,2014-04-01,My resume is going to be mighty thin.,Historiun,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/21wd9a/my_resume_is_going_to_be_mighty_thin/,"I've been reading multiple online articles discussing the types of things you should and should not put on a resume. Specifically one for a undergrad seeking student employment or an internship, like me. They mention things like, ""List conferences you've attended, or had work presented at."", ""Give examples of projects you've worked on outside of school."", or ""List the various technical books you've read."". I paraphrase of course. 

This is all well and good, but I have a problem. I have exactly zero of those things under my belt. Reading the technical books is a relatively easy fix sure, but the rest? My main problem, I suppose, is that I'm getting started very late in the game. I'm 25, have a bachelors in history, and am currently working towards an associates in Computer Science with an emphasis in computer programming. I spent the time after my graduation desperately seeking pretty much any type of job I could find, that's a history degree for you, and working at various non cs related places. I realized I liked computer science and figured it would have much more opportunity for jobs and advancement than I currently had. So I enrolled at my community collage and got started. 

I do very much like this field. It's fun, challenging, and I'm not awful at it. However, I feel like I have almost nothing to offer. Maybe once I finish school, but I see these people all the time who either somehow stumbled into a cs job with no experience, or knew as much or less than me and got lucky. I just don't know what to do. Ideas? Suggestions? I'll take all I can get."

One of my professors is in charge of a lab group and was looking to hire an intern. 

He gave me a chance with an interview. I could tell by the end that I was not what he was looking for. A lot of that had to do with me starting the masters program in the Spring and only having one semester while the other applicants have two semesters. 

I didn't think a whole lot about it when I left. 

Yesterday I interviewed to be a Teaching Assistant for another professor in the same department. The interview was going well enough. Then the whole essence of my being sank. I didn't know how to respond when the interviewer mentioned something that happened in my other interview. 

While interviewing for the internship, I had a complete brain fart. Total lapse in thought. I have my BS in Computer Science and forgot what programming languages I knew. Totally blanked on the names. I thought I had played it off and it wasn't a big deal.

In my Teaching Assistant interview the interviewer mentioned how my other professor had interviewed someone that couldn't remember what programming languages he knew. I almost fell to the floor and hoped to blend in with the carpet when he said that. The TA interviewer did not remember the name of the person that was being interviewed for the internship (me) or he did and realized it after he made his statement. 

I have never done something so stupid in an interview, and then to hear it as a funny story from someone else a week later.... "

And apparently I'm the only Doctor on call.

Our computer patient in the most critical condition is being used by 4 different people.

They come in at different hours of the same day and some on different days then the others.

It shouldn't be that bad of a computer.  It's an Apple G5 Tower.  ""State-of-the-Art"" as my Boss put it.  

However, I don't know my patients technical-medical history.

It had suffered from abuse, that much I know, but it doesn't want to tell me what's wrong with it.  Even when I get close to finding out what's wrong, she just shuts down and I have to start all over.  

Poor girl.  

Must've been put through so much.

The Boss bought it when it first came out so the price of it when it was new ($2K and change) in 2006 is the reason we can't replace it, it cost so much in his view.  It was used by the Boss before being passed down to the children therapy center where for a while it was used by the children before being designated a work computer for graphic designers and interns. 

I don't know why I feel an affinity with this computer.  Maybe it's because she's a workhorse that's been ground down over the years by a Boss that used it for whatever he needed it for and neglecting its needs, just like us workers he employed.  

When I first met her she had no updates done on her, yet had 3 different versions of Adobe Creative Suite installed on her.  

She was timid, temperamental, and unpredictable. She lashed out at any sign of work wanting to be done on her, throwing up her rainbow wheel on almost every click.  Depending on how she felt that day, she would connect to the internet/network drives and then disconnect for seemingly no reason at all.

Every day at this hellhole I was bogged down by stupid projects that would never get done, had to listen to demanding clients who thought we were their in-house IT, or forced to try and fix an issue with a co-workers computer who couldn't get work done until it was fixed.

Not today.  

On this day I decided to dedicate the whole day to helping this poor girl. 

I cleaned out the crayon shavings inside her, uninstalled unnecessary applications, deleted non-essentials files to free up her hard drive, and even diagnosed her connectivity issues.  I gave her all her updates and even brought her up to the latest OS (which she was something like 2 full versions behind on) and gave her a restart.  If she failed to work better by the end of this, I couldn't justify my trying all day and the Boss would be pissed I hadn't worked on other things, but a fuck I did not give.

She started up, got to the desktop login, and after entering the credentials, she ran like I'd never seen her run before.

I took her random blinking light in front as her way of saying ""thank you"", smiled, and made my way back to my office.

&gt;ZD: ""So what's the status?""

&gt;Me: ""She's gonna make it.""

&gt;ZD: ""You know in the end they all get replaced, right?  With a shit version of the former compy to save money, but still..""

&gt;Me: ""It matters to me, because it mattered to her.""

&gt;ZD: ""Uhhh...ok.""

It mattered to her.

21xtq8,1,2014-04-01,Fiancee has been lying to me about a past relationship,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/21xtq8/fiancee_has_been_lying_to_me_about_a_past/,"My fiancee and I have been together for two years.  Before we started dating and before she and I even started hanging out, she would talk fondly of a certain friend from her school (we met during a summer internship.)  I asked if they had ever dated, and she said no.  No big deal, as I didn't care at the time.  We weren't interested in each other at this point, so I took her statement as honest.

We start dating about a month later, and about two weeks after we start dating she sat me down and told me that she and this guy actually had hooked up...and emphasizes they hooked up once.  I was upset that she lied, and I also felt the normal amount of jealousy that anyone feels when they hear stories about their sig-o's ex.  As time went by and our relationship progressed, I became okay with the idea that she had an ex-lover of sorts, but still uneasy about her lying.

Flash forward about a year.  She gets all nervous all of the sudden one night while we're about to go to sleep, and then tells me that she lied to me, she actually slept with this guy on more than one occasion.  It hurt...again hearing about her ex-whatever, but more this time because she had lied to me.  Her excuse was, ""I didn't want to upset you, that's why I didn't tell you.""  So, I ask more questions, and get what I think is the whole story.  But after that, I couldn't shake this feeling that she was still holding something back from me.  I tried to talk about my hurt feelings several times, but she would yell at me, telling me I need to forgive her and not hold on to it.  The real problem, she said, was that I wasn't forgiving her.

I should add at this point, this is the ONLY thing I've ever not trusted her.  She's always honest with me and is usually very straightforward with me.  I know she loves me dearly.  She's very good at showing it and telling me daily.  I feel very secure in our relationship, with this issue being the one thing that gave me even the slightest pause.  But, she told me what happened and kept insisting that I knew the extent of it.  It was the end of that saga (or so I thought...)

For the most part, I have remained relatively forgiving and forgetful about the incident.  I haven't let it bother me at all, and it's been nice moving to the same city and building our lives together.  

But yesterday, I'm taking a nap after she and I practice our wedding dance (we're getting married in June.)  I have a really weird dream that involves my fiancee and her ex-whatever.  In my dream, the two of them are working at the same place where I work.  

After I wake up, and get that weird feeling again that I used to get...that she wasn't being very honest with me.  So, while she's in the shower, I do something really dumb---I look through her phone.  I find 1) a grouptext with her friends where they ask her about it and she says straight up ""He doesn't know the whole story."" 2) An email between her and this guy from the summer when we met, after we started dating, telling him ""sorry for not being there to accept your call.  I was out drinking with my friends.""  That day, however, was a day that she and I left a work thing early and went back to watch a movie at her place.  There was no drinking.  No party.  No bar.  3)  An email to this guy at the end of the summer saying that she didn't want to be with him because his temper was just too much.  No mention of the fact that she was already telling me she wanted to be with me long-term.  No mention of me at all.  Very weird.

So now I'm left with this issue.  She lied to me, but the only reason I know is because I looked through her phone, which was a stupid thing to do and a breach of privacy.  I know that's stupid.  But I want to know what to do!  How do I talk with her about this.

I don't care about their past relationship, really, as long as she didn't cheat on me.  My problem is the trust.  All of the sudden, I'm calling into question my trust I have for this person who, up until yesterday, I thought was very honest with me.  It turns out she was lying about something we've talked about A LOT, and that makes me question how honest she is about other things as well.  It wasn't like she forgot, and it wasn't like this topic wasn't something we've talked about several times (mostly right after she told me.)

What do I do?

Please critique my resume and cover letter!,SirCloudbear,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/21ya06/i_am_late_20s_male_trying_to_get_back_into/,"Here's a brief background about myself since I think it's relevant.  I graduated from a top tier university with a double major in economics and mathematics.  I went to Japan to teach English for 2 years after graduation and decided to go to film school.  After I graduated, I did a couple of internships and freelanced as an editor but it was a struggle the entire time and I had to rely on my parents to help me with my finances from time to time.

After struggling for a few years, I have decided to fall back on economics degree.  I have been accepted to Masters in a work-and-study data analytics/big data program but I am currently trying to find work that's related to economics/data.  When I say *""related""*, I use that term loosely.

Truth is, it's hard to find relevant work in that area since I've been away from economics from so long, even though I got quite decent grades as a student and my professors are more than happy to provide me with a reference.

So far, my applications haven't been going anywhere, so I would really appreciate it if I can get some feedback for my resume and cover letter to get it into the best shape you can be.

----------------------
Also, I have some concerns with my resume that I would like your opinion on.
- I don't know if I should keep this line at the top ""Economics and mathematics major with a strong analytical, technical, and quantative skills.""  I feel like my resume is filled with all kinds of jobs, and it might be hard for recruiters to know what I want to do without it.
- As for my cover letter, although I have a wide variety of work experience, most likely none of them is relevant to the jobs that I am searching for.  This brings up an issue - specificity:  I don't know how to make my cover letter specific to the company and I don't know how to highlight my skills and experience and connect it to the job without it sounding like BS, since most likely they will be vastly different.

Thanks for reading my long post.  I am really grateful for any feedback I get.

I keep hearing all these kids getting rejected and denied from colleges and it scares me like crazy. Honestly, I am not a Straight A student.
My first two years of high school I was mostly B's. and B+s (nothing below a B). This year its been a few A's and B+'s once again. I think my gpa un-weighted is a 3.3 (my school does not weight the grades). I have taken 3 honors classes Sophomore and Freshmen year and am in 3 Honors classes this year. I am Pre calc for math as well as AP Chemistry this year. I guess Pre calc is considered one level up for most Juniors.

I think it is something about me and school, Not that it is hard to get A's, but I just never seem to pull it off. There is always that other kid in my class who is far stupider then me who has 4.0's. My course load is pretty rigorous compared to others I would say, but I guess its kinda of hard to describe.

I got a 720 on the Math, 650 on the reading and 650 on the writing on the Sat's, not super scored. This is my third year as a member of the First Robotics team which I absolutely love. 2nd year on the Varsity Lacrosse Team, (Freshman was on JV). Member of FBLA. I also have a full time payed internship this summer at a school software company. They develop software and websites for private schools. I only add this because not a lot of Juniors seem to have internships already. I have other stuff on my resume, those are the biggest things. I also develop iPhone apps and love technology.

This reason I list all this is I am curious to know what people think my chances are of getting into schools like Stevens Institute of Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Rochester Institute of Technology, Worcester Polytech Institute, Wentworth, and pretty much any other more STEM focused school. I want to become an Engineer.

For any still reading I just wanted some input on what people think my chances are, and what I should do to improve.

We have a startup in the works and are looking to get feedback on whether or not this is a service that people would use. If you don't mind providing us with some feedback, it would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR We are a service that will allow ""employees"" or ""interns"" to gain experience by working 3 jobs over the course of a year with 3 different companies that are looking to hire interns or co-ops.

The full explanation....

We are creating a site to help people who are looking to gain experience in a real world environment.  We realized that there is a market of people who either just graduated or have used online tools for education such as codeacademy, codeschool, or even online schooling and are having trouble finding jobs due to the lack of experience.  We want to help people gain experience in different companies so they can see different work cultures, understand work life, and help get their foot in the door.

As a student or intern, you get to work for a full year with these different companies.  They will provide projects/tasks over the course of 4 months.  If a company liked you, once the program is complete they can reach out and hire you.  Once you complete a job, there is a survey on the company to help other students get a feeling about the company.  The company will also grade you and you can see where they think you can use improvement.

As a company, you can get fresh blood into a position and give them projects that you may have dreamed about or just need to get done.  In this respect I can speak from experience, at my current job there is so much work that we need to get done, but its more ""nice to have"" rather than ""need to have"".  With our site, we will be able to match you with staff to help complete these projects.  They will bring fresh and new ideas and can help get these tasks done.  At the end of the program, you rate your employee and help them grow where you see they need help.  You then have access to a database of employees at your disposal to help find new hires that are strong in areas you are looking for.

This is the basic idea we want to implement.  There are more features such as mentoring and resume help, etc...  Why would you not want to be involved, what might tip you over the edge to join, have you had any experiences finding interns or internships?  Thanks for taking the time to read and if you have any questions or feedback, please let me know!"

I am 3rd year electrical engineering student and want to ask electrical engineers about career paths for EE majors who are actually in the fields out of school. As I only have a year and a quarter to graduate with a degree in EE, I have been thinking a lot about how EE career will be like after I graduate. 

When I was a senior in high school, I was good at math and physics so I decided I want to be an engineer. Then, I looked up types of engineering and, at that moment, I had absolutely no idea what each fields were about and which one would be best for it. I ended up choosing EE because I thought it would be most essential field in engineering career. I read so much about being an electrical engineer in US online which sounded very promising and hopeful. I'm from a family with a single mother who supports entire family, so could not go to 4-year university that I wanted to go when I was admitted after high school graduation. Instead, I went to community college for 2 years, did prerequisite requirements for transfer admission for same university and got in. After this spring, I will have one more year remaining. 

From my experience so far, I love/enjoy EE. It is really fun studying, designing, testing circuits and also learning about other cool things we can do with electricity such as signal processing, nano-technology, and so on. I am doing power concentration because I want to work with efficient energy technology. In particular, my dream job is to work on hybrid vehicle technology such as Tesla motors. 

One problem is that I keep hearing people talking about how tough it is for EE graduates to build career after they graduate. Unlike what I've heard before, everyone I talk to tells me that EE is no longer a field that can grow any further and I should change my career path if I can. I also talk to a lot of senior students in laboratory who tell me of their struggle to get a job or even an internship when they are about to graduate. If that's not enough, people tell me power concentration sucks compared to other EE concentrations. I really don't want to change my concentration because I am really interested in this particular area. All this really put me down and make me feel worried about my future. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to ask anyone with EE degree out there for opinions. Is EE really a bad career field that no longer expands? Is it true that it is extremely difficult to find EE jobs these days? Should I consider changing my concentration area to something other than power, or is power concentration really worth it? 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




**
I don't know if this is important, but I had nearly perfect GPA(3.97) for first two years before I transferred, and about ~3.7 GPA, currently at UW in Seattle. I'm doing three electrical power/energy concentrations(descriptions copied from department website below) at the same time, as well as a minor in mathematics. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Power Electronics and Electric Drives: 
Power electronics is among those areas of electrical engineering whose importance is expected to grow dramatically over the next years and decades. Whether one considers hybrid car technology, power supply solutions for data storage centers and high-performance computing, energy efficient technologies, or renewable energy - state-of-the-art power electronics is central to all designs. Electric drives provide important solutions to electromechanical energy conversion and control in broad areas such as transportation or robotics, but also in applications as diverse as hard disks or wind energy conversion.


Sustainable Electric Energy: 
The scarcity of fossil resources, high fuel cost, and environmental awareness are important drivers behind the strong interest in renewable energy. In the USA the capacity of installed wind power converters has increased by 50 % in only one year. Solar energy conversion and fuel cell technology also receive a lot of attention. This track is centered on the key contributions of electrical engineering to the area of sustainable energy.


Large Scale Power Systems: 
This area prepares students for careers in the electric energy industry with utilities, manufacturers, consulting firms and government agencies, and for graduate work in power systems research. Large scale power systems are the largest capital investment industry in the United States. The power system itself has been described as the largest man-made system in the world. Large scale power systems are fundamental foundational infrastructure for the high technology society in which we live. While the problem of efficient generation and delivery of electric energy is as old as the light bulb, the power industry is an avid early adopter of advanced technology to better solve the continuing problem.

I have taken my resume to 3 different ""career services"" and ""engineering advisors"" for critiquing, compared it to my peers' resumes (who have landed internships) and I don't know what the problem is.

Obviously I do not have any related work experience, so I listed projects that I've worked on in my classes and outside of my classes (1 game in Java and 1 algebraic expression evaluator in C++).

My major GPA is 3.92 and my cumulative is 3.08 (I am working to bring this up). I only list my major GPA on the resume which was recommended to me by several people including recruiters themselves. I have gotten an A in every single CS course up to data structures and algorithms, have aced every single programming assignment, and done fine in all of my math courses (Bs and A- mostly in Calc 1-3 and Discrete).

There are students in my class who have a GPA &lt; 3.0, no work experience, and struggle with their assignments, yet they land software engineering internships @ $25/h over the Summer. How?

I was told by my father who is an engineer in the oil industry that there is a small chance that I seem too qualified/arrogant/academic for internship opportunities and they are chucking my resume because they want students who can actually gain something. That seems like BS, but what do I know?

Any advice is greatly appreciated because I am not looking forward to being jobless upon graduation.

I landed an internship with a great tech company in Manhattan. They came across as ideally language agnostic during the interview and were more interested with both my overall level of competence when it came to CS and programming, as well as my passion and level of enjoyment in the field. They were also comfortable with the fact that most of my experience was in non-web development work. 

I've got a fair amount of back end experience with SQL, Python, Java, C, etc and am capable of picking things up really quickly because a programming language is just another tool a developer should be able to wield. 

I was wondering how I can best prepare for the work ahead of me, if there are any seasoned web developers out there. What are some of the major bullet points and concepts I ideally, as an intern, should be expected to pick up knowing that I'll be interning full time and will be assisting with development every day? 

I'm confident and not worried, but I just really want to make the most out of this experience. Apologies if this is too open ended of a question, but any advice is appreciated. "

My predicament is that I would really like to know if iOS development is something I would want to do as a day job, or just as a hobby. I figured that a summer internship would be a perfect taste of what it would be like, though now I just got the second offer that is 30 minutes away at nearly double the pay.

My first experience programming was using an illegal copy of Visual Basic to write a linear equation solver in middle school so I didn't need to do any homework for 2 years. Later, I joined my local FIRST Robotics Competition team in HS (the most complicated it got was doing some multithreaded C++ stuff on hour long, high pressure deadlines) and then went on to work in an internship for one of our sponsors the summer before my senior year to work on custom software solutions (that mostly included working with large portions of the .NET Framework and integrating them -- MVC4 to Entity Framework/MSSQL and beyond).
   
Now, I want to work on self-organizing cellular automata (among other things, although that's the most tangible part), applying this to cheap replaceable robots that can go out and mine asteroids. This, besides the obvious EE and CS requirements, also needs a unique blend of building the connections needed to accomplish this for a business later in life, meaning that I want to be steeped in enterprise before I turn 25.   

Honestly, I don't know which of the two to go to. Money currently isn't an issue, as both universities have given me large sums of needs and merit based grants. I'm in Colorado, so staying instate would be nice since I could keep my HS girlfriend and generally keep my surroundings stable. However, going out of state presents a unique opportunity to start from scratch and get away from the inertia that I've currently worked myself into, plus some crazier aspects of my family and not going to Uni with a majority of the people I went to HS with. Additionally though, I have gotten into CU-Boulder's Arts and Sciences Honors Program (Pre-Engineering), which would allow me to pursue a CompSci major and immediately begin working on research, if I understood the letter correctly. Currently, Boulder is a hotspot for startups as well. Yet, RIT has a co-op work study requirement that also aligns with my goals.

I am a 23 year old college graduate with experience working at non-profits, broadcasting, and the film industry. I gained much of this experience while I was in school through both internships and paid positions. I also maintained a high enough GPA at a well-respected university to graduate in three years and Cum Laude. I (naively) believed that if I worked my ass off while I was in school, I would not find myself un- or underemployed upon graduation. I wanted this because I read The Atlantic a lot and understand how pervasive this issue is to Millennials, in addition to our woes within this ""Hook-Up Culture"" journalists are so keen on these days.

I majored in Film Studies and English so, needless to say, I was not gainfully employed immediately upon graduating. I waited tables to pay my rent during school and continued to work in the service industry well after I finished school. I worked my way up the ladder within the local restaurant-world fairly quickly and became a bartender about 8 months ago. Not the beer/wine/mixed-drinks only sort of bartender, but the sort where one of my co-workers donned an anachronistic mustache and suspenders. I enjoyed this job. It was creative to a degree, I enjoyed reading and learning about booze and cocktails and I generally like being active at work, rather than sitting on a fucking computer looking at tiered wedding cupcake-cakes on Pinterest.

Which brings me, finally, to my point. Being a bartender, however much ""mixology"" you practice on the job, is not a widely respected career. I was depressed and began to abhor the people I had to wait on. I felt petty. I would hold grudges and find myself thinking about problem customers days after the fact. I had dreams of opening my own bar, but the capital necessary to start it would take me about a decade to acquired. I felt like I wasn't reaching my potential and that I was ""wasting"" my intellect. Which is really pretentious and I'm so sorry.

I accepted a position in the film industry as a production accounting clerk two weeks ago and left the service industry. And I declare every day on this job to be the most boring day of my entire life, as it is somehow, successively more and more boring. I only have about 4 hours of work a day. The rest of the time I spend asking my supervisors if they have anything for me to do and they say, ""no, enjoy it!"" Oh, thanks. I'm gonna have the time of my goddamn life rolling around in this windowless office on my big pink stability ball, listening to every episode of This American Life ever produced in this dimension. My boyfriend tells me I should write my much talked about and imminent novel, which critics are already calling ""barely started whatsoever"" but I can't write in this environment. I feel weird about reading a book or watching a film because I assume that I should maintain the illusion of doing something work-related despite the fact that I don't have fuck-all to do. I don't get a lunch break because lunch is catered to the office every day, so isn't that the worst. However! This job is only for a finite period of time. It will hopefully serve as a ladder to something more interesting within the industry (i.e., the Art Department? I guess?) and pays fairly well. These are its saving graces. Everything else is shit.

I am not really looking for someone to tell me to follow my heart and return to bartending. I don't necessarily want to do that for the rest of my life. Are there any bartenders or folks of a similar profession with a creative bent who successfully made their way in the 9-5 world? How do people with restless minds cope with downtime at work? Am I supposed to pretend I am doing something or just watch Trailer Park Boys with my office door open? Should I get a tattoo that says ""I have no idea what I am doing with my life"" or is it already that obvious?

TL;DR: Former bartender entering dulldulldull office world; dunno what I should do with my ridiculous amounts of spare time there; also, should probably invest in a seasonal affective disorder lamp"

222v5p,0,2014-04-03,Is GaTech right for me?,[deleted],gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/222v5p/is_gatech_right_for_me/,"Hey guys!

I know there's already an accepted student advice thread, but I wanted something a little more personal for me. 

I'm going to be a CS major and am currently trying to decide between UT and Georgia Tech. I visited Georgia Tech a few weeks ago and absolutely loved the campus but have read a lot of forums about how shitty campus life was and how everybody seems to be ready to jump out into I-85 (as well as other forum posts just saying those people are lazy pricks who don't plan their time out and etc). I'm not really sure where I fit in all of this, so I thought I'd give a little bio of me to all you Georgia Tech Redditors and have you guys tell me what kind of adjustments I'd need to make and such.

Academics:
I've never been a good planner. I tend to go with the flow and react to things as they happen. From what I've read, that mindset will kill you in Georgia Tech. I also don't put in the most effort for school, but I'm not just putting that downtime into video games!(though a lot of it admittedly is lol) I am the captain of my school's programming team and we just won our district competition and qualified for regionals, something that our last team could not do. I am also an intern at Cisco and am required to put in at least 10 hours a week for my internship. In addition, I have a girlfriend who wants me to spend time with her (crazy, I know). Though putting all excuses aside, the main reason I don't put as much effort in to my school work as I could is because I just plain don't care. The only subjects I really care about are my math and science classes, and that's something that's very attractive to me at tech. The emphasis on engineering classes and less of those icky humanities classes. It's not that I have anything against humanities, I just don't enjoy most of them as classes.

Social:
I'll be honest, I'm kind of a timid person. I'm getting better about it, but I still get really nervous around people I don't know/aren't familiar with. It's not that I can't talk to other people, I feel I can make decent conversation. I'm just kind of passive. My hobbies are kind of typical nerd stuff (anime, movies, vidya games, esports) but with my best friends I'm willing to do anything with them (tubing, shuffle phone, parkour, jamming out to gangnam style...in a mall...and then getting kicked out..........hwat).

Personal:
I'm a very indepent-minded person. I always prefer to try to seek out answers on my own before going to others for help (though I do get help when I need it) and I believe it is an individuals are responsible for how they feel. I'm also not too big on the whole authority thing. Not really the authority thing, but just someone abusing his/her authority so that he/she will look tough. I guess you could say I'm kind of stubborn too. Basically, I like to do things my way, but I don't blame other people when it doesn't work out the way I want it to.

Wow that was longer than I expected. But if you've read this far, might as well comment right? right? Anyways though, thanks for reading and I look forward to your responses :)

EDIT: How's the math program at GA Tech? I'm considering doing a minor/double major in math."

**Intro::** 

So I'm a student in the UK who until recently was a casual console gamer. About 4 months ago I sold my 360 as I hadn't played it in a couple months (left it at my parents house whilst I was at University) and still had an old refurbished macbook pro I'd inherited from my older brother for my casual gaming (v. causal=i had to play civ5 in strategic view). Unfortunately a month later my old shitty macbook kicked the bucket, leaving me with just my little Chromebook (bought because my old macbook had the noisest fans and the worst battery; no way i could really take it into University library. etc. etc).


Sooo...

**Usage::**

I'm looking to make the gaming change from console to computer, and am kind of looking to go as overboard on the graphics/gaming capabilities as I can (kind of a reward for all the pc games i never got to play). I've also done a little coding and programming, and have attempted a few mods, consequently I'm going to be playing around with a lot of skyrim mods, and no doubt be watching films on a monitor whilst also messing around with other programs. I enjoy fliming and have done a few events for the university, and work for a production company (summer intern) so it looks like I'm going to be a doing a fair bit of video editing for a while, so will need a fair bit of processing power and hard drive space.

**Model I'm looking at:**

In my novice-level understanding I thought this looked like a good package. Would be great to get some advice on it. Cheers guys!"

I need some advice. I'm 26, graduated 3 years ago in CS, and currently an SDE II at one of the big 4. My work is interesting. Friends are good. School loans paid off. Healthy savings. On paper life is good.

But I've had a goal for a while to do some long-term travel (6mo+) and I have this gnawing feeling that life is robotically passing by. I regret not doing a study abroad during college and during the summers I always had internships. When I look forward, I see potentially a mortgage and family which will make it more difficult. I'm also extremely interested in Oculus Rift, bitcoin, mobile, and a Javascript library I work on --- all of which could potentially be future careers --- but I barely have enough time for these side projects as it is and it takes a toll on friendships and past/potential relationships.

Has anyone taken some extended time off before? Was it easy to return to work again in the same position? Were there any unexpected upsides or downsides? I appreciate all advice, but especially from managers, recruiters, and people who have considered doing this before. Thanks!"

[Did you live?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj8jr6?context=5)|I don't know, I could still be in a coma.
[That is very interesting.  Do you think that he meant to kill you with the hit or just cut you?  The area of the cut leads me to believe he wanted to kill you but if so why would he only strike once?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj8b7s?context=5)|You know, I have no idea. I was told that he couldn't be charged with ""attempted murder"" because he didn't say anything along the lines of ""I want to kill you"".  But I figure, if you come at someone with that large of a weapon, you have nothing in mind other than taking that persons life. But like I said, I have no clue. 
[Did you have to cover all of the medical bills yourself? Also how was the recovery process after you woke up? Any nerve or muscle damage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj8gte?context=5)|The state paid for about 15k on a 200k medical bill. I think I will be in debt my whole life. I tried to see about suing him, but he had nothing, like I said, it was all in a bad neighborhood. 
[Have you thought about changing countries? Maybe Canada? Fuck that debt.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgje60b?context=5)|I want to move to Norway.
[Have you thought about one of the online fund campaigns such as gofundme.com? I am sure that the reddit community would offer some support even if it is only a portion of the bills for a short time. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj8xil?context=5)|I wouldn't mind something like that, but I don't think I could ask for money for something that is not someone else's fault. It's not their problem. 
[Sorry, I don't mean to derail your thread or get all political but if someone TRIES TO MURDER YOU in the US, there's no way you can cover the damages if that person happens to be poor? That seems mental.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjigua?context=5)|In my case, it is sad but true.

[Did Jo Jo ever have a bizarre adventure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjhgh5?context=5)|Once we left out of town, and him, my other dog, and our cat tried tracking us down across the country. There was a mountain lion, a mean animal clinic, and a lot of montages.  
[I enjoy your choice of dog names. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjyml4?context=5)|Thank you. Jo Jo was originally Cujo from the book and movie. And Yoshi (AKA Yo Yo) was chose because I wanted a Chinese name for a Chinese dog. I love Mario, so it was decided. 
[Did you get him from a shelter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjc0ia?context=5)|No, just someone had a liter that they couldn't keep. So they were about to probably hit a shelter. So, sort of. 
[So what you are saying they were bound for home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjnnn7?context=5)|Somewhat of an incredible journey.

[How did it not chop through your jugular? It looks like it went straight through. How close was it to cutting your jugular? Did it hit it and not cut it but just pull on it? Sorry about all the questions, I'm just incredibly surprised it didn't cut clean through it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjkaok?context=5)|I was told it was centimeters. The ""lucky to be alive"" and ""It was a miracle"" were phrases thrown around. I make light of it, but I know how lucky I am.
[Was this the first time you have been cut with a machete in the neck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgja825?context=5)|Yes, but not the first time almost being decapitated.

He better have been arrested. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj87ne?context=5)|He was arrested, I think that same night, or in the early morning. He was charged with 2 counts of agg assault with a deadly weapon. He's serving a 15 do 10 and banished from the county. 
[Banished? Wow. Well I hope you are okay. Any lingering effects besides the scar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj8iyc?context=5)|I can scratch behind my ear, and feel it in my lower back, and visa versa.

[Who found you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj9cr8?context=5)|A neighbor. It happened right  behind where I was living. They were having a BBQ and hear the shouting. When I was walking away, they called me over (At the same time they called the cops) and told me to lay down it was bad. I didn't think so because it didn't hurt. Then I saw all the blood and decided to listen to them. Within the next 30 mins I was at Grady Hospital in Atlanta. Great medical team by the way.

Thanks OP. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjo3vj?context=5)|It is near a place called Douglas county.

225p0g,3,2014-04-03,Thoughts on reneging a job offer?,kitch6041,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/225p0g/thoughts_on_reneging_a_job_offer/,"I'd like to hear an outside perspective on a situation that I'm currently in:

As part of my Commerce degree, I interned at a company (Company A) and was offered a full-time job by them upon graduation. I decided to turn it down and look elsewhere because I was looking to relocate to a bigger city.

I then interviewed at a number of firms in bigger cities but did not receive any offers. During that time, Company A offered me a new job at their head office (which is in a larger city), a more senior position and significantly higher pay. They are a very small company and had lost several key employees in the previous few months, thus they really needed to hold onto their existing employees as hiring and training is a long and relatively strenuous process for this particular job.

I accepted Company A's offer this past Friday and was looking forward to my new role there. However, on Monday, one of the firms (Company B) that I had talked to previously unexpectedly offered me a position.

Company B is much larger than Company A, is in a different industry, and has offered better compensation, benefits, etc. Working for Company B would be a great way to start a completely new career path in a major city, but i would be one of only 50,000 employees, whereas at Company A I would work as part of a smaller team playing a more integral role in the organization as a whole.

My main reservation about reneging is that Company A has bent over backwards for me during this period and seem relieved to have me back on board. Also, by accepting they have stopped looking for other candidates and me reneging their offer would leave them short-handed. More importantly, it would be disrespectful to people that have supported me and expressed a sincere interested in keeping me.

Would it be awful of me to renege Company A's offer? I could probably move to Company B's city at some point in the future, but at the same time I think I would kick myself for not accepting Company B's offer.

I'd be interested to hear others' thoughts on this. 

**TL:DR: Am considering reneging a job offer from a very small company where I previously did internships, which would leave them short handed and likely result in burned bridges. My alternative is to work for a much larger company in an unrelated industry that I am eager to gain experience in. Should I risk the downside of reneging to work for the other company?**"

I don't have any financial background, nor a degree (but 2 years of college), so I'm not their ideal candidate. I was hired to provide some additional support for them during the tax season. So far I've gotten nothing but compliments and absolutely crushing it (it's not the hardest job.) I love the firm. The people are great, they treat their employees right, they're growing fast, and I can definitely see myself there in the future.

It's getting towards the deadline/the end of my official role (get them in) and everything is hectic, and stressful. However, a senior partner said I was doing a great job, asked me about my future plans, and hinted at sticking around after the tax season is over. I mentioned that I'm heading back to school to finish up my degree, and he mentioned looking into an internship. They have several different areas that I would love to be involved in, especially their wealth management/investment division. I want to get a sit down and talk things out, but it's so busy, that there really isn't any time.

I never really intended on getting a career in the financial world; I was actually headed back for chemical engineering with a minor in finance. I mention this to the guy, and he said that it wasn't the strongest of cases, and that they were looking for people who would want to establish a career there. I definitely would like to do that, and would even be willing to pursue a degree in finance, economics, etc.

What would be the best way to approach the situation? I still have some pondering and figuring out to do, but not much time left before my time is up. "

226fuo,27,2014-04-04,I wrote some stuff about Americans going to UK universities that you might find interesting,Paiev,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/226fuo/i_wrote_some_stuff_about_americans_going_to_uk/,"I wrote a comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/225tpm/i_dont_know_if_this_is_the_right_place_but_what/cgjse4p) on a small thread on /r/PersonalFinance, responding to somebody who was asking about doing his undergrad in the UK. It's a pretty long comment and I thought it might be interesting to some people here, so I'm cross-posting. Hopefully you find my advice and experiences to be at least somewhat interesting. 

Here's the comment text:

&gt;I'm actually an American doing my undergrad in the UK. It's a route that I probably would not recommend to very many people, actually. Some things to think about:

&gt; * As everyone has said, finances are the biggest question mark. It ain't cheap. I pay in the 40-45k USD range per year for tuition + housing, and I'm grandfathered in to the rate from before the tuition increases a few years ago-- if you started now at my university you'd be paying a bit north of 50k USD a year. This is in the same ballpark as private American universities, which are generally around 50-60k+, but of course the latter have financial aid.

&gt; * Financial aid consists of loans. The university won't give you any money, and getting external scholarships or grants will be very difficult, so you're pretty much stuck with loans. You can take out Stafford loans for around 5k USD a year, and your parents can take PLUS loans up to a variable amount depending on their credit, income, etc. These two + some college savings are sufficient to cover my costs, so I'm not sure what the options are beyond that; I imagine you'd have to head to private lenders. 

&gt; * On the flip side, degrees in the UK [edit: in England, anyway; Scotland is typically 4 years] are in general a year shorter than those in the USA. Degree length is variable depending on what you want to study. Typically arts subjects are 3 years, while science subjects are 3 or 4 or either. The setup is generally 3 years for a bachelors or a fourth year for a masters. You'd have to look it up for your specific subject.

&gt; * Speaking of which, in the UK you apply for a particular course of study and then study exclusively those subjects (this is also why degrees are shorter: no distribution courses / core curriculum / gen ed). Changing courses is difficult; you can sometimes change to a related course after your first year (e.g. I have a friend who went Maths &amp; Computer Science =&gt; Maths only), but in general changing courses requires reapplying and restarting. This is a huge, huge difference from the USA; while British students have been focusing in on a few subjects for the last couple years of their secondary education, many Americans don't really know what they want to study in college, or they think they do but change their mind once they actually take a few courses in it or in something else that they like better. [edit: in Scotland there's a bit of room for studying things outside your course of study, so this applies especially to England (and I think Wales too, but don't quote me on that... no idea about Northern Ireland). Changing courses in Scotland will still be nontrivial, though.]

&gt; * The current UK government is pretty hostile to foreigners (the understatement of the century). I mean, look at [this](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02628/tory-van-620_2628143b.jpg). It's an ad the Home Office put on some vans recently. They've been increasing immigration restrictions and you just generally will not feel very welcome from the government. This will only be a factor when applying for a student visa and when figuring out what to do after graduation, but the latter one is pretty important, and it's something to keep in mind.

&gt; * UK universities cater towards UK students. Obvious, right? But that means that if you're looking to return to the USA, you may well find them much less helpful than you'd like. Campus recruiting events will be filled with UK-based employers and not very many US-based ones, so you're mostly on your own looking for a job in the US. And there will be little guidance or preparation for heading to an American grad school. This is a really important bullet point that I really did not appreciate before coming here.

&gt; The financial reasons combined with the rigidity of course of study and the poor US connections are why I would not recommend UK undergrad to most people. The simple fact of the matter is that a comparable-quality US school would probably serve you better.

&gt; In my case, I still think heading to the UK was probably my best option. But the UK-school scale has a lot of factors tipping in its favor for me that the general student won't have:

&gt; * I'm studying a joint course with two subjects (math &amp; computer science) that I had gained significant exposure to in high school. I had a pretty good idea of what college-level study in these subjects was like, and I was confident that they were what I wanted to do. Most people are not this fortunate. Studying two subjects also allows my interests between the two to fluctuate a bit more, and I go in phases of being more focused on math and more on CS. Studying a single subject gives a bit less flexibility here.

&gt; * I'm at a top UK university. This is a pretty big factor. In the USA, almost everywhere in the UK will be largely unknown, and I think the brand value of your degree will drop off very rapidly past the absolute best unis. This won't affect the quality of education, but it will affect all the things that your university's name is relevant for (prestige and its social and employment consequences). American employers are much less likely to think a degree from Durham is worth any more than a degree from Plymouth even though the former is a far better university (this should maybe be in the warnings section above...). Anyway, the upshot is that I'm fortunate that being where I am mitigates a lot of this.

&gt; * I was able to get into a significantly better school in the UK than I would've been able to in the USA. Not super proud of this one and it's not something I like advertising, but I never did my homework in high school and had a crappy GPA. However, I had high SAT, SAT II, and AP scores, and it turns out that test scores are all most UK universities really care about (particularly AP scores), due to it being much easier to compare them to their A-levels (or Highers; don't want to leave out my Scottish friends) system. I never even submitted my GPA or high school transcript, and nobody ever asked. Crazy, right? I really lucked out and totally gamed the system. Happily, I got my shit together a lot more once I got out of my house and was on my own. Maturity and all that. I'm now on track for a high first class degree result (UK has degree classifications instead of GPAs), and was in the top 10% of the year last year. So I've turned it around quite a bit since high school.

&gt; * I knew I could get a good, high-paying CS job after graduation, so I was fairly unconcerned about my own student loans. I'm not graduating for another year, but I'm confident that this was a good judgment given my experience searching for internships so far.

&gt;**tl;dr**: Doing your undergrad in the UK is in most cases imprudent, and I would recommend it to very few people due to finances, rigidity of course of study, and poor industry connections. I only think it's a good choice if you're in a similar position to what I was: attending a top university, have good post-graduation prospects, and have good reasons to believe you know what you want to study.

I've been sorta half-heartedly looking for internships (applied to google and fb and some others with a ""deferral"" from google until fall and no response from fb/others) that haven't really come through, and I've been feeling some pressure to find something to do so that I don't spend around three months doing nothing.

To top it off, my telebears is coming up in the next week, and the classes that make sense to take next, cs70, cs61c, and ee20, seem like they would be a tough combination to handle..

I've thought about taking cs70 over the summer and taking cs170 or something in the fall, and that would give me something to do, but that doesn't quite solve my doubts about taking 3 tough classes at the same time.  Plus, I'm not sure if I want to keep on grinding through without much of a break between classes.

Anyways, that's my situation.  If anyone here has been in a similar situation or could give me some advice as to what to do regarding classes for next semester and summer plans, I would appreciate it greatly :D"

Unsure how to go about it.",boudica88,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2277lo/getting_noticed_at_work_and_earned_some_favors/,"So I've been working as a receptionist for a salon branch of a fairly small corporation in a major city that handles a couple of enterprises. Over the last eight months, I've solidified myself as one of the best receptionists in my salon, but also proven I have a number of other talents (I was a publicity intern before I came to this company, I wrote a number of press releases for that group, and my communications skills are ridiculous). I've volunteered time on the side to help with some licensing issues for employees, run errands for practically everyone in the company, and pretty much everything I've heard directly or behind my back has been glowingly positive. My boss has actually said that he prefers my style of customer service to his own because he can tell I actually care.

Anyhow, the company is opening a new branch for several of its enterprises this summer, and I've heard that they're planning on expanding into several other major cities in the next five years. Right now, the corporate team seems pretty small; other than the individual owners of the branches, I only know of four or five people who actually work strictly for corporate to keep everything in order (president, VP, operations, marketing, one person per major role). 

Everyone in the company seems to have known everyone else for years and years, goes to the same parties, etc., and a few people where I've worked have promised to put in a good word for me so I can hopefully someday move beyond being a phone jockey. I've also heard the president of the company has expressed some curiosity in meeting me after people at my branch talked me up. I also just learned we're alumni of the same university. 

So I've found out who coordinates the marketing and publicity materials (flyers, newsletters, social media, all that jazz) for our company, and it's all done by one person. It seems to me if the company's really growing this quickly, that's likely going to change.

My question is, how should I go about approaching the marketing/PR guy for our company? The company itself is extremely casual (it's style and wellness-focused, so it's pretty much entirely composed of gay men in expensive jeans with impeccable hair), and one of the stylists at my branch who owes me a favor said he could text the guy for me or mention me over drinks. So I'm wondering, should I just send out an email to him introducing myself? I was thinking I could volunteer my services as an apprentice or intern of sorts and express an interest in how he composes our materials and manages the social media that we have. I've got experience with InDesign, I've run a blog or two, and I'm pretty sure if I phrase it right he'd be thrilled to have a little back-up for all the work that's coming our way.

Alternately, should I just wait until I have a chance to organically have a conversation with either him or the president? I've already met the VP a few times, the president visits our branch frequently, but I've never seen my marketing guy anywhere (though I understand he's extremely friendly and approachable).

I am not sure though if i would get another opportunity to do work over the summer b/c i have not heard from the other multiple REU's and internships that i applied to. Do you think i should accept the REU offer or pass on it and hope with my low gpa an internship contacts me. First option gives me an opportunity do test out research, see if i like it and guarantees something i can add to my resume while the other option is a bigger risk with a better reward(looks better on my resume) if i decide to into industry.

Um, ok. He's an intern for Graphic Design sooo...

&gt;ZD:""Yup. Server.""

I love my Dell PowerEdge T410.

It's built like a tank, very reliable, and the front of it looks like a piece of armor from Batman's suit.

It was the gift given to me by the IT tech's who worked here before me to be able to brave the harsh battlefront of office users and the outrageous demands of our ruler, Boss.

This isn't happening...this is NOT happening!

I figured I could dual-boot it and use Windows for my work and leave Linux on it so it can still act as a server.  I know how to do that kinda stuff. Do you need it?""

I wasn't even mad at this point.  The server had a monthly image backup.  I could restore it, but anything after the 1st of this 6th month was pretty much gone.

trying to explain that it was ok because he knows what he's doing.  

&gt;Me:""Yes.""

I didn't even let him save anything. I shut it down, disassembled it and brought it back to my office to fix.

Intercom buzzes:

&gt;Boss:""Captain, how long is it going to take to fix the office server?""

&gt;Me:""I have an image backup of the server, I can restore it, but we may lose a couple of weeks worth of work...""

I wanted to tell him he's an asshat for letting the kid take my server. I wanted to tell him the intern is an anally regurgitated seminal fluid bubble.

But i didn't.

&gt;Me:""...depending on how much damage he did could be a day, maybe more.""

&gt;Boss:""Well that's not good.  Ok, see what you can do, but in the meantime could you get Intern a computer from the basement that he *can* use?""

Oh yes....yes I can.

&gt;Me:""Sure thing.""

I went to the basement. 

The Boss doesn't like to buy anything new no matter how bad we need it, and he never throws anything out.

The row of dead or outdated comps were labeled as such.  

""Dead"" or ""Old"" were the labels on the top.

The oldest, slowest one I could find was going to be his, but which one?

Then I saw it.  

A PowerMac G4 Desktop....and the ridiculously 90's cool spacey-looking monitor that it came with.

This. This will become his.

The look on his face when I brought it upstairs was priceless.

I recently got my PhD in CS (Data Mining, Data Visualization, Image Processing and some Big Data).
I was offered a Postdoc position at a research institute in Brazil, but I've been wanting to immigrate to Canada for the last 6 years or so.

The only reason I still have not applied is I lack the ""work experience"".
I have 6 years of full-time experience (R&amp;D, programming, data mining), but it was a internship sponsored by a scholarship program, and it seems to not be ""valid"" work experience for immigration purposes.
I have ""working"" experience in English, and an intermediate level in French (just a little bellow Quebec's requirements).
I was interested in living in Manitoba, but the local process requires me to know someone from there, which I don't.
I have no fear of living up in the north if there is a faster/safer way to move to Canada.

Soon I'll have my Italian citizenship (I believe less than a year), and I'll be able to move to Europe, but I'm not sure where I would be able to get a STEM work there (I've read they don't hire easily if you have no local work experience). I would probably live in GB, Portugal or France, as I can speak their languages, but I would love to learn any other language if it would help me to get a job.

Lastly, there is the US.
Frankly speaking, the US seems like an awesome country to live once you have a decent job and is debt-free, but I just can't find a way to move there.
They seem to be hiring STEMs, but only those with an american PhD, so I'm not sure how to apply or become hire-able for the US market without being in the US.

So, I probably failed in trying to be brief.
Sorry about that.
I would like the hear your suggestions, there are some of you who know quite a lot about immigration possibilities for those countries, and I would really like to learn about it :)"

The shop was small, run by an owner whose computer experience wasn't enough to realize that he should never, EVER touch a computer. I could write about his derps for days, oh the things we had to fix that he broke...anyway, we were located in a small strip mall in the western part of the state, right down the road from a buffalo farm (oh the smells). This was around 2000-2002 for reference. We had three employees counting me - a computer/printer guy (think classic *nix dude, beard, tall, suspenders, kinda anti-social, who describes his apartment as ""lampless, because my computer is the only light I need"" - guy was scary brilliant and hilarious and I learned more from him in one summer than I did in a year at my private college, but I digress...), a network guy (my roommate at the time, and we had recently started a home networking/itty bitty local ISP out of our house), and me - their gal friday, who did a little bit of everything (except printers - nope nope nope) but mostly web design and networking stuff.

Our typical clientelle involved a lot of students and professors from the area (quite a few colleges were local), some local small businesses, and mostly involved a lot of ""remove pornography/virus, rescue files"" and trying to convince people to upgrade from windows 3. Oh, deltree, how I miss thee.

Anyway, one day a woman brings in a computer, and *nix guy is being really fiddly with some laptop, and CluelessOwner was busy doing ""accounting"" (aka, corrupting the lovely quickbooks I set up for him) so I go out to explain our pricing to her. It was tiered, depending on multiple factors. You paid more if you had ME on your machine (the 1 hour diagnostic for ME cost more than paying us to put a fresh win2000 on it). You paid more if it was a Compaq laptop. That sort of thing. People never blinked at how seemingly arbitrary it was, but who knows.

So I ask her what seems to be the problem and she tells me her computer just won't start - push the power button, and nada. I ask her if it makes any noise, and she claims no. OK, maybe a bad connection, who knows, I'll figure it out once I open it up. She informs me that it's heavy, so can I please get it from the car for her because she almost dropped it loading it in to bring to us. So I head out to the car to get it and she opens her trunk and inside is...a square-shaped black trash bag. OK...so she wrapped her computer in a trash bag. I carry it in through to the back (almost dropping it myself it's so damn slippery) and set it down on one of the tables. I pull the bag off just enough to see it's a relatively new looking dell, and go out to take her diagnostic fee (standard, $75).

She leaves, and I head back to hook it up and see what's going on. I pull the bag off and notice...something is off. Something is just...not right. And then it starts. The sneezing. I can't stop myself, and the next thing I know my asthma is acting up, and then the smell hits me and I'm wondering WTFITY is going on here. Everyone else starts coughing and sneezing and we're all WTFing at each other.  I turn the machine around and see...black fuzz coming out of every hole in the rear of the machine.

The entire computer. MOLD. Just...it was full of MOLD. Horrible, terrible, possibly deadly mold - we had to quickly carry the thing outside and open all the doors and put fans on in the hopes of getting the stink out of the office.

As soon as we've put it outside I call her and leave a message informing her that her computer is a biological hazard, and she has 24 hours to pick it up before we take it to the dump.

She called back (after hours) and left a message saying that's fine, go ahead, and asking if we had any ""sales"" going on since she really needed a computer for work. Uh...not for you, you almost killed us all.

**TL;DR - nice lady brought in computer for repair, it was full of BLACK DEATH and almost killed us all.**

Sorry to post here with my problems, but I'm just having a hard time and I'm looking for advice from those who have been through this process. 

Basically... I was rejected from all (still waiting on one, but I assume it'll be reject at this point) of the schools I applied to for a master's degree in computer science. I thought I was a decent applicant with 2 software internships and a summer research position in the field I want to study, in with reference letters from two pretty well known researchers currently working in the field. The field is a bit specialized, but I figured people applying for master's will probably not be experts at this point, which I thought wouldn't put me out of the contest. My grades aren't great, I have an overall GPA of around 3.2 but in my last two and a half years I've always been around 3.7. 

I'm wondering if I should even bother trying to improve my application to try again next year. I know I have a job lined up if I don't go to grad school but I really love science and I can't see myself working a 9-5 in software for the rest of my life. My plan is to graduate this summer, but go back to school to take a couple graduate courses and possibly get a research spot, but this will delay me at least a year. I'll also write the GRE and apply to a few more schools.

So my question is, how did you motivate yourself to try again and what did you do to improve your application with the time off?

Out of my admitted schools, I have come down to two realistic options: University of Florida or University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am going into computer science, and both schools seem to have respected Computer Science programs. 


University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign:

UIUC seems like the better choice because it is ranked higher than UF (UIUC - 5th; UF - 47th) for its computer science program. It seems like an amazing school, but the only issue is that UIUC is my out-of-state option. Four years at UIUC would leave me graduating with $180,000 in debt. And i know that this a dumb reason, but the idea of going to college out-of-state is much more appealing.

University of Florida:

UF is the safer option. UF is my in-state option, only 72 miles away from my hometown. I will most likely be able to graduate from the university debt-free, as the university is giving me much better financial aid as well as Florida Bright Futures helping with payment. Unlike UIUC, I will be enrolled in the Honors College and taking residency in the Honors College Dorms. 
Both options are very appealing to me in different ways. I know that the $180,000 of debt seems extreme and absolutely insane, but I wanted to see if anyone out there would suggest a reason why this debt may seem worth it.

The factors that are most important to me are the curriculum, the internship opportunities while in school, and the career opportunities right out of college.
I know this post may seem dumb and the answer may seem obvious, but I want to get as much advise as I can before I make this decision. I most likely will only make this decision once, so I hope to make the right one.

Should I accept the offer, or take my chances and try to intern at another company that is more prestigious / better fitting?

**My background**: I'm currently a freshman at a ""public ivy"" studying Computer Science and Economics with a minor in Applied Mathematics. I'm a good student (3.8 GPA) and will be interning this summer at a 35 person Data Analytics startup doing software Development. I basically got the Deloitte offer through being invited to the Deloitte NextGen Summer Program (4 day conference).

**Long Term Goals**: I'm a techie / coder with a interest in business and entrepreneurship. My dream is to one day run my own tech-startup or have a C-level position at an established tech company. I most likely want a MBA (80% chance), but I might decide in the future instead to get a Masters in Computer Science or Supply Chain Management (20% chance). Either way, I want to find my way into Silicon Valley doing something more than simply just coding.

**Question elaborated**: I don't know whether to take the offer or not. Deloitte is a big name, but I don't know how respected a tech-consulting position would be if I wanted work for big-name tech firm like Google later on. Also, I don't know how hands on it will be and how much soft work the internship would be. Also, I don't know how exciting it would be (compared to a tech internship which are notorious for being really fun, amazing perks, and learning a lot).

If I didn't accept the offer, I would try my best to intern at a large, competitive tech firm (Google,Microsoft,Amazon,Facebook, etc.). However, these internships are tough to get (I estimate a 50% chance of landing one at these top 4 companies) for Summer 2015. Decent chances, but not when compared to my 100% at Deloitte. Plus, I would spend a lot of time interviewing and searching during the school year for the tech internship which could get stressful. If I didn't land it at the big 4 (50% chance), any tech company I intern at won't be significantly better or different from where I am working this summer in terms of diversifying my own experience and resume. Due to my career confusions, my goal in the next 3 summers is to intern at a small company / startup, a large tech company, and a large finance/consulting corporate.

Any advice for my situation? Also, any advice for the long term? "

Should I apply?,[deleted],ufl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/22any2/do_i_have_any_chance_at_getting_accepted_should_i/,"I'm an 11th grader aiming to study biological sciences + pre-med. I really screwed up in my first early in high school and I've been working to improve, I'm scared I might not have done enough. I still have a summer and 12th grade left.

Any help and insight is massively appreciated.

Test scores:
SAT: 2020, retaking in May aiming for at least a 2200.

ACT: Taking this summer. Based off SAT score + general abilities I can get above a 30.

AP exams: All 4's and two 3's. 5 in AP Bio which is what I'd like to study in college. Expecting similar results for future AP exams.

GPA/Grades/Classes: Weighted ~3.1. My performance in school has been continuously improving since the start of my high school career, but has increased the most rapidly and drastically during my 11th grade year. At this rate, I hope to have something AT LEAST in the mid 3s by the time I apply. I am unsure of my unweighted GPA at the moment, it is not great, however it is and has been improving. Some things to consider:

I. Grades have improved since the start of high school.

Unweighted average: Low C(9th) -&gt; Solid B(10th) -&gt; High B(first half of 11th grade)-&gt; All As (currently, 2nd half of 11th grade) -&gt; All As (expected summer and senior year)

II. I've had an extremely rigorous course-load. Every high school class I've ever taken with the exception of art and P.E. have been Honors, Pre-IB Honors, or AP. I will continue to do this for the rest of my high school career, I've mentioned below how I've signed up for 6 APs and 3 Honors classes this upcoming summer + my senior year. Because I am currently making As in similar classes, I expect to do so for the rest of my high school career.

Hopefully my rigorous course-load explains part of my low GPA as well or my drive to challenge myself

III. I've been taking extra classes (Honors and AP) online in addition to my school work-load, these have helped my GPA, I've only made As in my online classes and will continue to do so. Hopefully this reflects my desire to do more than what is necessary to achieve things, and my ability to continuously challenge myself.

IV. I've advanced very quickly. Finished 99% of my graduation requirements before I'm even a high school senior.

APs that I've taken
Biology, World History, Human Geography, Microeconomics, US History, Statistics, European History, Language and Comp, Literature and Comp

APs I'm taking this summer and in my senior year, already signed up:

Psychology, Physics, Calculus, Enviro, Latin, Gov, Maybe Computer Science and Chem if I have time

Honors classes for senior year:

Anatomy, Physiology, Marine Bio

Note: Cleared up required classes so I can take mostly science-related classes as a senior. They align with my personal interest/passion as well as career plans. Also will be a teacher's assistant for a year.

Extra curricular:

**Weaknesses:**

1. Nothing special in terms of clubs. 2yrs ModelUN + JCL, 2 yrs JCL, with no real achievements or recognition.

2. No awards except for 1st place district History Fair

3. Symphonic band and Jazz band in middle school, probably doesn't count since I quit in 8th grade.

4. Would consider being active in clubs next year but I'm going to be pretty busy with schoolwork and nothing at school really suits my interest. Will consider picking a musical instrument back up and sticking to it. Would consider getting a paid job.

**Strengths:**

200+ hours of diverse volunteering in my field of interest as of 11th grade, hoping to hit 300+ hours by the time I graduate, lots of stuff done and lots of stuff learned. Can reflect on these experiences through writing. I've been told by my teachers and guidance counselor that my dedication, hard work, and passion for what I do outside of school is well above what is standard. This might be a testament that I'm not as lazy as my GPA would suggest.

1. Volunteer every summer at a large hospital, did extra hours and was chosen specifically to make a video, Power-Point presentation, and informational packet for all incoming volunteers. From what I've heard this was pretty hard to get accepted into.

2. Volunteered at a small school clinic in a low-income county about 2 hours away, assisting elementary school aged children with health check-ups. Done one summer, 1-2 times a week for the entire day, 6am-4pm. When the clinic was slow, I went to different class rooms to help the teachers teach the kids.

3. Help with Dad's public health research projects. Both in clinical and academic settings. I love public speaking, my upcoming task for this is traveling to different institutions around the state (churches, schools, etc) delivering talks to inform people about breast cancer, why and how they should get checked, etc. Also helped with the filmography and post-production components of advertisements made regarding these topics. Learning how to write grant proposals from my dad who has pulled in millions of $ for research funding.

4. Confirmed that I will shadow a surgeon and observe surgeries as well as a non-invasive physician this summer and intern for hospital executives who run the hospitals.

5. Will be observing and participating in university level medical and health classes (not dual enrolling), to get a feel of how college classes are structured and their atmosphere. Hopefully this will be beneficial to me.

6. I tutor kids with schoolwork and SAT stuff for free.

7. No sports, although I've made great improvements on my personal health and fitness which I could possible reflect on positively as a testament to willpower and hard work and self improvement.

8. Will assist my dad in pro-bono medical help of underprivileged rural inhabitants in a third-world country sometime before the end of this year. He does this on his personal time and I want to help. Beyond the scientific stuff, I feel like this will be a humbling and informative experience on the reality of how people live, which is vastly different to how I live. Hopefully I can feel more worldly and understanding after this. I hope to reflect this in writing.

9. Took a huge responsibility with my younger brother as I've been growing up. Completely by myself, I've taught him how to read and write and do math well ahead of his school pace to put him in an advanced position, I tutor him with homework nightly, and he's now in the Gifted program at school and succeeding academically because of my guidance, parents did not assist with his learning because I did such a good job. Does this count?

I have been told that my essay writing and communication skills are a big asset, this should help in writing my application essay. I've experienced a lot of lessons in self-improvement that I could write about. I have a good background for recommendation letters given the diverse group of people I've worked with throughout my life who praise my hard work and dedication. If there's an interview, I will fare very well.

Here are some miscellaneous things that apply to me, let me know could help me if I elaborate on them. Or if they could hurt my chances. Please be honest:

* Parents are affiliated with FSU for work, although I'm not sure if this has any pull

* Good family educational and professional background, parents have MD, MPH, and PhD degrees

* Diagnosed with ADHD, prescribed Adderall near the end of 11th grade. Am able to function well and work hard without it, but it has helped slightly.

* Will pay tuition in cash. Unsure if I will stay in a dorm or if I will live off-campus.

* Male, South Asian, $250-300/year household income


Thanks, you guys are awesome. What are my strengths, weaknesses, what should I do in the future?

I apologize for any grammatical errors, I'm typing pretty fast and a little exhausted at the moment."

I have received a few replies, and even had a few phone interviews, but after that they lead to nothing.

I'm not even sure what my skill level is at this point, and I'm afraid I may never find a job and I'll be stuck doing simple administration forever.  

At my current job I'm officially a Linux Administrator, and I manage around 100 linux systems on two separate networks.  Most of these systems are actually workstations as I directly support developers who use and develop for Linux based applications.  I also administer the NetAPP storage for NFS shares and SMB shares.  

I also help the other Administrators (mostly windows) whenever they need it, so with those systems it's around 2000 or so including the ones not on the network I help manage.

Most of my focus tends to be on security because of the industry I'm in, so I don't get much of a chance to play with anything cloud related.

But... I manage a couple redmine/gitolite systems I set up. I previously had a mongodb/elasticsearch/rsyslog/graylog2 setup for logging purposes which I had setup to communicate over an openfire server and/or an email server I setup.  I setup puppet with the systems I manage to do basic config management and security lockdowns.  I write bash scripts on a normal basis to keep things consistent.  I have written python scripts in the past to do more complex things like scrape websites for needed downloads.  I also commit these scripts to a git repository I set up for the administrators using gitlab.  I use MDwiki to maintain documentation.  Most of this has had to be taken down recently because the security people decided they didn't like it.  

As far as certs, I have Linux+, Security+, and RHCSA (self study).

At home I use Ubuntu, on my web servers I use Debian, and at work I use Red Hat. 




What am I doing wrong?  Do I not have enough experience...  Is everything devops now, and if so, how do I convince people that I can learn fast enough.  

I'm not sure what to do at this point, and considering my boss just left for a job that is below where he was before, things are not looking good at work and I want to get out as soon as possible.  

Sorry this is all ranty, but I am so frustrated I feel like I'm having a panic attack just about every day.

edit: I should mention I've been with this company since Sep. 2009, so 4.5 years, and before this I had several internships in high school and college with 3 different companies."

I'm a female freshman studying computer science at a state university in northeastern USA. I really want to snag an internship this summer, because I think it'll really help me learn more by diving in. I haven't done much programming before college, so I'm a bit behind my peers in terms of experience. The only coding I've done is for class, plus small little side projects for fun. I know MATLAB and am currently learning Java, but I wouldn't say I've completely mastered either language. I do love programming, and I'm more than willing to work hard and learn if someone gives me the chance, but... getting that chance is really difficult.

What should I do to earn an internship this summer if I don't have much experience with coding?

22awtv,1,2014-04-05,Losing motivation in Freshman year.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22awtv/losing_motivation_in_freshman_year/,"Hello,

I'm a freshman studying CS in Pennsylvania. This is a throwaway as my identity could be pretty obvious from reading this.

So basically, I'm losing motivation about being in college in general. My first semester was meh. I pulled a 3.0 because I wasn't nearly focused enough on school work and ended up getting involved with too many clubs and such.

 I thought this semester would be better, but its turned out to be hell. I'm taking two comp sci classes, intermediate programming and discrete math, that are going to kill my GPA, i.e., probably get C's in both of them. I don't feel like these grades are representative of my actual knowledge of the subject matter. The same instructor teaches both of these classes as I'm in a combined sort of class that links together a lot of topics from both of the classes. The instructor is generally regarded by the students here to be smart, but a pretentious douche when it comes to grading in that the majority of points he takes off are for formatting issues and white space. As an example, an entire problem of mine was not graded on a discrete math exam because the reasoning for each step did not physically line up on the paper. This was a 12 pt question on a 100 point exam. That's more than an entire letter grade for formatting. The rest of that exam and the second exam endured similar fates. 

I don't agree with the idea of criticizing the physical appearance of my solutions when they are *actually correct*. For some reason, he can't figure out why the failure rate was so high last semester.

I'm beginning to not like the program in general here. We aren't heavily recruited from the top tech companies with the exception being Microsoft. Microsoft tends to hold a fair amount of events throughout the year. Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. are all absent. Amazon showed up to our career fair in the Fall, the supposedly biggest career fair in the country or something like that, but don't seem to be all that interested otherwise.

I'm becoming worried about my future here. The compsci prof I had last semester for our intro class was also horrid in that he talked in an incredibly monotone voice and read the lecture slides off of a projector, the slides of which were online. By the end of the semester,  I was one of the 5 people that still routinely came to class, mostly because I felt guilty if I didn't go.

I've been programming for a while. College was not my first exposure to programming. I started programming in QuickBASIC or some variant of BASIC when I was in early elementary school and have always had a love for programming and computer science in general. At this point, I'd say I'm decent enough in Python, C, C++, and other random languages that I've played with over time. I don't focus on ""learning"" specific languages anymore insofar as I can pick up the syntax of any given language (besides some FP languages) and become productive enough in a short amount of time. I love tech. I love programming. I love computer science.

I feel like to some degree I'm wasting time. I'm losing motivation rapidly and don't know what to do. Managing to keep my head above the water so that my GPA doesn't suck after this semester has prohibited me from working on fun/interesting side projects. 

I have a few internship offers on the table for this summer and am waiting a bit longer to hear back from some other companies/startups I've been talking to before I make a decision.

I wish I had gone to UMD now. I feel like there CS program is significantly better than ours. I had got accepted into better schools than where I am (i.e. UIUC, UMD), but chose the instate option to avoid crippling debt after school.

Am I being too cynical? Not dedicated enough? I hope I don't come off as attempting to blame the prof I'm dealing with right now as the root of all my issues, but I feel that to a certain extent, it can't be my fault completely... Am I in the wrong?

Another annoying problem is that I'm doing a good deal better in my other classes, such as multivariable calc and some gen eds, so I feel like I've got the ""how to study"" part worked out... 

Let me know if I can provide clarifications or if this rant didn't make any sense at all."

22b8ie,2,2014-04-05,"About to earn my Graphic Design Certificate in a rural area (with a minor in web design), and unsure how to intelligently pursue work",wellgolly,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/22b8ie/about_to_earn_my_graphic_design_certificate_in_a/,"So here's a more specific rundown of my situation. I apologize for the length of my post! I am just so lost, I feel like I need to mention everything.

The certificate's simply from a community college, although I made the dean's list, got a scholarship, and designed the school calendars. So that's currently what I'm working with.

There's a reason I didn't go for a full degree - but trust me, you don't need to hear it, it'd just be a biography. All that's worth saying is - I can *work* hard, at least. And I can learn from that experience. I'm happy to work from the bottom, pretty much. I mention my age, because I'm a bit concerned being relatively old for such inexperience might be an issue.

Asking this just a month from graduation might sound like I've only thought about this last minute, but the truth is, I've been working on this since last fall. I finished my classes early in February to devote myself full-time on finding work, and...it's not going too well. I'd searched all over my school for any sort of guidance last semester, but all the advisers and the ""success center"" seem to be clueless as well. In fact, many of my classes were independent studies, since those courses were so rarely taken. So I don't really have any peers, either.

It's especially tricky since I live hours away from any city, and there's nobody around here that's looking for this kind of help. Hell, even for free. So I've been scouring places like Craigslist, and well - there are very few possible jobs (including internships) that would even look at someone without years of professional experience and a degree. And absolutely none of them are virtual jobs (understandably).

I'm 100% willing to move, if that's where the action is. I've saved up for years, and actually managed to get $3000 to my name! But at the moment, it's just a blind leap of faith, and that 3k is more than a year's salary to me (minimum wage and all - my scholarship went to supplies), so that's a very precious resource.

Honestly, all the work I've been doing - it feels like I've wasted so much time. I'll spend months going one direction (only this week, I've been using Internships.com), and then hit a dead-end. I'd be absolutely thrilled for anything, really. I don't even know how to divide my time between this and free Udacity courses. Outside of my part-time jobs, it's all my time, and I can't seem to squeeze any more hours out of my life.

And the thing is - I keep feeling like no matter how much I spend focusing on this, I'm stumbling around blindly, because I can't find any guidance on the issue. It's a bit personally important I find something before Summer, and now the clock's running out. Although even a slow lead would be great, as long as I definitely know it goes somewhere.

_____________
E: Thank you all for your comments! They've all been helpful :)
For the sake of anyone in a similar situation who may find this through Google, I should update a bit:

I wasn't *specifically* looking to freelance, although I'm certainly not opposed to the idea, and I've set myself out for work.


However, since Andrejia's post, I've dialed it down a little in the last few days.
It was mainly just unrelated work, but I also took some time to step back and re-evaluate my process. I even watched some television! Sounds mundane, but a totally meaningless hour and a half was a big deal.


Internships.com has already sent some responses, so I would recommend that site! And I am interested in taking up that tutoring offer, once I finish one of my courses. It's like all of my desires suddenly popped up the second I stopped for a breather!


So if my situation sounded familiar, it might be worth taking a look at your process. It seems I got so caught up in the stress, that it wound up being detrimental to the search. Just taking it one task at a time isn't going to doom you, and it certainly would help to avoid burn-out.

And as obvious as it may sound: all the things you might plug away at, that never produce any results - eventually you have to take it as a sign to drop that method completely, not just apply more elbow grease. Despite having seen links to it, I never would have tried 99designs on my own, because I was so caught up on what wasn't working."
22bjrg,74,2014-04-05,For those who haven't had any luck finding internships...,radicalnegative1,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/22bjrg/for_those_who_havent_had_any_luck_finding/,"Don't give up! Just a quick tip (and how I defied logic and landed my internship for this summer):

Most of the big companies that use external hiring websites (indeed.com, monster, etc.) at this point probably have their interns / co-op positions filled. Continue applying, but broaden your search. I suggest trying this ***one weird trick that companies don't want you to know about*** or whatever... you get the idea.


So basically, **go to this website and look at past awardees: http://www.sbir.gov/**

These are companies that you want to target at this point. They're small, they have money, and they're often off the radar of other potential interns.


Identify a few (or a lot) of companies that interest you and research them. The company for which I am interning this summer was publishing technical papers on really cool stuff, so I took the time to read the papers and then reached out to the company to ask informed questions about their research. Whatever the company does, ask about their research, products, services, or whatever they do. Make the connection first. Be genuinely interested in what they do, then bring up a possible internship. By demonstrating interest, you have already presented yourself as a great potential intern. Just for some perspective, **a day after I made contact with the company I'm interning with they offered me a job**.

Don't give up!"

I’m a final year MSc student in Computer Science. I’m not american, but I want to go there and get a job. I think my CV is fine (2 Google SoCs + 1 internship this summer at a Big Four company), decent GPA but not top university. I will try to get a full-time offer, but of course that’s something not sure at all. The thing is problem solving is not my strong point (I’m not saying I’m bad, but not better than the average), so the idea of getting a full-time offer from one of the Big Four is unlikely. However, my dream is to work at, concretely, Google (but the others would be awesome as well) and I would like to give it a shot.

The thing is, if I don’t get a full-time offer after the internship, I have two options:

· I come back to my country and work for a while at a company I know to get some more real-world experience while I practice problem solving and, in a year, I apply to the Big Four and some others. This is a good option because it would be just 7 hours every day and I would have some spare time. I’m sure that although problem solving is a lot about how smart you are, there is a huge difference between having solved 50/100 problems in TopCoder and just try a few basic ones. The problem about this one is that it is not known in US, so maybe not that good for the CV.

· I perform a massive apply to, let’s say, the 50 most appealing companies where I want to work (this is, west coast). I guess most of them would be startups. It would be awesome for me to work at any cool startup as long as they offer me good conditions; but I think I would regret not having tried Google without preparing hard for it. I know getting an offer from a good startup could be even harder than from Google, but I could try at a lot of different companies here.

I would appreciate any suggestion, thank you!

EDIT: ""worse"" is not the word, but I hope you get my point."

I'm about to do a one year internship as a sales analyst role which will require mostly using Excel, forecasting sales and some database work.

The problem is I am very unhappy with my workplace at the moment due to the fact them not providing employees with a day off in nearly 2 months.  People are overworked and tired.  So now that you have the background, I currently only have about a year and a half left for my CS degree but would like to either do work on the side, or work part time as an intern so I can leave my current company and get experience in a relevant position.  (I would like to do something like Bioinformatics or designing/coding bionic limbs)  

So my question is:  What should I really be focusing on at this point to further my learning in my desired field, and also if anyone has gotten a job without extensive coding knowledge, what are some tips you could give me as to what got your foot in the door?

Thanks in advance everyone!"

In other words, will I be able to register a Fall class despite not currently meeting the pre-reqs? I'm under the impression they allow this type of registration. However, this plan strikes me as risky because if I have to drop one of the classes, then I'm stuck trying to fix my schedule for the fall after most people have already had their pick in registration.

Also would taking 10 hours over the full 11-week session in the summer be considered insane? Espeically if those classes are the following:

    Math 2414 - Integral Calculus
    CS 2305 - Discrete Mathematics I 
    CS 2336 - Computer Science II

I was going to spend the summer working on some software project to gain some experience and hopefully have something to show when looking for an internship in the future. However, after looking over the classes I need to take, I realized I can graduate a semester earlier if I could get these classes out of the way. This plan involves me taking 16-17 hours each regular academic session with next summer off (hopefully internship). 

Conversely, I can just take something like Linear Algebra this summer, which hopefully will leave me with enough free time to do a project. I'll graduate a semester later but each semester would be somewhat less break neck at approximately 14-15 hours. I should also point out that I don't have any of the easier humanity ""core"" classes left to take. Fall classes that I need to take look something like this (assuming the above 10 hours of summer classes are taken): 

    CS 3341, Prob &amp; Statistics in CS
    CS 3345, Algorithm Analysis &amp; Data Struc.
    CS 3340, Computer Architecture

I graduated about a year ago with a bachelor's degree in computer science. I got really good grades and enjoyed learning what I was learning, especially the more math-like stuff such as algorithms, data structures, theory of computation, etc. But during my internships and over the past year of working in software development I've discovered that I really hate this line of work. It's not that I don't like programming per se, and I actually really liked and was good at doing programming assignments for school and on my own. But those were all done individually or in very small groups, and it's a lot harder for me when I'm working on a big project with many other people and a codebase that I can't hope to fully understand myself. I also am a bit socially awkward and have some issues with anxiety so it's tough for me to communicate with other developers/engineers and ask questions.

So I'd appreciate any advice that people with more experience in the field could give me about other career options that would better suit my strengths and weaknesses. I'm also considering going to graduate school, for CS or maybe math, so if anyone could comment on what that is like that be very much appreciated as well. Thanks again :)

22ebty,1,2014-04-06,"""Wireless""",[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/22ebty/wireless/,"Hey there TFTS,
long time lurker, always wanted to post, all that jazz.

I am good friends with a guy I met at a Best Buy because we were both teaching two different employees how to not read specs off of the tag of the same lap top we were both looking at buying. So ya we kind of clicked.

So my friend works IT at an office here in town, and this is the story of my first day working there after getting a position in the office.

I was there with him because I had applied and asked the guy in charge if I could basically be a non-paid intern until I started just to check out the company and what not. So I am sitting in the office with all the IT techs and they are all busy saying ""turn it off and on again"" so I took up an easy sounding ticket off my friend.

It read as follows...

""Please help. My wireless key board and mouse are not working. Also monitor does not work either.""

Sounded easy enough. I was expecting to have to install two logitech devices and plug in a monitor. **Wrong**

(I now see why /u/airz23 always looks to his faithful coffee in times of distraught)

I get to the user in question. What I saw was like a technological murder scene that haunts my dreams to this day.  This user had heard about wireless keyboards and mice and decided that a set would improve his work performance. Their solution... to buy a wireless mouse and keyboard, but throw out the actual devices and keep the wireless USB hubs that go with the computer itself because he likes the feel of the existing equipment. So he plugged them both in, and then this user realizes that the wires on their mouse and keyboard are now useless and therefore do not need to be there. (see where this is going?)

The user or should I say murderer **cut** the wires off the ends of the mouse and keyboard. After excusing myself to go punch the punching bag that IT had put in their office (now seeing why and getting looks of respect and a few bro-fists after doing so) I returned and spent about 30 minutes explaining the meaning of wireless to the murderer. I then got replacements and tossed the old (almost wanted to play taps on bag pipes to give the abused tech that perished in the line of duty a proper burial) I then had to check out this monitor issue.

My torment had not yet ended. This user had also apparently heard of HDMI cables. So they went out and bought one, plugged it into the computer, and then realized that the existing VGA cable was wired directly into their monitor. Their solution, you ask? To one again **cut** the end off the VGA and one side of the HDMI, then they twisted the wires together and then wrap them in scotch tape. I was baffled. Once again I return to the IT office and head-butted the IT punching bag. Returning to the murder scene once again I took the computer, monitor, new mouse, and new key board. I picked up the first paper pad I saw and handed it to murder. 

*Murderer*: What's this for?

*Me*: What ever you needed this computer for can be done on that.

*Murderer*: But I need a computer t---!

*Me*: To play solitair and write reports?

*Murderer*: *silence*

I then just walked out of this murder scene cubicle.

I brought the tech to the IT office and then explained to the techs what I had been up to for the past hour and a half. They made a toast to me with their coffee and said ""To Professor_Derpsalot! One of us!"" After my friend got the user working tech and told him to not alter it anymore it was quitting time. We all headed to the closest bar and the IT techs bought me a glass of the bar's best whisky to welcome me to the team.

I find myself wondering what brand of coffee /u/airz23 recommends.

**TL;DR** Tech murder scene and a punching bag."

Some background:

1) I work for the mayor's office. I am responsible for maintenance and support of all machines in my town.

2) Have three employees: FatGamer, DumbCrazy and CrossEyed. The last 2 are interns.

3) THIS HAPPENED 15 MINUTES AGO.

------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the time we just have to reinstall some networked printer who went offline for whatever reasons, or check why there's no internet connection (usually somebody just turned off the modem 'to save power'), but sometimes whe get older machines (all desktops) with users complaining that they are slow. 

Normally we just cleanup the dust, do a virus/malware scan and/or format and reinstall, since we don't use any special software, just office/winrar. Not so often we have some spare parts like a better memory, or a faster HD, and upgrade the machine the best we can.

So this machine came to us. CrossEyed pick the ticket and proceed as usual.

Suddenly...

CrossEyed: - Boss, I think this machine came toasted.

Me: - No, the client said it was ok, just running slow. I know them, they're reliable. Check again.

CE: - Boss, the machine isn't powering on.

Me: - Did you checked if the power cable was plugged in? Because you did this once...

CE: - Yeah Boss, I checked.

Me: - Did you checked if it is 110v or 220v? On their site they have both.

CE: - Yeah.

Me: - Strange. Let me see.


I go check this poor baby, and the first I smell is that sad scent of a deep fried motherboard.

Me: - CrossEyed, come here.

CE: - 'sup?

Me: - Tell me exactly what you did.

CE: - I cleaned it up...

Me: - ...and...

CE: - ...upgraded the RAM from 512MB to 2GB...

Me: - ...and...

CE: - ...switched the power supply. 

Me: - and it was all ok? 

CE: - Well, it was a little hard to fit but I managed it. When I turned it on it smelled burned so I turned it off.


I had to show him. He did those upgrades hundred of times. 

But this time he accomplished 2 things I never saw in my life: He managed to plug a DDR2 on a DDR slot... AND plugged the power supply backwards. When it doesn't fit he does the one logical thing (on his mind) and CUT THE POWER PLUG IN ORDER TO FIT.

**TL; DR: CrossEyed intern could fit an square peg on a round hole.**

New intern gets laid off because of inexperience so I need to get into a couple of projects to get some experience. 

So two weeks ago, I posted a thread about me feeling like a fraud at my new internship. And I received a lot of good advice on what to study. And after that, I hit the books like crazy, asked questions at work, went the extra mile with everything I was supposed to do. I tried my best to study the libraries and code. They even gave me some static pages to work on, and the lead graphic designer said that the pages looked good. I was friendly with everybody in the workplace and most of the peopled liked me there.

But then I walked into the office with a Red Bull in hand ready for a week of work and learning and I can't even log into my subversion, ftp account or email. At that point, I knew what was going on, but I had wondered what I did wrong. I gave them every single thing I had to offer so I wondered if I pissed off the wrong person. 

I got pulled into the accountant's office and then my boss said that it's just not going to work out with us. Apparently the company is having money issues and they didn't have the staff to train me. When I took the interview test, they thought that I was much further along. They needed somebody who could handle their complex libraries and maintain their systems. 

So they took my key card, had me empty out my desk and I walked out of the workplace with an armload of supplies and a stupefied look on my face. They tried to assuage my pain by saying that I can use them as a reference but I don't know how I can even milk that reference from only 2 weeks on the job. They also said that they'll be hiring again in the future and they'll keep my resume. But they're not going to call me again, are they? 

What do I do next? Does anybody have any projects that a developer of 8 months can sink his teeth into? I can do basic jQuery, PHP, HTML5, CSS3 and a little bit of MySQL. This is my dream and I cannot sit around feeling sorry for myself. I must get back in the game. "

So here goes mine. Throwaway Acc.

I left Neurophsyio after 3 yrs of school with no degree. I have worked at Big Blue Box Geeks for 3 years, Apple for 2 and then moved. I got hired by a small IT firm that required no resume, no documentation, and a slew of lies. E.g. work from home, yearly raises, chance to work on server configs, advancement.

As it is, I maintain my own clients. I obtained my CCNA, which was frowned upon, since we're an MSSP. I have not been offered any training, my paychecks do not reflect my timesheets for commission on hours charged, my benefits are pretty bad (Humana), no standards in practice, and apart from a 250k 10Gb fibre network and server, I haven't implemented another. Some pet peeves are thoughtless configurations and lack of apprenticeship , ie. certs, security management, shortcuts in our work,my new co-workers are a pizza delivery boy and a guy from the guard that neither have any experience nor knew how to install office. 

I've been here two years and was ready to leave, but my boss approached me and offered to get me work with servers. Is this just another carrot? I feel like bc I have neither a degree nor hands on with Cisco, that I wouldn't be worth much elsewhere. 

I also love my customers. I have been told that its because of my work that they continue to hire us for work, and it makes me feel appreciated for my hard work. I charge $105/hr for my services. I am *supposed* to receive $5 commission, and I make $40k after taxes in the Houston area including gas reimbursement. 

I am thinking about going to WGU online for IT security, but am worried about starting a new job and school simultaneously. I am working my way through ""hacking the art of exploitation"" and I am really liking it-fwiw. 

*Edit*: Thank you all for the posts. I really feel like it has encouraged me to put myself out there. I have applied to the city Metro, but they wanted experience. I have been lurking /r/houstonjobs, craigslist, dice, indeed, and calling business cards looking for opportunities. Most are looking for a degree or substantial experience with hands on. It's a hard sell to make them believe that I am a living sponge.

 I want to learn anything and everything about this industry. I signed up for the Linux foundation class and paid the $250 for *official* class badge/cert/whatever that call it. 

Everything I have has been from self motivation to better myself, because that's what I want. Sometimes, I just feel like I need a hand up, other times I feel like I am too down on myself. That's why I came to Reddit, for another POV.

WGU has been something I've been researching for about 4 months now, and it certainly is much different than the Devry's and ITT. The way I rationalized it is like this:

I am competing with college grads atm for jobs (people with degrees with no experience). I now have nearly 10 years of techy experience ( I worked in electronic dept at ODepot and freelance work on yachts w/ fiance's dad before).

WGU will give me the certs, the two letters for HR, and some confidence. I have many connections from networking and being able to impress people with my work, but there always seems to be a hang up from them taking a risk and hiring me. I'd love to apprentice or be in an environment that would encourage my learning, but those jobs tend to require what I don't have yet.

What do you think about taking an intern position with a security firm? I've been lurking on a company ""white hat"" in the area, that provides substantial blogs via linkedin and their website says that are hiring. I'd love to be able to career somewhere."

To balance off some of the negative crap I feel, I'll say that I KNOW I'm intelligent, funny, my self esteem is horrible but I'm confident in my abilities. I don't believe I'm all bad...but sometimes the bad outweighs it. 

I live in Ontario and went back to school to get a diploma in the legal field two years ago although I already have a BA. Almost immediately after finishing, I found a few internships to hold me over until I found a paying job, which I did. But the place I worked at was hell. The work was good, the learning experiences from the research I had to delve into and the content of the project were fascinating. It taught me a lot about people and how cold, cruel, and uncaring they could be.

Myself and the other new hires spent 9 hour days sifting through information that would stick with us forever. Stories of rapes, murders, deaths and worse situations, all of which occurred without penalty. We all felt morally disturbed by it, and though I was warned when I started, I didn't realize how difficult it would be. But it was still a good learning experience that left me with a new understanding of what some people have to go through in their lives and despite what I say here, I've had a much better life than that and I'm thankful. However, the working environment was like working in a sweatshop and my stress levels sky rocketed as did everyone else's. Even with a healthy diet I managed to gain at least 10 pounds which exacerbated my existing chronic health issue. I got up at 6am, made the two hour commute to work, sometimes worked at my internship and didn't get home until 10 at night. I became unable to stay awake for even a few hours in the day. I'd routinely have to hold my eyes open at work just to keep myself up. I started losing my memory enough to the point where I had trouble just having basic conversations. It became a struggle to get my point across during a conversation - I'd forget the word 'book' or 'pen' or anything else. My brain just stopped functioning. I'd thought about quitting often but didn't for the money and the experience. When the job was finally over, I pretty much crashed and haven't been the same since.

My memory has come back, I still have trouble with my speech sometimes but it isn't nearly as bad. Since last summer I've been searching for a new job and I've found nothing. I've been offered the chance to start a partnership business with a colleague and the only reason I might even consider it (if they'll actually be willing to think I'm serious this time) is because I can't seem to find anything else. Within a few months of being unemployed, due to my general dissatisfaction with life, I've often contemplated just ending it all. I can't remember the last time I was happy. I'm 29 now...I think the last genuinely happy moment may have been in high school.

Part of it is my appearance...maybe that's shallow. I'm athletic and always have been, but I'm lucky enough to be one of those girls that can't ever lose a pound. So since I have no job to go to, barely get any interviews, I've been sinking my time into working out. In the course of four months of cycling, jogging, and boxing, I've lost a whopping grand total of five pounds. 

I'm realizing I just don't know who I am anymore. I thought my life would be different by now. I have high aspirations and I want to achieve them but I have no way of getting there. At this point the only reason I haven't actually killed myself is simply because I'm used to living. I do it out of habit, not because I want to. If I didn't have parents that would suffer from it, it would be much easier. But right now I pretty much feel like I'm stuck living and I don't want to be. I actually find myself wishing I'd grown up without a family just so I could have given up years ago.

I do have a few close friends but none that I can really talk to like this. I tend to be that typical INTJ that bottles it all up and seems all happy on the outside but really I'm just a mess. When I do try and talk to friends somehow it just feels like whatever I say isn't that big of a deal to them. No one seems to get how serious I am, even though I'm that person that always has a smile on their face and always goes with the flow, it seems to give them the impression that nothing can touch me. Right. I tried to open up about it to a friend a few weeks ago, but couldn't bring myself to bring my friend down by emphasizing just how desperate I am. They ended up writing me a lengthy email telling me how much they appreciate me and just generally trying to cheer me up a bit. It helped a bit and I appreciate it, but it wasn't enough to stop this.

My last relationship was three years ago. Whether the drama from that screwed my head up even more, I don't know, I'm over it and we're good friends so I don't see it as much of a factor. But I've started to realize that not once have I attracted anybody before. I've been out on dates, I've had relationships, but only if I've approached anyone. I've never been asked out in my life and this just makes me wonder what the hell is wrong with me even more. I know people like me, and I pretty much make friends with everyone I meet within minutes. 

So at the end of the day, I can't get a job in my field, I feel like a failure, even at times when I have all the confidence and positivity in the world I'm apparently never going to attract anyone, I've been trying like hell to at least work on getting into shape so I can say I've accomplished something and I come up zip on all fronts. I've been dealing with a lot of this for years (especially the serious health issues) and usually you can only tell I'm unhappy if I outright tell you. I don't go out and throw out negative energy everywhere to automatically repel people. So someone tell me, what's the point of all this? Why bother continuing with such a pathetic life when every chance to change the problems in my life just fails utterly? 

I'm tired of trying so hard for nothing. Thanks for taking the time to read this."

22ghpl,0,2014-04-07,Vote in the Rutgers University Student Assembly Elections,hgcai3456,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/22ghpl/vote_in_the_rutgers_university_student_assembly/,"We need 10% of the student body to vote for the referenda questions. 
http://ruassembly.com/spring-2014-referendum-questions
We also need you to vote for people to be on next year's assembly. I am running for Livingston Campus Representative Class of 2017 on an academic based platform. My priority is open source textbooks which will pave the way for cheaper and more affordable textbooks. I will be Working with other organizations such as Rutgers Libraries, Rutgers Legal team, and the University administration to implement open source textbooks. 
What makes me want to run for election to the Rutgers University Student Assembly as the Livingston Campus Representative? Maybe it is my desire to continue to assist the undergraduate student population at Rutgers New Brunswick through small actions every day. It might also be my commitment to finish the projects that I have already started since I first began serving as the Livingston Campus Representative in October. A more likely reason is that I am willing to give my time to working for the undergraduate student body because I am deeply passionate and enthusiastic about this University. I am even more enthusiastic and passionate about the student body, especially my graduating class.
About six months ago, I ran for this position because I wanted to be a bridge between the Rutgers University student body and the University. After six months of hard work, I have navigated through the University’s many departments, talked to many administrators, and worked with the senior student body leaders to get a better picture about how this University works. More importantly, I have experimented with certain projects and have become more aware of how the Student Assembly works as well. I believe I have met many people in RUSA and become close friends with a couple of them. These close relationships allow me to function more effectively in RUSA. I have been constantly building relationships. Now I have a clearer picture on how to finish and follow through on all my current and future projects because I have successfully built relationships with many different leaders and organizations. One of my favorite organizations is the NJPIRG. Not only do I see them as a powerful ally to help me work to bring cheaper textbooks to the student body, but I also see them as my friends.
First, let me introduce myself for those who joined Rutgers recently for the Spring 2014 semester. Born in a city near the Yangtze, I was brought to America as a wide eyed five year old boy who saw America as a shining city on a hill. After being raised in this country, I have seen this shining city tarnish a bit. I want to help make this city on a hill shine again. One of the things that I have been doing to make this “city” shine is through volunteering for my local community organizations. From being trained as a Counselor in Training to being a volunteer at the West Windsor Library, and at the Crisis Ministry, I have helped many people.
Now at Rutgers University, I want to work to eliminate mistrust and miscommunication between people. Some things that I have done to increase communication includes helping to write and pass the Preferred Name Bill through the student assembly. Now Trans* students and international students can add their preferred names to their class rosters. Trans* students can finally be recognized by their professors with names that reflect their gender. International students can feel more comfortable and communicate more easily with American born or raised students by using American names in class. Their American names will be added to the class roster, SAKAI, Blackboard, and e-College. I am currently perfecting a bill that will be presented to the assembly soon. It will build a stronger relationship between Rutgers professors and students.
Additionally, I voted to pass resolutions that support shared governance and smoke free campus.
I will continue to be a bridge that connects the student body with the University not only through my work on RUSA, but also through the use of social media. I connect with my fellow peers and friends using WeChat, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Google, Yahoo, iMessage, Pinger, LinkedIn, blogger and Instagram, and WhatsApp. I have worked with my fellow Writing Center Interns to build an Instagram page that promotes the Livingston Campus Writing Center and its services. As a Writing Center Intern, I have personally connected with even more International students and try to understand their feelings and needs. As a business school student, I am actively maintaining my LinkedIn page with my latest activities, which you can all read online.
Lastly, I have used my time in RUSA to meet new people. I am looking forward to meeting even more people and listening to their opinions and ideas to make the University a more harmonious place for all students. After accumulating valuable experience from serving as the current Livingston Campus Representative, I have become more mature, wise, and smart about how to accomplish my goals.
I am interested in running for this position on the Rutgers University Student Assembly again because I believe in creating a stronger university student body that has fun and stays within the rules and laws of the university and the nation. 
Please vote for Henggao Cai for Livingston Campus Representative.

Me and my experience are having our two year anniversary in a few months. I've been working as a junior front-end developer with a company that makes social networks. I started there right after high school as an intern making wordpress sites. I got better at PHP and MySQL so after half a year they let me work on their social network projects. Right now I'm making $32,000 a year, after taxes a little more than $21,000 a year.

I'd like to make some more money, as of right now I'm living without health insurance so I can pay my the bills, and in Massachusetts that results in a tax penalty. Just sayin'.

How much should I be making as a junior front end developer? Should I ask for a review?
This is what I usually list as my skills:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* jQuery
* PHP
* MySQL
* Wordpress
* Linux and DOS commands
* Apache

22gvz7,2,2014-04-07,I'm scared to death of interviewing. My stomach turns and I start to shake when simply filling out job applications online because I know they could lead to an interview. Help!,Sohcahtoa82,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22gvz7/im_scared_to_death_of_interviewing_my_stomach/,"I just recently finished my BS in Computer Science, and I'm now applying for jobs in the hopes of being a software engineer.  I love to code, and was doing it at home off and on for years before I even started going to college.

I worked a software testing internship for 16 months at Intel, which of course meant interviewing there, but for some reason, I felt more confident at that one.  Going into it, I knew it wasn't a coding position, and I had a friend that had also applied for the same job and was able to give me a heads up on what they were asked.

But when it comes to coding, even though I've written plenty of things here and there, I still feel like I have no idea what I'm doing (I've heard what I'm feeling is [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)), and it'll show when I get an interview.

I recently had a couple 20-minute phone interviews for a position, and when asked to describe the MVC design pattern, I was so nervous that I stuttered like crazy and was probably highly incoherent.

Then of course is the issue of my mouth becoming absurdly dry due to the stress.

[How much do you charge to program a website? Nothing fancy, just some basic images and text. I want it to look good, but not over the top. I' sent you an email with all the images i want on the webpage. Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmlg61?context=5)|As a consultant, I get billed out at $115/hr to clients. I was making $90k/year at the job I got laid off from before doing this.
 |I'm not a designer, and I don't make websites for people. I am sorry but you should find someone younger and less experienced to do your bidding.
[So you can get this done in less than 1 hour? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmt2yf?context=5)|I'm in the process of writing software to allow people who want this sort of thing to do it themselves in an hour, so that there is no need for me or anyone else to do it; only to hire a designer to lay it out.
[How would you easily explain to someone who doesn't know much about technology (ELI5\) how hacking works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmlgu6?context=5)|About 10 years ago, hacking is just another way to say you are really good at making computers do whatever you want, even if the computer was not meant to be able to do those things.
 |In the modern sense, hacking is the digital equivalent of breaking and entering typically. That is not how I use the word, but it is what I will explain, since I think that is what you are asking. Eg: How do you break into computers.
 |Investigate the computer hardware and software being run by your target.
 |Find ""problems"" with that hardware or software ( things that don't work correctly ), or ways to force that hardware or software to do things it wasn't meant to.
 |Take advantage of the problems, by studying them carefully, in order to gain more than the normal level of access the systems are intended to provide.
 |Continue to use increasing levels of access to get more and more information from the intended target.
 |Note that there are a lot more steps you need to take to do these things, that is just the general idea of how hacking is done.
[Do you even lift?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmmfo8?context=5)|I'm a computer programmer. I'm a total weakling. On a related side note, the FBI agent actually was involved in Tough Mudder and won one of them as a team with a bunch of his buddies. He probably lifts.
[I'm a programmer and I lift. You have no excuses.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnj7sq?context=5)|Well I hike and bike, and I like sprinting. I also go up and down stairs 3 at a time. I may not be able to lift but I can run. I'm not a donut eating potato sack.
[How were you caught?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmljzn?context=5)|I am not quite sure exactly. The things that led me to be a suspect in this case were grey hat hacking. I wasn't selling information or breaking anything, so I wouldn't quite say I was 'caught'. No charges have been pressed against me thus far, either by the university, the state, the secret service, or any other group.
 |To answer your question more directly, I'm not exactly sure how I got caught. I know friends of mine were questioned before I was. My parents got calls from the FBI asking for my online only alias 3 weeks before. There were signs something was going down.
 |What the FBI did have was a print out of a Stream chatlog. Apparently they got it from Steam themselves and/or got it from someone else I was talking to about the hacking I was involved in. The Steam chatlog is the only evidence I know of that they had that I was doing anything that would classify as 'hacking'. I was stupid. I told my friends what I was doing, and I used Steam to tell them.
[Is there currently a case against you? If so, does this post act as admission of guilt? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmn114?context=5)|I believe I am a suspect in the current ongoing case that was in the news about someone stealing 300k+ identities.
 |I did have more access than whoever that was, but I didn't do anything ""bad"" with that information or access imo.
 |I have not been pressed with any charges, so to my knowledge there is no case against me thus far.
 |Most everything I've stated here I've stated freely to the FBI ( I have continued cooperating with them after the RAID ).
 |During the RAID I provided my 20+ character system encryption password, my Keepass password, the location of my keyfiles, and a full description of everything. I basically ""confessed"" everything to the FBI already.
 |My stance is that I did nothing ""morally wrong"". My attempt the entire time has been to help the university improve their security.
 |As far as being ""guilty"", I assuredly did have more access into their systems then I should have been able to have, but some of this they were fine with and I told them about freely before the RAID.
 |Whether or not I broke any laws, I am uncertain of. I have and will repeatedly apologize for any wrongdoing I may have done, and I will simply continue to reiterate that I was only trying to help.
 |There is sufficient evidence to demonstrate I mean well.
[Thanks for the answer. I read recently that the vast majority of hackers who are caught are discovered not via the actual hacking, or some kind of trace, but by telling other people/bragging in forums and whatnot. Interesting to hear that may have been your situation too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmmm5o?context=5)|I don't think the FBI or Secret Service knew what I was doing during the 1.5 week period I was testing the security. They claim they knew, but they are full of shit, because they did nothing to stop me from doing so until my house suddenly got raided.
 |It was far too obvious that I was the only one with knowledge of the systems and a hacking background, and I told too many people.
 |That and I actually communicated some of what my pentesting activities found on their systems, through my company, using my real name. They already knew I was testing their systems, they just were unaware of how much access I had gained.
 |Eg: I did white hat hacking officially through my job. I did further grey hat hacking that went too far after that, and that is what got me into trouble. I wasn't very careful to hide my activities, and intentionally there is a lot of evidence as to exactly what I did, for my own protection. I never had any evil intentions in any of the process.
[Did you think that you weren't on anyone's radar or just that you were too good to leave footprints?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmmocn?context=5)|I used VPN access through Sweden, Switzerland, and Hong Kong to do the testing. I did mess up and do 1 or 2 things that could be traced back, but the majority of anything that would get me in any trouble there was little to no evidence of.
 |The only thing that alerted anyone was myself. I told the university that I hacked their systems ( specifically I sent an email to all 20 members of the task force for UMD in charge of security ) In the email I listed out all the names and internal employee numbers of all of the people on the task force. That is what triggered the FBI and Secret Service to start digging and eventually arrive at my door.
 |I did good things through my actual job.
 |I did more good things, to try and help security, outside of my job ( albeit things that I could very well got in a lot of trouble for now )
 |I communicated exactly what I did in detailed steps to the university ( to help them patch their holes ) - albeit ""anonymously""
 |University involved FBI and Secret Service.
 |Authorities questioned other people at my work, as well as clients.
 |Authorities then realized it was me, due to me having told other people at work what I was doing.
 |Was then raided.
 |Told my job I was raided.
 |My job laid me off, despite me cooperating with authorities and not having got in any legal trouble thus far. ( may yet )
[*My parents got calls from the FBI asking for my online only alias 3 weeks before.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn5b92?context=5)|Yes it seems amateur; I am not quite sure why they did that.
[Doesn't that seem, I don't know, really *amateur* to anyone else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn5b92?context=5)|The same has happened to me in the past when I was in college, shortly after I applied for an internship with the NSA. I assume it is normal procedure for government agencies to attempt to verify any and all ""pen-names"" used by people being investigated.
[Hackers use steam. I feel like Im getting near being a hacker. LOL. For the sake of learning, can you guide me on where I should start when learning hacking? Any good site you can recommend? I am a network engineer by the way thats why im interested.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn0lo8?context=5)|The best way to learn about hacking is to do it. You should setup two computers, with a cheap router connecting them, and then setup something like a LAMP or WAMP webstack on one, and then try to ""hack into it"" from the other computer.
 |Note that this is a bit much to start out with though, I would just advise googling how to guides on learning to hack and then reading every single google result that comes up ( google searches are limited to 100 results )
 |As far as sites I would recommend, probably a good idea to read hacker news ( news.ycombinator.com ) Also good to read r/technology and r/programming.
 |Since you are into networking, you should learn how to use Wireshark and understand what is going back and forth across the network when you do certain things.
 |If you don't know any coding languages, you should learn some, such as C or Perl.
[If charged, the court cannot compel decryption unless it is a foregone conclusion that there is incriminating evidence on the encrypted volume. If you were smart, you had deniable encryption and can always give them the second partition.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn8row?context=5)|Yes I agree I was manipulated, and I agree it was retarded of me to give up my encryption keys.
[You honestly believe any of this is about morals on their end? Sorry, but I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you if you think this is like 1994 when doing the right thing prevents you from getting charged.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn8row?context=5)|She was forced to sit still in my living room and not move and hold our dog during the entire time I was questioned.
 |Why? Because I care about my wife. If I was alone and single I would have told the FBI to go stick their heads in the sand and ran to pull the main breaker for the house to shut down my PC. What are they going to do; shoot me?
[Why do you keep writing ""raid"" in caps lock?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmron7?context=5)|Because I'm a clueless turd who doesn't have a RAID in my system. j/k.
 |I dunno, just because I can?
 |My current system actually has a RAID5 array with 4 drives, all 2tb drives. Split into 1tb encrypted containers. ( 6 of them )
[When you are interviewed by the FBI are you speaking to someone who is able to understand all the technical details of what you did?  Do they know the right questions to ask?  Or do you find that they only understand the bigger picture?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmuhp8?context=5)|The agent I spoke with seemed to understand what I was explaining. Looking back at it and at what he has asked me since, he isn't as skilled at coding as myself. He also is not a software engineer. He seemed to be trained to interrogate me more than to comprehend what exactly he extracted from me. It is about what you would expect.
 |That said, he probably will read this thread, and I don't want to insult him or his expertise in any way. I don't really know the guy. I don't have his resume. I haven't been allowed to interview him, so I can't really ascertain his technical skill level. Supposedly he is working to analyze my system, so he must know something to even be able to operate the crazy setup I had going.
 |They asked a ton of questions. They asked a bunch of stupid things, like ""what video games do you play?"", ""what was the last video game you played?"". Apparently it was hugely interesting to them that I play 'Rust'. I can't imagine why. I guess hackers typically play video games with their hacker buddies??
 |They also repeated the same questions lots of times, to see if I would pause and react in any different way and leak more information to them. It really is best to not talk to authorities AT ALL, until you are forced to do so, after they press charges. I cooperated, but I believe I made a mistake in doing so.
 |There was a more technical person futzing with my computer before I gave them the passwords. She looks extremely geeky ( like the sort of person who would have no bf ). She had trouble with my Japanese keyboard ( the keys are laid out in a different way than a normal keyboard, and the way I have it setup the labels don't even match what it does ) That is to be expected though; how many US people know how to type on keyboards from other countries?
 |She was clueless when I explained how to read my bash history file, so I am doubting she had much experience with Linux.
 |Basically, I didn't see anyone who was a real pro with computers in the group of people who served the warrant. They were just doing their job; grabbing my stuff and then analyze it later. The fact that the FBI agent who questioned me knew anything technical is probably good, since I was able to cooperate and them not to just take everything in the whole house.
 |All in all, I can't really complain about the search warrant. They were actually pretty cooperative and only harassed me to a degree that I think is reasonable.
 |I still think it is dumb they busted the door though; that is my one complaint.

Just make sure you're not sharing anything here which could harm your defence, a lawyer would be best to tell you whether it was. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmnkbn?context=5)|Lawyer said don't say anything about it to anyone.

[*I used VPN access through Sweden, Switzerland, and Hong Kong to do the testing. I did mess up and do 1 or 2 things that could be traced back, but the majority of anything that would get me in any trouble there was little to no evidence of.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn8yu2?context=5)|The VPNs were setup within Fedora. The passwords are visible in the Keepass I gave them access to. I told them this already in person. They already know. They have full proof of everything I did. Stating it at this point makes little to no difference, because they already have all the evidence.  It isn't illegal to test things. It also isn't illegal to use VPNs to do so. Suspicious sure, but not illegal.  Also, the ""anything that would get me in trouble"" things I mention are things the FBI has full proof of. Those things are trouble in the sense that they were not approved by the university, but they are not trouble in the sense that I was ""stealing"" things. My only aim the entire time was to demonstrate and explain how their security was lacking so that the university themselves could improve it.
[I think you're fundamentally assuming you're anything more than a case file for a few FBI agents, a docket entry for a federal judge or a conviction statistic for a US attorney.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnvwqn?context=5)|Yes I didn't go about thing in the way I should have. Did it happen? Yes. Can I change it? No. What harm was caused? Well my door is busted in... I don't think the university will press charges against me; I think they know I was trying to do the right thing. I could be wrong about this; only time will tell. I don't think the FBI agent who wrote the affidavit is going to try and screw me over, I believe he really is appreciative that I am doing my best to cooperate. The US attorney overseeing the case is the only real question mark. The involved agents says he will state that I am cooperating completely, and that should help. Eg: It sounds to me like whether I get in trouble is just a decision by the US attorney of whether or not to press charges against me. Considering the university has thanked me, and I have and will continue to cooperate and am apologetic about any harm I may have inadvertently caused, I think it would take a malicious sort of person to press charges against me just because. Perhaps the US attorney is just a dick and will go ""hahahaha gonna screw over this punk; he deserves it."" I don't know, all I can do is be honest, cooperative, apologetic for any wrong I have done, and hope for the best.

[Why do you only have 6x1TB containers if you have 4x2TB HDD's in RAID5?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn6v34?context=5)|The way RAID5 works is that you essentially have a parity drive. Lookup parity on Wikipedia for a basic explanation of what parity is in general and how it is computed.
 |What that means in this case is that only 3 of those 4 2TB drives can actually be used to store data. The fourth drive exists so that if any one of the drives fail, I still do not lose any data. So 3*2TB = 6TB. Hence 6x1TB containers.
[I'm surprised their supposed ""computer expert"" was clueless about Linux. That's a pretty big red flag. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn8xg7?context=5)|As stated elsewhere here, I don't think they expected to encounter the elaborate setup I had. They expected some average Joe programmer who did some stuff he shouldn't have. IMO they were shocked at what they saw in my house and in my computer when they got here.
[You can't detect the existence of a hidden partition, that's why the two-key-two-container method works so well.  Also, don't overestimate the capabilities of SS and FBI. They are not wizards.

[I decided recently that I wanted to learn how to code and after some research decided that python was the easiest language to start with and learn the logic of coding from.  I have since realized that few applications use python.  Am I wasting my time?  Or will it be really easy to pick up java or c or another language after developing an understanding of python?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmuc1o?context=5)|I view python the same way I view ruby; it is something in the recent trendsetters group. It has been around for a while, but is recently gaining more attention due to coming into vogue as it were.
 |It is easy to learn and use to some extent, but it does not have, imo, the depth and breadth of connected libraries that exist in languages such as C and Java.
 |There is a large demand currently for Python programmers imo, because it is popular right now.
 |The more languages you learn, the easier it will be to pick up others.
 |If you have a decent grasp of Python, I would suggest advancing it till you have a firm grasp on it before you switch to another language, or you will forget what you have learned.
 |Learning coding in general is a skill that transfers to other languages, but each language has specifics that are quite different.
 |Python is a scripting language. You will find it easier to switch to another scripting language, such as Ruby, Javascript, or Perl, then you will to switch to something such as C ( compiled ) or Java ( Bytecode ).
 |Commonly colleges these days teach Java, since it drives the software for most of the enterprise level. Java can also be very complicated and bloated to write.

 |Additionally, I interviewed for a position with the D.O.D. and was offered the job, but I turned it down because it was equal pay to what I was making and a much farther drive. ( plus the position sounded kind of boring )
 |The fact that I still have my current limited clearance makes me think I may be okay in the long run; I don't really know though.
[Umm... you're an idiot.  It doesn't matter whether you did anything wrong or not, you're essentially throwing yourself on the mercy of the FBI and prosecutor.  The law does not care whether it was ""morally wrong"" because the law doesn't deal in morals.  Nothing you say can help you, only hurt.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnbchg?context=5)|Whether or not they press charges against me is more political than anything at this point. I agree they could press some sort of charges and likely be able to convict as well, but I have been very cooperative, and at no point in the process have I had bad intentions. Eg: at every step of the way I tried to do my best to help the university improve their security. I believe multiple people both inside and outside the university are willing to agree with me on this and state is publicly. Just because the government can crucify random people doesn't mean they have to.
[They may not charge you, but just based on your posts in this thread and the vague wording of the Computer Fraud and Abuse act, it wouldn't be hard to convict you.  Federal prosecutors aren't known for their lenient nature.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnbchg?context=5)| 
[The big problem is that it sounds as if you've already admitted guilt to the FBI, not that you are talking about the search warrant online.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn9knt?context=5)|I don't disagree with you. I clearly have other motivations for speaking out.
[If you had an AMAA and only discussed the fact you were raided and anything that has been published about the case, that would be unlikely to jeopardize anything as long as you didn't pull a weev and insult the court (which was cited for his increased sentence\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn9knt?context=5)|Raise awareness of the truth.

 |I believe I am still an active suspect in that case. There is more than enough evidence to demonstrate my innocence of being involved in that particular ""data breach"" involving the university though.
 |I was working on a UMD website through my company, and I downloaded a portion of the site to work on it. My computer virus scanner picked up a virus ( a shellscript ) on their site. I reported it to my coworkers and my boss ( VP of the company ). The VP did nothing and didn't tell the university.
 |I later, after the 300k incident was in the news, checked if the shellscript was still there. It was. I freaked out and told my coworkers. They immediately told the VP and CEO of my company. Several days later I was in a conference call with people from UMD. Basically nothing was done about the shellscript besides removing it.
 |I waited 2 weeks and then continued, outside of work, investigating to see how bad UMD security was. ( eg: pentesting ) Their security was and is horrendous. I detailed what I found and communicated it to the university...
[Wait, so what exactly did you do that caused them to believe you stole 300k+ SSNs? It sounds like you just alerted your bosses to the presence of the shell script before the 300k incident and afterwards... And THEN poked around. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn8vpg?context=5)|I am obviously leaving out stuff. The stuff I am leaving out is so as to not state anything that would interfere with any ongoing investigation into the 300k incident. Eg: in my testing / poking / hacking / whatever you want to call it I saw things that are not public knowledge, and communicating that information to anyone could be detrimental to the university and/or their security. I do think UMD security was/is bad, but I do believe they are doing their best efforts to fix it now and made up for their failings.
 |To answer more simply, I actually had access officially through my job and that access was able to access the SSN information without me doing anything I would actually consider hacking.
 |The testing and poking I did later was to demonstrate and point out that a malicious individual could gain the same level of access I had officially.
 |Basically, I unintentionally had access to the 300k SSN information that everyone is upset about, and I pointed it out to the university as soon as I realized I did.
 |The reason I got in trouble was because I poked around afterwards. They didn't realize that me ( the person who reported I had access to the info ) was also me ( the person who was poking ).
[Gee can't imagine why I'm upset that you could see who I am and all the perminant information to ruin me can ya???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnu1mf?context=5)|I had to be the bearer of bad news, but security across major corporations and entities across the globe is terrible. I am just one person. There are assuredly a thousand more ever bit as capable as myself, if not more so, and just as assuredly some portion of those are malicious hackers and not people who actually care.
 |Believe it or not, I care about privacy and security greatly.
 |My point here is that for every breach you hear about, there are hundreds if not thousands more than are not noticed and/or not reported. This was stated by Dr. Loh during his statement before the senate hearing recently. I agree with him on this notion.
 |Anyone who is upset at what I've done is rather near-sighted and missing the big picture. Security in computers should be improved across the board. Respect should be given to experts such as myself, and we should be utilized to make the internet and storage of sensitive information more possible. Treating people like me like criminals is counterproductive.
[Then you should have used your **official capacity as an expert** to bring it to the universities attention not grey hat your way to proving a point. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnuhq3?context=5)|I did bring it to the university's attention. Then they did little to nothing about it. They didn't tell the FBI, or anyone on the taskforce. They basically tried to shuffle the things I pointed out under the rug. I got a round of thank you's over the phone from UMD personnel, and then I was ignored. I asked to talk in person to them afterwards, and I was refused.
[Thanks for the reply! One more corollary question, so is it much easier to detect (and then find\) a hacker than it is to do the actual hacking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmrdc3?context=5)|It depends on the type of hacking. If you are discussing people hacking into random websites, typically you cannot easily gain root access to the system serving up the webpages.
 |Until you gain root access, there is a trail of evidence as to what you have done in the logs. How long those logs get retained for, or if they are regularly checked for hacking, depends on the admin. Typically they are not checked at all.
 |Usually, evidence of hacking is only looked for after the hack is obvious. Eg: most hacking goes undetected because it does no real harm, and is simply not noticed.
 |There are a ton of easy hacks against a ton of websites all over the internet. Most of them never get hacked, because no hacker even cares to do the easy hacks.
 |The only hacks that get attention is when people go after specific information, or actually damage system software or delete data etc. Those type of hacks are obvious crimes, and everything is done typically to go after the people who do them.
 |It is difficult to not leave a direct trail back to oneself when doing any hacking, and most amateurs aren't even aware of all the clues they leave.
 |Basically in summary; it is easy to hack, it is harder to do it and not get caught, it is stupid to think you've thought of everything, and in general if you are attempting to hack to steal or damage something, there are people with money and resources interested in catching/finding you.

22h89k,34,2014-04-07,"Cannibalism, Necrophilia, and Possibly Murder in the Rue Morgue.",tustus28,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/22h89k/cannibalism_necrophilia_and_possibly_murder_in/,"The whole entire week felt like one big blur. I had two dips left in my can of Copenhagen, half of a hydrocodone, a waded up bag with a few pieces of good cannabis inside, an almost empty eight ball, and a few sips of whiskey left in a bottle of Donny Donell. I had really over indulged this time. I was trying so hard to numb the pain of my lost loved one. I needed to cope with the sudden overwhelming change, and of course it didn’t help. No matter how many illicit substances I consumed, the pain was still there, slowly consuming me whole like a python does with its prey. Just goes to show the useless role drugs have in my life. Is there even a real way to deal with death? 
Last Friday I got a text message from my aunt telling me I needed to come home for there was a family emergency. Upon my arrival home, I was greeted with a driveway and lawn packed full of cars, I knew something was wrong. Once I parked I put my hands together and prayed, “God please don’t give me the news that I have lost someone else, you have taken so many people away from me, please don’t do this to me again!” I got out of my car nonchalantly trying to keep my nerves calm. I saw Darrel (a close family friend) walking around the yard talking on the phone. I threw my hand up and waved along with my typical greeting to friends. “Hey man!” I yelled. He gave me a quick look then his eyes went back to the ground as he continued talking on his cell phone. I couldn’t help but overhear his conversation. “I don’t know momma I reckon it was someone on dope or they were drunk or something, yeah I know, yeah.” After hearing this I faded away into my own thoughts. “Yeah someone has died.” I thought to myself. I took a deep breath and prepared myself for the worst. I was thinking maybe my father was coming back from one of his little “parties” and one of his friends was most likely over intoxicated as usual, thus causing a car crash in which my father was the fatality.
As soon as I put my hand on the door knob it opened. There stood my dad; face blood red, tears pouring from his eyes like a waterfall, an almost solid white snot drooping down from his nose. He grabbed me and pulled me towards him and held me there. I was almost in shock. Never in my life has my father shown this kind of physical affection towards me. “Your mother died in a car accident this morning son,” he said in an almost nonexistent quivering voice. My whole body went limp, my mind went completely blank. I couldn’t comprehend and process the devastating news he had just gave me. I don’t know how long I was there in front of the door with my dad, but eventually I came to the realization I had to get up. I forced myself up to my feet and then the reality train hit me harder than it ever has before. I jerked my glasses off and burst into tears as I tried to make my way for the comforting sanctuary that is my home.

 The living room was overflowing with people, they were packed in like sardines. All of them were staring at me with faces full of sorrow and pity. I felt so humiliated, I can’t stand it when people see me cry. I tried to maneuver my around obstacles to get  to my room, stepping over people’s feet, tripping over the rug, squeezing past chairs in the dead silence.it was the most awkward situation I had ever been in. Full of rage along with a hateful attitude I locked myself in my room. At the moment I didn’t want to see another person’s face nor deal with any of their bullshit hollow apologizes or their unfaithful promises to help.

A loud knock along with a familiar (and very unsettling) high pitched voice rattled my door. “Hey buddy its Caleb, I just wanted to see if you were ok.” Caleb is the undertaker/mortician at the Green Valley Funeral Home. This ridiculous looking man stands around 5’5, about 170 pounds, long blood red hair that’s usually kept in a ponytail, followed by freckles head to toe, and he has the most insidious laugh a person ever could have. On the outside Caleb seems like a friendly charming guy, but ever since I’ve been working under his supervision, something’s been telling me there is a dark and evil presence lurking around inside him. It may be just a crazy thought from my judgmental human nature, but it’s a thought I can’t seem to shake. Unfortunately Caleb Hatmaker is also my boss. I have an internship at the funeral home as a mortician’s assistant. I unlocked my door and welcomed him in. “I’m so sorry for your loss Jason, this was so unexpected I just couldn’t believe it when I was told. “Listen if there is anything you need just let me know,” he claimed. That’s exactly what I didn’t want to hear. It was the reason why I locked myself in my room, to escape from that untruthful statement. Damn if I had a dollar for every time someone told me that over the past few weeks. “Ok thank you Mr. Hatmaker, I appreciate it.” I said looking down at him, he is a very short man compared to me. “What did I tell you about calling Mr. Hatmaker?” “It’s Caleb to you, ok?” he said with that disgusting grin emerging on his face. “Sorry sir I keep forgetting.” We discussed work for a moment and he told me to take a week off, I thanked him and showed him out. I walked back to my bed to lay down and continue sobbing and wallowing in my own pain.

No one seemed to understand the severity of my situation. I had just lost my wonderful mother. The woman that was looked at by many as a saint, is now gone forever. I felt so hopeless, my whole world had been turned upside down within a 24 hour period. There were two exhausting thoughts that constantly looped through my mind on my week off from work. “I miss my mother so much” was the worst one. It was just a constant reminder that she is now dead. The woman I love more than anyone else in the world will soon merely be another forgotten corpse rotting in the ground. The other nagging thought that will also most likely aid in my downfall to a path of depression and alcoholism was assisting the other in pestering me. “What am I going to do now?” My mother was the person that took care of us all. While dad was at work I would be at school and going to work right after, and there she was at home. She was always working towards making the best damn home anyone could ever come to. All of our clothes were washed, never a trace of dirt could be found inside, and that cooking, my God! You could never ask to come home to a better meal then what came from my mother’s kitchen. There is no doubt in my mind that I lived in every man’s idea of utopia. I never took my mother’s troubles for granted, I always gave her the gratitude she deserved unlike my father who didn’t. I just couldn’t stop thinking how could I ever match up with my mom’s outstanding performance? How can I possible keep up with the cooking and cleaning? Especially being in school and working every day.
 By day two on my week of recovery allowed by Caleb, I knew I couldn’t bear the rest of the week without some type of crutch. I called up my father’s friend Mac, he’s a well-known drug dealer in our town. He answered after just a few rings. As soon as I told him who I was he automatically knew what I was perusing. “What all do you need and how much do you need?” He asked in a professional tone of voice. “15 of those blue speckles, bring me 3 grams of the snow that came from the snow storm a few days ago, a small bag of that special herb from your garden (I was aware of his garden because I have heard my father compliment him on his growing skills), and a bottle of the highest proof whiskey available.” I tried to talk in code the best I could. Usually when he hung out with my dad I would frequently hear his paranoid ramblings of the police tapping his phone. “Ok buddy I’ll be there as fast as I can.” This was the first time I actually detected some real promise in someone’s voice since my mother’s passing. Not even an hour later he was knocking on the door. Opening the door he immediately greeted me with a comforting hug. Mac is probably the most caring drug dealer I have ever encountered. He Knew I didn’t invite him for small talk. I could tell he was trying to get to the point as fast as possible. He handed me a shopping bag containing my supplies with a friendly smile on his face saying, “don’t worry I won’t tell your dad about this I remember what it was like when I lost my mother.” “Mac you have no idea how much I appreciate you doing this man, how much do I owe you?” “Nothing at all, you and your whole family have helped me more times than I can count on my fingers and toes combined, don’t sweat it kid.” I insisted he took my money, but there was no point in trying anymore with the stubborn old man. “Well the least you could do is sit down with me and do a few lines of this blow.” I said smiling while pulling out the white gold. “Well it looks like you got me there, how could I pass that up?” He sat down next to me as I cut out 6 lines, I knew this was going to cheer me up. After a while he announced he had to get home to his old lady before she started calling. We said our goodbyes and he wished me plenty of good luck and then he was out the door before I knew it. My over indulging had started. This is when the drugs started to take hold of my mind, rendering my ability to rationalize. 

It was probably the drugs causing my brain to produce and entertain the insane thought but I was determined to go for it. I wanted to prepare my mother’s body for the funeral. Most of you are probably thinking what the hell is wrong with you? I really don’t know, but now that I look back at it with a sober mind I realize it was fucked up, but please understand it was the best decision I’ve ever made. If I hadn’t wanted this, I would have never been able to stop the sickening and depraved acts that were occurring in the Green Valley Funeral Home. 

I lost count of how many shots of whiskey I had. The onset of the stuff was fast, I could compare its strength to Everclear. I sat and practiced what I was going to say to Caleb for about 10 minutes. I then frantically searched for my phone. I’m sure my mother would have been ashamed to see me stumbling around the house in that manner. Once I found my phone I did a small victory dance to celebrate my accomplishment, afterword’s I called Caleb immediately. I felt like I was stuck listening to his Fur Elise ring back tone for an eternity. Eventually he answered. His scraggly high pitched voice lunged into my ears from the other line. “Hello?” Hearing his voice triggered my gag reflex and caused me to drop my phone and vomit all over the floor. I could hear his voice carrying throughout my room as if he was standing there next to me. “Jason is that you?” “Hey are you alright?” I scooped up my phone from what looked like pure concentrated bile on the floor.  “What the heel took ye so damn long Calerrb?” I screamed slurring every word without any attempt to hide my intoxication. “Is everything ok Jason?” “Do you need help with something?” More screaming and slurring from my end, “Listen dude, listen, I want to prepare my mommas body for the funeral, I’ll be up there tomorrow to do it, kee?” “Umm Jason I don’t think that would be appropriate and I think what you are asking of me will not contribute to your healing process in a positive way.” “Ahhhhh fuck yooooouuu Calerb!” I exclaimed. “Ok well you’re obviously drunk. Jason I understand your frustration, just sleep it off and we will talk tomorrow.” I threw my phone down in a rage without even hanging up. I then proceeded to scream hateful things about him, which I do not know if he herd or not, but I honestly I don’t care and it wouldn’t matter anymore if I did.
The next morning was miserable. To my awakening I found myself lying on the floor accompanied by that well-known “trainwreck” hang over. I’ve had a few hangovers in my days but never like this. I sat myself up against my bed while trying to recall everything that happened in the previous night. I remembered getting shit faced but nothing more, so I decided a relaxing shower would help it come back to me. Standing there it hit me. “That’s right I had called Caleb! Oh shit what all did I say?” I quickly finished up so I could check my cell phone to confirm the thought. I found it behind my bed covered in dried up vomit, “great” I thought. I managed to clean the remaining discharge but I am positive the smell is forever embedded into the inside component’s, just my luck huh? There it was in my call history, a 20 minute ongoing call with the psycho (that’s his contact name). 1 unread message from “the psycho” displayed up in my notification bar. It read, “Jason call me when you get this we need to talk, love Caleb.” I was puzzled. Why the fuck did I call him last night? It’s as if I had blacked out the whole phone conversation. “I guess I need to call and figure all of this out.”

I’m a huge fan of classical music such as; orchestra, aria/opera, famous compositions from Beethoven, Franz Wohlfahrt, etcetera, but son of a bitch do I hate Caleb’s ring back tone of Fur Elise. I used to adore this beautiful masterpiece, but somehow he made me despise every fucking note. After 1 minute and 30 agonizing seconds he answered. “Jason?” Why would he waste my time questioning me with his disgusting voice if he already knew it was me, does he ever check his caller id? “Yes, you wanted to speak with me sir?” I questioned back. “Yeah umm I just wanted to talk about last night. You were a bit intoxicated and forgive me if I upset you. You requested to prepare your mother’s body for her funeral.” “Yeah I’m so sorry I don’t remember that I was very drunk, I apologize for that Mr. Hatmaker.” “Oh its ok we’ve all had those nights before. I’m happy to see you realized it just wasn’t an appropriate thing.” It all came back to me, I remembered parts of the conversation and my demented wish. Then I thought, “the fucking nerve this guy has.” He tells me he’s glad I realized the error of my ways, well fuck him. “What do you mean I realized it was inappropriate” I snapped back at him. “I beg your pardon?” Ugh, his annoying questions, they make me want to barf. “I still want this, I know I may seem like a lunatic to you but to me this is important.” I was improvising at this point. “Jason as your friend and your boss (he put a lot of emphasis on the word boss) I forbid you to do any such thing.” The tone of his voice sounded defensive thus giving me the impression there is some sort of secret involved. Now I’m curious, time to put all the years of reading detective comics to good use. I assumed it would be a good idea to agree and throw him off guard, I guess it’s time to use what I learned in drama club from high school. I burst into tears spontaneously, “God Mr. Hatmaker your right, this is over the line and I can’t do this, what was I thinking? I’m so sorry I put you in this spot and caused an uncomfortable situation for you. I’m such a fool.” I sobbed without shame. “Jason you are not stupid. You are the most brilliant young man I’ve had the pleasure to meet and work with. This kind of thing happens to everyone, God knows I have went through this. Now don’t let me ever catch you talking down about yourself again.” “Sorry sir it won’t happen again, I promise.” I said trying to sound promising. “That’s what I like to hear! Jason just please get some rest and go easy on the booze, it’s not good for you. I will see you at the funeral Saturday.” I kept picturing him saying this with a smile on his face. “Ok Mr. Hatmaker, have a good day.” I was almost ashamed of myself for kissing his ass, but it was necessary. “Oh and Jason its Caleb to you.” “Yes sir, sorry, goodbye.” It was a great success. Now that I threw him off guard he will not be expecting me. This is my chance to get to the bottom of all of my suspicions, I knew for sure I was going to find something out. I knew I would expose him for whatever evil mischief things he was hiding. 

I was like a Special Forces navy seal preparing for his mission. I gathered my trusty 9mm handgun with my shoulder holster, my old timer pocket knife that my dad gave me when I was ten years old, and finally my steel toed boots, just in case I needed to give a powerful kick to something. I was ready to go to the Green Valley Funeral Home, I was ready to uncover the truth, but before I left I needed to request some special help. I got down on my knees for what could possibly be the last time, and prayed. “God I know I’m not the best person in the world but I think I’m doing something good here, please guide me and keep me safe from whatever I might face at the funeral home, and if I do fail and maybe even die, please don’t send me to hell, sincerely with love, Jason.” I now felt more confident than Rambo. 

It didn’t take long to arrive, 10 minutes at the max. Which is unusual. Typically it takes about 20 minutes from my house, I guess I was too busy thinking about what might be in store for me so it must have made the duration of the trip seem quicker. There I was in the parking lot, panicking. I didn’t have much confidence at the time most likely from my anxiety disorders. Staring at the entrance with hundreds of thoughts rushing through my head, all kinds of different scenarios were agitating my nerves and making it worse. I gave myself a quick pep talk and said fuck it, let’s do this!

Palms sweating and shaking I reached for the doorknob of the entrance, trying to make as little sound as possible to avoid alerting Caleb. There are no type of alarms to let him know I was here, also we are the only two people who run the place, besides the janitor that comes after hours. So I knew staying silent was the main goal of my mission. The funeral home was dead silent as usual so it made being stealthy quite difficult, especially with the occasional squeaky floor board. I finally made my way to the entrance of the morgue, the door was already slightly open. “He must be working on someone” I thought.  

I peaked my head into the door and what I saw before me was the beginning of a homicide. My mother’s body was on the table lying in a pool of blood. She had been mangled and dismembered. Her stomach had been torn open in a sloppy savage way, her small intestines along with many other vital organs were lying next to her. On top of her was Caleb, completely nude and thrusting into my mother. My heart skipped a beat. I had expected to find many things but never this. I couldn’t even imagine such a horrible thing. My whole body shook I could feel my face burning my fist squeezing so tight they felt like they were going to bleed, my raw animal instinct was coming. I pushed myself towards him trying to stay quiet I wanted to take him by surprise. I grabbed his red ponytail and jerked back with all my strength sending us both crazing down to the floor. I quickly got myself up and grabbed his hair once again. I spotted a nearby scalpel and put it to his throat. He laughed, the stupid fuck started laughing hissing even. “You want an explanation I’m guessing? I told you not to come down here Jason.” “im going to fucking kill you, you fucking sick son of a bitch.” I screamed and strained so hard my whole head was shaking my face was on fire, I knew my screams could be heard throughout the funeral home. I even startled myself a little, I felt like a monster, I had never raised my voice in such a way before. I didn’t even know I was capable of this. “You don’t have it in you,” he said laughing. This fueled my anger even more, I’m glad he said this it sure helped. I’m punched him in the face and he went straight the ground with a broken and bloody nose. I mounted him and used the scalpel to slash away at his face but controlling myself to not kill him, I wanted keep him alive for a long time, I wanted to play. With each slash more and more blood squirted onto my face, I kept my eyes closed to keep it out of my eyes. This was the first time I enjoyed Caleb’s voice, his screams of pain sounded like music to my ears. “Please stop I’ve had enough, please!” I stopped because I didn’t want to accidently hit any major veins in his neck. I turned him around and slashed both of his Achilles tendons just so he couldn’t run away from me. He was constantly screaming “Jason please stop! I’m sorry!” I ignored every word I had turned into a killing machine. I cut away at both is legs leaving them a mangled mess of meat and bone. I then moved to his dorsal cavity and made small incisions so he would lose more blood to make him weaker, but I didn’t want him to bleed out, not yet. I moved down to his penis and cut it off along with his testicles. Louder high pitch screams came from him. I knew now he would bleed out soon so I should work on torturing him a little more. I cut at all of the sensitive nerve points I knew on his body just to inflict more pain. I propped his head up on my knee and put a hand on his lower jaw and upper. I pulled the opposite way on each hand trying to break his lower jaw, I could feel him resisting, his lower jaw was too strong. I threw his head onto the ground and raised my boot into a kicking position. With full force I kicked his lower jaw and broke it completely free, it has now lost all function. I picked his head up and shoved my fist as hard as I possibly could into his mouth, I could feel my arm making its way down his esophagus. He was chocking and coughing trying to plead for me to stop. I kept going full force. My arm had completely blocked his airway so his chocking ceased. It didn’t take him long to suffocate which disappointed me.

Looking down at his mangled body gave me a great feeling of justice. I looked around the morgue and saw things I didn’t see earlier. There were more bodies. All dismembered and covered in semen and blood. There was a small portable gas stove on the ground with a piece of human flesh sitting in the skillet. How much worse can this get? I thought.  I thought it would be a good idea to leave a note for the police to let them know who he was. So I went to office to fetch a pen and some paper. Searching through his doors I found a key to his safe. I opened and found numerous locks of hair and teeth, it’s like he was keeping them as trophies. I found what looked like a photo album that I believe may be bound in human flesh. Inside were hundreds of pictures of Caleb posing with dead bodies and violating them, but none of them seemed to be in the gory mangled state my mother was in, he went all out on her. Why did he have to worse things to her? Many of the cadavers in the photos were people I knew and worked on a little myself. I couldn’t take anymore. I needed to finish up as soon as possible. I sat down at his desk to write a note for the police letting them know I was a vigilante getting rid of the scum of the earth. I avoided writing my hand writing just in case this was linked back to me.

 I carried the safe and note back to the morgue and lied them beside his body. I then retraced my all my steps with a rag to wipe all my finger prints towards the murder but none in the places I work so it won’t look like I was involved, after all I just work here right? After I cleaned as much blood as I possibly could from myself I left and went straight home. I spend the next three days in bed. I was disgusted with myself for doing all of those horrible things. I kept thinking, “am I a just as much of a monster as Caleb Hatmaker?” I couldn’t be, what I did was a good thing. I just kept telling myself this, I tried to assure myself that this feeling would pass soon.

The incident was all over the news. Later that day sheriff Kacey was knocking on my door as I expected. I opened the door and greeted him. “Hi there, can I help you with something sheriff?” I was trying so hard not to panic, I couldn’t stop my limbs from shaking, it was very obvious. The little voice in my head kept telling me, “oh you’ve done it now Jason he’s going to catch you.” “Your Jason Bozinsky right?” He asked in a stern voice. “Yes sir that is correct, come on in sir and make yourself at home. Now is something wrong?” I could even detect to fear in my own voice, I’m sure he could too. He stepped inside and I closed the door behind him. “Mr. Bozinsky are you aware that your boss Caleb Hatmaker was murdered a few days ago?” My heart started to pound. I tried to sound surprised and frightened. “What? When did this happen? Who did this? Can you give me some details?” “Well we don’t know who did it yet but it turns out that your boss Caleb was a pretty sick person. He has eaten and had sex with hundreds of corpses and we believe he may have been a serial killer also.” I tried to play along and look clueless. I sat down on my couch and put my head into my hands. “I just can’t believe any of this sheriff, I just saw him not long ago, he gave me some time off work because my mother died.” “Yeah I thought so, that’s one thing I wanted to talk to you about, your mother.” He began to tell me about the things he did to my mother, I burst out into tears but they weren’t fake, it just brought back all the pain all over again. Kacey sat down beside me. “Jason we checked Caleb’s phone records and you were the last person to speak with him, we also have a witness saying they saw your car leaving the scene at the time of his death.” His voice wasn’t stern anymore, it was compassionate. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, are you trying to say I did this?” “Jason I know you were the one who killed him, but I want you to know I don’t blame you one damn bit. There is more evidence that points towards you that will eventually lead to your arrest. “Your right I’m not going to hide it, I’m not ashamed of what I did, I did this town a favor and everyone is going to be on my side.” I said defending myself.” Kacey smiled and said, “Jason don’t worry I have an interview with the press at 5:00 and I’m letting them know I’m closing the case, there is no evidence for us to go on and the killer has most likely fled the state, therefore it is out of my hands.” “Are you serious? How can I ever repay you for this?” It was such a generous thing he was doing for me, I wanted to repay him somehow. “You’re joking right? You don’t need to repay me in anyway Jason Bozinsky, you have done more for this town than I have or any other sheriff has. You truly are a hero.” I just couldn’t believe what he was saying to me. I was getting off the hook and now I’m looked at as a hero. Kacey stood up and walked to the door but before leaving he turned around and said, “Now get some rest you’re going to need it to run the funeral home once it gets cleaned up and reopened.” I was a little confused. “What do you mean sheriff?” I’m going to make arrangements with mayor to make sure you gain ownership of the funeral home, you deserve it and plus you’re the only person in this town that can run it.” I smiled at him and thanked him, “thank you sheriff, I really appreciate what you’re doing for me.” “No problem,” he said smiling, he tipped his cowboy hat as a wave goodbye and left. 

The sheriff and I both feel that I have restored this town, I fixed a major flaw. Although the sheriff and myself are the only two people in the whole world that know the secret victory, I’m sure the rest of the town would be proud of me for what I have done. Overall this has been one big cluster fuck of madness. I’ve lost my mom, the most important person in my life, but then again I look at it like she was sacrificed so I could do something great for my life and the other resident’s lives here as well. Caroline Bozinsky died so I could fix this now near perfect town. My mother’s sacrifice gave me the opportunity of a stable job that is now the basic building blocks of starting a family. My mother is still doing things for me from the grave.

22h9li,1,2014-04-07,I need advice on my college decision. I'm sutck between 2 schools...,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/22h9li/i_need_advice_on_my_college_decision_im_sutck/,"Hullo. I am a high-school senior. I live in the suburbs of a relatively large city in the United States. I come from an upper-middle class background. My family has 4 members, including me.

I am currently in a dilemma, that is very discouraging to me. I have currently been in the long process of deciding what University I wish to attend in the coming fall. I have narrowed my options down to two colleges, yet I feel that I am at a grid-lock point in my decision. I'm sure my case is one that many can relate to. I'm not looking for any definitive decision, just some more perspectives.
This is my situation:

I have a weighted GPA of 4.3. I got a 31 on my ACT. I have been involved in my high schools music program, and my church's mission work. I am also an Eagle Scout. I am taking 3 AP classes this year, and have taken 2 in previous years (receiving a 5 on both)

In college I hope to study History, and perhaps double-major or minor in International Studies or Political Science. Graduate School is probable for me as well.

(Note: I am not really interested in partying, nor am i considering that a factor in my decision)

As I mentioned, I am currently stuck between two schools. The first college is a large state university, I'll refer to it as StateU. The other is a small Liberal Arts school, which will henceforth be called LA-U.

StateU is a very large, very popular university in my state. The school is know nation-wide, largely for its sports programs.
 I have grown up with much exposure to the school. My feelings towards the school have always been rather negative. The sports fans for this school are rather obnoxious. I am also bothered by the fact that many students from my high school will be attending this college also. For me I have seen StateU as a very cliche option for higher education.
 During my visits to this school, I learned more about what StateU offers academically. I was impressed. StateU has a good History program, and has much flexibility to double-major. Their career guidance programs also seem good, with some connections to international work as well, an area I am very interested in.
The cost of attendance (tuition+other fees)  at StateU would be about $20,000 per year. However I received a full-tuition scholarship from StateU, and would only pay about $10,000 per year to attend.

LA-U is a tiny liberal arts school, that is about the same distance from my home as StateU is. I had never heard of LA-U until my college search. My mother stumbled upon LA-U while searching for some smaller schools online.
 I visited LA-U without knowing what to expect. I was blown away.  LA-U has a nice History program, but is more focused on the broad skills developed by a liberal arts degree rather than knowing/memorizing specific History facts. I really saw this same Liberal Arts concept/mission everywhere in LA-U, and I loved it. One student specifically said that a college degree isn't meant to train you for a specific job, but to develop the tools so you can do any job. 
Speaking of jobs, I was completely astounded with the Career development program the LA-U used. They have strong connections with alumni to offer many internships, and work with the student from day one on looking forward to the career the want to seek. They have mock interviews and individual counselor to help develop your interviewing and career-exploration.
LA-U appears to be an academically rigorous university (a good thing in my opinion), more so than StateU.
I enjoyed the small campus environment of LA-U, but I would not say that campus size is a major factor in my opinion.
I perhaps feel as though my liberal-arts major of History would be well suited in a Liberal Arts college like LA-U.

The biggest conflict is in price. LA-U's cost of attendance would be about $60,000 per year. I did receive scholarship money worth about $20,000 per year. I would be hit with a price tag of about $40,000. I did not receive any need-based aid.

My family does not have the kind of money for LA-U saved, and I would have to take out student loans to attend LA-U, while I would not have to for StateU.

If you couldn't tell, LA-U is the college would really like to attend, and that I could be excited about. While I am appalled with the idea of attending StateU, (the college I've grown up dreading) they are a nice college academically. At the same time, I just feel as though StateU isn't very ""me"". I find it hard to picture myself attending StateU. But the ability to get out of college without major debts and loans seems like a major advantage for life after college. With the distinct possibility of grad school, this is also a major plus.

I know I should not judge StateU based off the notions I've held about it in the past, and more on my experience with it, but I have a difficult time dispelling these negative feelings towards it. I imagine myself being very embarrassed to tell my peers that I am attending StateU, and would likely avoid discussing my decision with most people because I this same embarrassment.

Maybe this is a conflict between the head (logic) and the heart(feelings).  My strong desire is LA-U, but StateU seems more realistic.

If you have advice/a new idea/a new outlook/encouragement/anything really, that would be greatly appreciated. I am currently loosing much sleep over this decision, and need some more outlooks.

If you have any questions for me, plead feel free to ask!
 Thank you!"
22hh4y,31,2014-04-07,No Internship. Difficult to get a job?,ohThisUsername,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22hh4y/no_internship_difficult_to_get_a_job/,"I recently found this subreddit and I have *tons* of questions but I'll start with my most basic one today.

I'm currently just finishing up my 3rd year of a Computer Science degree with a concentration in Software Engineering, and also a business-related Minor to pad my resume. While probably 95% of all people in my year are heading off to do internships next year, I am not. Since my first year I have been determined to finish school as quickly as possible so I can get a job sooner even if that means skipping a year of doing an internship. I was once talking with a graduated Engineer who said she got a job without an internship while all her classmates did internships, so I kinda felt relaxed. 

It's only really dawned on me in the last couple months that it was probably a bad idea to skip the internship. Based on my experience at school, I seem to have more applicable programming knowledge than most of my classmates (I've been programming since about 14 years old), however I don't have any professional experience, or personal projects to prove to employers I know what I am doing. I'll be competing with these other people who have done an internship.

My current GPA is also pretty low at 2.7, but I should be able to get it past 3.0 by the time I graduate.

TLDR; Didn't do an internship, will it be hard to find a job?

Anyone here have experience with getting a job without an internship? Was it difficult?

22hi4w,5,2014-04-07,How much should I be expecting with an Associates Degree in Computer Science?,dracul104,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22hi4w/how_much_should_i_be_expecting_with_an_associates/,"I will be attaining my Associates Degree next month, and I currently have an internship at a small company in the Columbus, Ohio area developing web sites and PHP web applications. It's not my dream job but it's a start. I've enjoyed the internship for the most part, and I feel I've learned a lot from it. This has been my only professional experience in programming. The initial internship period of 3 months ends soon, but they've offered to keep me on part time (up to 30 hours a week) for another 3 months, after which they would bring me on as a full time employee.

This would all sound great to me, except for the fact that I was expecting a higher salary then what they are offering for the full time position. I am currently making $12/hr for the internship, which I am happy with considering it's an internship. When I inquired about the starting salary if I accepted the full time position in three months, at first I was told it would be the same. When I raised my concerns with this amount, they said they could offer as high as $13/hr.

So my question is, is this a typical starting salary for someone with just an Associates Degree? From what I've read, the general consensus is that an Associates in this field is pretty useless. Should I be happy I can even find a job without a Bachelor's degree? I'm probably going to stay with them for the extra three months part time so I can finish school, but I'd like to scope out my options upon graduation. Am I wasting my time applying for other jobs without a Bachelor's degree or more experience?"

The initial internship period of 3 months ends soon, but they've offered to keep me on part time (up to 30 hours a week) for another 3 months, after which they would bring me on as a full time employee.

This would all sound great to me, except for the fact that I was expecting a higher salary then what they are offering for the full time position. I am currently making $12/hr for the internship, which I am happy with considering it's an internship. When I inquired about the starting salary if I accepted the full time position in three months, at first I was told it would be the same. When I raised my concerns with this amount, they said they could offer as high as $13/hr.

So my question is, is this a typical starting salary for someone with just an Associates Degree? From what I've read, the general consensus is that an Associates in this field is pretty useless. Should I be happy I can even find a job without a Bachelor's degree? I'm probably going to stay with them for the extra three months part time so I can finish school, but I'd like to scope out my options upon graduation. Am I wasting my time applying for other jobs without a Bachelor's degree or more experience?"

I'm at an excellent school with great STEM and CS programs, I've worked two coding internships during previous summers, and I'm currently working a web development job for a professor on campus. I'm looking for work for this coming summer, but I have a few problems:

* I shot myself in the foot by not taking any CS courses this year, putting me at a disadvantage relative to my peers.
* I'm only a freshman. Based on my experience, employers who say they're looking for ""undergraduates"" really mean they're looking for juniors and seniors.
* I'm still (perhaps irrationally) really focused on academics, and (perhaps more rationally) on spending time with friends, so much so that I have little (read: no) time to code or work on side projects. For that matter, I sometimes think I don't even enjoy side-projects. I know that I have loved coding in the past, and there are aspects of it that still really appeal to me, but there's a lot of drudgery involved, and it's hard to get myself to put in the 2-3 hours per day to actually get stuff done (15 minutes / day does nothing at all). My ""lack of time"" is also making me unable to fulfill the additional ""requirements"" of blogging, tweeting, posting to github, and generally being active in Internet communities -- all things I would like to do more of, though. I want to go into CS and software engineering as a career, but hell, I don't want to code in my free-time that much atm -- or, if I decide to, I'm going to somehow need to manage my class work and coding, which I have absolutely no idea how to do.
* I've already applied to ~25-30 positions over the past few months, and I haven't yet gotten a definitive response from anyone. I know I shouldn't be and that this doesn't matter, but I am a bit discouraged.

How can I get a paid gig for the summer? (Pay is quite important to me, because of my family's financial background.)"

[previous](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/22ed9z/wireless/)

So today was my first official day on the job after being essentially a non-paid intern for 4 days.

It started off as any day at a normal office. Arrived at the office nice and early with my coffee and bagel in hand. Walked inside, sign in, went to the office to my brand new shiny desk. Sat down and just took it all in as I gently sipped my coffee of the gods and said hello to the only other IT ""tech"" there already. 

Of course I am referring to my new friend, the IT punching bag. Turns out that punching bag has a name... ""USER"" as in Ultra Stress/Stupidity Elevation Reliever. 

The day was pretty low key.I said the words ""off"", ""and"", and ""on"" about 5 dozen times, imaged a network drive for myself, and took a gander at the server room. Although I am skilled in hardware, high level software, java, javascript, html5, and C++ I know nothing when it comes to server software. I know what each physical part does, but the actual managing of servers is not my forte so that is why I am glad it is not in my job description. 

ANYWAYS... So about an hour after lunch I get a ticket from the security guys. It read as follows...

""One of our cameras is out, picture not moving""

I grabbed my trusty screwdrivers (I always take a philip's head and flat head when I take any kind of ticket what so ever because you never know) and went down to the security department. Now there are certain areas under constant PTZ camera surveillance. This case is the motor pool because it is a razor wired area in which we park our propane trucks. (I just realized that I forgot to mention that the place I work at distributes propane to many states) So I get down there and take a look. The fat guard (FG) shows me the issue.

**FG**: See I press the button to pan the camera right, left, up, and down and nothing happens. But when I press zoom it zooms. *he proceeds to show me and sure enough he is correct, however, I notice that something doesn't look right when he zooms in*

**Me**: Here let me take a look. *I fiddle with the controls and check the logs. Sure enough the commands are sent without error.* hmmm odd. Did you try (the slogan of every IT tech in the world) turning it off and back on again?

**FG**: Yes.

**Me**: *Holy shit, wasn't expecting that answer*

I go outside and take a look and what I expected was the issue was indeed. Someone had pulled a prank and taped a picture of the lot over the lens. I radioed **FG** to pan the camera just to check that it was indeed working and thank god it was. I call out **FG** to show him the prank. He has a good laugh. (the motor pool in question is usually empty because it is used to park the broken down trucks, but our mechanics are so efficient that there is hardly ever anything in the lot) As I reach up to yank off the photo this humorous ticket turned idiot faster than a DDR3 RAM swap.

**FG**: I can't let you do that. You don't have security clearance to physically alter the cameras.

**Me**: *scoff* ya and you don't have the clearance to fit in a desk chair with arms. You guys are hilarious *reaches for the photo again*

**FG**: Halt, I am serious you do not have clearance to physically alter cameras Professor_Derpsalot! You can only fix software issues.

**Me**: I am not even going to touch the camera, just the paper scotch taped onto it.

**FG**: I can't let you.

**Me**: Well then who in Eternia has the clearance? *A-thank you*

**FG**: I'm gonna go call the company listed electrician to do this.

**Me**: Umm okay, you do that I am going to be right back.

I then went and had a nice ""chat"" with my good friend USER and returned. By the time I had returned the electrician had already arrived and it took him an entire 10 minutes of checking in, taking a look, writing a summary of what is wrong and what he will do, turning it into the security department head, yanking off the piece of paper, and checking out. And of course he probably charged for an hour of work time.

I am glad this job is easy, but for the love of all that is 0 and 1 what is with ""non-techies""?

**TL;DR** Apparently paper and tape is a high level security risk. We better go arrest some kindergarteners."

My GPA for the first semester last year was 3.15, and my GPA for the second semester last year was 3.76, but my overall GPA is still an absolutely awful 2.68.

What's worse, aside from my classes I have absolutely nothing to put on my resume for an eventual job. I have no extracurricular activities or projects that would benefit me, and I have no time to pursue them currently, already having a full course load this semester.

The only real hope I have for finding a job at this point is getting an internship, but none of the internships I've applied to have responded to me at all. The closest I've gotten is an online interview from Discovery Communications, but after two months they haven't responded at all, even after calling and leaving a message for the hiring manager.

I'm getting the distinct feeling now that I'll never be able to find a job at all at this point. Is there anything I'll be able to do? Will studying for a degree turn out to just be a huge waste of time, effort, and money on my part?

So I'm currently an MSEE student in my second semester of grad school. I'm hoping to graduate next May, but I may have to push it to August of 2015. Nevertheless, I know that I'll be wanting to apply for jobs in the next 4-8 months. I'm trying to get some feedback on my situation and any skills I should try and pick up so that I'm a more appealing candidate.

I'm not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this question, so if it isn't someone should kindly redirect me to the correct sub and I'll delete/repost!

*In undergrad I had two internships:*

-Regional utility working in planning and running power systems analysis

-On the business-engineering side of things at a Fortune 500 semiconductor corporation

*In grad, I've taken courses in a completely different field than what I did in undergrad:*

-Pattern Classification

-Stochastic Processes

-Image Processing

-Radar Signal Processing

 Thus, I'm sort of on the machine learning-type track. 

*Next year, I'll probably take courses like:*

-Computational Intelligence

-Unsupervised Learning

*My research deals with:*

-Landmine detection (lump of image processing and pattern classification)


*My concern is:*

I'm afraid that I'll be, rightly so, lumped together with a plethora of computer science and computer engineering candidates. Unfortunately, I feel this is bad because I don't have the same background as them. For example, my entire research deals with MATLAB and I don't truly know C, C++, etc. I have small experience in Python, but the only language I feel like I could confidently say I utilize and understand fully is MATLAB, which may not be the hottest ticket in the job market. 

I feel like I should be teaching myself some more programming languages, but I'm just not sure. I wanted to hear what other engineering students had to say. Of course, I'll ask my advisers as well.

22izmh,1,2014-04-08,Is there ever a reason to get a MA in Econ?,econ_grad_student,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/22izmh/is_there_ever_a_reason_to_get_a_ma_in_econ/,"I've applied and have been accepted to some MA programs in Econ - programs that advertise PhD prep as a benefit and are ranked in the #20 - #35 range. I know there's a lot of distaste for these programs, but it seems like the best option for me right now. I'm wondering if I'm wrong, and looking for some constructive feedback or reassurance.

I couldn't apply to PhD programs this year, plus I doubt I could have gotten into a top program, and I'm not sure I have the qualifications to get a good research position for a gap year to improve my resume significantly. 

Right now, I *think* next year I either want to go for an econ phd &amp; law program or earn another masters in urban planning. I'm not 100% sure though. I have a great liberal arts resume - double major (one was econ, other was comm), 3.7 GPA, some internship experience, slightly less than desirable quant GRE score (161) (though I'll be retaking later this year), I'm completing multivariate &amp; linear algebra by the end of the summer, and I did an undergrad econ thesis, so I've got just a little research experience.

I'm looking for some feedback on my reasoning for going to one of these MA programs.

Reasons to go:

* Chance to learn from / make connections with *really* great faculty ( huge majority with PhDs from top 10s) - maybe do some research with them too

* Focus more on school rather than extra-curriculars and earn that 4.0

* Sort out my interests in Econ - decide if the urban planning or behavioral law and econ route is right, or if I should do something else

* No undergrad debt at all, so picking up a little graduate debt wouldn't be the end of the world

* Prepare me for a PhD more than my undergrad institution / help me make sure I want to commit to a PhD

* Possibility of transfer credit to PhD program...maybe? Anyone know how common this is?

* Live in a cool city


Reasons not to go:

* 50K total cost and lost wages

* If I go to a PhD program, I'd get a masters anyway... so this will end up as a second (extra useless?) masters

* Losing a possible year of work experience (again, don't know if I'd be qualified for the kind of job that could help me get into a top program).


So, am I totally wrong to be leaning towards going to this program now? If I decided I was done after this MA, would it buy me anything at all? "
22j1d8,1,2014-04-08,If anyone could offer insight into the statement of intent I would appreciate it,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/22j1d8/if_anyone_could_offer_insight_into_the_statement/,"*I am in the process of applying to a MS program for Business Analytics. I feel that my intangibles are pretty strong, but my grades and test scores are just a bit below average. I am hoping to make my case in the statement of intent, but I've never written anything like this before and I'm finding it more difficult then I thought it would be. This is my rough draft, so far:*

It is appropriate that two of my most memorable and life shaping experiences happened in my last year of undergraduate studies. Appropriate, because 2013 was the year I started to take my education seriously. In high school and my first years at college, I lacked the guidance and wisdom to define a clear, strategic vision my future. Fortunately, since then, I have turned a corner. I am confident that my future lies in Business Analytics, and that the best way to achieve this is the MS program at *****************.

The first of these life-altering events was when I was hired to be a tutor for MSIS 212, Managerial Decision Making. A mid-level, required management course, 212 focuses on finding real world solutions to business problems by using Excel to build linear programming models, tree charts, and simulations. This was my first exposure to mathematical modeling, and I was enthralled. I enjoyed the class immensely, and when I was recommended by the professor to be a tutor I jumped at the chance. However, it quickly became apparent that the problems I found logical and intuitive were anything but for some other students. So, over the course of the year, I got to grapple with these problems I had breezed through in a much different way. By explaining (and re-explaining), the concepts I was able to begin to appreciate the complexities of the subject matter, and start to truly understand the magnitude of the possibilities that could result from these methods. 

Secondly, I was blessed with the chance to attend the INFORMS Analytics and Operations Research Conference in Boston. This was an incredible, eye-opening experience. I was stunned by the depth and complexity of demonstrations, and by the enormous potential for actionable insights drawn from the conclusions. By the end of the three days I was exhausted, mentally and physically, but more intrigued then I had ever been. 

An advanced degree in Business or Predictive Analytics is the next logical step for me. I have completed my studies in Supply Chain and minored in Sustainability. I relish the qualitative aspects of my education so far, but I am hungry for more substantial quantitative methods. INFORMS was just a taste of what I view as the incredible pool of possibilities. I see education as a lifelong pursuit, and while I intend to continue to broaden and deepen my knowledge of both SCM and the clean tech and sustainability sphere, it is analytics that will give me the tools to make a lasting impact in those areas. 

A main reason I am able to form this perspective is the education I’ve received outside the classroom. Working part time jobs, mainly in the food service industry, since age 16 has immersed me in an industry that values long hours and hard work. I have worked 30 – 40 hour work weeks for years, sometimes while attending to a full schedule of classes, but it was never a negative. I relished the work, because there was always a clear objective, and the harder I worked the bigger and brighter that objective became. Whether it was tips in a serving job, or a promotion at a catering company, I’ve consistently found that hard work mixed with the right opportunity will bring me success. This clear vision of the goal is a big piece of what was lacking my first couple years of college, and an even bigger piece of what I have gained since then. 

In three years, I see myself working in an analytical operations capacity at a cutting edge clean tech company. In five years, I will be working at the crossroads of supply chain and sustainability, using predictive modeling to provide actionable insights into methods that can help companies drive profits by becoming more efficient while lowering and mitigating their environmental footprint. There is no doubt in my mind that I will need substantial training in these areas to reach my goals, and similarly, no doubt that ************** is the place to attain that training. 

There are many aspects of the MS Business Analytics program and ** itself which lead me to believe this. From the impressive corporate sponsors of the internship program to the logical balance of the classes between mathematical business intelligence and the interpretation and gathering of insights from data, it is clearly a complete package. Additionally, I firmly identify with the campus wide commitment to sustainability and “****************”, a phrase I take to heart in every facet of my life. I would be honored to be a principle graduate of the MSBA program, and proud to carry on a rich *************** tradition of hard work and spectacular achievement.

*What do you think? Any obvious improvements to be made? Any big shortcomings? I think the beginning is a bit weak, but I am trying to explain why my grades were not as good as they should/could have been in my first couple of years.* 

*Thanks for taking the time to read it, even if you don't comment.*

In total we had about 10 full-time employees. 

Boss, being cheap, had recently increased the amount of part-time interns working for us to try and handle the extra work. 

Boss, being dumb, didn't seem to realize that somebody had to train these interns as we were not in The Matrix and couldn't just upload skills to their brains when they came in.

We were falling behind on work while trying to train people, who worked for free, to do our jobs.  

Intercom rings, it's Boss:

&gt;Boss:""Hey Captain, how are the new interns holding up?""

&gt;Me:""They're, uh, getting there.""

&gt;Boss:""Good, good. Listen, could you come up here and help me with this payroll and accounts software?  It's not working for me.""

&gt;Me:""Sure, but i'm not familiar with those programs so...""

&gt;Boss:""Ok well just give it a shot, I gotta go out for a few minutes so i'll be outta your way.""

That meant more than a few minutes, possibly he's just going home and not coming back, that was welcomed.

I went up the Trail of Tears to the office of Boss as he was leaving, exchanged pleasantries and sat down at his desk.

Whenever I'm working with sensitive or personal data of a user I choose to ignore the content and just fix the problem. Admin-User Confidentiality. In this case the content was part of the problem so I had no option 
other than to look at it.  

I have no idea what i'm doing LOL.

Another employee worked in that office, it was Boss' Assisstant (BA) who was actually really cool and took more shit from Boss than I would ever deal with.  She did Accounting (part-time) for almost a year now at the office 
and said she would help me navigate the phrases and terms so I can figure this software out.

We started trying to figure out everything when I let her take the reins to re-enter some books data.  She didn't understand why she wasn't asked to do it since she knew more than me about 
this stuff and even helped do the books for the place.  Until...

&gt;BA:""Wait, that's not right...""

&gt;Me:""Um, huh?""

&gt;BA:""Uh nothing, hold on.""

She looked concerned and angry while clicking through the various tabs on the software.  So I took a step back.

&gt;BA:""He so *does* have the money.""

&gt;Me:""Wait what money?  Is it fixed?""

BA was all of a sudden livid.  She then went on a rant that ultimately came down to the fact there were two sets of books.  Not the ""illegal"" kind, but rather accounts that Boss handled and then 
added BA's books to that.  So he was claiming everything like the law says, but BA didn't have an idea of the ""big money"" accounting that kept her in the dark about how much of a profit he was actually turning.  

Guess who did accounting for *those* accounts.  Yup, Boss.

According to her, even if we took on double the staff we currently have and gave them all $40K a year to start, it would take upto 3 years to go out of business even if we didn't turn a profit.  Actually, even if we just let the company bleed money and did nothing?  2 years. 

She showed me Numbers + Math = Lots of zeros.  

Boss, as a business owner, is well within his rights to pocket profits.  Nobody debated that.

What *was* up for debate now was what the workers think. The fact BA was denied full-time status many times on the basis of ""we don't have the money"" and that that phrase was continually used to deny everyone around the office everything 
from a raise, to extra help that was desperately needed for a specific dept (:::cough:::,Web Development,:::cough:::), or even a new computer....hell, even just a computer of their own!...was rage inducing.

BA dug even deeper and saw what everyone was being paid.  It made her rage.

&gt;BA:""Do you know what he's announcing tomorrow?""

I am beyond confused at this point.

&gt;Me:""Um no.""

&gt;BA:""Oh he's just dropping our company health care because it's 'too expensive' despite the fact we pay into it.  He's forcing everyone to sign-up for the new federal health care that's available. No adjustment in our salaries to compensate either.""
   
I took the option for more money rather than health insurance.  Doesn't effect me, but damn that's shitty.

After those revelations, the news spread around the office fast with BA telling our senior AE that was also the new VP, but had no love for Boss.  

The program was fixed by BA and I returned downstairs.

The fuse was lit, this place was about to blow.  

I had no idea, I mean I had an idea, but didn't know how far it would go.

Boss didn't return until the next day.  

In the morning I heard a yell from upstairs:

&gt;Boss:""WHAT THE FUCK?!""

That was the sound of a man so confused and so screwed.

His BA, Senior AE/VP, and a Graphic Designer quit.  

No 2 weeks, no warning, just flat-out quit via *email*.  I had no clue yet.

Intercom beeps:

&gt;Boss:""Why did you let BA use my computer?!""

&gt;Me:""She said she knew how to fix the problem with the software and she did.""

&gt;Boss:""No! She was not to use my computer!""

&gt;Me:""Ok, i'm sorry but it was fixed.""

&gt;Boss:""I DON'T CARE THAT IT WAS FIXED!""

He hung up.

ZD had come in late that day.  She came into the office, sat down, and a few minutes later was brought up to speed by the gossip committee via text.

&gt;ZD:""HOLY SHIT!  BA, AE/VP, and a GD quit?!""

&gt;Me:""WHAT?!""

&gt;ZD:""Uh yeah, they quit, no 2 weeks, just quit through email.""

Boss had apparently made our Senior AE the VP by giving her a shit raise (despite his insistence that the money ""just isn't there right now"") and dumping basically every client on her as her 
new responsibility. That was 2 days before all of this.  So now, all the clients that were told to direct their business to her had nobody to talk to...except Boss.  While Senior AE/VP might have 
sucked at her job she was at least responsive with a vague idea of what the client wanted and knew who they were.  

BA handled Boss' clients well, but now was gone.  

Boss didn't know who was who or what was what as the calls poured in.

Despite being profitable year after year he had tried to run a skeleton crew on little to no office equipment, stuffed the place with unpaid interns to do some of the work and placate clients, and get away with paying the full-time staff as little as possible by crying poverty all the while pocketing huge profits instead of expanding his business to accommodate the influx of new clients, becoming less dependent on so few key people that he thought he couldn't lose because of a shitty job market, and re-investing back into the company in any capacity.

He didn't expect 3 core people, 2 that he depended on so much, to just leave like that. He didn't count on them finding out about the fact he had plenty of money to pay them more like he had promised some of them for years. ""Once we start making money"" was a constant excuse.

He had taken money up-front from the new clients, was gonna let Senior AE/VP calm them down when the work wasn't done, but was now hounded by old and new clients as to the status of their particular projects.

His only hope laid with the 6 new interns (that we had until June) and 2 developers to pick up the slack and save him from being forced to give refunds, lose clients on retainer, or even sued.

This is the beginning of the end for me.

Hey guys, I recently joined a startup as a front end intern.

I work with the CTO who is the only other developer in a team of 5.

I was expecting to deal with JS, HTML, CSS and be responsible for the complete design and user experience of the site.

Instead I got handed a PSD layout designed by someone else, my own creative input is being ignored and suppressed, this worries me. 

The site was built with Ruby on Rails, and the lead developer has asked me to learn Ruby. I understand that front end and back end are intricately linked and that knowledge of both would be necessary in some capacity. But I don't want to learn Ruby, I mean I quit Computer Science degree, because it was too broad, information overkill. I don't want to learn every programming language. I want to specialise in one thing.

Our lead developer is pushing (at least thats what it feels like rather than encouraging) me towards full stack development but I have no interest in backend whatsoever.

I don't want to leave as I lack experience and would have a difficult time landing a job. I am starting to realise perhaps a startup is not the ideal place for junior developers, because there are no defined roles and in my case an extremely inexperienced manager, plus the fast paced environment, there is no planning!

So should I stick it out with this internship and gain the experience, or is this ultimately leading to nowhere."

I've been looking at the success of most TS students. It seems like they all get internships at top companies (like Microsoft, Facebook, Google, etc.) and go to the best grad schools (like MIT, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, Stanford, etc.). I'm only a first-year student, but it feels like I won't be able to go to grad schools and get internships like those.

I kind of feel inferior and it feels like I have a limited future success because I am not a TS student. I spoke to the director of the TS program and he basically said my stats are too low to get in. He said I could still apply, but being a pragmatist, I don't think I'll try to fight the numbers.

As I've been doing research about what kind of work I'd like to do when I get out of school, I've noticed a particular bias against web. That the pay is lower, there might be less opportunities, possibly difficulty moving to non web dev later on, that kind of thing. Now, while I am wondering if those things are true, that's not the important part of my question. 

I've had two internships, both working with C#. The first I was making WPF applications for a larger ECM company, and the second is in ASP.net making web apps. Is this second internship ""web development"" in the sense of all those negatives? It seems like it can't be because I'm working with nearly the same technologies. Just substitute some JavaScript or HTML for XAML. 

I assume that the negatives associated with web dev are for jobs which focus primarily in scripting languages. I just need someone to confirm or deny that and fill in my understanding.

After I grabbed all my shit I headed for the register when a girl stopped me and started talking to me. She said she was doing a project and asked me about myself. I told her about how I was new in town at an internship. She was smiling a lot, laughing at what I said, and told me her name. She then began to tell me about herself, and how she needed my help. It was a magazine subscription sale of some sort... She mentioned that people usually buy magazine subscriptions for themselves and some to be donated to a children's center.

Since I get paid for my internship and I'm lucky to be making some money nowadays, I thought it would be good to donate something to someone and help this friendly girl in the process. When I looked at the magazine list they were pretty overpriced, but idk what the fuck magazine subscriptions cost and it was for two years anyway. I ended up getting one for myself and one for the children, I didn't have cash and I don't carry my checkbook so I got some cash out when I paid for my stuff.

When I got my cash out I asked her if she had proof that she was part of an organization. She looked at me funny and told me that I was getting a receipt (with a cancellation policy of a full refund if I really wanted). She wrote down a website on the receipt and gave me her Facebook address.

After talking to her a while longer about stuff like my plans for the future, my career, and whatever else, she then handed me my receipt. I started walking out of the store and she said she'd walk me out to my car. Me feeling a little strange, I kept the money in my pocket...

But this is the real kicker- She said thank you and goodbye to me and walked away without my money. I didn't stop her; I was extremely reluctant to give someone I just met that much money despite the cause. I got in my car and started to back out until she knocked on my window. She was laughing and said she forgot to ask for the money. I nervously laughed too and gave her $100 cash for the two magazine subscriptions. 

I got home and did some research- the company that was on the receipt (Midwest Circulation LLC) is a complete fucking scam. I read so many stories of people who had the exact same thing done to them, and when they try to get a refund the ""company"" makes endless excuses and threatens with lawsuits etc. Fuck I'm pissed and feel so helpless. I guess I'm more naive than I thought.

I'm a Canadian student looking to work in the US after graduating from GATech, and I have a few questions.

1. How available are internships, co-ops, and research opportunities at GATech, and what percentage of CS students are involved with these these?

2. The GATech website lists the starting salary for CS grads as $70k but a relatively small fraction of grads respond to these surveys, so I was wondering if some CS students/grads on this sub can give me more some more details regarding employment opportunities?

3. Are there scholarship opportunities at GATech for international students? Tuition is more expensive for out-of-state students and I don't qualify for financial aid, so it's a stretch for me.

4. How important is it to choose the right threads at GATech, and will your strings affect your co-op/job directions significantly?

5. Do many CS grads move away from Georgia after graduating? I'd like to join my family in San Francisco after I graduate, and I was wondering if GATech is a reputable school in Silicon Valley.

6. What is the male/female ratio for CS majors at GATech? Edit: I'm male.

Thanks! :)

-I currently have a job in which I am doing IT and programming for a department at my university

-I have not done any internships.

Before I decided to switch, I applied for a lot of accounting positions. I've gotten a couple of phone job offers but I'm not sure what to do. Here are my options: 

1) I could take the job to make some money and quit by September 

2) I could spend the next five months learning everything about computer science and doing projects so that I have a head start with my career. 

There are many factors to consider in my decision so here they are: 

1) I have not had income or a real office job for 2 years, just student loan money. I would be happier if I didn't have to live like a hobo and always worry about cash 

2) I will be completing my degree in 2 years so there is minimal time for me to complete my projects in order to sell myself for an internship or full time job 

3) I know some python and java but I have only done my self studies for 2 months 

Do you think accounting experience would be useful for my career? I am interested in all paths of software engineering including programming for accounting applications. Deep down inside though, I think I really want to do web development or mobile apps. However, in the end, I just want to have a good career in the field of computer science.

I will try to keep this as short as possible and any help is MUCH appreciated.
I am 22 and graduating this summer with 2 business Bachelor's from two different institutions (one of which is a top UK school and the other a quite respectable EU school). 

My studies were mainly focused on Economics/Accounting&amp;Finance and my work experience is also mainly related to finance. I've worked abroad in the US for a summer, I've done a banking internship, and for the last ~2 years I've worked part-time for a small investment bank as a junior analyst. 

My background has made it fairly easy to enter the finance industry as I got full-time offers from the accounting Big4 (E&amp;Y, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG) companies for audit positions. I've tried applying for start-ups and more creative type of business jobs, as well as data analyst jobs, but I can't seem to get into anything that is not related to finance.

My biggest concern is that I am NOT looking forward to doing finance as a career AT ALL. I've now sort of decided that I want to pursue a career as a computer scientist, but I'm unsure as how to do it. The way I see it, I have 4 options:

A) Join Big4 as audit consultant, gain work experience for ~1 year, quit, and enter full-time CS Bachelor's next year. How much would having a Big4 company's name on my resume help my CS career in the future? Even though the work is different, the hiring process of these companies is still fairly demanding and the names are both respected and well-known in the industry. 

B) Not accepting Big4 offers and immediately starting CS Bachelor's in September. I would not get a well-known corporate name on my resume, but I'd get a 1 year headstart on CS studies.

C) Working for Big4 for a while and doing CS Master's conversion course. This is an option offered by UK schools and takes 1 year normally. My concern is that 1 year is too short of a time span to teach me anything that is required in the industry so I will be completely unemployable in that field even with the degree. However, it would be much faster compared to a (third) Bachelor's.

D) I've also considered doing a CS degree whilst working for the Big4, but it has several drawbacks. I would have to attend a lower ranked school due to the location of my job, and my GPA would quite likely suffer due to the intense workload. This would also not leave me with any time to complete my own projects or create a portfolio to use when I start applying for CS jobs.

**TLDR:** Have 2 business degrees from good schools, and a very good career in finance is most likely available to me. Want to switch to CS, what to do?

I do some coding, know Python, C++, java script etc. I take advanced math course in school and have French and Irish(not that would be of much use). I wouldn't mind travelling for this.
If anyone has any advice on how to approach please do tell or if anyone has any experience interning like this please do share.

I haven't done the research on the companies that are going to be there tomorrow and I need to spruce up my resume. I also need to heavily review my Data Structures book because I'm assuming that will be a very important topic. I know I can kill any basic questions, but have forgotten a lot of the key Data Structures stuff. Anything about arrays or string traversals I can do off the top of my head. Algorithms for Data Structures have been forgotten and need to be practiced

Should I spend all day preparing or just wait for the next job fair? I was planning on spending this summer working on a small project and concentrating on reviewing Data Structures book and Cracking the Coding Interview.

My github is completely empty and the only thing I can put up there is coursework from the past couple of years.

JOB 1

* **Management:** Exceeded fundraising goals by targeting high-priority prospects, tracking candidate's performance in call time, and addressing weak points in pitch delivery and messaging.
* **Research:** Tripled the production of new donor research and immensely improved its quality by refining and refocusing the internship program.
* **Writing:** Standardized best practices and procedures for staffing call time, managing the database, and conducting donor outreach by authoring instructional memos and documents for internal distribution.

I'd like to say that I'm fairly experienced with computers, but I've never really dealt with much networking related.

* Any recommendation on a camera? I'm assuming the best kind of camera for what she wants to do would be an IP camera. Our rescue is very small, so I doubt there would be more than like 10 viewers at a time.
* I realize that setup might vary from camera to camera, but generally how would I go about setting up the camera so that it can be accessed by other people from the website? I've read stuff about DDNS services, but the whole process is kind of confusing.

I'd also like to note that cost may be an issue. The rescue is run out of the director's home and relies solely on public donations for funding. I believe the director is paying for these cameras out of her own pocket, so I don't know how much she's willing to spend on a camera and any kind of monthly services. Cheaper would be better.

Thanks for reading!

edits: 

I intend on finishing my master degree in the place we emigrate to (just the thesis, depending on the accepted equivalences), so that's an important factor also on the final decision, education conditions.

Per country, do companies usually offer housing/transportation to foreign after the agreement or as part? Or is that something we must definitely not count with?

I had 3 x 6 month engineering internships in college, followed by almost 3 years of experience as a Professional Engineer before quitting to work for a small manufacturing company.  I wanted to get out of engineering but needed more business-related experience, and this seemed like a great opportunity - and it really has been.

Theoretically I am the Head Estimator, but being a small company I wear many hats.  I am also a cornerstone of the Sales and Marketing team and a small portion of my week is always spent working with Project Management.  To be clear, I work for a small joint venture created with a company in Germany - our German manufacturing ""parent"" is a very large company, but my company (the US rep) is only about 15 ppl.  We engineer/manufacture/supply green construction materials and facade systems.  So we are really in a sense small because of the small number of employees, we are a ~$16 million a year business.

At a larger company I would not have the benefit of having such broad experience, but being a small company I honestly don't think i spend more than 30-40% of my week on estimating as I do so many other things.  I even take responsibility for managing smaller projects as a salesperson would in regions we don't have a dedicated salesperson, and develop and close on these contracts myself.  Initially I was working for another estimator, but had done so well he moved on to being sales full time and I took over estimating, and we are looking at hiring someone to work for me and they even offered me a sales commission on projects i work on (normally only done for sales) as a part of the promotion.

Without dragging this on, what I've gained at this company is invaluable experience to coincide with working on my MBA.  Since i now directly work for the CEO and he has little interest in growing the company outside of our niche market (no interest in vertically integrating or expanding to other products, etc.) I don't see myself staying here when I graduate.

My problem is, if I start applying to other positions and want to leverage my experience here as I look for other jobs, will employers hinge their decisions based on if I will allow them to talk to my current employer?  I feel uncomfortable making them a part of my job search by asking if any of them could be references, as we are somewhat of a ""family"" - but I may need that in order to move on to the right position.  

Just as a reference by the time I graduate with my MBA I would have been with this company for just over 2 years.

Does anyone have any experience in this situation or advice?

If I didn't provide enough detail anywhere please ask.  I just want to do right by them - they are good people and this is a good company, they just don't offer what I want long term.

TL;DR - My best and strongest experience is from current employer, small company of less than 15 employees. What advice would you offer on a job search and will/should I expect to have prospective companies speak to my current employer in order to secure a new job? As I plan to leverage my experience here heavily.

22pckl,2,2014-04-10,I want to ask if exist a tutorial on cryptographic/hash function and such ?,j3lackfire,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/22pckl/i_want_to_ask_if_exist_a_tutorial_on/,"Hi /r/learnprogramming.

This question might seem weird but right now, I need to learn quick to know and understand how to implement a hash function algorithm. Are there anysource I can find some basic tutorial on cryptographic and such ? Thanks.

Long version :
I am a 3rd years students in ICT and I am doing a internship for a local company. My project for the whole time would be on Document duplication Checking. The company is making a Online News Website, they produce hundreds of article a day, so they need somethings to check to make sure they don't put up a same article on their website over again.

That's the purpose. For the works, the guys at the company have already implemented a ""tokenization"" technique to do as below :

They devide the articles into token, and named them as ID (example : the strings Human would match the ID of 000001, for example). For every article, all of their information would be stored in a Vector of (n dimensions) with each dimensions is a token (human-000001, people- 00002) with a weight, for example, the token ""human"" appear 4 times, so the weight of it would be 4, the token ""people"" appear 0 times, so the weight of that is 0.

So and so, to compare the article, they compare the article's vector to see how similar those articles are.

After that is where my works start in.

Because the vector size is quite big to compare. So they need to reduce the size of the vector to make comparing faster and more efficiency.

In order to do that, they need a hasing algorithm. But the problem is that, hash function, like MD5, could make the very similar source, become much much different after encrypting. So, we need a encripting algorithm to make similar input, out come to similar out put. Which is called SIMHASH.

And the thing I want to learn is :
-I don't know anything about encrytion AT ALL. So I really need a quick tutorial (or article, or anything) to the beginner level of HASH algorithm
-Next, I would want to know about the SIMHASH or something similar to that.

Anything would be fine, super appreciated. Just throw everything you have or you know. Thanks a lot, a lot and alot :)"

My main question is how bad would something like bad credit/collections on my record affect my ability to get an internship and eventually a job? If anyone has any experience or knowledge in this I would appreciate.  Thanks."

Googled, read manual, still stuck.",yellowmarbles,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/22pfrv/php_why_wont_the_email_send_to_the_multiple/,"I am a programming student working my first internship. Wee! I am fixing bugs in a PHP-heavy website left behind by the last guy.

This code that I am working on comes from the registration page. After the user fills out the form, it is supposed to pull the user's email address from the form and send a confirmation email to that email, which works. My boss wants me to get it to send a copy of that email to another email address, so that he is notified whenever someone signs up.

After reading the [php manual mail page](http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php), I thought this would be easy. It says that the 'to' field in the mail function can take multiple recipients as a comma separated list. Only problem is, I still can't get it to work. Emailing the new user continues to work, but I haven't gotten the second recipient to work.

Here is the code: ($email is pulled from the form and seems to be working fine)

    $headers = ""From: no-reply@website.com\r\nReturn-path: no-reply@website.com"";
    $body = ""The Body"";
    $to = $email . "", second-address@website.com"";
    mail($to, ""Registration"", $body, $headers);

I also tried writing it as, mail(""$email, second-address@website.com"", ""Registration"", $body, $headers);

I also tried adding the second address as a ""Cc:"" appended to $headers.

Where am I going wrong?

**EDIT:** I solved this but I still don't know why this is the only thing that works. What I had to do was declare a second variable, $email2 = ""second-address@website.com"";. Then the mail() call had to be changed to mail(""$email, $email2"", ""Registration"", $body, $headers);. Using mail(""bob@site.com, zack@site.com"", ""Registration"", $body, $headers); did not send an email to either bob or zack. No idea why any of this is happening as such, based on the manual."

My long term aims upon completing my PhD are to complete a biology post-doc and attempt to enter into Academia. The opportunities for internships are mostly for law firms, banks and estate agents, none of which really appeal to me or I feel I would be able to win at the interview stage. 

There is also the opportunity to be assigned to a school for three months and assist in lessons, sort of like a completely untrained TA, which I thought might be interesting but maybe not very relevant. 

So I am posting to see if anyone has an opinion on where I should attempt to apply, if perhaps I'm not thinking long term enough, or whether teaching in a school for three months would/ wouldn't have any impact on my future scientific career. All advice appreciated. "

Some background information (not exactly a necessity for the story, but thought I'd introduce myself): I'm a last-year high school student (meaning I'm a 19-year-old) from northern Europe studying Computer and Communication Technology (the closest you can get to studying IT on a high school level here) and recently finished an internship for a medium size company (~500 employees with nation-wide offices). The company does inspections on virtually anything that's using an engine: elevators (or lifts for the British people out there) escalators and so forth. I worked for their internal IT support, dealing mostly with pre-assigned hardware tasks but occasionally with on-site support.


So anyway, to the actual story....

&lt;$user enters IT dept.&gt;

**Me**:    Hey there $user! What seems to be the issue?

**$user**:     Well, my HDD crashed. Can you help me retrive some files?

**Me**:    Okay, I'll do my best. Is it anything from the DATA folder? (There's an automatic backup for this folder, plus a couple of other ones, for every user in the organization. Sometimes they don't initiate backup so it was worth asking).

**$user**:    No, it's not. They were some personal photographs...


Now, I (and the rest of the crew) were instructed not to spend time on non-work-related inquires but most of our users are genuinely nice people, even though they're lusers, we usually did it anyway. This time included.


**Me**:    Okay, gotcha. I'll do my best. And what would the name of the folder be?

**$user**:    It's the one named **No Backup**....


I did manage to retrive it, and hooked him up with a fresh SSD instead of a bulky HDD. I told him afterwards he should backup his files more often. Hopefully he'll obey.


TL;DR user's HDD crashed, wants me to retrive folder named *no backup*."

22q6v1,1,2014-04-10,[Build Help] Crossfire or new card?,Tisaric,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/22q6v1/build_help_crossfire_or_new_card/,"Hello,

So I've recently come into a paid internship thanks to my school's engineering program offering an internship as credits, so I've now got a little spending money for my build. I currently have the following:

CPU: AMD FX-8320 Vishera 8-Core Black Edition

Mobo: MSI 990XA-GD55 ATX

RAM: 2x Kingston HyperX Blue 4GB DDR3 1333MHz

GPU: HIS Radeon HD7850 2GB DDR5

HDD: 1x 1TB 7200 RPM 6Gb/s

1x 750GB 7200 RPM 3GB/s

PSU: RAIDMAX Hybrid 2 RX-530SS 530 Watt PSU


Now, with the current build, I can play most games around the typical ""High"" or ""Very High"" settings around 60 FPS (give or take), but as the newer games have been coming my way, I've seen more and more FPS readings reaching the lower ends of 30 or lower, which can be acceptable, I'd much rather keep close to 60.

And this is where the question comes in: would it be better/more futureproof to simply buy a new card, say a GTX 770 or Radeon R9 series, or buy a 7850/7870 and crossfire the two? I've heard arguments for both sides, but I'm tending towards crossfiring as I've loved my 7850 so far and it's only been about a year since I got it.

Also, if you see any major upgrades I could do other than the GPU, any help would be appreciated. I was considering an SSD, but I still feel at the current price, I wouldn't get as much out of it as I'd like.

Also if I HAD to put a budget for the card, I'd probably want to spend about $500 at the very most, and that's a bit steep.

Thanks!"

I'm extremely passionate about all things computers and really want to be a developer. I just feel clueless what I should be doing though beyond showing up to class and throwing a thing or two on GitHub here and there.. What are some things I can do *NOW*?

Can I get an internship or part-time job at my level? (I have 6 months experience working as a Computer Information Technician, does that help at all?) I always see people recommending to contribute to open-source projects, but I only really know the fundamentals and don't see how I could contribute to something worthwhile with that.

What are the steps that people are taking? What can I do?"
22qfkp,5,2014-04-10,A place where I interned 2 years ago can't/won't confirm my employment for my background check. Am I screwed?,evryvillainislemons,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/22qfkp/a_place_where_i_interned_2_years_ago_cantwont/,"I am a student set to graduate college this May, and I recently was offered a position with a large national company once I graduate, pending the background check and drug test, the usual. I'm going through the background check right now, which has been contracted through a third party (HireRight). I submitted it yesterday, and it looks like they were able to get in touch with all of my employers except for one internship I had nearly two years ago. 

I worked as a ""Graphic Design Intern"" for a local magazine. Basically, I designed advertisements for one of those crappy 'magazines' that are entirely made of advertisements that they stuff in your mailbox. The whole experience was pretty bad, but I was able to swing it well in interviews and make it sound like I got something valuable out of it. 

The only problem is, apparently HireRight now can't get in touch with the people that own the magazine. It honestly does not surprise me that no one is picking up the phone there, the place is an absolute shitshow. They want me to provide some sort of documentation proving that I worked there when I said I did, but I never got paid for the months that I worked there, and I don't have anything else I can use to prove it.

I guess my question is, what happens if they can't confirm I used to work there? I don't have any documentation that I worked there, and I didn't leave on the best terms so I am not sure how helpful the owners will be if I call them (Long story short, the internship was supposed to be unpaid until I learned the ropes, at which point they would switch it over to paid. I worked there for several months, and was skilled enough that they were having me train other interns, but they still refused to pay me. Between that and the fact I was also doing the job of their real-estate intern for no pay since they couldn't find anyone to fill the position, I ended up quitting with no notice a few months before I had originally promised to stay. Probably a stupid decision, in hindsight, but I was 18 and I couldn't afford to buy groceries and they wouldn't pay me, so I quit for a job that actually would pay me). 

If it ends up being that my former employers can't be contacted or refuse to cooperate with me, how much will this hurt me? I have two other employers on my resume, and I'm not even taking a job in graphic design - at the time that was my major, but I'm graduating with a degree in Computer Science now, and I have 2 years working at a helpdesk on my resume, during which I was promoted twice to a student leadership position. Both my boss here and the position I worked pre-college (tutor at a learning center) have already confirmed that I worked there, so is it going to look really bad if they can't confirm I was an intern for a couple of months two years ago?"

I'm a first year engineering major at Cal State Fullerton. I have a few questions for you higher grade engineering students and/or current engineers. 

1)I'm currently Engineering-Undeclared, but I'm leaning towards computer engineering as it is far more interesting to me than mechanical and civil. (My school offers those three, EE, and CompSci.) Because of that, I haven't taken any major courses yet, but I will probably start with the intro courses next semester. Any tips on what I should learn or know before hand? Currently learning some HTML, but I don't think we'll be using much of that, if at all.

2)Similarly, what did you all do during the summer after your freshman year? I have no experience with engineering and as mentioned above, I haven't taken any engineering courses so an internship or research for the summer is likely out of the question. 

3)Lastly, does the school you go to make a big difference when looking for internships/jobs? I know a lot of Redditors here go to big engineering schools, while I'm at a Cal State :( "

I'm an undergrad CS major and have, for the past 5 months or so, always been on the prowl for new internships and opportunities. Of course there is the typical ones like Google's practicum, or Microsoft's explore program, but it's been hard to find a site primarily for CS related internships.
Just thought I would share my thoughts:

* Readyforce has been the closest thing to a CS dedicated matching site: http://fbuy.me/NSz_
* Internmatch has also been a very nice and solid way to find postings:
http://www.internmatch.com/
* Lastly, simplyhired.com has been my favorite blanket site:

To make a long story short: I was always a shitter in school. Then I went to college (UK college, 16-18) and retook my GCSEs and didn't do any better. Then when I was 18 I got a call from my old school saying they fucked up and it turns out I got a borderline A* in IT.

That meant I could apply to a better course at a shitty college. So anyway, I got predicted AAA doing the better course, but I'm 95% sure my teacher bumped up my grades because I'd never legitimately got an A in my life before. This meant university went from being a distant dream to very fucking real, and I could get into a good university too.

Got into a top 10 uni despite my academic record and began studying for an accelerated masters in computer science, I must've believed my own bullshit if I thought I was capable of that because I had to retake my first year, which they only let me do because my dad died.

Aaaanyway, while believing my own bullshit I decided I wanted to work as a banker or a software developer at a big tech firm, but the more I'm realistic about things the more I see that just isn't going to happen. I feel like I don't belong at this university, but because I'm here I'm being groomed to go into these top jobs where, even if I get them, I reckon I'll crash and burn. Even got a couple of interviews for internships on account of my school and college grades, but at interview I left feeling like the stupidest guy alive.

TL;DR: I am a retarded imposter at a very good university. Want a top job when/if I graduate and now realise that's not going to happen, and even if it does I'll crash and burn once inside. What would you do? Basically just wanna hear what other people would do in my shoes, plus advice."

I will be in Germany (with my SO) from 1 July - 31 December this year for an internship.  I am looking for inexpensive, furnished, single room, rental  apartments in Hanau, Frankfurt (300-500 Euro).  I've been searching the internet for apartments and I found many useful websites. eg. [Immobilienscout !](http://www.immobilienscout24.de/). 
I found that although the prices are listed by apartment rent/month, when I call and inquire they always say I'll be charged more (~200 Euro more) because my SO will live with me and for utility costs.  
What are the right questions I should be asking to make sure I understand the total price of living in a rental apartment for a month (including heating, electricity, gas, utilities, etc).  I've heard about a ""warm and ""cold"" cost, but I don't understand it.  Also, what are other questions I should ask the housing agencies to make sure I don't get scammed into a bad apartment.  

My requirements are listed here.

* total rental period, 6 months (1 July - 31 Dec, 2014)
* furnished apartment
* 1 room or studio
* living space &gt;20 m^2
* total cost (everything included) ~300-500 for 2 people (me and SO)
* dependent on public transport
* no pets/non smoker

If there is anything else I should list please let me know.
Any information about rental apartments in Hanau is welcome.  Any tips for saving money are welcome too!

Any information from locals about the rental apartments is welcome.

Thanks.."

Now...I'm starting my post-bacc in CS in the fall. I see advice here to seek a software internship prior to graduation, and what I want to know is - does that advice still apply to me, given my current job experience?

Is the point of an internship to work with and learn from other programmers in the real world, or is the internship advice mostly about getting experience you can talk about in interviews? 

Would I be fine sticking with my current job while getting my degree, or is advisable to seek a ""real"" software internship?

I have an internship interview at a big 4 in the coming weeks. I'm going to try to set up an interview the week after next to give myself enough time to practice. My last interview was with amazon and I didn't get it because I only studied for one day because of exams.

I really would love to intern at this company and I am determined to get this internship. My only problem is that I'm not that great at the tricky algorithmic questions. I'm the type of coder who needs to read the spec multiple times to understand the problem. From there its 70% planning, design, and coding and 30% stack overflowing for solutions to a subset of problems. Overall I have no worries with my programming abilities that I would need to use on the job. I'm not a bad programmer, in fact I'm the guy my friends go to for help in their programming assignments, I am just weak at the programming competition style of these interviews.

I feel it is a weakness of mine to solve these algorithmic problems quickly and under pressure. Therefore I plan on going through CTCI to try to understand the questions in the book. Any advice on learning this book and not just memorizing it?"

I was searching for internships at big retailers like Target, Walmart, and Loblaws. One of the requirements were that you need to have completed 3 years of school.

I've been working at Walmart for over a year in reeving so I have gotten some relevant experience with their inventory management systems. It's mostly basic, but anything helps. I talked to our store manager, but he didn't know anything. He said he will talk to the HR department and get back to me. But I'd still like to look for other options, in case he doesn't get back to me.

Their voices just compliment each other so well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq29ms?context=5)|NO, I don't think so at all, but its incredibly common to hear that. It tru of most bands with 2 main singers. Ozma is that way, and the Beatles too.  Devin's voice is a choir boy RnB thing and Toby's is like a old dad that can sing.
[1\) What is a band that you always wanted to tour with, and could never make it happen?  (and why couldn't you make it happen\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2wvp?context=5)|We wish we could tour with Jimmy Eat World.  Not sure why we haven't other than ya'll haven't bugged them enough on twitter telling them.

[Woo! Thanks for doing this Matt. Let me first start off by saying I love Emery, and your music has gotten me through some tough times in my life. Second, the book ""Bad Christian, Great Savior"" is amazing. I downloaded in November, and I've read it 4 or 5 times since then. My question for is as a college student wanting to take a leadership role in a campus ministry, what are some good ways I connect and preach the gospel to those who are unreached?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2hkd?context=5)|EASY, I'd would focus on liking the people not converting them.  Spend a lot of time with people with NO AGENDA. If you don't even genuinley like them, they won't buy that God loves them.
[Who are some dream guests for the Bad Christian podcast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2m3d?context=5)|I'd like to have on some comedians i think. They are the most honest interesting, and often depressing people. It's a wildly attractive quality to me.  I love Louis CK and Norm MacDonald.  I don't anticipate having them on however. HA!
[With being a band that's full of Christians and getting crap about your faith, how do you deal with releasing BC and the negativity that people throw at you? I've seen some of the forums/posts/comments and holy crap people are negative about this whole side of Emery. What keeps you going?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2gmm?context=5)|Well, the truth here is that the negativity almost works as good PR.  Also we are pretty brutal to each other and therefore not fragile. We are not very insecure, and more than anything we LIKE exposing how shitty people are. I think its GOOD to see Christian and non Christians true hearts of criticism exposed. We love that irony of someone being mean and sarcastic when telling you you need to understand the Bible better. 
[Hey Matt! I've always been so impressed with all the really cool ways you guys transition into different keys and time signatures and tempos in your songs. Creates such interesting variance in the tunes. When you're writing songs do you start with several different ideas and then try and fit them together?

I know we have done a million meet and greets and I know that tons of nights I have avoided fans entirely and just sat on our bus to drink beer and cut up with my friends.  
[How would you respond to someone who says that wearing the title ""bad christian"" is endorsing living in sin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2bwv?context=5)|I guess i really don't care enough to correct them.  Since its not true, its kind of like someone telling you that you endorse communism. i'd just say, ""okaaay, coool"" 
[What, if anything, can you tell us about the new record? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2ttc?context=5)|The new album YWNA is gonna be aggressive.  thats the best word for it.

Still a lot to work out, but tht is the idea.  So yea, we are gonna go everywhere! 
[Hey Matt, what are you favorite Emery albums in order?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2dbx?context=5)|Ah, I have no clue, because honestly, I NEVER LISTEN TO 'EM.   They are for YOU not for ME.  I guess they are originally written for ourselves, but once they are done, thats pretty much it, the journey is over for me.  It's all about MAKING the records, not listening to them.

22tklv,9,2014-04-11,Advice for someone with impostor syndrome?,UselessCSMajor,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/22tklv/advice_for_someone_with_impostor_syndrome/,"Hey everybody,

So I am a third year computer science major at a research institution. 

I am to the point in my college career where I NEED to get an internship or at least get involved with some sort of research in order to set up for my post-graduate career.

I have multiple friends who are getting summer internships and the like through connections they know: a family member who works somewhere, friends who started a company etc.

I have never had a job or an internship in the CS people (IT is the closest I have been to having a job similar to computer science.) 

I guess I am just asking, is there any way that I can have a better chance at landing an internship? I have almost completed 3/4 of my CS degree and I still feel like I don't know anything. My GPA has much to be desired at 3.0, so other people who don't have some sort of a familial connection to secure an internship like myself look better even without work experience since my GPA is less than stellar (which is completely my fault.)


I guess this is kind of a stupid question. If anybody has advice, that would be greatly appreciated. I am having trouble finding available internships/research opportunities at all and when I do, my GPA stands out in a bad way.

Thanks for your time.

Also sorry about the bad formatting. Not sure what I could do to make it better."

[One thing that worries me though: how do you raise children? Do they go to school? Would living in a way so at odds with the outside world create problems for them when they grow up? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgpzvtk?context=5)|A lot of them are home schooled and there is a daycare program for the younger kids. I am actually going to play theatre games with the kids there one day soon.  One of the greatest things I've heard about education over there is this game called Heroes. Its like trivial pursuit mixed in with Dungeons and Dragons. My friend does the DMing for it. Basically the kids get to decide what they want to do in this fantasy world and roll dices for it like in D and D but if their roll is too low they have the option to answer a trivia question to roll again and some parts the story in the game are educational.  For example, in one game the kids were studying the religions of the world and all of their characters had to answer questions about the religions from the counsel of the gods. All the ""leaders"" of the worlds religions were there jesus, buddha, shiva, etc. Once they answered all the questions the kids were granted access to the library of the gods and were asked to make their own religions just for fun. One of the values of their religion was ""always eat your breakfast""
[I work at an educational children's toystore and I love this idea! Thanks for sharing! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqe8di?context=5)|I'm so glad!
[Kinda sounds like a cult. Religious group? what's the deal? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgpzoos?context=5)|No. Not a cult because with a cult people would try to keep people here forever and try to get everyone to think the same. People leave whenever they want, sometimes we're sad because they are our friends, but we want people to do what they want.
 |We share everything, but there is a wide number of opinions, which can often make decision making difficult, but it is valuable to have so many different outlooks.
 |I'd say we share a lot of the same values as in egalitarianism, feminism, non-violence. We are just looking to be the example of what we would like to see in the world. We are very focused on face to face communication and conflict resolution. We also have no leaders and we emphasize personal responsibility. 
[Sounds like a town now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgq083q?context=5)|Yea you could look at it that way, except we live kind of dorm style. 
[*same values as in egalitarianism, feminism.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqfpy6?context=5)|I've gotten into this conversation many times on Reddit. I agree that feminism, mainstream feminism, like girls on tumblr and stuff, have a tendency to propagate a lot of female superiority and not a lot of equality. I suppose for what we do as a community is better defined as egalitarianism. I think what we mean when we say ""feminist"" is that we encourage females specifically to do work in area that are generally considered ""mens work"" if they are interested in it. i.e construction. I would say we also do this with men also. A lot of men cook and clean here. 
[I am confused, because as far as I have ever seen those two things are opposites. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqfpy6?context=5)| 
[Are there rules to your anarchist commune? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgpzggg?context=5)|Anarchism to me means lacking oppression and no hierarchy. Not necessarily ""no rules"" thats silly little anarchist teenagers.
 |There are policies which are kind of like rules, but these are subject to change depending on where the community is at the time.
 |There are norms, which are more like common sense things.. like don't put knives or pointy things in the bucket we put all the other silverware in the dish room. You know so no one cuts themselves.
 |There are actually rules I guess, our values are egalitarianism, feminism and non-violence. Meaning you can't be physically violent with someone, if someone did this who had been living here long term this would mean a BUNCH of long meanings.
 |Also non-consensual touching is a big no no also. 
[Hierarchies always exist. Just maybe not the type that inconvenience you personally.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqidls?context=5)|You are right there are always hierarchies. Like the fact that there are full members (people who've been members a year +), provisional members (under a year)associate members(intern more than once) interns (2-6 month stayers) and visitors (3 week visits applying for membership). Full members often have the most power.
 |The best is that no one is my boss and no one tells me what to do or benefits more than I do from our income. 
[*egalitarianism, feminism.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqgv0w?context=5)|I do not agree with the mainstream version of feminism.
[These contradict.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqgv0w?context=5)|Someone else said something similar to this.. please read that. 
[Feminism poisons everything.  It just an evil hate movement.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgr0v9o?context=5)|Hey so the other guys didn't call it evil so I am just going to personally respond to you.  I honestly sympathize with MRM. I am not a feminist, I have been a feminist in the past, but I would tend to not take on a label. I just think its a bit ridiculous that you would call an entire movement evil, movements are made up of people and chances are there are feminists out there whose beliefs you would agree with. There are plenty of feminists who actually don't give a fuck about mens rights issues and I personally thinks thats pretty gross, but there is a good percentage of feminists who think that MRM has got some good points.Specifically I am into the whole legal paternal surrender idea and I think there needs to be WAY more resources for men who are being abused or who have been abused.  I'm sure you can see that there are quite a few MRAs who actually straight up don't like women, thats why a lot of feminists hate MRM not because they don't agree with the specific issues, more because its sensationalist propaganda to say an entire belief system is wrong, because in belief systems there is a tendency for people to have a wide variety of beliefs. And because the feminism has actually opened up doors for women in ways that have not effected men negatively. There are certainly things certain groups of the feminist movement did that was not fair to men, but think of it as many different kinds of groups.

[Northern Virginia? I live in Maryland and would love to come check it out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqm2cq?context=5)|Pm if you're interested. 
[Whats your day to day life like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgpzo3f?context=5)|I usually wake up whenever I want unless I have signed up to cook lunch which is served at noo or if I sign up to do a phone shift that starts at 9 am. People generally work whenever they want, but there are certain jobs people sign up for at our sunday meeting. That includes cooking shifts and customer service phone shifts for our business.  A lot of things count as work gardening, cleaning, work for the business.
 |So here is a typical day as in my day yesterday:  I woke up, helped my partner build a new computer for the office, he is teaching me about the parts of a computer, I'm kind of interested in programming, so this is helpful. Then I cooked dinner. I made Lasagna, three different kids due to the diets of people I live with. I made one with local ground beef, one vegetarian one with just cheese, and one vegan one with crumbled tofu instead of cheese. Then I smoked cigarettes in our only smoking allowed area with some people visiting from a friend community in another state. We talked for a bit, had some laughs, I shipped out some packs of seeds in my room while listening to music for a few hours. Then I wrote a little bit, I like to write fictional stories and plays, then I went to sleep. 
[What do you do when some new technology comes out (smart phones, game consoles, etc\) and not the entire community wants one? Is there some form of barter system to trade goods, or is everything shared freely? I can see necessities being shared freely, but not luxuries.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgpykni?context=5)|If someone wants to buy something that is kind of expensive to be shared by the community we bring it to one of our meetings. We make decisions using consensus. 
[It is disappointing that when people are given free choice, they don't all bang each other?  is this surprising?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgq9nvs?context=5)|Why isn't it exciting that people have the chance to figure out what feels good for them?
[Are all meals communal or only lunch and dinner? Do you get a consensus for the meals themselves, or does someone meal plan? What does the community do if someone/s isn't working hard enough? Are there elders? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgq2zn6?context=5)|On Sundays Brunch instead of Lunch. Brunch is served at around 10 am and Lunch is about noon. Dinner is 6 pmish.
 |Meals are decided by whoever signs up, but people complain if there isn't enough of a certain food group.
 |If someone isn't working hard enough it'll probably be brought up in a clearness and maybe asked to keep labor sheets.. sheets where they record their labor for the whole community to see.
 |Elders? I mean there are people over 50, but no one especially influential just because they are older. 
[Is there anything you miss about life prior to the commune? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgpymwk?context=5)|I am originally from Brooklyn and I often miss walking the streets of New York and all the opportunities to meet strangers. I miss some of my old friends and I miss all the theatrical opportunities NY had. I was studying to be a musical theatre actress before I came here.
 |I do often get to meet strangers here though, a lot of guests and people interested in community come through. Its a bit like non-nomadic traveling. There are community theaters nearby and sometimes we have music performances at parties and events and stuff. 
[How do you share liability of vehicles? Including parking tickets and accidents. How do you punish a member that is responsible for more than their fair share of problems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgq36ze?context=5)|People are specifically put on insurance for the cars and only they can drive the cars. Anyone can be on insurance if they have a license as far as I know. I don't drive so I don't really know.
 |See below about clearnesses, we'd probably do that first.
 |I don't think thats really a problem we've been dealing with these days. 
[To what extent do you see this lifestyle as feasible? Do you plan to live in this type of structure until your end comes around? Do many people leave once they have lived with the group for some time, if so how assuming they had no assets prior to joining (as a 21yr old might not\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgpzixk?context=5)|There are people of many ages here. Most are in there 20s to early 30s, but there are people in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. I'd say most people who live here have lived here about 6 months- 3 years. There are a few people here who have been here for about 8 years.
 |I see myself being here for the next couple of years. I may go try and be an actress, but I would still maintain a status of ""friend of the community"" and I would probably come back at some point.
 |There is quite a bit of turn over. The people here are often the types who are not worried about money and trust they can figure out how to survive. A lot of people also go off to do more WOOF type deals. 
[WOOF?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqlria?context=5)|Working on organic farm. Its a work trade thing. 
[Awesome! Do the people you live with share anything in common besides farming? Are many of them related, were you all friends before forming a commune?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgpyqjy?context=5)|The commune we live on has existed for about 20 years. Most of us have some alternative political views. Many people here would identify as anarchists. I probably would, but I do not like labels. A lot of people are also interested in growing most of our own food and participating in capitalism as little as possible. We have no bosses. We use consensus to make decisions, meaning no proposals get passed unless everyone consents to them.
 |There is a bigger commune in the area that is our sister commune. Some members from there decided to start the one I live on, they were not related but many of them had known each other for a while.
 |Right now there is a woman who has lived here for a couple of years and her daughter in her late 20's just moved here this year. There are a lot of couples, I don't know if you would consider that related. There was a couple of children here, but their families moved to different communes in the area. 
[When the collective makes a decision you don't agree with does that piss you off as much as when a boss makes one?  How do you deal with internal issues like fights, breakups etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgq30qd?context=5)|A clearness is when someone has a conversation with every member of the community about what its been like to live with them this can range from a simple ""I like you you're great, how've you been doing these days?"" to long conversations processing personal issues.  Then the group gets together for a meeting and talks about their clearnesses and if any conflicts were unable to be resolved in personal clearnesses we talk about it as a group. If people get violent sometimes we'll give them another chance if they've been here a while with no incident, but generally we have a no tolerance policy and that person will be asked to leave pretty quickly.
[Are there any particularly influential people in the group?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgq30qd?context=5)|There are people who have been here a long time who have a lot of experience so sometimes they want to have more influence. I'd say there is a balance of power.
[Traditions like 'clearnesses' can often get mean/abusive. does that ever happen. have you ever witnessed a clearness that you felt was unjust?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqhf5a?context=5)|I think most people we accept as members are people who want to live peacefully, so they try and talk about hard things are calmly as possible.
 |We did have one member for a while who was pretty harsh with people. We have something called an Associate Member, someone who doesn't live here full time, doesn't have an official room, but comes and stays anywhere from 2- 6 months a year, stays in various places, usually works very hard and well-loved. This nasty person had a clearness with a very well-loved Associate and kept repeating to them that they didn't really live here and that this wasn't there home.
 |He was eventually asked to leave, this usually happens if people repeatedly do not treat their fellow communards with some level of respect. 
[I love your seeds! While your catalog illustrations certainly have a homegrown quality to them, you're one of the last few seed catalogs that don't use photographs. Why is that? Cost, or is it a part of your brand now, or something else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgq0izu?context=5)|I'm so glad you get our seeds! Thank you!
 |I think it is a style thing and we want to make sure we have excellent photos if we are going to put them in there. We don't always have an amazing camera around. 
[Ohio/Michigan heirloom veggie gardener/WOOF farm here; I've come across your seeds before. I've got some nice soil, any tricky veggies or herbs you need me to help grow you all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgq9rkt?context=5)|Hey if you're an interested grower PM me!

[How did you decide to join? How did you hear about the commune? How quickly did you decide to stay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgq4eco?context=5)|I was part of multiple occupy occupations, one specifically being Occupy DC and I met a guy there who eventually moved to the larger commune and he asked me to come visit. I was rejected from membership in short because I am obnoxious and promiscuous. Then the guy I was dating from the larger commune asked me to come visit again, just as his guest, but I thought visiting the smaller commune nearby might be more interesting. I didn't plan to stay, but after a week I liked acorn more than my relationship and i stayed as an intern for months before becoming a member, 
[If you were going to be any type of muffin, why type of muffin would you be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgpyyhn?context=5)|Apple cinnamon! 
[How often do you people come and go from the commune? How hard would it be if you decided to leave?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgq07gg?context=5)|People can leave whenever they want, though it is preferred if there is some notice like a regular job. There are no bosses but some people do take on responsibility for certain areas. For example, if the person who ordered food like beans and rice from our bulk order up and left with no notice it might not be very nice. It is nicer to acclimate someone on how much we usually consumes, what to buy, etc.
 |It can be hard because of money, but people do come and go a lot.   Some people are members, which means they gone through the whole process to live here long term, they usually stay longer.
 |Interns who just come for work exchange are usually coming and going a whole lot.  
[I guess it could be executed in a fascist way if there were enough pressure that if you vetoed anything you would, for instance, be completely shunned. Or if one person or ""faction"" bullies people into giving them what they want by pulling a ""Republican Congress"" and blocking anything but their own agenda. Still giving everyone a veto, I think, typically would encourage everyone to collaborate or compromise. In that kind of culture I don't expect you develop the adversarial mindset that leads to these types of problems.  I can see that this would need some adjustment to work for larger groups but I think it has good potential.  I do wonder, what happens if someone is unhappy and wants to leave the community? Can they ""cash out"" and leave with some possessions or do they need to start over from scratch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqkc1y?context=5)|People can leave with their own personal possession and sometimes get a leaving loan.

Some people want to focus on continuing to grow the business, some people want to do more natural housing (like strawbale), some people want a dairy barn for our goats and one cow, etc.
 |I'd say an occasional member can get a little out of hand with discretionary spending. Nothing thats ever been too big a deal, at least in my time here. Something I have noticed is sometimes people will buy things on one of our budgets that I would've personally thought should have been from their stipend.

If someone wants to make a purchase for work there is like a limit to how much you can spend I think it might be like under 100 bucks or something, otherwise it goes to meeting.
 |People can always use their stipend.

If that option was unavailable I'd maybe try to do something similar, but try to gain squatter rights somewhere. I'd be interesting doing this sort of thing in an urban setting somehow. Two of my fellow communards are actuall working on project like this.
 |I'd also be interested in starting some kind of free school/commune situation, I'd like to start an arts-focused one for teenaged people. Note: I consider all projects that require any amount of creativity or critical thinking to be art... so anything really! I would like people to be encouraged to pursue their interests, whatever they are. People can learn so many things from about a variety of topics just by heavily studying one topic, doesn't really matter what. For example, i know a lot of interesting things about history through studying one of my passions, musicals. A lot of musicals are based on something historical, causing me to be interested in reading up on those specific events, therefore learning. Woah. Wall of text.

I might sound like a complete idiot but I haven't even tried to look for internships or jobs for when I graduate. I intend on getting my Masters degree after I graduate but would rather do it part time while working.

22vhyb,5,2014-04-12,Should I stay or should I go?,asidy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22vhyb/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/,"Thank you sooo much in advance for any help. I have had much internal conflict and I obsessively think over this question since it came up about a month ago.

I am a sophomore in college. I am able to graduate at the end of next year if I beef up my schedule. I grew up poor and it would be cheaper for me to take another year of school instead of shoving all I need into one year.

Option 1:
Currently I am employed as a developer.  I have been employed here after I graduated HS. The work is not challenging. I will not like to work here after I graduate and definitely not any significant portion of my life. I have a job offer after graduating that is a security net, but I would not like to have to use this.

Option 2:
I have another offer for a job, paying 10% more. This job however will only employ me during the summer until I graduate. Upon graduation this job has a 10% higher base salary than what is offered by my current employer. Still, I would hopefully not have to be employed by either after graduation.


Question time. Based on that information, what would be your decision? I hope to work in Silicon Valley (for the area, as well as the high tech atmosphere) as a Software Engineer. I am experienced with Java , Sql, Ruby, PHP, Javascript (doing node atm), as well as messing around with NoSQL and API design. I have 2 years of experience.

By choosing option 1, my skill set will not be pushed very hard at work, but I will have 2 more years experience, as well as the money (that I am currently paying off school with ;). I can continue to do self study, but at a much slower pace than option 2. I will have to take 1 more year at school doing this. However, that will also be 1 more year experience as well as the income and financial stability that might help when going to california.

By choosing option 2, I will have a much better company name on my resume (although for only a summer internship) and I will be able to do much more self study in my spare time. I will also be able to beef up my course work and graduate within a year. However this option will be more expensive, and since I don't come from any money at all I will probably struggle financially getting on my feet in California.

What would be your personal choice? Using your knowledge of the labor market, is there even much hope of me getting a job at a high tech company? THANK YOU!"

22weva,92,2014-04-12,Landed a job because of reddit! Keepin' the hope alive.,lager_half_full,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/22weva/landed_a_job_because_of_reddit_keepin_the_hope/,"My journey through unemployment was nothing out of the norm, I think most in the trenches alongside me could relate. I went to a good uni, graduated with a sensible major (A foolhardy STEM boy with med school aspirations), dropped out of med school-- *Enter black hole of unemployment. 

Shit took me two years to rebound. I went through all the cycles. The ~~ups~~ downs and downs, since I never felt the ups until I actually received an offer. Tons of resumes sent via courier pigeon and it felt like most of my flock migrated south for vacay, never to be heard from again. In the meantime, a couple handfuls of hiring managers, interns, sketchy old men (be careful with craigslist!), and well-intentioned alumnus took turns wasting my time at interviews, informational sessions, and so forth. The worst feeling, though, was mustering up the courage to roll up out of bed, reading a rejection email at whatever stage of the interview process I was at, and rolling back into bed, except this time in a fetal position resembling a post-food poisoning bout.   

I probably lost a lot of friends during this time. I just couldn't stand the ignorance. My dad, surprisingly so, knew what I was feeling inside. But my well-connected friends just made me feel alienated and frustrated that they couldn't empathize with their friend who didn't have a friend-of-a-family-friend that worked for JP Morgan or a father who could shell out monthly rent stipends in exchange for daily phone calls to the madre to keep the peace at home. 

Then the sun came out, and a reddit user delivered on his word. That's more than I can say about my friends, family, and university professors/advisors. They meant well, I'm sure, but words don't hold as much weight as actions. Your friendly redditor told me about job openings with his company and gave me constructive feedback on my cover letter and resume. I sent in my first application and thought I might actually luck out and finally get to ring the New Year on a positive note. My application was well-received and I had an interview lined up late November.

After one Skype interview I was rejected. I crawled back into bed and figured I'd wait until 2015 before propping myself out of bed again. God it was an awful feeling. Applying through online portals seemed like a distant last-ditch resort to try again with the job market. I knew I would need some sort of employee referral to make it that far again, just to get an interview! One thing was for sure, I wasn't going to take steps backwards and beg for another unpaid internship (I did two and I felt like not only my wallet was getting lighter from the costly commute, but my dignity was dangling like a bludgeoned piñata). I thought about volunteering.... 

I checked the company our fellow redditor worked at once more and another position popped up. I said to myself, ""I'll apply one more time, but that's it.""  I lathered, washed, and rinsed, just like last time. And a month later, I received an offer. :) 

The day I received my offer, I had a Skype interview lined up (I received the offer seconds before my interview) with a big pharmaceutical company. I was interviewed by two young associates, one had just been with the company for five months, the other was a college student intern. Apparently the company has a high turnover rate. Surprise, surprise. I didn't get the job. The interview q's kept digging at my flaws. They really wanted to know why they shouldn't hire me (They asked me what my biggest flaws were twice, and they had followup q's about those flaws... each time!). When they asked me what I tend to look for in a supervisor, my dad said I should have quipped: ""Big Tits."" 

I guess honesty is my biggest flaw. 

Why am I writing this? I guess I felt my story was like many of the other stories I've read which made me feel happy for complete strangers and inspired me to keep my head up.... off the pillow. So my advice for anyone looking for a job is plain and simple, nothing you don't already know, although a little reminder every once in a while doesn't hurt: Don't give up and don't be afraid to be honest with yourself. I can't stress this enough: being a realist does not make you a cynic or pessimist (disclaimer: I'm a big George Carlin fan).  Also, find out if you can get dual citizenship through your parents/ancestry. I was amazed at how many doors this opened. It opened only one, but still. One is all it took. 

Now I'm moving to a new country, doing a job that calls on my strengths that actually makes my diploma seem more than just a haughty wall ornament, and I get to work with great people. Who cares that I have no money, haven't found a place to live abroad yet, and don't speak the native language ;) I'm just happy I feel like my life is no longer like a plane just waiting for the go-ahead to lift off from the tarmac. I take-off in the next couple weeks, and I have no idea what's next. But, man, what a trip it's been so far. 

And yes, I plan to return the favor as soon as I've kicked some ace at the company.

complete the following tasks: 

• Research remote access standards on the Internet. For the given scenario, 

write a draft Remote Access Standard that will reduce the occurrence 

of risks, threats, and vulnerabilities in the Remote Access Domain of 

the given IT infrastructure. Make sure you include the minimum remote 

computer configurations, the use of anti-malware software, and the secure 

virtual private network (VPN) access in the Remote Access Standard.

Indicate the names of procedures or guidelines that you would add under the

 |I thought deaf is just an interchangeable word.
[I went to a married couple's apartment this winter on a call. Husband was ill and had abdominal pain with vomiting for the past few hours so he called 911. We got to the door, knocked, and said ""EMS!"" like usual. No answer. Knock again. No answer. One of the neighbors came outside and told us we needed to press a special doorbell button that flashed the lights in the apartment because both the husband and wife are deaf. After the wife let us in I was thinking ""great, now I have to communicate solely via handwriting with this dude at 5am."" Wrong. After a couple minutes of hand waving and confusion, wife brings my partner and I to the room with the big TV and there's a woman on the TV speaking live both to my partner and I through the phone with her headset and with the pt's wife though sign language with a webcam in the patient's apartment. It was absolutely amazing. I would ask a question to the special services person, she would sign the question to the pt's wife, who would sign the question to her husband, who would sign the answer back to the wife, who would sign it back to the woman on the TV, who translated it via webcam to me on the phone! Probably the coolest use of technology for disabled people I've ever seen.  How common is this? Does every deaf person have this service in case of emergency? Even if you live with other people who have hearing, I feel like it would still be a good idea to have it in case something ever went wrong when you were alone. Also, are there similar services for deaf people for other types of emergencies? I mean, I'm assuming that if there's a fire or police is needed, they could use that system as well, but what about mundane day to day stuff---how much is this system integrated into deaf peoples' lives?  Also, what's medical school like deaf? I get that you have hearing aids and can lip read, but what about taking Hx's and doing PA's? Can you speak well and communicate with your patients and coworkers effectively? How does this affect you in the specialty you've recently matched into?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22w22o/i_am_that_deaf_guy_with_bulky_alarm_clock_on_my/cgr6ojc?context=5)|The technology they are using with the webcam and all is call Video Relay Service (VRS). They help communicate between deaf and hearing person.  Even I used a similar service called IP-Relay. It's not video but it's more of a instant messenger service where I use it to make phone calls. The relay service person talks to the phone and types it back to me and I respond back in text and then she relay the message verbally.  I don't use that anymore. It has its flaw because the hearing person would think it was a sales person on the phone. Pissed me off major time! I always have to instruct the relay person to not answer the phone with a question (it's different story and i'm getting offtopic)  but yes I am aware such technology exist. I have seen deaf people use it to communicate with other deaf people using this VRS.  I live with a hearing people. I have pretty good handle of how to listen on phone. In case of emergency, i have a backup plan. I would just call 911 and tell the person that i am deaf and this is my address. I would just text my immediate friend or family about the emergency.  I wish i could use the IP-relay services but man it's such a fuck up flawed system though. I wish there was something else better way to make business phone calls.  Medical school was hard and is still hard for me! I had to have note-takers, asked my study group for copy of notes, visit professors' office hours whenever possible to ask questions, clarify notes with professors, and practice clinical routines with friends and partners.  when i started rotations, i made sure i communicate with the people responsible and the attendings, residents and other clinical interns. I told them that i don't want to make things tough for them and i wanna be a team player. I was upfront with what i want and what i expect. My professors were able to help me make phone calls to some of the docs that they know at some teaching hospitals and made sure i was on track with what i was suppose to do.
 |Taking Hx's and doing PA's was a challenge in the beginning but i found my rhythm. My colleagues knows me and see the effort that I am putting into so they are more inclined to help me make things easier by telling me other ways to manage and giving me stuff that are ""in the know"". Because not everything is textbook. you kind of pick it up as you go along such as routines and Hx.  you have no idea how much respect they have for others in the professions. It may seems like cut-throat competitions but in the end, everyone is looking out for each other.

[Just cant wrap my mind around someone choosing to do without one of their senses.  Nothing wrong with being deaf, but if you had the option to not be then why not?

When i was a baby my parents had the option to choose CI or hearing aids. I am glad they chose hearing aids because CI that time was in its infancy. CI was a new thing. There was lot of risks involved. I am sure now the risk are small but it would require lot of re-learning and re-training because the sounds you are used to are totally different.
[I can totally relate to that about song lyrics. I only have moderate hearing loss but I still have problems hearing the lyrics in songs. Saying that though, it can have its advantages as it turns the vocals in songs into their own ""instruments"" as I can't really hear what is being said, only really the tone. It definitely makes for some interesting listening!

[I'm very late to the party but hopefully you'll still answer this question I thought of when I saw the original photo. For people who can hear, sometimes sounds can seem to get incorporated into our dreams. For example, one might hear the beeping of an alarm clock going off in real life but in their dream the beeping noise is coming from a garbage truck that beeps when it backs up to warn people. Have you ever experienced something similar with the vibration from your watch alarm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22w22o/i_am_that_deaf_guy_with_bulky_alarm_clock_on_my/cgr6uwj?context=5)|Haha ya!
 |In fact, i woke up before my alarm goes off thinking why is it not vibrating?!

[Do you know any ASL or do you lip read or can you hear well enough with a cochlear or hearing aids?

I do listen with my hearing aids. It's like assistive device like glasses.
 |I've never used sign language as a method to help me learn how to speak or learn english during my developing years. I was trained by a private speech pathologist/therapist for 12 years.
 |I stand on the fact that I would encourage deaf people to actually learn to talk without speech impediment because it is a great way to communicate with people. If sign language help them learn to speak orally, then ok! It shouldn't be that their preferred method of communication should be sign language.
 |No one in the whole world knows sign language. Sign Language is an acquired language like spanish. You can't expect to go to other country and expect them to know Spanish. English is the most universal language and everyone knows them verbally.

22x099,17,2014-04-13,My boss at my paid internship has made it clear she wants to hire me upon graduation... how do I negotiate my salary?,MyCScareerThrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22x099/my_boss_at_my_paid_internship_has_made_it_clear/,"Here's my [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pxp0s/got_interviewed_and_offered_my_first_internship/) from 5 months ago.  

I'm 30ish, and after losing my sales job in the recession I went back to community college for an Associate's in programming (I already have a B.S. in something unrelated) where I have been a 4.0 student.  I have fallen in love with programming.  I will complete my internship and earn my Associate's next month.

In order to graduate, I needed an internship, and only one company gave me chance... a company that specializes in IBM products, and I have been coding in various flavors of RPG since (see my previous post).

They have made it abundantly clear that they would like me to stay on with them after graduation.

Right now they are only paying me $10 an hour.

We are a small company of less than 20 people, some do sales and general IT stuff, but only around 5 of us actually code (most of the people there are on the verge of retirement or are already semi-retired, and they're just riding the wave). 

Anyway, to wrap this up...

It's not like there are a thousand places looking for RPG programmers, especially in the city where I live.  I would say Java is my best modern language... but I only have a piddly-dick Associate's degree.  Is it possible to find a gig with just an Associate's, in a town of only about a million people?  

I know I need to make a ""resume website"" and all that before I start job hunting, but I really just haven't had time the last 6 months because I've been taking 18 credit hours and working two jobs.

Thanks everyone for reading this wall of text... sorry it's so long, I'm just still starting out in my career.  I really appreciate it.

**TL;DR** -- I learned RPG from scratch as a paid intern making 10 bucks an hour, now they want to hire me full time when I graduate next month with an Assocaite's.  How much should I expect to get offered?  Is it okay for me to say I expect more if they low ball me?  I have no idea how to negotiate.

E:  I have discovered the guide to negotiation in the FAQ and am currently reading it.  However, I would still be overly appreciative for any advice above and beyond this guide as it relates to my particular situation.  "
22xqr9,2,2014-04-13,"Should I go for the job, or seek someplace else?",idonteven0,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/22xqr9/should_i_go_for_the_job_or_seek_someplace_else/,"I'm 23 years old guy.

I have been working in one company as an intern for about 3 months. Internship is part of my studies. I will graduate from my studies in the end of this month, and my boss has shown interest about hiring me.

However, I have some qualms about it. The reason why I have continued such time in this specific company, was that my employer had priorly hinted me of another job in different part of the same company, which had significantly better pay than I was hoping for. I went for the interview, but my co-worker got the job (since he was already under employment in the company, as a paid employee).

So, basically that means that this co-worker's position is now opening. But still, I don't know, would getting a job in this company would be what I want from a job, or should I not just be this picky about it.

Rational side of me thinks that is would make sense to take this job offer.. as this is more of a sure bet, or at least very likely one to get.

But the thought of getting remarkably better salary if I would get a job in other companies at the very same field I am haunts me. The salary in this company where I now intern is significantly lowest in all possible of the workplaces, and I would actually somewhat struggle to upkeep wanted level of quality of living, if I choose to work here. Also, the atmosphere at the workplace is rather negative, and work morale of the employees is seemingly low. It doesn't give much a vision of a more positive future to me.

I feel like if I would take his job offer, I would still not stay in the house for more than several months, maybe max. of 6 months. 

I am basically trying to choose between sure-but-not-as-nice-scenario and possibly-awesome-but-no-reservations-about-how-likely-scenario. These are, of course, just speculations at this point.

How would you do in my situation?

[As someone who's seen many attempts at producing/teaching Othello as a race play, I'm interested why you chose to teach Othello (a play which I don't believe has much to do with race\) instead of Merchant of Venice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgs0ac8?context=5)|One is that it goes really well with The Great Gatsby. And it deals with their concerns in life: cheating, backstabbing, etc. And I think it really is a play about race, and my students tend to agree. Othello has internalized the racism in his society, and is willing to believe Iago so quickly because he's right, how could a white woman love a black man? They get this.
[What is the hardest resource for your students to afford, and how do you work around that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrhjmx?context=5)|A lot of them don't have computers, but luckily, we have a computer lab at the school. They have a lot of access to that, but more than that, I accept most assignments hand-written when necessary. It's a shame, though, because many of them are computer illiterate. I recently took them to the computer lab, asked them to type something with right alignment, and got blank stares. I can't expect them to use computers at home when they don't have them, but if they don't use computers, they're not going to be ready for life after high school.
[I am going to make some educational videos for computer classes we learned in high school and middle school. What are some topics and how can I make learning online more fun?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrvuat?context=5)|That's an awesome idea! But kind of a broad question. What, specifically, are they for?
[Wow, I thought every American family had a computer in their home by 2014. This is really sad because without being familiar with computers you can hardly do anything without a high school nice enough to accommodate you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrolbl?context=5)|From a quick Google search, in 2012, 25.2% of American households didn't have the internet. (Didn't find any states on computer ownership.)

[Hello! I'm a high school senior in a middle class suburban district. Putting aside the obvious cultural and demographic differences between the school I attend and the school you teach at, I'd like to know if there is a severe case of the government ""fixing something that ain't broke.""  I see as I'm about to graduate all the changes that are being made. Changes to curriculum, not exposing students to the critical thinking and analytical skills I was fortunate enough to be exposed to in my Honors/AP classes, and most importantly, taking away the independence that teachers have in how they do their jobs.  What are your opinions on Common Core, No Child Left Behind, and other educational reforms being introduced?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrikms?context=5)|Oh my God oh my God yes. The corporate reform movement is a complete disaster. At the end of the day, this is all about profit at the expense of the kids. I could go on about this for hours, but I'm not going to spend too much time on this post, because EVERYTHING is wrong with this reform movement, and I can't cover everything in a few paragraphs.
[So do you think most teachers disagree with common core?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrlik6?context=5)|I can only speak from what I've seen, but I've met almost no teachers who like the Common Core. There is one survey that suggests teachers like the Common Core, but it was published by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the very same people who wrote and pushed the Common Core aggressively (and profit from it).
[What about fixing the teachers union?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgs3v3g?context=5)|What do you think is wrong with teacher unions?

Or at least, they didn't before the Reagan administration started gutting public schools, justifying it with a statistical error in ""A Nation in Crisis.""
 |Most of our so-called ""underperforming"" schools are in low-income districts. Research repeatedly shows the effects of poverty on educational outcomes. It has little if anything to do with the schools themselves.
[What are your favorite and least favorite books/short stories/etc. to teach?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrhhee?context=5)|To the first: The Great Gatsby is probably my favorite. It's one of those famous ""I hated that in high school"" books, but my students always walk away adoring it. In fact, the school dance team is planning to choreograph a 1920s-style dance because they loved it so much! I teach it that it's not a love story, but a story about wanting the impossible in a materialist society.
[Also, I have to ask: How much of the overexplaining of what the author meant is based on your opinion, the curriculum, and/or actual things the author has said?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrhhee?context=5)|Which I suppose leads to your second question. There's always a matter of opinion in what I teach, that's unavoidable. That said, my kids know not to directly ask my opinion. Last school year, they pestered me to tell them who I voted for in the election. No dice. I try to keep my own feelings out of it but I also have such a passion for literature that, well, how could I?
[Now I have to ask: What did you think of the adaptations of ""Gatsby?"" (Any of them.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrhnli?context=5)|The first one I didn't like. It's loyal to the book, in plot. But the director seemed to view it as a love story. He didn't have any sense of the fact that it's Fitzgerald's tale of a society crumbling before his eyes.
 |On the other hand, I loved the recent one. I went in expecting nothing, because it's a story about the emptiness of a life full of flash without substance, and Baz Luhrmann's films are all flash without substance. But I think he really captured it. I read a review that said something like, ""DiCaprio's Gatsby is like an empty champagne glass: Glitzy and shiny but nothing inside."" Well ... that's the freaking point. He nailed it.
[When you say ""the first one"", do you really mean the Robert Redford one? I have a feeling that you don't mean the 1926 silent film.  Wiki list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgs50bk?context=5)|Yeah, I'm referring to Robert Redford.
[Does your district have Zero Tolerance policies? Do you feel they help or hurt the school environment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrie6l?context=5)|Thank goodness we don't have Zero Tolerance. What an awful concept. Some people have disabilities or emotional disturbances. Are we saying they are not entitled to an education because of these challenges in their lives? I wouldn't want to live in a society that tosses thousands of people by the wayside because they happen to be a challenge.
[You sound like a fantastic teacher, and I wish you and your kids every success.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgs41zk?context=5)|:)
[Not to sound crass, but what is the graduation rate like at your school? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrhx8b?context=5)|No need to worry about sounding crass. That's a serious concern.
 |In New York, there are two types of diplomas: Regents and non-Regents. The Regents is harder to get, and the non-Regents is much harder to make use of in colleges and the job market. Our grad rates are 83% Regents, 94% overall.
[I'd say for being the poorest congressional district you guys are probably way ahead of the curve.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrhzzd?context=5)|In numbers, to some extent. The most recent report card from the city gave us a 69.9, which is .1 shy of an A rating. I don't think those ratings mean ... well ... anything, because they don't measure the right things. But graduation rate compared to similar populations is a factor.
[What do you mean by "" don't measure the right things?"" Sounds interesting, please elaborate. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrjbeg?context=5)|Well, they measure a lot of stuff that has feck all to do with education, like test scores. Standardized tests are among the worst measures of student learning there is. Other things it measures are suspension rates. A school is bad if it suspends a lot of students? Really? We get a few students with emotional disturbances and our ""grade"" can topple.
[Why do you think standardized tests are bad, and how would you change it? Sorry for drilling you with questions, you just seem like you know your stuff! :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrjhiu?context=5)|No worries.
 |A number of reasons. One is in the name: Standardized. There is no standard school, standard classroom, standard teacher, standard student. Everybody learns in different ways and at different paces. We teach our kids all differently, so why should everyone in a school, let alone a state, be judged on the same test?
 |Second, tests just aren't that useful as a measure of learning. Projects and other assessments are so much more effective. What if the student just doesn't sleep well the night before? Or gets depressed when it rains?
 |Third, they don't measure growth, just a benchmark. If I have a student who comes in and scores a 5 on a standardized test, and I get him up to a 60, that's amazing work! But he still fails the test, so I and the school get penalized.
 |All of these things wouldn't be that big of a deal if the tests were just used to gather data for study as opposed to high stakes. Teachers have lost their jobs and schools have been shut down over low test scores.
[Since the question is rarely asked: is our children learning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgshlce?context=5)|Yes, they am.
[It seems you are arguing against the notion that there should be any common standard against which to measure schools in this country.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrlkbm?context=5)|Well, no, not entirely. I dispute that the quality of a school or teacher is measurable by its students' success. It's a bit like trying to measure how good a doctor is by how many patients survive. Some doctors treat pimples and others treat cancer, just as some teachers teach gifted kids and others teach students with intellectual disabilities. Further, I have no control over whether a kid studies, just as a doctor can prescribe medicine but has no control over whether the parent takes it.
 |This is all aside from the fact that teachers now teach to the test. Do you know what I'm working on in class? How to structure a Critical Lens essay. I'm teaching them what to do on test day, not a skill or a life lesson, because this is how I'm going to be measured. Do you want your students spending their valuable time in school being taught how to take a test?
 |The tests are also absurdly over-stressful and not at developmental level for kids. Look, you wouldn't be willing to spend 6 hours of your day sitting motionless and staring at a paper that was asking you to do something that was above your developmental level. Excessive testing crushing our kids' souls and their self-confidence. It drains them of individuality. It's heartless.
 |I have 150 students. Some teachers have as few as 30, if they're elementary. The law of averages will not balance out external factors for us. And our livelihoods are on the line.
 |EDIT: You are also making the assumption that long, arduous tests are a valid measure of whether students know the material. Most education researchers and experienced teachers will tell you otherwise.

I find most teachers teach it as a love story, but there is so much more going on.
 |I once did a unit on The Things They Carried, which drew more snores than anything. I love it, but I think it's a bit too non-traditional for high school. Lesson learned the hard way.
[Last year in my junior AP Lit class, we were taught both those books and the reaction was exactly the same. The school I go to is one of the richest public schools in the country, so I think it must be the universal high schooler's reaction regardless of background.

 |From what I understand, The Great Gatsby is one of those cliche books that high schoolers hate, so it excites me to hear that another class liked it too!

At the bottom, there was a drawing of a pig, labelled, ""Teacher."" However, by the end, most of the kids on the list loved it.
[I haven't been fortunate enough to teach junior Lit (this year I did 10th/12th\) but Gatsby was my favorite, I'm interested how you teach it if not just as a love story?

[Do you think it is odd we teach students chemistry yet do not have a single class that deals with taxes, personal finance (how credit cards work, mortgages, budgeting, ect\), labor law, as well as management skills?

It is an utter joke.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrw2sw?context=5)|I definitely think we need some sort of ""life skills"" classes, which include all those things. I also think we should include vocational training for all students, not just separating the kids we think are too smart from the kids we think are too dumb.

None whatsoever. I have students of all races and ethnicities with all sorts of behaviors, positive and negative.

[There are many schools that have average math SAT under 400.  The math section is a straight forward list of math questions,  none of which require any advanced mathematics,  so you can't talk about that section being culturally biased.  How is it possible that ""Most of them want to learn"" and yet they have such a shockingly low score?  I mean,   if you just study the content of your textbooks,  you have the knowledge you need.  Why don't most of your students bother to do that?

A 10th grader gets into some rage, so she picks up a desk and threatens to throw it at another student. Meantime, the teacher has to hold the desk (he's stronger than her) to prevent her from actually doing it. While he does this, he obviously can't leave to get security, so, not really thinking, he says to the kid nearest the door, whom we shall call D, to go get security. Now, D is a bit spacey and odd, so when he leaves, another student follows him and tells him not to bother, so D just ... walks back into the room! The teacher says, ""D, what are you doing?""

Teachers love power, but try to avoid the power trips. :P  (I know it's just an internship, but don't work at a charter school. They mistreat their employees AND they're bad for kids.)

[Thanks for doing this AMA! I have two questions that aren't really related to each other. Sorry if they've been asked before.  What do you think could change in the curriculum to better prepare high school students for the real world? (Classes, common core, etc\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgs2p17?context=5)|I think less of a focus on careers and more a focus on humanity. There is nothing wrong with preparing students for professional skills, but creativity and imagination and self-reflection are all just as important, and America's schools tend to ignore them because a) we have a belief that schools are job preparation, and b) creativity and self-reflection aren't job skills. I dispute both.
[What subjects are the most difficult to teach due to your lack of materials/ students' lack of computers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgs2p17?context=5)|Professional writing. I can teach them the actual content, but translating that into word processors on computers is a challenge. Some of them don't even know how to change the text alignment.

I hear they're changing up the SAT to make it more Common Core aligned.
[*a\) we have a belief that schools are job preparation, and b\) creativity and self-reflection aren't job skills. I dispute both.*  I agree with you on b\), but a\) seems strange.

Making students socially conscious and capable of standing up for themselves is also a part of economic advantages. Creativity makes them more valuable in the economic market. Political awareness will help them understand why they're in the situation they're in, and help them know when a politician is trying to take advantage of them. Etc.
[What is your work culture like?  I've had some experiences with teaching Shakespeare in High Schools and in summer camps to Middle School students and I've enjoyed both a lot. There aren't many sustainable career paths for theatre artists and I'm seriously considering getting my teaching certificate, but having worked a government job in the past I'm afraid of working in another heavily bureaucratic and political workplace.

I more often deal with the opposite -- absent parents. As for workplace politics, right now in schools, that's a challenge. With what's going on in education reform right now, it's become a hotbed of politics and scandal as people push new instructional techniques and tests on you and tell you you'll be rated on these as a teacher, even when the people who told you to do these things have never taught a day in their lives. That said, the culture of your individual school is huge. I've been fortunate enough to have a principal and assistant principal that support us all tremendously. There are ways to avoid the politics. What do I do? I just teach. I leave all the other stuff to the politicians. When my kids are in the classroom, I just teach.
[Do you notice the difference between popular and unpopular pupils, and does this then directly relate to grades? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgribx9?context=5)|From my own experience, having been a huge outcast as a child, I can say that popularity and ""status"" in school probably affects grades. My school is really small, and to some extent, we don't have a lot of outcasts. But I do know one, and I've made a huge effort to relate to her. I think I've made some impact. She turned in her latest project, albeit late, and that's a big change.
 |But overall, it's hard to say there's a straightforward correlation. Some kids are popular because they're really bright and successful, and some are popular because they're too cool for school.
[What is it about teaching in the poorest congressional district in the US that gives you a sense of achievement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgry869?context=5)|I'd rather teach where I do than in a suburb. Let me say that every child needs a good teacher, but the kids in suburbs or in Manhattan are going to be fine regardless. If they don't have a good teacher, mom and dad will get them a $200/hr tutor. (No exaggeration, I've seen Craigslist ads.) I try to do something with my life that, well, matters. I know that's really pretentious, but hey, I'm pretentious.

In 11th grade, I want to focus on things like reasoning skills, and some of them come to me writing run-on sentences. So I spend some time teaching these things when I wish I could spend more time on higher-order thinking.
[You're right. We should see that, but in all honesty how many of these students are gonna have a chance to become a teacher?

Isn't that a shame? Kids grow up getting one perspective on the world. I think the education profession should actively recruit minorities, so that kids can learn about the world through many sets of eyes.
[I am trying to get a job in a poor charter school in Fl. any tips for new teachers? I am white and the students will be black/hispanic. This is my first job so anything will be helpful. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrx5hk?context=5)|First bit of advice: Don't go to a charter school. Not just for political reasons. You'll be treated better as a public school employee.
 |But in terms of actual pedagogy: Don't assume that your race will be a barrier, but don't ignore it either. Acknowledge the issue of race in the lives of these kids. Don't pussyfoot around it. Depending on what subject you teach, you can bring in a lot of text and information on race issues and engage the kids tremendously.
[If you could do one thing in your power to improve your school/students (within limits\) what would it be?

What I actually think would improve our school the most would be resources outside the school. Universal, free healthcare for these kids. Or more expansive universal screening for disabilities. Or a higher minimum wage. Things like that, because there's a lot of research suggesting that student learning is influenced most by out-of-school factors.
[Are ASD students mainstreamed in your district?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrhv1l?context=5)|Depends on severity. My particular school has no self-contained classrooms. I have some ASD kids but none with severe behaviors. In NYC in general, there is more and more mainstreaming. If you're an idealist, you believe the city when it says it is doing so because kids do better with their mainstream peers. Cynics say it's about saving money. Either way, it's the wave of the future.

Just landed an internship in the computer science field, I was told by my new boss that I would be doing a lot of work with Java and SVN (which I'm more than familiar with). However, he told me that all of my work would revolve around the use of PowerShell. 

I'm pretty used to command line work with my experience in the Linux terminal in Ubuntu but have never touched PowerShell once in my life. Is there any recommendations for where I should start learning it, especially if I'm working in version control?



TL;DR: I need to learn version control commands in PowerShell."
22yr96,11,2014-04-13,How much debt is UCLA worth?,Nokusu,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/22yr96/how_much_debt_is_ucla_worth/,"So right now, I'm pretty much set on either going to UCLA or UCR. I know I'll be taking out loans either place, and UCLA is 10k/year more expensive (just because of the amount of money offered by the school). 

I'll be majoring in English (or Creative Writing at UCR), hopefully with a double major or minor in something else, though I don't know what at this point. My goal is to have a writing or editing job, possibly journalism, and eventually an author. I know how difficult that is, so no need to lecture me on that. I expect to be working a second job (most likely entry-level) in addition to that, at least while paying off loans. 

Both schools seem to be able to offer similar things academically (though I'm guessing there would be more internships at UCLA, if I can even obtain one at any point). The biggest deciding factors, in that case, are location and cost. UCLA is located where I'd like to be, in the Los Angeles area, and UCR costs less. 

I thought about attending UCR first and trying to transfer to UCLA, but apparently transferring to English there would be difficult since they have limited space or something, so it's competitive.

Since I want to be able to write believable characters at some point, I want to gain a variety of experiences. And, you know, gaining experiences in general is exciting. As I see it, I will have more opportunities for this at UCLA than at UCR-- considering the fact that the Metro reaches a wider range of locations than Riverside Transit, and I know I won't have a car at either school. (There's zipcar, but the more money I can save, the better. Obviously.) Plus Los Angeles has more people, and there are communities such as Little Tokyo around (which, being of Japanese descent and living in a southern town, is pretty exciting to me). 

I've also heard Riverside is a lot hotter, in terms of weather, which is intimidating since Los Angeles already seems pretty hot to me. Plus, apparently it has more pollution? But Riverside has that Creative Writing program. And some kind of week-long event where authors come or something. Which sounds fun. And I'd be in less debt. I know I'd want to move away from Riverside after graduating, though. (Well, right now, that's what I think.)

I'm also an out-of-state student. Because of the state I live in, however, I do not think it's good for me to stay here at all. (I'm in the LGBTQ community/whatever, and my state is extremely conservative. I've been /lucky/ so far, but I'm not comfortable here. I'm also not comfortable with the thought of continuing to go to school with many of my fellow high school classmates, honestly.) It's a great town, but I've known for years now that I can't stay here. I also think that if I establish myself here first, it would be harder to move to LA, since the cost of living is different. (But if I go to LA for school, I'd meet more people there, etc.) (Another note is that I have quite a few friends in the LA area.)

Essentially, what I'll be paying for at either school is the set of experiences/connections/friendships/location that comes with it -- not just the pretty sheet of paper that will have my diploma printed on it. 

All that said, it's pretty obvious where I want to go. My dad has gone back and forth between encouraging me (""One way or another, I know you'll be able to pay off your debt!"") (""You should probably go ahead and go there!"") and seemingly discouraging me (though he says he's not) (""I wouldn't go to such an expensive school--"") (coupled by statements that he wouldn't have even been admitted, so he supposedly has no idea what someone like me should do ?? whatever that means). The thought of not being able to go to UCLA stresses me out, but also the thought of the amount of debt stresses me out. I do not know how much I'll be capable of paying since I don't know what my income might be. My whole career choice is a gamble, but if I don't stick with it, I know I won't get anywhere. 

Anyway, any advice is appreciated. Even if you don't think you're ""qualified"" to give advice, I'll take it. Thank you in advance, and I apologize for the wall of text.

EDIT: I don't know exactly how much I'll take out in loans each year yet, since I'm still applying for as many scholarships as I can and will not hear back from those for a while. It also may vary from year to year, and I'm not sure how much."
22yzne,5,2014-04-13,"Hey reddit, how am I doing? I'm desperate for feedback.",bigvic69,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/22yzne/hey_reddit_how_am_i_doing_im_desperate_for/,"A little background: I'[m] 20 and currently finishing up my sophomore year of uni as a Computer Science major.

*I'm struggling to define how well I'm progressing in life. Am I on the track to success? Or am I being set up to fail? In a society where a college education has become just another thing you have to do before you can be considered successful, I wonder has the value of a degree become next to nothing. Am I even pursuing the right career? That sort of thing...*

I feel like I'm getting nowhere with school. Most of my classes seem irrelevant, and the ones that are, move at a snails pace. This semester the homework is so easy that I rarely ever start it until the night before it's due. It all seems so ""un-involving"".

*Is it just me? Is my school running a skeleton curriculum? The schools population is exploding, and every department has quite a few new teachers...*

I'm not friends with anyone from my major and most of my friends don't have majors even remotely similar to mine; it's hard to make a comparison of progress.
My parents don't have anything to say. Growing up, my dad was always at my 2 siblings and my heels for anything and everything. Once I got to college (I'm the youngest), my parents' feedback ceased to exist. These past 12 months, I've been on an emotional trip, reassessing my view on life. I've partitioned some of my attention on my health/nutrition. I've lost 57±1 lbs, and I've made some big strides with facial acne that I have neglected for far too long. I consider these as huge successes, but it barely seems to invoke any enthusiasm from my parents. No ""congratulations"". No ""I'm proud of you"". It was more like an ""oh wow"" or a ""that's great"".

*Should I not expect much input from my parents as an adult? Has my disassociation with Christianity gotten to them?* In reality, they're wonderful parents, and I love them. If anything, they trust me too much. I think the cynic in me tempts my outlook with worst case conclusions...

Just a few days ago I saw a post in this subreddit or the next; and in the comments, internships were being given out like religious ideological flyers with candies attached. I've always heard that internships for computer science students don't happen until junior year. I'd kind of like to know if that is even a valid assumption. I have next to nothing prepared for this summer, job-wise. I've put it off more and more, and now I'm in full on panic mode. I've dreaded calling about the dish-washing job I had last summer. Just the thought of spending another summer, finger-pruned, in that windowless 5ft X 5ft dishroom at a high volume grocery store deli with a bar and lake view. 

I have all these ideas for games and other software that I am so eager to bring to fruition and begin developing. Am I even good enough material for a job like that, at the forefront of creativity? Perhaps it's unrealistic to expect to land a job at a studio, and I should focus my goals on something more realistic...

Anyway, I hope this came out coherently. If you have read this far, I just want to say thank you and that I appreciate all feedback given.

tl;dr Plz respond!"

1. Should I move my github link into my experience section or keep it where it is?
2. I'm a beginner with python and java having learned about them in class and Objective-C on my own. Should I write that I'm familiar with these languages so they don't expect too much? Or should I leave the languages section be?
3. Should I even include Xcode in my technologies section?
4. Should I include the jumbles program? My description seems a bit vague and I was thinking I could get rid of it so I'd have an example of a project I did in each language."

This is my current build. I built this about 3-4 years ago for around 600 Euros. One of the problems is that there was no there was no CPU fan included with the CPU, which was a mistake on my part. The dealer who I bought the parts from (azerty.nl) was kind enough to put in some kind of standard fan but the sound it makes is horrid and can be heard throughout my house.

I'm looking to upgrade my current rig as cheaply as possible to be able to run ArcheAge on maximum settings without any problems. At the moment I have to switch from DirectX 11 to DirectX 9 and turn everything on lowest settings just to be able to play it without Bluescreening.

[Here are the minimal and recommended system requirements for the game](http://i.imgur.com/jUf3Ojv.png). Unfortunately I can't find anything about the requirements to run the game on maximum.

The game runs on CryEngine 3 and it's an MMO with a lot of party PvP. So I guess a good CPU, GPU and RAM would be the primary focus? (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong)

Thanks for reading, I hope someone's able to help me out. Feel free to ask me some more questions if I forgot to mention something."

So to start off let me say that I will be beginning university in a couple of months and I am going to be studying Computer Science. 

Now I want to ask which OS I should start developing apps for, WP, iOS, or Android? I WILL branch out to all and I want to be a good developer who does everything well, but where should I start? Which should I give the most focus to?

Which OS should I focus on the most if my goals are to get internships at ""The Big 4"", which OS will help develop my skills the most and help me use my skills for other stuff too? I don't imagine there would be a difference but would developing apps on any one of these look better on my resume than the other?

Overall, which would you recommend I dive into first to develop apps? 


P.S. I do have a Mac in case iOS is suggested.."

I'm looking to get an internship for this summer. I've applied to quite a few companies but not heard a lot back yet. I'm wondering however if some of you could have a look at my portfolio and CV and critique it and if you have any pointers in general and to improve what I have individually?

My portfolio is here: www.midnightpacific.com, my CV has it's own page and I have a page for university work and non-uni work.

Would also be interested in a software engineering internship, rather than just games.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What are your thoughts on the discovery of water on Saturn's moon? What are the chances of other life forms existing in those conditions? Can it be habitable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8i0i?context=5)|That's pretty awesome. We now think there may be liquid water oceans on Enceladus (Saturn), Europa (Jupiter), and Ceres (main-belt asteroid). Since we know that life on Earth depends on liquid water, these all may be good places to look for life. But also, life depends on many other factors, that we need to explore more on these bodies - like a source of energy, carbon molecules, etc. -BC.
[So, because it has liquid water, would there be any way to... teraform... it for human life? Could it be habitable at some point?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9x9u?context=5)|My personal opinion? Anything can be ""terraformed"" with enough energy. But that's the trade - enough energy may be enormous and not practical. Plus, you need other gases besides water and oxygen for all life forms (not just humans, but also plants and microbes). -BC 
[How would you best describe a total eclipse of the heart? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9i5i?context=5)|Love is like a shadow on me all of the time. -BC.
[Can you use your super secret weather machines to eliminate the cloud cover over Charlotte, NC tonight so we can observe the eclipse?  Big fan of that space stuff, btw. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgsb1v7?context=5)|When I'm able to control the weather I'll let you know. Or not. Muah ha ha. -BC 
[If the moon was made of spare ribs, would ya eat it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8v0o?context=5)|Probably, I'd be pretty hungry by the time I got there -RCW.
[What is an average day like performing your duties at Nasa?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8nai?context=5)|An average day is pretty boring to the outside observer, my research is all data analysis, so I do a lot of computer coding. Depending on my current project, I have to sit in a lot of meetings or teleconferences. But I get to do some cool stuff sometimes! Like doing public outreach: NASA hosts web-chats, stuff like this AMA here on reddit, going to the Space and Rocket Center here in Huntsville to participate in events (touch a Moon rock!). I go to conferences and team meetings around the country to talk about my research and collaborate on projects. Right now I am working on an analysis of the shallow moonquakes that were recorded by the Apollo seismometers, and I am also on the science team for the upcoming InSight mission (Mars geophysical station) which will launch in 2016. -RCW.
 |I really enjoy working at NASA. On an average day, I work on several different projects, including lab work and mission planning. I work on geochronology - or how old a rock is - so I need to get samples, crack them open, and pop them in my mass spectrometer. We write proposals and papers, and review other peoples proposals and papers, and present them at conferences when we can to make sure we are doing the right science. For NASA, I sit of some committees that help plan NASA's new missions and goals, which I enjoy helping with. -BC.
[Thanks for the reply! When you say *coding* do you mean programming or classifying and identifying things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgsaidb?context=5)|Programming. I use FORTRAN, MATLAB, and Mathematica. -RCW.
[Does the lunar eclipse only happen during a full moon?  If so, why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs98el?context=5)|Hi Eva! Yes, eclipses only happen during a full Moon, because the Sun, Earth, and Moon need to be all lined up in a row. If the Moon is not lined up with the Earth and Sun, it wouldn't look full. Don't forget to remind your parents to wake you up so you can catch a glimpse! -RCW.
[Do total lunar eclipses happen often? Are their partial lunar eclipses? How often do they happen in comparison to solar? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8ovw?context=5)|Eclipses come in cycles. Yes, there are partial lunar eclipses, but during those the Moon doesn't appear red. There's another total lunar eclipse coming in October. This is a good site with info on when eclipses occur and which areas of the world can see them: [Link to eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov](http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OH2014.html#LE2014Apr15)  -RCW 
[What is the most widespread myth about our solar system or what we have been taught in the past about space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs83wr?context=5)|I tend not to pay much attention to myths, was there something specifically you had in mind? -RCW.
[Why does it take on a reddish hue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8tpk?context=5)|It is the same effect that causes the sky to look red at sunset. The light that is reaching the Moon from the Sun passes through the Earth's atmosphere at low angle and is scattered; red wavelengths are scattered least.
[What is the difference between a ""harvest moon"" (an orange/red moon seen in the fall\) and a blood moon? They look the same on google searches, but apparently ""blood moon"" is also some silly name for a full moon in October.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgsaq6a?context=5)|Various cultures have given names to each full Moon of the year - presumably related to their importance in planning for sowing, harvesting, animal migrations, etc. A harvest moon is the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox, it doesn't generally have a color associated with it (except what you might see as it is rising or setting). The blood moon or hunter's moon is the full moon in october. Other names include flower moon and wolf moon, etc. -BC.
[Do you know of a website where I can go see in what location in the world and at what time the eclipse can be seen (best\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8crp?context=5)|This one is good too: [Link to eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov](http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OH2014.html#LE2014Apr15T)
[I don't want to stay up that late to watch the lunar eclipse. Can you guys reschedule it for earlier in the evening please?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgsbfsq?context=5)|Have your people call my people -RCW.
[What is the most incredible thing about our moon that most people don't know about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9n5b?context=5)|There are lots of neat things, it's hard to pick the most incredible one, but here's a nifty tidbit: the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth, which means that the same side always faces us. But thanks to slight orbital variations, the Moon experiences librations, meaning that the leading and trailing edges (and also the top and bottom edges) sometimes expose slightly different hemispheres of the Moon. So we can actually see about 57% of the Moon's surface over the course of about a month. Here's an animation that shows it better than I've described [Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lunar_libration_with_phase2.gi) -RCW.
 |To me, the most interesting thing is that every crater you see on the Moon had a counterpart on the Earth at some point. We don't see those craters today because the Earth recycles its crust through plate tectonics, erosion, etc. So the Moon is the place to look if you want to see the cratering history of the Earth. Which is huge! -BC.
[One of my highschool teachers once said that Hubble isn't powerful enough to see the objects left behind by the first moonwalk. I find this hard to believe due to how powerful Hubble is. So, can Hubble see the small objects on the lunar surface?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9ri2?context=5)|The issue with Hubble isn't resolving power - Hubble can't look at the Moon because it's too bright. It would saturate the camera -RCW.
[For Dr. Weber, how does earthquake activity on other planets compare to that here on Earth? Are our landers/rovers frequently equipped with seismographic equipment or is this something you're just now beginning work on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8t99?context=5)|Right now, the Moon is the only body besides Earth that we have seismic data for (from Apollo). Moonquakes are a lot different than earthquakes. The Moon has no active volcanoes or plate tectonics, so the seismic activity there is mostly all related either to impact on the surface, or solid body tides. We sent a seismometer to Mars on Viking, but because it was located on the lander body and not in direct contact with the ground, it only recorded wind. The good news is that we'll be sending a new seismometer to Mars on the InSight mission in 2016! I would love for every mission to have a seismometer, but because of the technological requirements (most importantly, that it can live on the surface for a long time), sending them to other planets is pretty tough. -RCW 
[1\)  How often does a blood moon like this occur so that the USA can see it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8fxf?context=5)|Lunar eclipses occur every few years - it's not terribly uncommon. Whether we can see if from the US or not depends on the exact timing - see the top for links to eclipse times.
[Would setting up a moon base significantly contribute to the advance of our technology, or are we already very much capable of such feat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9f9j?context=5)|We have the majority of the technology now to set up a moon base - if you think of something like a space station on the Moon. But right now it would need to be resupplied from the Earth, like ISS is now. NASA is currently working on closed-loop life support systems that would lead to autonomous lunar bases and long trips in space. -BC.
[Is it possible that there is a planet exactly the same as ours that rotates at the same speed and distance on the other side of the sun.  but we cant see it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8ftn?context=5)|No, all the planets are in orbit around the sun, so nothing is ever permanently on the other side of the sun from us. -BC.
[I think you're missing his point! What if it had the same orbital period as our own planet? It would remain hidden from us as we moved, because it would move too, at the same rate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgsa3qp?context=5)|Oh, I see. Well, it's incredibly unlikely, but also we have sent spacecraft all over with different vantage points, so they would have been able to see it even if it was hidden from our point of view. -BC.
[Where do you think NASA would be in terms of technology if the government had continued the amount of funding that was provided in the 1960's and 70's? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8un5?context=5)|This is a difficult question (but one many what-if historians enjoy thinking about). The Nation's goals have changed since then, and NASA follows the will of the nation. We have developed a lot of new technologies related to the space shuttle, the International Space Station, and robotic science missions. But, if NASA had had more money, it's probably fair to say that more could have been developed. -BC.
[What time can I exspect to see this over North East Ohio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs865q?context=5)|Total eclipse will start at 2:06am eastern, with greatest eclipse at 2:45am eastern  EDIT: forgot to account for DST, sorry! greatest eclipse at 3:45am eastern.
[That's okay, I didn't really want to get up for work tomorrow anyway...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9gfe?context=5)|I remember as a kid, making my mom wake me up in the middle of the night to see an eclipse. She swears she did it but I have no memory of it! -RCW.
[It's a plot against having to wake up themselves at 2 in the morning.  ""Of course I woke you up honey, but you were so tired you probably just forgot!""  SHENANIGANS!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9z2m?context=5)|She denies it :)
[What would the next steps be for scientists if we discovered life on another planet? Does the Mars Rover even have the technology onboard to check for life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8tni?context=5)|It's very difficult for us to positively identify life on another planet for many reasons - some reasons are cleaning all life off our own detectors, and another is that life may be different. But even if you just mean earth-like life (DNA), we had an experiment on Viking that did not discover any (to the limits of its detection ability) and of course we tested the Apollo rocks extensively and found none. We do keep looking though - life on other planets would surely teach us an enormous amout about both that planet and about our own life and evolution on the Earth. -BC.
[Is it true that the distance between the Earth and the Moon is increasing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8skr?context=5)|Yes, but VERY slowly. The interaction between the Earth and Moon causes torques to the Moon, which causes it to essentially ""spend"" its energy. The less energy it has, the farther it moves from the Earth. But it's a slow process - only about 1 cm a year. Nothing to worry about! -BC.
[If the Earth had two moons like Mars, What types of eclipses would we be able to witness? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8djm?context=5)|The moons of Mars are much smaller than our Moon, even in relation to the diameter of the parent body. So the moons of Mars don't cover the whole disk of the sun (no solar eclipses from Mars). How the shadow of Mars covers Phobos and Deimos depends on their orbits - I don't know this offhand. -BC 
[What about the moon being in the earth's shadow makes it appear red? Also, is it possible for earth to ever appear in transit across the sun from the surface of Mars? Like Venus can for us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8cje?context=5)|The Earth's shadow is bending the light from the sun, so we see the red part of the spectrum just like you'd see in early sunrise or late sunset. Someone said, it's like seeing all the sunrises and sunsets all at once. I'd have to double-check the orbits, but I bet you could see an Earth transit from Mars.

It's very exciting work to me because I get to understand other planets without even going there. I work like a geologist - but instead of mapping and studying earth rocks, I use rocks from other planets and study them in the same way.

Even with light pollution you should still be able to see it like usual. (Disclaimer: I am assuming you can see the Moon every other night - light pollution is bad but not THAT bad, right???) 
[Where is the most ideal place to set up a Lunar base and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgsbaee?context=5)|Since the Moon has nearly no atmosphere, the surface at the equator heats up to 100C during the day and cools off to -100C at night. So we have been thinking of bases near the poles, where the temperature is colder (-50C) all the time but doesn't vary much. There are some places near the poles that are on mountain peaks and see the sun all of the time, so that would be good for solar power at a base. These places also can see the Earth much of the time, which is good for communication. Finally, they are within reach of unexplored territory near the poles and the far side, so that's good for science. -BC.
[Question for Renee Weber from an aspiring geologist/seismologist: based on what we already know, what is your best guess on what we might find when we bring seismometers to Mars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9qq4?context=5)|I would guess, verification that Mars is stratified like Earth (crust, mantle, core), some information on the properties of the crust (fractionation, density, properties relevant to transmission of seismic energy like wave speed velocity and attenuation). We might be lucky to record landslides or meteorite impacts - the potential for a good science return from that type of event is higher because the location can be verified with satellite imagery.
[What does seismic information tell us about the history of planets/the solar system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs99e0?context=5)|We can use seismology to probe a planet's interior, and learn whether it has differentiated (meaning, separated into layers, like a crust, mantle, and core). Understanding the size and state of a core (whether it is solid or liquid), and the seismic properties of a body (such as the speeds at which seismic waves are transmitted, the density and porosity of the layers, etc) tell you a lot about how that particular planet formed and evolved.  We only have data from the Earth and the Moon right now, and that's why I'm interested in sending seismometers to other planets. We're sending one to Mars in 2016! -RCW.
[Why or what drove you to pursue a career in astronomy? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgsag60?context=5)|I would classify my career under planetary science, not astronomy, but… I started graduate school in geophysics doing ocean-bottom seismology. I had grown up loving space and planets and getting really into sci-fi (Star Trek). So when as a first-year student I was given the opportunity to study the seismic data from the Apollo lunar missions, I knew that was the project for me. 
[When's the next solar eclipse going to happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgshlg1?context=5)|There's an annular solar eclipse on the 29th of this month, but it'll only be visible at max eclipse from Antarctica.

No shading indicates that the entire eclipse from beginning to end will be visible; full shading means that none of the eclipse will be visible. Partial shading indicates that the Moon will either rise already eclipsed, or set before the eclipse is over. The diagram with the red circle shows which part of the Earth's shadow the Moon will move through - the labels P1/U1/etc correspond to the shaded regions on the map. Hope this helps! -RCW

Why will the moon appear red tonight?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgsorqt?context=5)|The Moon appears red because light from the sun is scattered as it travels through the Earth's atmosphere. It is the same effect that causes the sky to appear red at sunset. -RCW.
[I know this May be dumb, but do eclipses effect tides any differently? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgstwdg?context=5)|The gravitational pull between the Moon and the Earth (and to a lesser extent, the Sun) is the cause of tides. The largest tides occur when the Sun and the Moon are in the same direction in the sky relative to Earth - that would be during a solar eclipse. But it's the position of the bodies in their orbits that causes the tides, not the eclipse itself. -RCW

  Anyhow, I work in sales, but I'm going to college for a degree in computer science so I'd like to think I'm somewhat competent when it comes to fixing computers. As an aside, I had an old C2D machine because I'm in college and it was inexpensive.  
  
My manager came up to me one day and said ""hey, my computer keeps randomly shutting off all the time. I think it's broken"". The way he described the problem, I suspected nothing more was broken on it than a bad hard drive, so I offered to have him bring it to work and I'd take it home and try to fix it. Long story short, he ended up just buying a new laptop, but he offered to sell me his old rig for $60, as he didn't really want or need it anymore. The machine was custom built by a friend of his and had an Intel core i7-920, 4GB of Corsair Dominator RAM, a gigabyte mobo with 2 PCIE x16 slots and a 9800GTX+ (which is old as sin, but I'm sure I could find something to do with it).   
  
  Anyways, I connected the motherboard to my power supply because I thought his PSU could also possibly be the problem, stick in a linux boot disc and voila, the thing POSTs, boots, and handles a linux installation. I gutted my old computer, dropped in his old motherboard and CPU combo and ~two weeks later, the thing still runs smooth as butter.

1. During my degree I have to do 3 internships (optional 4th one). I was wondering if it is possible to submit internship applications to companies in the U.S. and expect a response from them.

2. What would be the best way to land an interview with one of the big 4 (whether it's internship/full-time job offer) ?

3. In know Google has an HQ in Montreal, what would would be the advantages of interning/working there instead of the one in Mountain View ?

The first phone interview was last December, the on-site interview was in March, and the follow-up phone interview was a couple of weeks ago at the beginning of April.

Last week they asked me to do a background check through a third-party background check provider. I just got the results back today and there were two discrepancies with my employment (everything else was fine though).

One discrepancy was that for the end date of my internship last summer, I put 8/29/2013 (a Thursday). The company I interned at told the third-party that I left on 8/30/2013 (a Friday). They were on a 9/80 schedule and my last working day was on a Thursday before an off-Friday, so I put that Thursday as the end date instead of that Friday.

The other discrepancy was that I indicated I was still employed at my last job, which I left in the middle of March.

The thing is, I provided the information the third-party used for the background check back in February. The company I applied to made me fill out an application form with my education, employment history, etc. in February before the on-site interview in March. So at the time, I was still working at that job and the information I gave about that job was correct.

When the third-party actually performed the background check, I was no longer at that job. Thus, they marked it as a discrepancy.

Should I be worried about these discrepancies when all the other parts of my background check were fine? Should I try to contact HR to tell them that the background check company used outdated information?"

How can I protect myself?,rjcatani,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/232aeu/passiveaggressive_boss_possibly_plagiarizing_how/,"My boss runs a small business with a relatively small reach. I've been an intern running social media for about a year now. Over the course of the year my job ""duties"" expanded (while my pay remained the same) into administrative/clerical work as well to the point where I'm now scheduling almost every client. Part of my expanded duties became doing the content maintenance on the business website, like blogs and such (because of course, since I majored in graphics I must know about web and everything computer). 
As I started to get involved in the content editing and posting, I realized that most of the articles written were paraphrased from others, with some parts being verbatim. Photos in the site had been simply taken from google images. Come to find out, that a book my boss is going to publish, (a workbook style book) is basically another workbook but reformatted and words tweaked here and there.

I've already been making arrangements to leave this company quietly and with no burned bridges.

Where is the line in plagiarism? How close is too close to the original article? Am I duty-bound to report plagiarism if I think it's been done intentionally/unintentionally?

Also, What can I do to protect myself from being tied to something I had nothing to do with? How can I avoid being the scapegoat ""intern"" should my boss get caught? How can I keep my boss from retroactively putting my name on the book because of my editing and cover art?

I recently accepted an internship--this will be my first CS internship. It was my first offer in a pretty long and draining process of trying to find an internship. It pays $30 and hour and to be honest I think that number played a big part in swaying me. I was so happy to have found and internship and impressed by the salary that I canceled an interview at another company. I probably would have gone anyway--but I had a lot of class work to do and it was a full-day interview. I think its possible that the company whose interview I cancelled may have a better environment--but I also knew it probably didn't pay as much. Did I make a terrible decision? This has been weighing on me for a while. I think the fact that I really don't know what the hell I want out of a CS career led me to use money as a determining factor."
232dcl,0,2014-04-14,BSMET major with decent GPA. I have time next year for a math minor. Should I do it?,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/232dcl/bsmet_major_with_decent_gpa_i_have_time_next_year/,"I'm a junior in my third year with a 3.25 overall and a 3.64 in major GPA majoring in Mechanical Engineering Technology. I have a minor in Manufacturing Technology declared already that will not be an issue. I am ahead of schedule with my classes and my major requires i think 10 hours of ""technical electives"". With my minor, I think there will be 5 left for next. Well to get a minor in Math at my school, I only need 7? more hours of math credits above a 143 level math classes. These credits will count towards my tech electives. I spoke with my advisor today, and he thought it was a good idea. 

The three classes he suggested were:
* Matrix Algebra (2 hrs) - mixed signals from people
* Elementary Statistics (3 hrs) - everyone says its easy
* Calculus 3 (3 hrs) - I've heard its much easier than calc 2 at my school.

My math skills are decent, but I can do anything I set my mind to. I am worried I will get a C in Matrix Algebra and drop my GPA a tad (only 2 hours). I think I can get A's or B's at least in the other two. 
BTW, this semester, I'm taking 19.5 hours, and currently have A's in all of them. Hoping to graduate with around a 3.5.

My logic here is: I have heard the debate against BSME vs. BSMET and have a pretty good idea of the strengths and weaknesses of each. I am hoping that these extra classes will help with my current weaknesses upon graduating, and companies will see my resume and say, ""Oh, just another BSMET, he can't handle real engineering.. But wait! He has a minor in math, some club activities, and an internship, maybe I am wrong. Lets set up an interview.""

Am I wrong? How valuable is a minor in math? My school has great job placement, especially with someone with a 3.25 GPA, but the problem is they are all midwest positions. I have lived in the plains my entire life, and my goal is to not only get a great job in a year, but in a more exciting location. Ideally aerospace position in Colorado. I have great family and friends in the Kansas City area, but I'm looking for a change.

As much of an enigma internship-hunting is--it increases tenfold when I factor in a foreign country. Does anyone have any idea how I might go about finding an internship in London next year?

They have printer that is apparently not working so I sent them a newly configured one. On the server which handles all the printers, it is named ""402HEC"" or so.

But I Think I did not add it to be called like that on the host computer for the printer and left it as the standard HP printer name but I still configured it with the correct driver and IP adress..

Does that not matter or do they have to be identical?
Or am I just overcomplicating things, just want to make sure since Nothing is really logical when dealing with printers.

I understand that retaking it can make a huge spike in my GPA but I've just done the math and I literally need to get straight A's to achieve a 3.0 overall. Is it worth attempting to get a 3.0 overall? I would like to be able to put having a GPA over 3.0 on my resume so that I can apply to some more prestigious companies who list GPA as a requirement. If I get a 3.5 with my remaining coursework(do-able) and do not retake CSE 105, I can achieve a 3.08 in my major GPA. Does this hold any weight at all to companies since it's not my overall GPA?

I understand that companies look at more than just GPA, I just feel that my resume would get through more quick screenings by companies if I had GPA on it. I've gotten two internships so far, but I've had problems getting interviews from bigger companies.

A little bit of back story first: I graduated in December of 2013 with a BA in Philosophy from a very good university.  I have been interested in programming for over a year and considered changing my major but I did not want to be stuck in school for another 3 years to round out my CS degree.  

I have been speaking with alumni who work in developer positions and other programmers, and the more I read and hear about the field the more I fall in love with it.  I can simply think of nothing else that I would rather be doing.

Thus, I have set the goal of becoming a developer in NYC.  I will be moving there in September, and want to use the time inbetween to develop enough skill to perhaps be taken on as an intern at a company, and using this to break into the field.

I was hoping for some advice on what languages to study in the meantime in order to be a great candidate for an internship.  I was going to focus heavily on Javascript and Ruby, and try to build a solid personal portfolio before September.  Then, once in the city, I plan on attending the weekly meetups for startups and tech companies to pitch my skills and build connections - and hopefully get some work as a developer.  

Thus, my questions revolve around whether the above sounds like a good plan, and what languages you would all recommend to study.

If any of you are involved in the tech scene in NYC, what skills to you see as being the most in demand currently, and what do you predict to be the most in demand in 6 months?  

Thank you all so much for your time and effort.  The FAQ has been immensely helpful on beginning this journey, and I know your words will help immensely as well.  

Best,

I graduated this December with a BS in CS from a pretty decent/known school. However, during that time, I never built up a resume or had any impressive internships, which left my job search not yielding too many results. My goal was to work in NYC doing software engineering for a modern web company, but my lack of personal projects was probably my reason for lack of interview opportunities. I took a job in the ""IT"" section of a major corporation, which has turned out to be completely unrelated to my degree.

I saw an ad for App Academy - whose high average salary and job acceptance rate seemed almost too good to be true. A couple interviews later and I was accepted, but now I'm left with the choice whether to accept or not. Do any CS grads have experience with one of these programs? Do you believe them to a smart fast-track to a career ready portfolio, or a waste of time and money?

Thanks for any replies. I know questions like these are pretty common."

Where I'm struggling right now is picking a niche and really going for it. I was a straight Econ student until the summer of 2012 (junior year) I decided to give a programming class a try. I loved it and immediately added CS as a major. I'm now graduating in May, so essentially it has been less than 2 years since the first time I wrote a line of code. What I know for certain is that computing and information technology is my passion. I am in love with learning as much as I possibly can each day, and I'm excited to at least be at this point. 

I like to learn everything, but since I got into the field so late, I feel behind in my technical skills compared to other CS graduates. I have general knowledge of several languages (Java, Python, C, Obj-C, Scala) as well as HTML and CSS. Since my first programming class in 2012, I have been working at the university help-desk and risen to be one of the top student-consultants there, so I am extremely proficient in troubleshooting machines, software testing and documentation, working with end-users, all operating systems ect. I also had an internship last summer where I worked under two web developers and spent the summer building and maintaing sharepoint sites for a very large private firm, as well as working with the Project Management Team to migrate the company intranet from SharePoint 2007 to 2013. (A lot of what i did was meet with stake-holders within the company to gather requirements, opinions, data).

Given how late I got into IT, I feel like I've accomplished a good amount since that first class, but I also just cant seem to commit to a skill (front-end developer , or iOS developer, or Java Developer, or .NET developer). 

I'm fairly extroverted (which from my job and school experience seems rare for software devs), but I also feel that I have a strong analytical mind and a good blend of technical skill / ability to communicate. I'm pretty certain I want to be a full-time developer.

I guess I'm just looking for advice from anyone on here that's made it in the field/is in a position exactly where they want to be. How did you go about narrowing down your expertise within the field ? 

At this point, I do not believe I am skilled enough to be hired as a full time software dev. As I said, I believe the foundation is there, and I'm excited about that, but the problem is basically picking a language/technology subset to focus on. I've never built any projects of my own, and the only skills test i've taken so far was pretty much a disaster (it was java, and I really got tripped up with syntax errors).

I really appreciate any perspective/advice. Thanks for taking the time to read this in advance. "

Even when I help people (which is quite frequently, and will often due it to procrastinate my own work), I find myself using their laptop more than they do and just trying to program it out for them (maybe I'm impatient?).

Budget ~3000 but any savings is good! 

I say I want a gaming laptop, but I don't play games. 

Although currently this is because I have a laptop with intel HD, and am running linux. Why do I want a gaming laptop I don't even know, but I don't want to buy another laptop with intel HD graphics ever again. The only game I play is EVE online, although I can see that changing if I buy a laptop that can support more. 

Why don't I buy a gaming desktop? I need to finish up another year in college, and in between I need to travel for my internship, and I like to carry my laptop places.  Also you can't use a desktop on a bus. 

 This is what I'm looking for, the perfect laptop:

* 13"" screen size.| 14"" is acceptable as an alternative.  | may be a very very very pretty 15"" laptop, but then it has to be sleek and can't make any other sacrifices. I want 13"" because it's easy to fit in a bus seat in front of me or on an airplane. 

* For a processor I want i7-4XXXMQ, if you can convince me an i5 will suit me for compiling code and matlab I can accept that too. 

* For a graphics card I want NVIDIA 880M/780M/870M or AMD equivalent if it exists. I want it to last as long as humanly possible, which means play the current iteration of EVE online/dota2/CS on minimum graphics (on linux) for the next 4-5 years.  If it can run two instances of EVE, that's better. If it can run three, that's more points. 

* I want four USB ports. | 3 USB ports is acceptable.

* I want a CD drive | I can live without it

* Do they even make docking stations any more? If you find one I can accept a 15"" laptop.

* Large battery |.. or a battery will do of course. 


I understand this is impossible: portability and power do not go well together and who games on linux anyway?

This [13"" clevo](http://www.xoticpc.com/sager-np7338-clevo-w230ss-eta-march-p-6992.html) is in first place. 
&gt; 13"", no cd drive, 3 usb ports, ugly, 860M. Costs only 1000. Good linux support, no windows tax. 

New [razer blade](http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-blade) in second place

&gt;it's 14"", but costs twice as much, still doesn't have a CD drive, only three USB ports, and no removable battery I think, but it's battery is slightly better. The biggest pro is the 870M, which according to [this](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7834/nvidia-geforce-800m-lineup-battery-boost) is a 35% improvement. Also questionable linux support.

 I just want to hear your opinions. If you want to encourage me not to buy something so ridiculous, that is welcome too.

I would like to go back to school and pursue a degree in Geology, since I've always enjoyed the subject. The reason I didn't pursue it in the first place is because I have always struggled in Math.

This summer I'll be finishing up my ""junior"" year at a community college in a 3+1 program and in the fall I'll be entering the +1 portion. This fall semester will be the first iteration of the +1 portion of this program ever. While this local private university has produced CS graduates before, I'll be among only a handful or two of students that will be the first to graduate from their 3+1 program. It's an excellent way to save money on an education, as I'll have minimal debt, but I'm a little worried about the merit of a program that hasn't been done before. I can't be sure of job placement stats, if we'll have recruitment services, job fairs, etc.

I'm also a bit uneasy about how much I'll have accomplished by graduation. I just received my first exposure to programming last semester in a C++ course, and each semester here on out will be a crash course in CS and programming since I finished the brunt of my general education a couple years ago at a university I previously attended. For instance, this semester I'm taking 18 credit hours with Assembly, C#, Advanced C++, and a Windows Networking course. This summer I'll be taking Calculus, another Advanced C++ course, and a Data Structures/System Design course to finish out my ""junior"" year. It feels like it's all coming so fast that I don't know if I'll find a suitable niche in CS and be able to produce from that niche by graduation.

I've got some school projects from this semester that I could polish up and put on GitHub, and I'm either going to teach myself Objective-C and code an application/game or find an interesting implementation for C++ or C# that I'll enjoy coding into a project over the summer. However, I feel like I could use some mentoring since all but one of my CC professors are pretty out of touch outside academia. As a result, all of the programs I've coded, except a couple games, have been problems out of a text book.

With that said, would I benefit from delaying graduation by a semester for a Fall internship? Or should I just finish out school and rely on my school projects, prospective side projects, and whatever the level of merit a 3+1 program will provide?

But what bugged me was salary.  The position would be iOS development, and he said the salary would be $45k/year.  This seems REALLY low as my college (And other sources, for that matter), said the average starting wage for a software developer is around $70k.

He said that salaries for a new job are typically going to be based on your previous job, and since my internship only paid $13/hour, I shouldn't expect more than double that.

He also said that this company is working for people willing to work 50-55 hours per week.

It just seems like I'm being horrendously low-balled.  However, I've been unemployed for over two weeks now and I really need a job.  I'm thinking of moving forward with this just so I have work, but I'll continue looking for something better.

I'm pretty sure I'm not going to get an internship this summer due to applying pretty late and having mediocre credentials. Here's how it is...

I have no real extracurricular activities (volunteering, active club membership etc) and leadership. My GPA is mediocre at the moment (&lt;3.0) but my major GPA is a 4.0. My only past experience is a minimum wage customer service job. Not sure how my skill set compares to others in my major; I know Excel/Publisher/PPT etc, SQL (barely but willing to familiarize), photoshop and plan on developing some skills over the summer....Also, my network sucks! My family and family friends all are small business owners of restaurants and dry cleaners. And I haven't made an effort to draw connections from elsewhere.

Long story short, I fucked up pretty bad my first year and it has made me pretty unmotivated and depressed to do anything for myself. But since seeing counseling and advising, I want to be very proactive from now on.  Even though I feel like it's too late. 

I ~~HOPE~~ NEED to get an internship of sorts (preferably in supply chain, accounting, human resources, but anything really...) next Spring semester. For Fall term, I plan on joining a finance related club and actually be an active member. I'm going to get an alumni mentor to help me in my job search endeavors. My GPA will increase to above 3.0 by the end of that term (probably) because I'm taking 18 hours (let me know if this is too much). I'm going to try to get an on campus tutoring job or work study. Also, I'm expecting a leadership position of some sort in a new upcoming club. 

ANY tips, support, words of wisdom for me? What things could I do over the summer to amp up my resume and really set myself apart? What are some skills to develop that are attractive to employers?

I work here for 9 months now and I can say that 4 of them dislikes me (including my boss). In front of me, my boss is a sweerheart, she will help me with anything I need etc, but you just know when someone is talking shit behind your back. Then there's this girl and this guy, let's call them Ashley and John. They work here for a year now, and I don't know if they dislike me because I'm the younger here, or if I am in fact an idiot, but I doubt that, because I mostly just stay here using the computer doing my work, and I'll only talk to any of them if I have a work question or if they talk to me first. I've had to put up with some of Ashley and John's teasing (John is like Ashley's dog, he will do ANYTHING for her, so he uses me as a way to look funnier to Ashley by ""putting pranks"" on me). Here are a few things that happened:

* I can't count how many times I got here to start working on my computer, and there was a funny picture on my desktop. I mean, it got annoying already. Today I got here and there was a picture of a really ugly woman. I know it was John since he used my computer this morning, he was probably trying to look funny to my boss and the other girl who works here, let's call her Jessica. (she's new here too, started out last week and is already making fun of me). Jessica had the courage to ask ""Didn't YOU put that picture in there?"" She knew I didn't because she works here in the mornings too, meaning she and my boss saw John putting the picture. And it wasn't the first time as I said, there's always a picture waiting for me when he uses my computer, my boss won't say anything because well she's on their side, she makes fun of me behind my back too.

* In the kitchen, you had to write your name on your cup and let it there on the kitchen so it would be there anything you needed water, I did, and one day I got there, put the water in my cup, when I drank it I tasted sugar in it. Someone  had put sugar on my cup. Funny, I wonder who.

* Ashley teases me all the time, any chance she gets. She tries to look responsable to my boss (who is like her best friend, they met here), Ashley tried to look like she is my boss all the time, telling me what to do or not. She's an intern like me. I have a boss to do that.

I know that Ashley and John hate me, I have proof. My boss is one of those people that goes with the wave, so if everyone is talking shit about me, she will do that too. Never in front of me though. I'm just tired of there people, I'm the younger here but feel like I'm the only mature one. I just try to ignore but I want them to respect me, not feel like it's okay to tease me."

Very surprised how much my last story took off, I even got gold! So here I am with another fantastic tale...this one is from my time working as an unpaid intern, doing help desk for a very very bad university in London, I wont name names, but it's next to the Cutty Sark, for those that care.

Anyway, we worked out of a small 'walk in' clinic which was basically a room with a desk, a computer and some cupboards with basic equipment like cables, keyboards, mice ect. Students would often come in and ask to borrow things for the day, mostly for presentations and group work using the ceiling projectors built into all the classrooms. We would take names so we could keep track of what is coming and going, there was very little trust as there is a lot of theft and vandalism within the school. For some reason, £2.99 mice and keyboards are worth possibly getting expelled over. Anyway, one special day, a group of model students waltz into the clinic demanding a bunch of equipment: 
 * Two VGA Cables 
 * Two HDMI Cables 
 * THREE mice 
 * a keyboard 
 * A monitor (?!?!!?!?)

I ask what it's all for and flatly refuse to give them a monitor. They tell me it's for a presentation in one of the rooms and things are broken. Instead of giving them the equipment I went to the room with the 'broken' equipment, to find it's simply missing. I see what's going on here... Acting on gut feeling, I tell them that I'll 'be right back' and go to the next door classroom which is empty, and oh look...missing equipment... I move onto another, there is a class but they're not using the computer, from outside the door i don't see a keyboard and mouse where it should be. I guess these delinquents are going around pillaging the classrooms for equipment! I go back to the walk-in and call my manager to let him know what's going on. He says he will be down in 5 mins. 2 Mins later he comes rushing down with a head of department! (i better be right or I'm in deep shizzle).

I lead them to the room that the A+ students are sitting in, listening to loud music and shouting at each other. On one of the desks is a pile of equipment, it looked like at least 7-8 different items. There is immediate silence in the room (bar the music in the background, which was quickly fumbled around and turned off). The head of department demanded the students empty their bags, and guess what? A torrent of our equipment comes pouring out, I imagine breaking some of it, but I didn't care honestly, it's worth less than my lunch! There was lots of shuffling and 'That aint mine!', but they soon turned their attention to me, shouting about how I'm a 'rat' and that I 'grassed them up'. They started getting pretty aggressive and I was beginning to worry, but the police were called and all 3 students were held for a day, and then expelled from the Uni. However, they knew my name, where I worked and what time I left for the train station every day...shit... Luckily, I was coming towards the end of my internship, with only about 5 days left of the 2 months. I came to an agreement with my manager to end the internship early in light of recent events. I still got a shining reference with mention of my ability to 'remain calm and make the right decisions when faced with a difficult and unique situation'. I tend to avoid that area now :)

*And they would have gotten away with it, if it wasn't for that meddling intern!*

Thank you for reading.

EDIT: I should clarify, the extent of the theft was not just 'the value of my lunch' that was just the sum of a few items which may have been broken when emptied from one of the students bags at waist height. In total I estimate £400-500 worth of items, ranging from long, high quality cables, splitter cables, wired AND wireless mice/keyboards (most of the value from wireless stuff here) as well as a few USB memory sticks which had names and contact numbers on them (stolen from students, most likely containing course work). Basically anything that wasn't bolted down.  That was what was just on their persons at the time, we had been seeing things going missing for weeks, possibly more unreported theft from other students too. Scumbags deserved what they got."
23ao93,2,2014-04-17,"Internship, or job experience?",boredom_cat,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/23ao93/internship_or_job_experience/,"Keeping it short, I've been handed a LOT of responsibility as a Supervisor in a tech based job for over 4 years, but I will have to lose the position within the year for the simple reason that is is a student only position, and I am graduating shortly.

I cannot move up to a full time job, unless someone in one leaves, and they aren't the kind of job one gives up easily.

My major [a type of architecture] will want to see some experience in that field, which my job currently is not.

Should I seek an internship out of school, or do you guys think I can swing my skills and show my school portfolio well enough they'll overlook interning?

If that falls through, is there a good chance I can get a decent job on my way out of school? I've got some insane amounts of tech and people skills, and have handled huge amounts of responsibility in this job so far. If qualifications would be useful, I can list some of my skills and responsibilities to see what you all think?

**EDIT:** Skills from this job, as well as some responsibilities:

- Reviewing resumes and applications for new applications to a position below mine. [over 100 applicants a year]
- Interviewing applicants and rating them to determine if they would be material for said job position
- Training new employees
- Designing and improving training sessions
- Upkeep of our technology on site
- Maintenance, repair, and troubleshooting on our devices
- Internet, Networking, and Virus remediation
- Solving customer issues with their devices, be it Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, other
- On committee meetings for how we communicate out to the rest of the university [student only job, remember?]
- Keeping employees in line and making sure they are happy in the job, and conducting employee evaluations
- Firing employees if necessary
- Excellent troubleshooting with user-end hardware and software
- Conducting outreach events to tell others about the job
- Organizing work group events, training days, etc
- Constant improvements with policy, procedure, hardware, software, and literally anything we can do to make our jobs easier, our customers happier, or our workers happier.
- Lots more.


TL,DR; I am in school, soon to lose my student only job of 4 years which will look excellent on any resume, but it is out of the field of my Degree, and I just want to be in a financially stable job ASAP."

Endless job postings have been unsuccessful (thus far), and each posting I find myself tailoring my resume for things I'm not particularly interested in.

I'm a senior at UC Santa Cruz and will graduate in December of this year. I am very interested in embedded systems, sensors and smart grids. I spent the past summer in a lab on campus continuing the development of an energy monitoring wall plug, and in the fall I built my own autonomous robot from scratch (a class I really enjoyed). My senior design project is a small scale power grid which will be used for research and to show control improvements available to the power grid. I will acknowledge I'm no computer scientist, but I do enjoy coding. I would consider myself fairly strong in C, but I have experience with object-oriented java. I'm also beginning to learn python.

Here is my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rza2u9611i7jq46/Blank.pdf).

For those of you with internships... any suggestions? Any red flags about my resume? I feel guilty playing the ""key-word"" game with the resume scanners and don't want to falsely market myself.

I have a 3.3. Is engineering grad school an option? Also, as it pertains to my interests, I am debating between CS and CE for grad school. Suggestions? Better career options in either direction?"

I really like being hands on with tech and fixing problems while learning along the way. The only thing that is holding me back from getting into IT is the lack of advancement I can make. For instance engineering I have the options to start as an intern, then go to a small company on a team, then become manager of that team, and one day maybe go to a larger engineering team like Apple. Obviously none of that is guaranteed but I am using it as an example. I want to advance in whatever field I go into and I feel like with IT you get an IT job here maybe transfer there but your still a tech. Can anyone prove me wrong or give me advice?"

I'm a sophomore CS/History double major in a rather difficult situation. Early on, I didn't apply for nearly enough opportunities as I should have. Although I had one interview for a programming internship and one IT job (obviously I'm less interested in that), when time came to get HR approval for the first job, the company was acquired by a larger company, and my offer seems to be in limbo, and I haven't been able to get a response from anyone.

I'm a qualified programmer with solid grades at highly-regarded liberal arts college with a good cs program (3.6 major gpa), but my experience is almost entirely theoretical, which might be a hinderance.

If this offer falls through, which I think it most likely will, what do I do? Are there any smaller firms with informal programs who are having trouble finding qualified applicants? Working at a start up is really appealing to me. What should my next course of action be?

I live in New York City, if that helps at all."
23bi6l,6,2014-04-17,I'm graduating in one month from a community college with an associates in CS.

What do I have to do to even get an interview?  I unfortunately don't have any internships under my belt, but in my defense all the companies I contacted never even replied to me. My GPA is 3.78.  

And if I got an interview, what kind of questions would they ask a recent graduate?  I know regular interviews ask all kinds of logic questions [like in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20ahfq/heres_a_pretty_big_list_of_programming_interview/), but I feel like I wouldn't be able to answer all of those.  I've been practicing every day, but I don't know if my practice is good enough (but that could be because I have no idea what employers are looking for).  A lot of the information online and on reddit is contradictory.  Some say I need a portfolio (which I can produce), others say that can only hurt you.  Same with having a github account or a SO account.    

tl;dr, what should a programmer in my situation know how to do?

23btdw,2,2014-04-17,"Undergraduate: focus on academics and grades, or on hobby projects?",sirciny,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/23btdw/undergraduate_focus_on_academics_and_grades_or_on/,"I'm an undergraduate at a top-tier liberal arts university, and I plan to graduate with a degree in CS and pursue a software engineering / CS-related career. During high school, I got in the habit of prioritizing academics above almost all else, but I realize that many of my CS peers appear to be miles ahead of me because they work on hobby projects or do programming work almost every day, often sacrificing either academics or sleep. They remind me that I could be preparing for a more advanced career earlier on if I made coding a regular habit during, and not only after, my undergrad years.

I think sleep and socializing are pretty important, so to maintain a realistic balance between the most important aspects of life for the next couple of years, it seems that the only way I can add more coding is by cutting out some studying and spending less time on academics. In light of the fact that I don't see myself pursing academia or, apparently, anything for which grades matter, is a slight drop in my GPA permissible? I currently have a 3.75, and I imagine that if I made coding a priority, it would hover around 3.0 - 3.3. Intellectually, I suspect that this isn't a big deal, but it's hard to convince myself to actually change my deeply ingrained academic habits.

Other potentially relevant information: I have had two coding internships in the past, and I currently work as a webmaster and web developer for a professor."

[You and me both, haha.  On a more serious note. Why did the doctors wait so long to remove the tumor? Judging from your picture, it looks like the tumor must have been a decent sized one. Did they try other means of treatment before removal or did they discover it late?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvkodr?context=5)|Cancer was technically inoperable. We tried tons upon tons of chemos to stop the cancer, but eventually we had to give in to the surgery.
[Inoperable how? Was it due to the complicated location on your face? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvkr11?context=5)|Yes. I think it was because of my cheek boned. IIRC it was wrapped around the checkbone.

I don't have to tell you that no person is completely perfect (not even Einstein\) because you can already see how our imperfections make us who we are.  I don't have to do anything at all actually, but I choose to. I want to help you understand why other people's aspirations will fall short of your own, why your path is more difficult then average, or why you have so much potential. The truth is that I haven't got those answers for anyone but myself. If there is one thing I'm perfect at, it's being me.

I admire your balls, you not only battled cancer and won, you even post, educate and answer questions about it. Most amazing is probably your attitude, I love how you probably have had somewhat of a shitty life experience when it comes to health issues, yet you spread more joy then I ever have in my entire life. and I've lived a couple more years then you. keep up the good energy because it helps other people more then you know!

23c8fq,31,2014-04-18,College Tech Rant,s3c7i0n,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/23c8fq/college_tech_rant/,"This is my First post here, I just figured I'd rant about a few of my stories. So recently I've more or less become the ""official unofficial"" tech of the area I hang out in at college. This place is just a general hangout / study zone, with a student store at one end. My name is finally getting well enough known that people I've never met are asking for me by name, which is fantastic considering I'm currently freelancing. 

First, a guy shows up, claiming to be an expert in building computers, brings in his laptop, nice Asus ROG, and wants me to strip it, clean it, and put it back together. Apparently the guy had done it himself before, but it ""doesn't work quite right ever since. "" So I open it up and check the heatsinks, first thing I see is a block of dust. A block. Like, sheet of dryer lint after 10 loads of laundry block. This thing has dual heatsinks, and the other one is no better. After those are dealt with, I check the CPU and GPU. Oh god. This guy used a full syringe of arctic silver and pretty much just hosed the area with it. Of course it wasn't gonna work right, but at least he didn't use any hydrogen peroxide.

So I clean it all off, make it all nice and spiffy, and properly apply the paste, then put it all back together, total time: one and a half hours. The computer boots about 5 seconds faster, and idles at room temp, down from 70C. Customer is thrilled. 

Another time, some guy walks in, starts messing with Ethernet cables, pulling them from the wall sockets, tying them in knots, etc. Security had to come and remove him from the campus, but left the cables in a pile. As none of the sockets were labeled, I had to spend 2 hours cursing that man and a lazy IT department until every cable was back in the right place and specific socket. Is it normal for a networked printer to only work if plugged into a specific socket? If it matters, the school uses novella for logging in. 

Lastly, today the copy machine was acting up, wouldn't work for anyone for no apparent reason, no jam, plenty of paper and toner, every option set properly. I walked by, coffee in hand, and jokingly put my free hand on top and said ""heal."" It immediately started working again, much to my surprise, and to the delight of the man standing there, who offered me an internship at a local social center for developmentally disabled people, starting in the next week or so. 

Thanks for reading my rant, this is by no means all my stories of college tech support, and I'm sure I'll have plenty of new stories in the upcoming weeks, definitely starting with the epic of Martin the slob.

I've been interning at startup (~20 employees) in the San Francisco bay area for about 9 months doing development/validation testing.  Most of my work includes test fixture development and Labview programming.  The CEO and CTO have expressed interest in hiring me on full time after graduation so they've set up a meeting to talk about it.  I like the atmosphere and work I'm doing at the company so it would be ideal to stay with them.  Between my internship, class load, design project and TA position I havn't applied to anywhere else.  My questions are:

1.  How should I negotiate salary?  I have no experience in asking for a salary from management.  The average in my area for new grads is $64k/yr but I think I've shown them that I'm worth more than the regular joe.  

2.  How much should my experience and knowledge of the product play into this calculation?  

3.  I have no idea what the other people on my team are making.  Is there a way to ask them without offending them?

Some of you might remember me from a similar thread that was posted a couple of weeks back. Well, I am back again after a successful spell with a couple of folks giving them practice in programming interviews. I had to delete the last thread to cut the incoming PMs so that the number was manageable.

Who am I ? I am an engineer at Amazon(can verify if you are really interested in taking this up.) looking to help provide interviewing practice to people who are interviewing at Software companies - both internship as well as full time.

Why? 
When I was interviewing one of the biggest pain points was lack of practice in actual interviews. I could sit and solve problems all day long on paper, but when it was d-day my performance would not be of the highest standards. I am looking to fix that same problem with other folks out here. All along I received help from unprecedented quarters and I would like to do the same in whatever way I can. Also - There is nothing more awesome than helping people get successful.

How do I sign up for this? 
Send me a PM with the following information. - Name - Email address - Position (Intern / full time) - Companies you are interviewing for (If there aren't you can say meh)

Do you have to pay? 
No.

What does this cover? 
Resume overview - Phone screen practice - Feedback

What happens next?
 I am looking to have a slot or two next week. Last time there were a lot of PMs and I managed to get replies across to most of you (sorry if I missed any). After your PM I would definitely try my best to accommodate you. If not, we will set up some time in the future.

The interview would be mainly around algos/DS/OOPS , so if the position you are applying for does not have any such interviews, this will not be of any use.

I will be starting my internship at Amazon in a few weeks, and I am extremely nervous about it. The reason is because I will be using Java, a language that I have never used before. I am CmpE major (graduating next year) that has been using C for the past three years, and I am good/great at it (relative to my classmates). 

I assume I am in the minority, as most of the other interns would be CS majors who will have had prior experience in Java. Were any of you in a similar situation as me while interning at any company? How did it turn out for you? Was it stressful having to pick up a new language while doing the necessary work required?

I am unsure of how ""difficult"" the assigned projects will be, and there are supposed to be ""code reviews."" I am mostly worried about writing code in Java that would be considered ""horrendous"" for Java (even for interns).

I am currently going through the MIT online Java course, and I plan to go through other ones that I can find as well. Is there some other website/documents that any of you could recommend for C programmers to get up to speed on Java?

Is there any advice any of you could provide me with?"

I think it would be an interesting experience, but the fact that it's completely remote makes me a little unsure.

How should I approach this?",ElectricGoldfish,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/23dydk/i_got_an_internship_offer_but_im_still_waiting_on/,"I had an interview for my dream job (well, dream internship, but it would lead into my dream job), and they originally told me that they would make a decision by April 16th, and that they would be in touch with their decision either way, but they still have not been in contact with me, and I'm not sure what that means.

For the record, I felt that the interview went pretty well and that I'm a solid candidate too.

Today, I got an offer from another company, which while a great job at a great company with a decent salary, would still be completely trumped by any offer from the first company. I told them that I would have to consider my offers, and that I would be in touch, but since it's approaching the end of the semester, there's not much time left before I have to make a decision, and I don't know how much longer it will take the first company to make a decision.

How should I approach this?

I emailed them the day after the day that they said they would make a decision, but never got a reply to that either.

Should I e-mail them again, and tell them that I need a decision because I have another offer?


And as a corollary, am I just deluding myself with optimism by thinking that their silence is a good sign?

 My reasoning is that if I was rejected, they would just need to send me a form-rejection email, but sending out a job offer takes more time and that this is what's causing the delay. 

(Of-course, the alternative where they just forgot to send out rejection letters is probably more likely)."

I didn't even get the chance to interview. What should I do? Here's the set-up:

I applied to a GIS Internship position (entry-level, obv) for a fairly small environmental consultant group (probably not that many applicants). It seems they do impact statements and advising for energy and construction companies. I was so thrilled about this job because I need an internship to graduate in the fall and it was absolutely the best option I've found so far. Making maps for the field workers, making optimal site reports, and providing vulnerability analyses. This is literally what I want to do as a career in the future and have done that stuff multiple times in my class projects, so I was thrilled. I even followed up after applying two weeks later to tell them how excited I was about the position.

I am a senior undergraduate student studying Forest Ecology and GIS/Remote Sensing with a certificate in environmental studies. I've worked in two labs on my university which are environmental GIS/RS labs. In my mind, I was set up perfectly for the job. Maybe not, because they rejected me without even an interview. 

So my question is: Is there anyway I could change their mind and at least get an interview? How would I frame that approach? Or do employers not change their mind like that? It seems like a really small company and I'm baffled that they don't even want an interview.

*TL;DR: I have what seems to be the optimal experience needed for this GIS internship that I've been so excited about, but they don't even want to interview me. Can I change their mind, somehow?*

BTW it wasn't my resume's quality or anything. It's been reviewed by my advisors and I've had interviews with my state government, a giant energy company whose HR told me personally, ""Something about your resume really stood out to me,"" and other resource management companies this spring.

This was crushing news to me, as I've been waiting to hear back from them for 3-4 weeks now, have gotten rejected by other jobs in the mean time, and am on my last legs for this summer internship stuff. So I appreciate any sympathy and advice on how to go about this!

**EDIT: Thanks, everyone who responded. I was curious to see if they do change minds about doing an interview but I guess that's not the case! Will be moving forward with a strong mindset. It's the first time I've been genuinely disappointed about a job so it's definitely a learning experience about myself. The applications will keep flowin'.** "

I am a student at a Canadian university and keep enrolling into internships fairly regularly.

In the summer of 2013, I worked at a software firm for 4 months and they gave me a return offer for summer of 2014. After negotiating with them, I got a couple things revised in my contract like the pay and the term of work. Please note that this contract was signed by me and submitted 8 months before the starting date for the next internship if that makes a difference.

In October of 2013, the old company where I worked got acquired by another company. I contacted them back at that time and confirmed that they I was guaranteed a return spot for my internship in summer 2014. I liked the old company where I worked so I was happy that I would be going back to work with the same people.

Now, I am in the process of getting ""rehired"" by the new company and they are going through their background check procedure. They sent me a offer letter yesterday and some of the terms were different.

     * Old pay - Weekly. New pay - Hourly

     * (assuming 40 hours work week) Difference of about $25 per week. Its significant because I would be working for only 4 months and the accumulated difference is my one month's rent.

There were some other minor changes here and there as well but since I would be working for a short period over there, they dont matter a lot.

I should also mention that the company that acquired my old company is based in US. 

Now my question, do I have any grounds for going to my recruiting manager and explaining her the situation and revising the offer letter ? This person is different from the person who hired me back before because now the company HQ is in US. Do I have the legal ground in saying that they are not respecting their old contract ?

I am torn between it and another school. It's definitely more affordable than the other school I'm looking at. (I have the free tuition+fees AES scholarship.) After Financial Aid, it should be even more affordable.

So I have a few questions.

1. For those of you majoring in natural sciences, how are the classes? How are the teachers? This is the absolute most important thing to me. I'm not looking for easy classes, I'm looking for opportunities to further my experience and intelligence. I don't know if I want to major in Environmental Science, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, or whatever, I just know that I really like science. Advice from any of you majoring in any of those would be greatly appreciated. I looked through the subreddit for advice about that, but I found very little (most of it pertained to Computer Science, which I know is a big thing at UTD, but I don't think I'll be taking it.)

2. How closely do you work with professors? How willing are they to help you and get you internships or research? This is another big one for me. I personally believe that working closely with professors and other students is a big part of learning.

3. Are any of you in Collegium V? I got accepted into it. How are the classes? They're supposed to be smaller and more personal, from what I can tell. If Collegium V is as good as they say it is, then that will play a big part as well.

4. How easy is it for students to get internships? Again, I'm thinking mostly lab or field work with natural sciences, but even if it's for an unrelated major, it's still good to hear.

I'm not worried about extra-curriculars or anything, because I am sure that clubs and organizations at UTD are great, from what I can tell. I don't think I would have a problem finding my niche at the school.

I have less than two weeks to decide, and this whole process is really quite stressful. Any help from any of you is greatly appreciated! Thank you!"

Any advice to recover?,jacobsboy3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/23gnnh/first_software_job_and_struggling_any_advice_to/,"Hey guys so I work for a really big and fast moving company. It's my first job after I graduated and I feel a little bit over my head. I've had one other internship at a smaller company but everything seemed a lot simpler.

I recently got a subpar performance review (I've been working for about 7 months) and the comments were mostly centered on being more independent and confident in making my own decisions. I do agree with the comments as no one should be hand held for their career. 

To me the biggest thing holding me back is learning all the tools of the trade. There are a lot of internal tools and configuration files, etc that trip me up. Coding wise I am quite confident and have no problem but obviously there's a lot more to software development than just the code. Unfortunately in school we never really learned stuff like configuring load balancers and spring mvc, etc and I just can't get the hang of it. 

I know the tools and software should be similar to programming. Once you learn the concepts you should be able to pick up new tools a lot easier, so do you guys have any advice or reading I could do, besides just more practice? And as for the independence thing I know I need to start looking deeper into things and figuring things out on my own, even if it take a lot longer.

The review kind of shot me down and I've been feeling pretty bad as this is my first job and I'm already not performing up to my peers. There's such a steep ramp up and I didn't intern here over the summer like everyone else so I feel way overwhelmed with the amount of technology I have to learn and so quickly. I want to keep working here but I'm starting to feel like maybe I don't in the big leagues.

For starters, I still live with my mom, go to college, and don't have a job. I feel like I have a low IQ  because I do so poorly in school due to my inability to focus on anything. That inability has caused me to waste my days in front of the computer. Every opportunity that I've had, I've said goodbye to due to lack of focus.

To make matters worse, I have a distant relationship with my family, and feel bad for being closer with them. So there's a lot that's wrong, and I just feel like even if these are considered petty problems compared to people who are starving, I don't want to feel this way anymore. Maybe the only way to stop suffering is to just end my life, then I won't have another birthday where I'm disappointed in myself. "

[My husband was fired over 4 years ago and is still trying to get his struggling business off the ground.  I cannot look at him. Hearing his voice makes my chest tight. He is the source of my stress. I am carrying the financial burden. My teenage daughter does not want us to divorce.  Can you give me any words of wisdom, comfort and a separation plan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwrwui?context=5)|Hi, you've already determined part of the problem: he's a dreamer and you're a realist? You've always known and maybe you used to like that about him? There are many couples with this dynamic, and sometimes they clash and sometimes they balance each other out. If you still love him, then I'd work on it.  There's no reason he cannot find or try to find another job while building his business.  People do that all the time.  I'd take care of yourself, as you seem burnt-out from all of the responsibilities. I would be as well.  I'd give you advice on relaxation strategies and healing (meditation, journaling, and creative arts), along with encouraging you to eat well and exercise.  Stop thinking about him for a bit.  Have you sat down with him to discuss how you're now physically showing signs of anxiety and feel overwhelmed?  You probably have, but I'd attach a strong urgency that you will not be able to do so any longer.  His other dream aside from his business, may have been to have a family. I'd remind him of his initial dream.  And the one you shared together.
 |As a last resort, a separation plan would be prepared by the realist (you).  He needs an time-specific action plan to help out financially and/or get help so he's able to do so.  Based on his response, then you'd know what planning to further pursue.  Good luck. 
[ of all, it takes a special person to do what you do, and for that I thank you. My curiosity lies in what you do when the therapy is over. How do you unwind? Is it hard to leave work at work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwwu0f?context=5)|Thanks very much:) They did not have a class on the realities of being a therapist, and I wish they had better training on it.  I've followed from the guidance of my former supervisors and mentors in how to handle it.  I supervise new license interns now too.
 |The first two or three years of work was very hard on me, and I struggled with leaving it at work. I'd cry. Heartwrenching, not just how it affected someone's life and family, but how they were treated in our system and society. In the recent few years, I mostly leave it at work, except in extreme cases of abuse or when I'm closely working with someone who is suicidal with intent.  I'm on call.
 |I'm very involved in session, but have learned to hold back some of me in self-preservation.  I'm an introvert, an INFJ, but I function as an extrovert at work.  So, I have to rest and be quiet for an hour or so after work.  I ease up on my schedule, if I feel drained.  I add sessions when restored. I know myself quite well.
 |I unwind with writing, art, music, books, exercise, family, and meditation.  I do case consultations and attend therapy a few times a year to take care of myself, so I can continue to help others. 
[What is your favorite book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgxgoza?context=5)|I devour books and barely remember the titles, to be honest. My fave book from the past is, Man's Search for Meaning, by Frankl.
 |I like to read all types of books, from Sex at Dawn, A Brief History of Time, to The Great Gatsby. 
[At what point does a waiting list get so long that moral prudence has you pass on the new business so the couple can get needed help sooner?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgx9su1?context=5)|I give some names of other therapists when new clients call, if I can. Urgent appts are seen or referred back to the referral source. It's their choice to wait or not. Current or former clients aren't on a list. 
[Is marriage just not for some people? Or perhaps more accurately is monogamy just not for some people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwrvsj?context=5)|Yes, some people do not thrive in a marriage and tend to become depressed, cheat, self-medicate with alcohol or drugs, remarry frequently, or just stay single.  Depends a lot of the personality and life history, including personal belief systems.
 |I do encounter people who are nonmonogamous and polyamorous, and I'm listed in a directory that caters to this lifestyle as well.
 |Choose your theory, but some people are happy being monogamous and some are happier in a nonmonogamy situation.
[I might be to late to the game for an answer but I'll ask anyways...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgx4f16?context=5)|The highest divorce rate is during the first two years of marriage and then declines, this is when the newness wears off and people really see who they're married to. Often people are disappointed that they no longer feel butterflies for their partner all of the time, but this is completely normal and biological in nature. Shift from dopamine to oxytocin brain chemicals.  People wait too long to get help, so by the time they might get help, too much damage is done. There are less people willing to endure years of unhappiness in hopes of improvement, solely for the sanctity of staying married. In the past, people were more likely to battle out the rough years.
[Why do you think divorce has become such a common occurance in America? Yes, domestic violence etc, has empowered individuals to leave abuse situations but that cannot account for a (roughly\) 50% divorce rate, can it?  Is there any volatility to the idea that gay marriage is harming straight marriages (in your opinion\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgx4f16?context=5)|It's a transgenerational process now, so if your parents divorced, then you're more likely to see divorce as a feasible option. It's an option and has become socially acceptable, yet in the past it was not.  With the feminist movement and more women entering the workforce, the divorce rate increased during this time, but has evened out and slightly declined. Women no longer need to be married to have credit or own property.  Our society has become more disposable, entitled, and wanting immediate gratification, so people are less patient and tolerant of the ups and downs in a marriage. And people can be unwilling to yield or give in on anything, so a marriage is impossible. As a good marriage includes a series of compromises and understanding/respect for someone else.  I don't think gay marriage has much of an impact on the divorce rate, however, I've had a few divorces due to a partner coming out that he/she was gay.  Societal impact is speculative. I'd say that people are waiting until they're older and putting off marriage until they are more independent. Some are deciding not to marry at all, which is a change from the past. This has also made the divorce rate even out.
[If you agree with idea that marriage is being redefined, what do you think the social implications will be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgx4f16?context=5)|Children and young adults do not have enough positive role models of a healthy intact marriage, so they may not know how to work well at keeping one. And they have no one to speak with about it and give guidance. And there's a delusion of what a marriage really is.
[My husband and I did pre-marriage counseling with a professional counselor (rather than a church program\) before getting engaged and found it extremely useful. We had a great relationship before but it gave us some good strategies for working through disagreements! Thanks for your work as a counselor.  Here's my question for you: How would you counsel a married couple that came in and was trying to decide if they want to have kids? 30 years old, very stable, both just totally 50/50 on if they want them or not. No pressure from either side. What exercises would you take them through or questions would you ask to help them delve into that topic more? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwyx8v?context=5)|You're welcome, I'm glad that it was useful for you.
 |What percentage would you need to be to decide? 80%? 100%?  What if one of you was 50% and the other became 100%? What would you do?  Are you familiar with what it would be like to have children?  Are you willing to commit yourself and be responsible for the safety and well-being of a child for many years?
[Edit- To clarify, my mom and dad are both in their early 50's. I believe this could be a midlife crisis, as well as underlying psychological issues on my dad's part. My mom isn't guiltless, but she hasn't done anything to merit his cold demeanor and anger as of late.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwrsem?context=5)|He seems pretty unhappy and people often show depression and sadness through anger. I'm sorry he assaulted you, and I don't think you or your mother should tolerate that anymore.  And since he attacked you, then you definitely have the right to say something before it gets worse.  
[What is the most screwed up/ interesting thing a couple has ever come to you with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwsb3e?context=5)|How do I choose? The most screwed up would be a woman hiring a professional and plotting to kill her husband.  The most interesting would be a man who took care of his bedridden wife who had MS for 20 years and battled his guilt about his affairs.
 |The most screwed up thing I encounter is what people do to their kids.  And then they want to drop them off (""you fix them"") and say they're the ones with the problem. Usually, they are just the symptom bearer.
[So basically... You see everything. So with the person trying to kill her husband, do you have to like report that to the police? Seems like you'd have to.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwumlr?context=5)|Yes, I always disclose what remains confidential and what is not, during the first session. That warrants breaking confidentiality and is required by law to notify police and her husband.  If she already killed him, then no.
[So... If she already killed him. You wouldn't have to report it??? what kind of logic is that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwwiqq?context=5)|Same logic that applies to clergy, attorneys, and medical personnel. Therapist-patient legally privileged communication. 
[I once had a counsellor reveal that he had taken 5 years off work when he started to feel burnt out at his job. I found it interesting to learn something personal about this person and I was wondering if it is common to reveal something about yourself during sessions or do most counsellors try to keep their privacy guarded?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwylpy?context=5)|I was trained to not reveal too much about me personally, as it's distracting, shifts focus, tends to create too much transference, and would interfere with the process.  Plus, it's your time, not mine. I don't want the person to alter who they are or what they'll share based upon who I am.  That's the beauty of it, can just be yourself.  I do sometimes use my reaction of feelings based upon what the person says, to help them understand how others may feel with that same type of interaction from them.  That's very helpful to them.  I do share when someone is going through bereavement, as they do like to know that I've been there.  And people who have kids often want to know if I have kids, so I tell them if asked.  If it's helpful for them and would make counseling better for them, then I can briefly share general info.
[I'm 22 and I've been very depressed for as long as I can remember, and in the past 5 years or so it's led to complete social withdrawal and a disability for really doing anything. I have tried on many occasions to get help. I've always been wary of mood medication so I chose to try and see psychologists and therapists especially after being referred to a hospital by my old school counselor.  I've spent more than those five years now just bouncing between counselor to counselor and now I've given up altogether. Maybe it's just luck but I can never find someone I'm comfortable talking to or someone who seems willing to address what I want to talk about. A lot of my early experiences with counselors were the same in that they'd narrow in very quickly on things I just wasn't there to talk about, a common one was my apparent ""cyber"" addiction (computers, internet, games\). Was referred to addiction clinics a few times for that and never showed up for the appointments.  Anyway, sorry for the TLDR, but basically I know I need help but whenever I have tried to get it shit just seems to not work. It's getting harder and harder to convince myself to even try. Any advice on staying the course, and more importantly, any advice on trying to find someone that might actually be helpful for me? Maybe it's just me, and maybe I've just been going about the whole thing wrong. I have no idea.  Additional question, I assume that people like me who have misgivings about mood medication for depression and such are pretty common. That in addition to previous negative experiences with psychiatrists have kind of made me want to avoid medication altogether. I know this isn't exactly your boat, but is there anything you can point me at to ease my doubts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwuu9q?context=5)|Are you an introvert? Seems so. They'd often rather interact with electronics than people. Can get out of hand. Although, if you're depressed enough to get a hospital referral and it's progressively gotten worse (withdrawal from society) and have suffered for five years with no results, then I'd wonder why you haven't tried an antidepressant? Are you worried about the side effects, pride, religious/cultural reasons, stigma, or is it weak to take it or something? I'd want to know.
 |That's tough, I'm sorry. I talk about medications a lot with my clients. It's personal choice. I'm required to have continuing education on psychotropic medications. I don't suggest it unless the person is truly suicidal or hasn't seen any improvement within 6-8 sessions. I usually see good improvement within 3 visits with active CBT. A lot of work is done out of session as well.  You never said what you really wanted to work on, so I'm guessing something happened when you were a teenager? The best treatment for severe depression is antidepressants plus therapy (CBT or DBT is preferred). Mild to moderate depression is highly responsive to just therapy. From my experience, 20% of people who have depression do not respond to just therapy, as they truly have a chemical balance. I go through the physiology and genetics of all of that.  It's approached like any other medical condition to me.
[How successful are marriages after counseling? What is the most common reason couples cite for going to counseling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwrtuy?context=5)|It usually depends on the treatment methods and on how long the couple waited to come in for counseling.  If you're going to a LMFT (Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist), then you're going to have a different experience than with a psychologist or another therapist who works with couples.  LMFTs treat the system as a unit and follow a different set of theories.  Both therapy types can be effective in reducing problems within a couple.  Standard therapy has an average 30-45% success rate, but it's really inaccurate on determining that. It's why I switched from providing standard couples therapy to following the Gottman method, as it's based on research and is not just sitting around and determining who is right or wrong (that doesn't work).  When the system or interactional patterns are not analyzed and treated, then the couple is likely to need help again (just received a temporary band-aid for the immediate problem) or give up.
 |Most of the couples I see are there due to a cheating incident or a divorce threat.  They're already at the end.  It's kind of like driving a car without maintaining it at all, hoping for the best, and then completely burning it out and wanting me to repair it.  I'm often the last one in the room to give up on a marriage.
[Is it normal to go through phases of being unhappy in a marriage? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwts7t?context=5)|Definitely, being happily married is hard work.  There's often more work put into finding a partner and planning a wedding, then making a marriage work well.  It's often neglected and that's typical.  Most long-term marriages have ups and downs. It's also one reason why people have affairs and get divorced, they compare the feelings of new relationship to a long-term one.
[I appreciate the response!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwvpo0?context=5)|My pleasure.
[I'm graduating with my psych B.A. in December and am going to try to get into a grad program starting the following September.  The problem I'm running into right now is officially deciding what kind of program I want to go into.  What led you to focusing on marriage/families instead of something like school counseling?  Further, what made you decide on being an LMHC rather than going for your PhD, PsyD, or a masters?  Last question (I think...\) as an ""insider"" I guess, what can you tell me about loan repayment/forgiveness programs available?  Specifically, through the NHSC or through the government/military?  Okay, these are the last questions:  What is the most rewarding part of your job?  What was the most interesting research you've seen or possibly conducted over the course of your career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgx18yc?context=5)|I have a Master's in Clinical Psychology, because I was fascinated about tests, measurements, research, clinical psychopathology, and statistics. And none of the other programs course schedules were as interesting to me.  I didn't want to invest the money or time into a PhD or PsyD, as I could do similar work without it.  I'd read all of the course descriptions on selecting a program.  Why I chose this over social work as well.  Just was a good fit, and I wanted to be sure I'd enjoy what I was learning.  I'd apply to several schools, as the competition is tight.  I'd do the NHSC or similar program, why not? I'm not an expert on the details of them, but have known people who did it.  I kind of did a small version of it by getting all of my weekly supervision hours for free, while working at a community health center in an impoverished area.  Most interesting? I've always been fascinated by twin studies in the battle of nature vs. nurture. I'm impressed by the research of Gottman in marriage counseling and how he predicts divorce.  My thesis was based on interpersonal trust, a great deal of relationship problems surround this.
[Thanks for the reply!  I really appreciate it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgx388c?context=5)|My school had two sections, one at night and one during the day. I worked during the day and went to school at night. I started at 21, but no one asked how old I was.  There were five women around my age and everyone else was older.  Several of them already had a Master's degree in another field.
[As a somewhat random follow up, about how old would you say the average age was in your Master's program?  I'll be turning 21 a few days before commencement and am hoping that being so young (and female?\) won't work against me because I'll be lacking the experience that comes with age.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgx388c?context=5)|They did not care how old I was, at all.
[Have fights broken out that you had to stop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwrvcq?context=5)|That's a good question. Mostly when I was working at the inpatient psychiatric unit for thought disorders. I was almost attacked twice there, but it was mostly because someone thought I was someone else and trying to hurt them.  Understandable.  Verbal methods and relaxation strategies greatly reduced amounts of fights.
 |I was trained on recognizing possible signs of an escalation and how to verbally reduce the likelihood of a fight.  And we're trained on physical maneuvers and how to reduce physical risk of harm.  Once it got physical, I'd follow protocol, which includes getting help from the other staff and security.  If that didn't work, then chemical or physical restraints were utilized.  That is the last resort.
 |I've had a few fights in outpatient settings as well.  I typically know who is at risk for getting angry and catch that early if possible, to prevent a problem.  I watch for it and give breaks or split up the couple.  And refer to individual counseling for help with anger, as needed.  Sometimes, there's no warning though.  And domestic violence is a different story.
[Was there anything that your patients told you that made you scared?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwru8k?context=5)|Absolutely, for me, it's rare to have a murderer come see me with no empathy, but I've met a few.  They don't tend to come to therapy on their own.  The people who I see are usually upset about what they've done and cannot tell anyone else.  I feel if the person is there seeking help, then I'll do my best to help them.  They often fear making me afraid by what they've done or fear me judging them.  I work very hard to stay calm and focus on what they need.
 |I've heard many gruesome accounts, but typically the person suffers with the knowledge of it.  Often, they want clarity on what happened and why they did it.  And they want peace.  And I help them reframe their thoughts about it and learn ways to not act on impulses.  I encounter clients who exhibit antisocial behaviors, but have no problem referring to an expert when I'm uncomfortable.
 |I take precautions to protect my safety.  I try not to show fear and with experience, I use statistics to help determine who is a dangerous person to me or society and who is not.
[I'm not officially diagnosed with anything, but I'm pretty sure I have some form of depression/dysthymia. My question is - how does a person deal with life (getting a job, feeling useful, etc\) when they have no passions, no skills, no motivation, and not enough money to just go back to school or try out different things until something clicks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwrxrn?context=5)|They find meaning in their life.  A person is lost until they find a purpose or meaning. It can be anything at all at first, even caring for a pet or cleaning up a house.  You could try a few things out that work for someone in your family or one of your friends (I didn't know cooking would make me happy, until I cooked like my grandmother did).  And try to focus outward versus inward.  What can I do make the world a better place?
 |Sounds like some type of dysthymia- I'd recommend a physical to rule out any medical problems, as sometimes it's something physical.  Usually a person does have some skills, but he cannot seem them when so dark.  And everything has a gray outlook.  I'd also try to remember a time when you used to be happier and do what you did then (if it's healthy).  And what did you used to dream about doing with your life? Go do it:)
 |Clients who are in a similar situation start with the job and career or educational aspect.  They go to the career center at the community college and ask for help or visit the unemployment office and check out training programs of interest.  They make do with what they can until they find the motivation and money to do what they really want.
[I do plan to try things like a temp agency, but I don't have high hopes. I want a 9-5  schedule, and those normally require skills I don't have.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwxwqh?context=5)|Who crushed your dream? Some teacher complaining about lesson plans and bad parents? Is that when you started getting depressed? My mom and my sister are both teachers and love it, and yes, they complain about lesson plans and bad parents sometimes.  But after the first year or so, most teachers typically use the same lesson plans and know how to deal with annoying parents.  They focus on why they wanted to become a teacher, to educate the children and inspire them.  Weighs out the negative.  There's cons of every job, one must look at the pros.  Like working half a year and having a pension is one.

Just like any other business owner, you may have talent, but without business sense, then the business will fail.  So, I read everything under the sun and spoke with people who were in private practice.  There's a good training manual from Bob Walsh via the ACA on starting a mental health private practice, but there are also several podcasts and manuals on how to do it.  Check out the AMHCA as well.
[I'm wondering what kind of advice you have for an emerging professional, and what tips you might have for building a private practice?

Most insurance panels require at least five years of experience post-license, plus other requirements.  It's doable, but I'd just rent office space from an existing practice until you have enough of a client base to afford to go full-time on it.  Many therapists have a full-time job at a facility and work part-time in private practice.  I think the Affordable Care Act will encourage people to get help in all avenues. I do have a few slots in my schedule pro bono work though.
[Can somebody acquire a mental illness after a breakup? My friend was dating somebody for about 10 years, they were on the verge of getting married, and he left her out of nowhere with only an email.  Recently it seems like her personality has changed.

There have been moments where she starts crying randomly over issues that happened months ago as well.  I've spent a great deal of time figuring out if I'm actually as uncaring as she thinks I am but none of my friends agree or to feel that way.

There are accounts of boundary violations. The regulatory board can make sanctions and impose fines or you could lose your practice license, when violations occur.
 |I do work hard to establish a good working relationship, where the person doesn't grow abnormally attached to me. The rules and therapy relationship are discussed in the beginning. But yes, I've had some who do anyways and that is discussed. It's the therapist's job to handle it accordingly and establish or maintain boundaries. I purposely do not maintain an excessively long duration of treatment episode, and I space out sessions to discourage an abnormal dependence from occurring.
 |Typically, I'm temporarily more flexible with a child, elderly person, or someone who is suicidal, but coordinate with community resources, family, or friends as much as possible.
 |Often there's transference and countertransference, which is normal. I've had a few clients ask me out on dates, so that's addressed and usually they're referred to another therapist. We're supposed to be trained on how to handle that when it occurs. Often, it's useful information to discuss in session. If I've done my job well, then the person doesn't ""need"" me.
 |Therapists aren't supposed to form dual relationships, in order to protect clients, as they're in a vulnerable position. We don't do anything with clients outside of work. There's a whole list of rules. We try avoid it as much as possible. In small towns and rural areas, it's challenging.
 |The boundary is that I only enter a client's world when in my office, unless extreme emergency or crisis, and my clients don't enter my personal world. I tell my clients that if I run into them in the real world, which has happened, that I don't know them. They can come up to me and say hello, but that's their choice. I'll not violate their privacy. 
[While she is extremely warm and friendly, I do also have insight that it is for my benefit.  However I was wondering how you personally would react to a gift from a patient or client?

Would that be bridging the border for you personally? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgyx13o?context=5)|Hi, you're welcome. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling better. Every therapist has their own application of how to manage the boundaries and tries to adhere to the rules for that area. I don't know how she'd react.  I think I'd love a handmade drawing or painting from a client, but it'd be best if presented when therapy has discontinued. I've received a few. It couldn't be something of much value, in order to be ok. Some people work around my rules and send things anonymously though. Enjoy:)
[How does one know when they're done with therapy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwv5hg?context=5)|It takes time to realize whether therapy has been effective long-term or not. I have clients contact me years later who have revelations about what went on in there.
 |And it's a bit complicated. I'd say you're done when you take a break, spread out your appointments, and apply what you've learned. And you're done when you've got nothing left to say or nothing else to talk about, but just need to take action.
 |I end counseling once the goals have been met. I don't want to create a dependency on being in therapy. It is supposed to be a practice ground for application in real life.
 |It depends on why you're there too. I track depressive and anxiety symptoms at admission and at regular intervals. So, once it's mild, then it's definitely time to end. Or if the treatment was ineffective, then it's revamped or consider referral. I space out appointments to check for readiness and adjust as needed. 
[A man married for 40 years once told me never text your spouse. He counsels newly weds for his church and says it breaks down communication between couples. Any truth to that?

There's hardly any emotion at all in a text, but some people express themselves best in a written format.  Never hash out an argument or have a deep discussion over a text.  Many, many, many clients bring in texts, cite them, and have had miscommunications this way.
 |I'd not solely rely upon a text to tell someone you loved them, but sometimes it's necessary when someone is busy or not able to speak verbally.  And a cute text or a simple thinking of you, etc., goes a long way.
 |I think your partner deserves a real phone call or talk in person:)

 |I think gender studies is an important aspect of Psychology, so yes, it would be beneficial. Especially if it interests you, only do what you enjoy.  I believe you'd narrow it down in your Master's program and determine your specialty even further from there.

23hp15,0,2014-04-20,Graduating next Spring. No internship this summer,kakster,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/23hp15/graduating_next_spring_no_internship_this_summer/,"Hey I'm a junior at a small private school in Austin Texas. I have applied to over 200 positions since December for internships and have had only 2 interviews both which I did not get an offer. I am a pretty good CS student grade wise but I feel like a lot of companies here haven't heard of my school. 

Am I basically fucked when I graduate since I haven't got an internship for this summer lined up yet since I only have fall and spring semesters left? I continue to apply everyday for internships because some companies are still posting listings. Any tips?

The MBS program offers Data Analytics as a science concentration and I could take programming and data mining courses. Part of the program requires a job or internship relevant to the field. Only downside for me is that there is no research involved.


Has anyone looked into this program? What do you think of it? Are there any current students in this program? Thank you for your help!"

I really like being hands on with tech and fixing problems while learning along the way. The only thing that is holding me back from getting into IT is the lack of advancement I can make. For instance engineering I have the options to start as an intern, then go to a small company on a team, then become manager of that team, and one day maybe go to a larger engineering team like Apple. Obviously none of that is guaranteed but I am using it as an example. I want to advance in whatever field I go into and I feel like with IT you get an IT job here maybe transfer there but your still a tech. Can anyone prove me wrong or give me advice?"

I am a computer engineering student so I have some programming under my belt, Java, C, python, Django, Ruby. Since my background and interests are in cyber security, that is where my work and internships have been in so I do not believe I have too strong of a webdev/web design background--albeit I could pick something up relatively quickly. 



What I want to do is to make a personal website where I can introduce myself, have a user send an email, post my twitter/linkedin/etc, post my resume.



Ideally the pages would probably be something like:    
   
* Home/About
* Link/Page to Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn 
* Link to my resume
* Send Email to me



My friend has told me the easiest way would probably be to modify one of the templates at: [http://html5up.net/](http://html5up.net/) or use Twitter Bootstrap.



Anyone have other ideas? 



I believe this: [Astral](http://html5up.net/uploads/demos/astral/) template is pretty good and all I would have to do would be to modify the files for myself (and probably have to learn some HTML and CSS to format it the way I like)

23jcny,2,2014-04-20,"Want to use my Degree, I am asking for advice on becoming employed.",EmploymentAdvicePlz,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/23jcny/want_to_use_my_degree_i_am_asking_for_advice_on/,"First off, I've put off doing this for ... a year? And just multiple times today even. I thought if I waited a bit more, answers would come to me. Sooo, I am here on this subreddit because they haven't. I have looked at other subreddits ( http://metareddit.com/r/jobs http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/ http://www.reddit.com/r/Employment/ http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes ), but have not found help that may help me in my specific situation. Maybe I just haven't looked hard enough, or maybe because of my tendency to procrastinate (that I AM trying to break myself of) I didn't think it applicable, or some other reason. I haven't posted on any of those sub reddits because, again, I hoped answers would come to me. Any and all help will be appreciated...

Okay, so here is my situation (I will try to make it a list of points for easy reading): 

* I went to college for Genetics. I've wanted to work in it since I was ~ 10-12 years old. My degree is a Bachelor's of Science with a major in Biology: Recombinant Gene Technology, and Minors in Chemistry and Philosophy. I want to use my degree to get a job as a sort of lab tech which, at least time I did any research, earn a livable wage of between $10 and $15 an hour. I hope to then use such work experience to help me get into a grad school. (Other life goals would be Visiting Australia, but I'm sure that can come much later... )
* I completed it in 4 years (8 semesters) with a 2.36 GPA. (I thought that was my GPA... And it may be for just my program, but I have since rechecked my transcript and my overall GPA is 2.92.) I graduated in 2010. 
* Since then I have moved with my parents as my father has had to move for jobs. I come from North Eastern Ohio, where I still have a friend, and from college I know someone near WVU in Morgantown in West Virginia. My brother moved to Central Wisconsin when myself and my parents were up there. Now I currently live in northern Indiana. (I mention all this because I mean to say that for an interview, I would have a place to stay to drive there the night before, stay the night, and be fresh for an interview the next day. I'm trying to keep my options open so that I'm not looking for a job in just a ~50 mile radius of where I live, but also a ~50 mile radius of family/friends.)
* Since graduating I have only had one job for 2.25 years in a factory. Aluminum Extrusion. I've been unemployed for a year and 7 months, now, living with my parents where they move to.
* I have no research experience because while I got a scholarship to attend the college, I had to pay for transportation, books, and etc. I ended up often unable to accept ""Unpaid Internships"" or other internships that would leave me with no or not enough net gain in income. 
* I have paid off all student loans I had. I also have no want to get MORE student loans to take more classes that may or may not help my degree or GPA. So I have thought about going back to school, but it does not seem a viable option.
* I do not have interview appropriate wear, so if I could get some sort of 'fashion advice' too on what is acceptable wear...?
* I do have a working vehicle, and I do have resources that I could make a 7-8 hour drive, and back, from Northern Indiana.
* I have a rather poor looking resume because I have no pertinent work experience and it's been 4 years since I graduated.
* I haven't kept in contact with professors so I would need to know how to approach then or if I should even worry about asking them for or listing them as potential work references.

What I need to know is: what is my first step? Do I fix my resume and curriculum vitae? Make a cover letter? Research potential places of employment? Are there any good resources for looking up such a specific job? Contact past professors? Etc. I feel lost, and because I feel lost I've kept putting things off, and because I have a close friend with things I'm involved in there, I thought I could just keep helping her and working with her, and it would, I dunno, 'Build Momentum' into me getting my life back on track... something. I repeat, I feel lost, and don't know what my first step is. I just know I need to get my life moving **SOMEWHERE**...

Soo, Thank you for reading, I hope it wasn't too much a chore, and I have now delayed my family from eating long enough, I guess, to write this. I will try to be back to this in a few hours. I thank anyone who offers advice."
23jqn6,1,2014-04-20,Internship option could lead to family falling apart. Not sure what to do.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/23jqn6/internship_option_could_lead_to_family_falling/,"I'm 20, living at home, and a junior in computer engineering in college.  I have been applying since November for internships for the summer because my family is moving to another state, and I really don't want to go with them for the summer. 

I finally got an offer for a local telephone company of an internship doing programming and creating a wiki for their customers and its 40 hours a week for the first 6 weeks of summer, and then if they like my work, they will allow me to be a part time employee until I graduate doing management on their systems and helping customers.  I accepted the offer for the internship.

Now a little backstory.  My family is really controlling.  I had to fight them for the longest time to get them to let me get an apartment for the summer and my last school year here because I've never been allowed to do anything on my own.  After a huge argument and a settlement on me staying being the decision, I got a call last week.

It was a call from a government engineering internship in a big city, asking me to do a full time, full summer internship for the summer.  It is also in the city where my boyfriend's (of 3 years) family is, and his dad (who I have a great relationship with) offered to carpool me to work everyday because he works on the same street as where my internship would be.  The pay is at least $5 an hour more and its guaranteed all summer.  

Not to mention, an internship doing actual engineering work for the government would look so much better than programming and creating a wiki for a local telephone company...

I tried to talk to my parents about it, and they flipped out.  They said if I went, I would be going against my word to them about staying here, and that I can't turn back on the internship I already accepted here.  They said if I take it, they wouldn't support me anymore.  

So here's my 2 questions.

1)  Would taking this internship, which is obviously a better deal for me, be a mistake since it could potentially cause a break between me and my family?  Or do I just need to cut my losses and go because I need to show my family I'm making my own decisions...

2) Is it even viable to think I could talk my way out of the first internship I accepted?  I really want this engineering internship, it is such a good opportunity and I really don't want to miss out on this.

Any advice would be appreciated.  Sorry if wordy.  I'm really torn here."
23jt8w,0,2014-04-20,My Google Internship,ITclown,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/23jt8w/my_google_internship/,"A few months ago I had the rare opportunity to work part time as an intern at Google. At first, it was awesome, free food, comfy as fuck chairs and enough weird and wacky people to keep it interesting. My crew and I had a lot of fun working together on new design products that our bosses at the time wanted us to work on. It wasn’t easy but we figured it out, fairly quickly. It was in august, however when things started becoming more and more unusual. My boss had asked me to take part in a seemingly normal activity but I digressed.

""Take these files down the caching room, first door on your left. And Braxton, don't go anywhere but the first door on your left. You got me?"" 

""Yes, sir. I'll be quick about it.""

""Good.""

I did just as I had been asked, and did it just as I said I would; in a timely manner without fraying from the task at hand. Now this is probably the point in other stories like creepy pasta, or Stephen King where I’d say the hallways were dark and depressing and lacking color or whatever but it's not one of those stories, Okay?

I had arrived at the ""caching and stacking"" hallway. The hallway's colors were not absent. The red and white's that covered everywhere else were still present and the rooms were still filled with the normal, half egg chairs and laptops. What did catch my attention though was the first room to my right. The lights were off. Not unusual but we were all on the app creation challenge and everyone else was hard at work but this team's room was entirely vacant. I knew that because they had left their doors open and laptop's running. I ignored it and gave the files to the girl in the caching room. Her name tag read ""Amy"".

She had seemed normal enough. She had long red hair accompanied by many other fantastical features. Before I left, I slipped my cell number under the folder with my name and a semi scribbled sentence saying:

""Text me?""

As I fumbled back up the stair's I noticed a few of my group members huddled around the lounge in red, yellow and blue bean bag chairs. As we were finishing up brainstorming app ideas my phone rang and my ungodly annoying ringtone sounded of bubble's popping. I looked down it read inside of a green text bubble.

""Dinner at the food court?"" I texted back in empathy.

""Yeah, 5 sound okay?"" I was crossing my fingers.

As the clock drew closer and closer to my half-assed dinner reservation I wished my group mates good bye and headed off. I looked around for a moment then I noticed her hair. Her silky red hair flew gorgeously in the wind. She had one had pressed against her cheek. I waved and she waved back. We talked very mundanely until I mentioned the group across the hall. She looked puzzled.

""What's wrong?"" I asked one eye brow raised and my eyes fixated on hers.

""Nothing it’s just, you confused me. That's all."" Her tone was chalking and I could tell she was nervous.

""How so?""

""That room has been vacant forever. No group has been in there since well, I think 3 maybe 4 summers ago. It's just weird that's all nothing more, nothing less.""

""Why not?""

""You sure do ask a lot of questions don't you, Braxton?"" She sounded sarcastic.

""I guess so, Amy."" I replied. I'll admit at this point I was kind of sketched out but more intrigued none the less.

""Just tell me, please?"" I sounded almost beggy, but I had to hear the end of this. 

""Someone went missing here a few summer's ago, Braxton. But once his group mate's found out they went looking for him. And they haven't been seen since."" She seemed shaky and a small tear rolled down her sad red cheek.

Neither of us talked for the rest of the time we were together at that table.

That night, I couldn't sleep. I lied wide awake. In my half egg shaped, chair. I watched the clock ""Tic Tok, Tic Tok, Tic Tok"" back and forth. It was about four a.m. when my longtime friend and group partner; Garrett struggled awake from his dorm and wandered into mine. 

""Hey bro, you up?"" He questions as he slid his group ID card into the scanner to open the door.

""Yeah, I'm awake."" I sputtered, fiddling with a tennis ball in hand. ""You seem lively, what're you up for.""

""Couldn't sleep. Just nervous for the app revealing tomorrow. And you?""

""Let's go for a walk."" I said. Without a word we headed off into the lounge, spotting a few other guy's spread out across the wooden presentation bleachers in the main hallway.

""What're we walking for?"" Garrett questioned, a yawn following his curiosity. 

I didn't answer I was far too busy thinking about the archive room. ""We have to get in there” I said to myself as we entered the “caching and stacking"" hallway. It was beyond eerie. All the lights were off and the vibrant greens’ and blue's, red's and yellow's that used to accommodate the once seemingly exotic hallway. 

I panned across the hallway. All was silent, the only noise was our footstep’s and the muffled talking of the 24/7 Google broadcast. I could practically quote it, I’ve seen it so many time’s. The door on the right was shut.

“Fuck. The door’s locked.” I murmured. Discouraged and slightly pissed off I remembered something Amy had said to me, she had said that there wasn’t a team. That the door was open in case a new team started and needed a place to room. 

“Garret, you remember how to pick locks?” I asked.

“Shit Brax, I was only a locksmith for 8 years. I’m sure this one won’t be any different. Got any gum?” 

“Why?” 

“I need it.” He said holding out his hand motioning for me to spit out the gum I was munching on. 

I spit out my gum into his palm. He carefully slid it over the keycard and opened the lock. I was impressed to say the least but I knew he’d get us in. 

The room looked vacant. No clothes hung in the closet, and the laptops that were on the small table were no longer placed there. The beds were neatly made and no one resided in them. But the smell was awful. The room smelled of a putrid, foul odor that I couldn’t see being at Google. Garrett slid his hand on the wall looking for the light switch. He flicked it and as he did a long “PING” sounded throughout the room.

Garrett crashed to the floor and there in the dully illuminated room stood Amy, wielding a light blue aluminum bat that was dented from where Garrett’s skull had met it.

“I warned you about here didn't I? Even Darek,your boss told you to stay out of here but would you listen? Oh, no you just wouldn't fucking listen!” She swung the bat smashing a lamp of a night stand. Her voice sounded hellish. 

I backed into a corner, my heart racing at million beats per second. She raised the bat ready to swing. A hand reached out grabbing the barrel. Amy fought against Garrett’s hand which was trying to overpower her. She got the better of him. She reared back and for the second time smashed his Head against his head drawing blood which stained the beautiful white furniture.

She swung at me I ducked, kicking her in the knee as I touched the floor. I ran down the hall and hooked around the corner opened the first room to my right by breaking the lock and slammed the door behind me. I was nervous, but I managed to find a light switch. My eyes were stuck open as I took in my surroundings. It was a red room. Undeveloped photo’s hung from strings above the sink. Most of them pictures of me and of my team. I noticed all of them had me in them. I was holding onto the sink, splashing water in my face to calm down, when I heard the crashing of the glass window from the door being broken and clattering onto the floor. I shook; the bat broke into the door viciously swinging. 

“Amy, please! You don’t have to do this it’s okay, really just drop the bat please.” I shouted, trying to sound as stoic as I possibly could.

“You should have listened Braxton, now it’s time you get what you deserve.” She lunged forward and my better instincts kicked in. I rolled out the way. I stood up and grabbed the nearest thing to me. A pen. What the fuck was I going to do with a pen? She swung at me again with the bat and I used my make shift weapon. I blocked with my left arm. She broke it with the force of the bat. I reached around and dug the pen straight through her neck, leaving her bleeding.

I sprinted back to the room where Garrett was. I saw him, motionless on the ground blood leaking from his temple I was almost certain he was dead. I was an EMT for years so I knew what to do. First I checked his pulse. It was there but fading fast. I ripped my shirt sleeve off and wrapped it around his head holding it there. I reached into his suit pocket dialing 911.

“911 what’s your emergency?” A female operator. 

“Yes, my friend has been hit with a bat. He’s bleeding fast” I shouted, shaking whilst I held the cloth against my friend’s temple. 

“Okay, sir do you have any prior medical experience?” The operator seemed calm. Lucky for her I guess.

“Yes, I’m an EMT of four years I’m keeping the blood in but I can’t do this alone.” I was calming down but I felt Garrett’s heart rate lower, still. 

“Okay, help is on the way. What’s the address of which you're located?”

“Okay sir ambulance and police are dispatched just stay on the line with me okay.”

“Sure.” I felt his pulse. It was still beating but it wouldn’t be for long. 

It took 17 minutes for the police and EMT’s to arrive to get Garrett out and to arrest Amy on assault and battery charges. My boss and I spoke a while whilst the paramedic’s placed my arm in a sling. 

“You’re stupid, Braxton. You disobeyed my direct orders and furthermore have cost us a ton of time and created some unfixable delays.” His voice seemed both scowling and sympathetic a rare combination but his Arabian accent helped pull it off.

“I know I’m sorry I just wanted to learn more about the missing team and snooping around seemed like the best way to go about it.” I spoke ashamed and disappointed. I motioned to remove my lanyard but his arm reached out to stop me. 

“You disobeyed me, sure but we need more people here at Google like you. Welcome aboard team Braxton.” He smiled at us. And wishing Garrett good luck. Amy died from the pen wound. But I still work at Google with team Braxton. Garrett made a full recovery but suffered extreme brain damage as a result. He’s still a wiz at writing code but his speech is slurred now. I guess the reason why I’ve posted this is to share something with you. A memory that I have, that I haven’t told many people in a very long time.

Google on, my friends."
23k0ne,13,2014-04-20,Any other graduating AE's having trouble finding a job?,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/23k0ne/any_other_graduating_aes_having_trouble_finding_a/,"Hey y'all,

So I'm graduating in a few weeks and have not had any job offers. In fact, I haven't had any interview offers either. I have only had two on-campus interviews and both were from talking to recruiters in person, yet I never heard back from either company afterwards. This whole situation has made me do a lot of introspection and has led me into several depressive episodes during the year. According to my peers I should have no trouble finding a job, yet not even getting a call for a phone interview has taken a huge blow to my self confidence.

Just to dispell some common responses to threads like this, I would like to state the following:

* I'll be graduating with a 3.60+ overall and major GPA from Georgia Tech.
* I've had my resume critiqued by friends, family, recruiters, professors, career services, you name it. Most have told me it's good and that I shouldn't be having any problems getting my foot in the door. I customize my resume based on the application, making sure I drop in key words (such as languages, related projects, etc...) from the job description.
* I have research experience relevant to aerospace.
* I TA mathematics classes and am comfortable talking with people and explaining things. From reviews I get from students at the end of the semester, a large majority leave positive comments saying that I'm friendly, approachable, helpful, etc...(several even saying I'm the best TA they've ever had). Because of this, I don't think my personality is the reason I'm not getting calls (although I did think this for a while).
* Googling my name comes up clean. Top result is my LinkedIn account and most links after that are mentions of me from activities at school and clubs.


I had the same problem finding an internship (which I never got) which I feel like is probably a big part of me not getting any calls. The whole ""experience for experience"" continuum has made me really jaded when I apply to jobs. So is there anything else I should be doing to better my chances at securing a job?"
23kdxy,74,2014-04-21,Found You,Daveswaffles,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/23kdxy/found_you/,"I don't know what's happening, and I would appreciate your help.

Over the last month, I've been suffering from a recurring nightmare that I've mostly attributed to stress. In my nightmare I see a man's face, with dark hair and blue eyes. The man looks happy at first, and he starts laughing. His laughing is weird though, it sounds more like a small child's laughter than a grown man's, as if a six year old were wearing the face of a middle-aged man. Anyway, he laughs for what seems like hours, but who knows how long it actually happens. Then his face becomes angry, and I can hear the same voice telling me over and over ""don't be alone, I can find you then. Don't be alone.""

As I said, these dreams had been happening for the last month, but over the last week they've been worse. Before, I would have the dream, wake up scared, and then fall back to sleep with no problem. It was scary, but I had been able to deal with it. Lately though, I see the face whenever I fall asleep, instead of just when I first fall asleep at night. 

Over Easter weekend, my roommates all left to visit their families, but because I am totally swamped with college projects and looking for an internship, I decided to stay in my dorm for the weekend. Big mistake. Last night, I was on the computer in my bedroom when I heard what sounded like someone running their palms along the outside of my bedroom door. I knew this couldn't be possible because I had locked the door to our dorm and deadbolted it, there was no way a stranger could have gotten in, and my roommates weren't due back until the next day. Being the coward that I am, I ignored the sound and hoped it would go away on its own. 

The noise stopped after about fifteen minutes, and after I had convinced myself that my imagination was playing tricks on me, I heard another sound. It was as if someone was using their fingernails to scratch at the drywall between my room and my roommate's bedroom. My bed is up against that wall, and it sounded as though the scratching was coming from the space right next to my bed. I turned around, so that my feet were up by my headboard, but the scratching followed me. Unnerved, I stood up and moved to my desk, which was backed up to the opposite wall, the wall between my dorm and the next dorm over. 

The scratching continued for another few seconds, but then stopped again. This time I didn't hear anything for nearly three hours, and deciding that at 4 am I should probably get some sleep I climbed back into bed. Except now instead of hearing scratching through the wall, I could hear tapping outside my window. Now, I live up on the fourth floor, with nothing outside my window but a sheer drop to the courtyard, there is no way anything living could be making that repeated tapping noise on my window. Terrified, I turned away from the window and attempted to ignore the noise, knowing my window was locked, but both the outside door and my roommate's bedroom door had also been locked and something had still managed to make its way in there.

Eventually, even with the tapping, I fell asleep. For the first time in weeks, I didn't have the dream with the dark-haired man, and when I awoke, I awoke to silence in my room. I pulled on a sweatshirt and stepped outside, checking to make sure that both my roommate's door and the outside door were still locked, and they were. Now convinced that I had made the whole episode up to myself, I stepped into the shower and turned the heat up to near-scalding temperatures, which is the only way to take a good shower.

I nearly slipped and fell when I came out of the shower though, traced in the fogged-up mirror were the words ""I found you."""

I am going to be applying for an internship for next summer with Boeing in St. Louis. This is my top choice for an internship. 

The reasons I think I will not be at the top of their list:

- I have an arrest on my record for criminal trespassing (stupid mistake 4 years ago)    This is my main concern
 - SIUE is not a top ranking school
 - My GPA is 3.7 - plenty of applicants will have higher
 - I have no other internship experience 

I feel these are legitimate concerns, especially the arrest. Are these deal breakers? Is there anything I can do in the next 5 months to enhance my resume? 

Also, will the arrest destroy my chances of any job in the defense industry?

You comments are greatly appreciated. 

EDIT: I'm definitely going to apply these are just concerns I've been thinking about for awhile.

23kfm7,1,2014-04-21,"I thought I was supposed to make the college decision, not my parents.",[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/23kfm7/i_thought_i_was_supposed_to_make_the_college/,"Alrighty, as the title states I am in a bit of a dilemma of which college to choose for the next four years. The problem is that my parents and I don't see eye to eye on which college I want to go to. I have been accepted into Virgina Tech, University of Maryland College Park, and Grove City College. The first two are large public institutions and the last one is a small Christian college. We can't afford VT since it's out of state so I'm left with College Park and Grove City.

Now, my parents break down their opinion on which college I should choose based on mainly the education quality and the morals of the campus.

College Park: They feel that, even though the school has a high ranking engineering program, they feel that the school won’t help me out at all and will only treat me like a number. They don’t want a school that focus’s on its pride over academics. My mom also believes/feels “that the school itself is evil.” Pretty much she feels that it a moral wrecking ball waiting to happen.

Grove City: Despite its location and size, it has a great engineering program, and since it’s a Christian, conservative, 99% white school, it can do no wrong.

My opinion is as follows:

College Park: I wasn’t initially accepted into the engineering program or honors and it was probably due to the fact that they look for diversity and not hard work. I do want that college experience of school pride and meeting new people. I also have a lot of friends attending this school in the same major field.

Grove City: While it prides itself in (almost to) rigorous academics, conservative values, and Christian belief code, I really don’t want to deal with a strict and stingy campus. While I may get a chance to participate in sports here, they are a small school still. They are also highly ranked for internships and jobs right out of college.

Start Rant

Now I understand that college is first and foremost for an education to eventually prepare you for a job, but what I can’t quite comprehend is that my parents keep trying to push me into what they want me to do. I have always though of myself as a pretty devout Christian who sought to serve God, my parents, and others. To make a long story short I really felt that I haven’t had much of a say in my life from the sports I play to things I by. While this may be an over-exaggeration, I feel that I have built up a dependency complex where I always want to please my parents by just saying yes and not putting up an argument. Recently I’ve been trying to break this mold and choosing a college is one of these “slight pushes” against my parents. However, they still believe that they have to keep steering my on “their path” towards what they want. Because of this, and other clashes I have with my parents, I have generally distanced myself from interacting with my parents and I feel that my parents actions have made me question whether or not I believe the same as them.
To convince me not to go to College Park my mother brought up how several of her friend’s children hated attending CP, and wanted nothing to do with it, how since I waited so long to pick I will get a cruddy dorm, and how their internship program is a hassle. She also follows that with saying how every college has its share of parties and shenanigans. However, my father also tried to reaffirm the last point by sayings a friend’s son dropped out of GCC because he was partying, but how is that possible if it’s one of the driest campus and top non-party school in the U.S.. I don’t get why my parent’s feel that I’m going to be this frat party animal, because that’s not me. I feel that they assume I’m going to get shitfaced and make other “bad decisions” whilst at CP (maybe GCC idk). If I do party a little, so be it, but I highly doubt that I will do something stupid. And it all comes back to how controlling they are of my life, protecting me from the “evils of the world.” I just don’t understand that I’m not some sheltered homeschooler but I have been in a public school for the past 5 years. I can’t hide from the problems of the world just by going to a “safe” college. If there is a problem, I will deal with it, and I’m tired of always feeling that I need to depend on you for every freaking thing I do in my life! I don’t care if GCC is a conservative safe haven where “faith and freedom matter” where it seems that only white conservative Presbyterians fit in while any other belief is ignored. Is there a reason why GCC has been called “God’s Concentration Camp?” How come every student review is either they love it to no end or hate it with all their guts. (This may be true for all colleges)  And then you tell me to pray about which college to choose while you’re clearly telling me that if I don’t go to GCC and go to CP, I will be some alcoholic, heathenistic, drop out bum who will struggle every step of the way. I thought this was supposed to be my choice, literally I just pick one or the other, not have some huge ordeal where I need to be sat down and spoken to about MY FUTURE. If I’m going to be an adult, let me be an adult to make my own decision please. Instead of demonizing a school, try and look for some positives.

End Rant

	While I find both school are both good, I am between a rock and a hard place. Going to CP would make me happen, but it would disappoint my parents, while GCC is the opposite. I know studying wont be an issue hopefully seeing that I am still a hardworking senior with a high GPA, but I am a little concerned with the overall workload at both institutions. CP is secular school I most definitely will be a part of some Christian ministry (despite what my parents believe I will do), even if it is going to church on Sunday, however, I want to have the choice to go to church, not be forced to attend mandatory chapels at GCC and go to a school where a good amount of people are snotty Christians who think they are “holier than thou.” (This it what I have gathered from some, but not all, student reviews) 
	I am constantly told that I don’t understand yet because I’m not an adult with experience, but I keep feeling like I’m still trying to be sheltered. I feel that both schools can offer me a rewarding future, but I feel that the experience will greatly differ.

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this question, but here it goes.

I'm going to be starting an internship soon at a startup. My first task, as I chatted with my supervisor would be to propose a system design/architecture for the upcoming products. 

The company builds mobile apps (ios and android) and require me to propose a backend system that the clients can use to login and update the contents of their app. For example, one client may have a gallery in the app they would like to update weekly, or their product stocks.

The problem is there would be a lot of clients and for each of them the kind of content they would update will be different. Is this where a CMS comes into play? How can I integrate all these customised backends into one system? Is it possible at all? 

My initial thought was to have custom solutions for them all, like individual vps-es for each app, but thats not viable in terms of maintenance. 

Please guide me in right direction on system integration. Thanks a lot."
23lxpz,126,2014-04-21,Derpy the Dell,rawrbunnyhop,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/23lxpz/derpy_the_dell/,"I work as an IT Intern at a small company. Most interns have someone above them that they can learn from, but not me. My company hired an intern because they wanted a systems engineer, network engineer, and general pc support person, but they didn't want to pay for it.

This is the tale of my dear old laptop. I named him Derpy. Derpy was a high school graduation present from my parents, 4 years ago. When I started at this company, I didn't bring Derpy with me the first few days, as I assumed that they would provide a work computer for me, as all my jobs in the past had done. This was not the case. I brought my dear Derpy into work, but I was not very pleased about it.

Derpy was a broken laptop. One day my father got mad at me for leaving my backpack in my bedroom, so he kicked it across the floor, which broke the hinge on one side of the screen. I had burnt out the memory by falling asleep with it in bed, so it overheated. I had gone through 2 fans, destroyed 2 hard drives, and ultimately upgraded it from 3 GB of RAM to 8 GB and installed a SSD in it. After these upgrades, it was fast! But still had a broken hinge. I loved that messed up computer.

Then December happened. I had left Derpy at work over the weekend, as moving him made me extremely nervous, due to the broken hinge. Someone broke into our building and stole 5 company laptops and Derpy off my desk. I was devastated. My dear old friend was stolen right off my desk. I felt violated and sick. I contacted Dell support and got a copy of my original receipt. Then logged into Newegg and pulled copies of my invoices for the replacement RAM and SSD I had installed. Then I turned it into my boss to file the insurance claim and waited.  
Then I waited some more...  
Then I kept waiting... 

In the meantime, I had to have a laptop to work on. The company wasn't going to buy one for me, so I borrowed a netbook to get through until I got the insurance money. It was several years old and could barely run windows, so I installed Ubuntu on it. It had a very tiny screen, which made most of my tasks tedious at best.

In March, my boss told me we were getting the check for the stolen property, and the insurance company had decided that Derpy was worth $380. My initial reaction was ""I guess I can buy new tires now."" I told my boss that wasn't enough money to get any kind of decent computer, and that the company should provide a laptop for IT to use. Her reaction was ""We've never had to invest in a computer for IT to use before, and we aren't going to start now. Deal with it."" I didn't know what to do. I was using an old, outdated machine with no hopes of getting anything decent.

Then something awesome happened. My boss went to the CEO to get my insurance check for me, and he asked if that was enough for me to replace my computer. The answer was obviously no. So he decided to give me $900 instead to replace the computer. I put that towards a MacBook Pro Retina 13"" that I purchased that Thursday and I couldn't be happier. I'm planning on leaving the company as soon as I possibly can, so I made sure the computer is 100% my property.

TL;DR IT doesn't get provided computers. Decent CEO saves the day.

Edit: I also named my new mac ""Pineapple"" It's fitting."

6 months ago I have moved to London. Originally I am from Poland where I have graduated from a Technical school as an IT – I have received an international certificate that proves skills(that’s worth jack squat tbh). Poland is also where I worked for 3 months as junior web-builder/webmaster for a SEO company. I know quite a lot of coding languages and I have quite a lot of experience, but unfortunately, not commercial, and more importantly, not UK commercial. 
My CV is really well done, in my opinion, at least, hence I get emails/phone calls from recruitment agencies on a weekly basis. Only after the conversation they realize that I have basically none commercial experience(they apparently don’t read CVs too thoroughly). That’s when I learn that, yet again, I am too junior for a certain position(which I am sure I would be a good match for). 
The question is how do I get even lower than a junior position? 
I can’t really freelance, as I have a full time job as a bartender to pay my rent. The same applies to internship.  

Tl;dr: Can’t even get a junior web developer/designer job. Can’t freelance since I am full-time pouring beers. What do?

I would love some advice!


Anyway, here's the setup, 8 weeks of travel to teach week-long summer camp programs to high school students. There will be a supervisor along with around 7 interns at each camp. Each intern will get around 5 kids at each camp to lead directly and watch to make sure everyone's safe. Students will be staying in what are essentially dorms as well as the interns. But there will essentially be 24/7 interaction while at the camps.

Here are the potential problems:

1. Everyone in the program is going to be competing for a job with this company and while I want to maintain friendly and working relations with everyone, I also need to standout from pack. I also want to avoid being sucked into potential drama of the other interns.

2. I'm not entirely sure how to interact with who will be my boss. The boss is the person I want to impress but I want to make sure that my interactions with him come off as genuine as opposed to simply wanting a job. How do I work on building a relationship while performing my responsibilities to the best of my ability?

3. Are there any other points I should go into further detail on?

I'm open to other suggestions and ideas but the two points I listed are what I'm most curious about. Thanks in advanced for the feedback"

I'd love to get some advice on how to prepare for this as I have never before worked in investment management.

My Background:

Through internships and early grad roles I've had exposure on institutional sales and trading desks as well as working in operational roles at another major AM firm. Since that time I have earned my MSc in management from a very well respected university, have level 1 of CFA under my belt (and am studying for level II this June), and I am currently working in wealth management.

While I am very confident in my Excel skills, am comfortable with Bloomberg and Reuters, and am getting pretty comfortable with financial statement analysis and equity valuations, I have no practical experience in research or valuations.

My question: What skills are most important to a value focused equity manager and how can I prepare? 

Is my understanding of the investment process, as follows, correct? I assume that these teams create rules to screen stocks, and then apply more and more screening metrics until only a small number of ideas remain. A thorough analysis of these ideas will involve looking at their statements and earnings over the past 2-3 years, reading sell-side coverage, looking at management, and applying a number of valuation models to see if it is priced well (probably making pro forma statements based on revenue estimates... maybe some simple DDM too), and then either buying, monitoring, or discarding. 

Any insight is very much appreciated -this is an incredible opportunity for me.

Sorry if you've seen this type of post a lot. I did do a few searches and looked through the results but I was hoping to get advice for my personal situation.

I go to a top school and have had a tough time academically - both with classes and figuring out what I want to do. I'm finishing up my junior year and will finish my CS lower divs by this summer, but am on the verge of failing my current CS course (already emailed the professor asking to meet). I really enjoy CS and know that I want to get into the industry (preferrably something graphics/CGI related).

The issue is that there has recently been a huge influx of intended CS majors so the school has put a GPA cap which is pretty difficult to meet. I knew I wouldn't be able to meet it (my GPA is garbage) so I decided to declare a film major (I really enjoy movie making) and go for a minor in CS. Now they've decided to put the GPA cap on the minor as well. I'm interested in CS but the classes are very theoretical so I lose interest in them quickly. 

Right now, my two options seem to be: stick with a film major and just take CS courses as if I was a minor although I wouldn't be a minor I would just be taking those courses. The second option is to double in math with a CS concentration but this would mean staying an extra year rather than extra semester and would have a more cramped schedule than I currently do. However, I do plan on working during my 5th year if that is an option (even part time CS stuff if possible).

What would you guys recommend?

Edit: Thanks for the advice everyone. To answer a few questions: No, there are no MIS/CIS or any related majors available. To my knowledge you either do CS major or minor, or do a physical science (math, stats, ieor, etc.) with a concentration in CS. I have taken some online programming classes (coursera, codeacademy, etc.) and I absolutely loved them. I love the coding aspect to my CS courses and don't really mind the theory but I don't like the way that it is presented - theory theory theory, huge project where we finally code. But from what I've heard, upper division courses are less theoretical. After this semester I'll be one course away from finishing my lower div CS courses (2 if I fail one CS course this semester). I'm in the process of finding out the new restrictions for the CS minor but I believe right now it is a GPA cap that I won't meet (although nor will plenty of other students unfortunately). The biggest reason behind me doubling is that I want to graduate with a technical degree. After looking at internship and job qualifications online, most companies ask for a BS in CS or similar degree so Math seems to fit that qualification. 

I've had trouble in my CS courses initially due to not realizing how demanding they were and this semester dealing with a number of issues like overloading my course schedule since I was so behind, again not realizing how difficult the CS classes were this semester (at least 2x as hard as last semester's) and having bad project partners.

23mon1,4,2014-04-21,"A Chemical Engineer, 27, that can't even get a half-decent entry-level job to earn a living, even in Texas. Losing faith in the ""system"". HELP :(",The_Broken_Engineer,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/23mon1/a_chemical_engineer_27_that_cant_even_get_a/,"A little back story. I am a US Citizen but I literally come from nothing and was brought up in a third-world country for most of my life until I somehow managed to get into a reputable (top 40) private engineering university (at the age of 20) up in the North-East and graduated (albeit a year late) back in 2012. The culture shock was astounding, to say the least. But I managed to master English and the American accent to the point where you could never tell that I never grew up in the USA.

Adjusting to America all on my own, with next to nothing (came here with less than $500 for text books/food/etc, with no support from my parents since they were too poor), took a serious toll on my academics and I ended up with a GPA of 2.76 when all was said and done and graduated a year late. However, while in college, I did manage to get into a competitive Co-Op program (with a GPA of 2.87 at the time where the ""lower limit"" was a 3.0 for the program AND in the middle of the Great Recession no less!) and had two rotations at a consulting firm that totaled to almost a year of work experience. 

After making it out alive from college, I got thrown into the world with less than $150 to my name and no 6-month grace period for my student loans as I had lost all my financial aid for the last semester (since I fell under part-time). After 3 months of hearing nothing back from all the jobs that I applied to, I was getting desperate. Desperate to the point where I took the first thing that came my way, which happened to be an ""under-the-table"" paid internship at an iffy  manufacturing company in the middle of nowhere in up-state New York in the hopes of breaking into the whole Marcellus Shale gas ""boom"" since said company catered to the Oil &amp; Gas industry. 

Turns out, it was all rumors by the time I got there since all the Oil and Gas companies had capped their wells 2 years prior to me getting there and moved out to Ohio before the EPA could really get their hands on them. 

**So there I am, a broke and somewhat duped 25 year old ChemE with a quarter-of-a-million dollar education in the middle-of-no-where, the only colored guy in the county(s) (their words, not mine)** and I try to make the best of the situation and toil away at that ""internship"" for the next 6 months and cut scrap metal at a scrap yard on the side and keep on applying around for work in the meantime. I got an errant interview or two at some more legitimate companies but it never panned out. 

Depression starts setting in and the people that I'm working with start to sense that I'm about to break so they end up bribing me by hiring me full-time with a bit more money of $32k/yr (still half of what a ChemE makes). I get excited but that wears off after a few weeks when I realize that I end up where I started with my finances after taxes, health insurance, etc. And so, I keep on chugging along, getting probably 1 or 2 interviews for that year until I get laid off a few days before New Years 2014. 

I take all my belongings and ""get the hell out of Dodge"", as the saying goes, and wander around the country for the next few months until I make it into Texas under the pretense that ""hey, I'm a ChemE that's NOT in Houston"" and I have nothing else to lose.

Now I've been in Texas for over a month and a half and still having no luck. All the positions seem to be either looking for anything but a Chemical Engineer or I don't have enough experience. My GPA may be a factor too, since I vividly recall how every single time I went to a career fair and approached the big companies like Exxon and DuPont, I'd get shunned away, quite rudely, when the found I was below a 3.0 (heck later on DuPont brought the cut-off upto 3.3?!?)

At this point, I'm out of almost all my money, hope and dignity and I just don't even know why I even bother getting up anymore in the morning. I get hounded at by everyone I've ever known or loved for ""why I don't have a job yet?"" or I should ""get my act together"".
 
I know that the world owes me nothing and I am more than grateful for all the opportunities that have even bothered to present themselves to me and I am also grateful for the fact that I've managed to make it even this far in life. But I can't help but feel betrayed at the same time by the system. All the people I know that I went to college with are doing great in life and I'm only getting older, broke-er (i know, its not a word), and slipping away physically and mentally. 

If ANYONE can give me any guidance as to what the hell I should do or where even to start, I would greatly appreciate it.


**TL;DR:** A US citizen who grew up with nothing in a 3rd world country, managed to get into a ""top 40"" US engineering college, somehow got a Bachelors of Science in Chemical Engineering but can't for the life of him find a half decent job and has been spiraling down into oblivion, hitting every damn branch on the way down the tree and now resides in Texas and needs help and advice.

I have about a $1000 budget, and I'm bringing over my SSD from my previous build to this one. I have the option to bring my CPU cooler also, but I never did get around to overclocking my first m-itx, and still debating if I want to, since I know I can save about $75, but I'm not too stingy on it. Ditching an optical drive also this time around, as I almost never use discs anymore.

The must-haves are the SG05 so I can bring it on the plane (in a carry-on bag), and the GTX 760 since it's SFF, giving more breathing room inside the case.
So folks, thoughts? Hoping to purchase everything by the end of mid-week."
23ndu3,7,2014-04-21,Concerned about side project relevancy,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/23ndu3/concerned_about_side_project_relevancy/,"Hey guys!

I am currently a student who is trying to prepare for next summer so that I can land an internship. My main question is: 

How relevant do your side projects need to be to the internship position you are applying for? For example, I really enjoy mobile development, and would love to have an internship in this field. However, when it comes to looking for other internship opportunities, I don't want to just limit myself to mobile internships. I want to cast my net as wide as possible to increase my chances of getting an internship.

If I was applying to internships at other companies for software development intern positions that are not related to mobile (for example maybe something related to back-end work, games, R&amp;D, or generic business application development), would it reflect negatively on me if 3/4 of my projects were iOS apps? Or does this even matter? 

I of course would not try to apply for internships that I am unqualified for (for example, web development which is a field I know relatively little about, or ones that use technologies I am clueless about).

I'm concerned that if I focus mainly on mobile development that I will not be a good fit for other types of software development internship roles. On the other hand I do not want to make my projects too broad because I'm afraid that this will make it seem like I am a jack of all trades who isn't really a good fit anywhere.

Also, does the company size play into this at all? For example, do start ups care more about this than larger companies like Google or Amazon?

I'm just trying to find the right balance. Is this something I should be concerned about or am I making this project relevancy issue a bigger deal than it really is?"

The company builds mobile apps (ios and android) and require me to propose a backend system that the clients can use to login and update the contents of their app. For example, one client may have a gallery in the app they would like to update weekly, or their product stocks.

The problem is there would be a lot of clients and for each of them the kind of content they would update will be different. Is this where a CMS comes into play? How can I integrate all these customised backends into one system? Is it possible at all?

My initial thought was to have custom solutions for them all, like individual vps-es for each app, but thats not viable in terms of maintenance.

23nisg,1,2014-04-22,My story...,A444444,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/23nisg/my_story/,"So it's been a bad year. I'm 26 and last year I moved out of my parents place for the first time. I'd had some issues prior to that, school didn't pan out how I'd planned and some layoffs led to me not being in a good place financially. Even before that however I had some huge issues. Since about 14 I've felt miserable. 

So this idea of death has been in the back of my mind for a long time. I've coped. Last year I learned my dad was a meth addict. I knew he was on something but I tried to avoid learning what. I was interning at a place with the plan of going full time there. At that point I'd be able to support myself. At the time I was also working part time at a call center. When I learned what was really going on with my dad, shit got a lot worse. I decided to quit my internship to go full time at the call center as it would be quicker. I was able to move out within a couple of months at that point.

People had told me it would help to be away... It hasn't helped.

I have a roommate who was one of my better friends in highschool. Now all he does is smoke weed. I don't necessarily think weed is horrible, but it is all he does. He had been living in another state and hated it, so I helped get him here and got him a job at the call center I work at. In a year I went from being an agent to being a lead to being a coordinator. Things were going well, but I never stopped being miserable. Meanwhile my roommate started spending all of his money on weed. He still manages to pay rent but I know he borrows money here and there all the time. It's a big source of concern for me.

So this stress starts adding up, but this story has good news too.

During this year, my dad had gone to rehab. Things seemed to be going better... but about 2 months ago, I found alcohol at my parent's place. My dad had started drinking again. I started looking and I found some suspicious things. I don't know that he's using meth again, but I believe it is simply a matter of time.

So I quit talking to my family....

This led to me not being around people for the most part. I don't have much for friends. The people I know bother me as everyone seems to be about getting high all of the time. It made me miss my family... so I decide to go to my parents place for Easter. It was a horrible experience. I realized I hate being around my family... I can't stand anyone. 

So, this time when the idea of killing myself comes up, it doesn't seem so bad... It's all I've been able to think of for the last 24 hours. I actually went to /r/suicide hoping to find advice on how to do it. There are definitely subs for illegal things, so I thought maybe... well I found SW and figured it couldn't hurt to post something."

23nooi,1,2014-04-22,Completely lost and unsure of what I want and what to do after I graduate college,iJamJL,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/23nooi/completely_lost_and_unsure_of_what_i_want_and/,"Hello there,


As stated in the title, I'm about to graduate college soon with a degree in Economics. The tl;dr for choosing econ is basically to have a degree. I changed majors so many times that I wasn't getting anywhere, and econ was the quickest way to graduation. To explain a bit more, I've tried the following majors: math teacher (twice - tried it, dropped the course, tried again two years later, quit again), math, accounting, attempted a pre-engineering route, and occupational therapy (actually worked as an aide for both physical therapists AND occupational therapists, and took anatomy and physiology i &amp; ii). In the end, none of them really seemed to interest me enough for me to stay put. Therefore, I bounced back onto economics because I took the intro courses when attempting to major in accounting, and somewhat enjoyed econ at that time.


Now that I'm majoring in econ, I'm bored half the time during my lectures. It's not the professors because they're great people and are decently engaging. I think it's my lack of care or interest in the subject.


Due to my constant change in majors, I haven't had any internships or work experience that can lead me to a career. The last job I had was working for those therapists, and it was for two years. I finally got a new job because I was so bored, and now I'm working as a bank teller because it pays better. I don't necessarily hate it, but I don't enjoy it either. Work is work, right? The thing is that I've only been working there for three months now, but I'm already wanting to change jobs.


So to recap:

-I'm majoring in a major that I have little care for

-I'm working in a job that I don't care for

-I have pretty much zero work experience directly related to any careers


Usually at this point, anyone I ask for advice would ask me what do I want to do with my life, what are my hobbies/interests/passions, or where do I see myself in the future (3 or 5 years is the usual length of time). What's my honest answer? I have no fucking clue. What do I want to do with my life? Obviously make a decent amount of money so I can live comfortably and have a family in the future. What are my hobbies? Well, I like music, am really crappy at guitar but do love playing it, table tennis, and just play League of Legends with friends in our spare time. A couple of friends have told me to pursue music because they see my ""passion"" for it, but that industry is way too risky for my taste. Those hobbies are mine should remain hobbies because I don't think I would ever go pro in any of them. Lastly, where do I see myself in a few years from now? I see myself miserable in an office job, working in a cubicle; kind of like what was portrayed in Office Space.


I've greatly considered joining the military because they have a structured system, and it would sort of give me time to figure out what I want to do in life; however, I have a few friends that are in the military, and they've told me that they suggest I don't join. They're completely suggesting though, and wouldn't stop me if I did join. It's just that they don't think it'll help me with my situation, and I'll just be miserable in a bad environment.


Another friend suggested that I do something like join the Peace Corps, or something along the lines of volunteer work. Maybe it's something to look into, but I feel as though I'm going to eventually chase money. Knowing that, I don't think I'll last in the Peace Corps long.


Therefore, I seek advice on what actions I should take to help myself. I don't even know where to start. I encourage any questions, especially if I was unclear due to my poor writing skills. All and any comments are appreciated."

I am a current freshman (intended L&amp;S CS major). I don't have any internship or research opportunities lined up, so I was thinking of taking either CS 70 or Math 54 this summer. So far, I've heard conflicting advice from my friends. Some are suggesting I take CS 70 so that I don't take it with Sahai in the fall and can avoid the notorious amount of work he gives. Others suggest I do the opposite and take it with Sahai. I personally see the merits to both arguments, but I figure any CS upper div is gonna be a lot of work anyway, so why avoid it now? I do want to take math 54 and get that out of the way (I really did not like 1A and 1B) but it looks like I'll be on the waitlist for the summer sessions. For fall, the only class I know for sure I'll be taking is CS61C, and I'll find something to satisfy my AC requirement. 

What have your experiences been taking either of these classes over the summer? Any advice?

Thank you very much! :D

I need something that will let organize my schedule, keep notes on what tasks I need to get done, and save online articles and such to read and take notes on for when I have the time.  For now, I've been supplementing my Mac calendar by taking separate notes in a journal, posting sticky note throughout my office and apartment, and emailing myself articles and tasks, but its too cluttered and unorganized to be effective.

-------------------------

&gt;**Today**

The medical college stands off in the distance, the structure peering over the rest of campus. A dry fog curls along the ground as birds chirp and chatter. It's a colder day, 40F, but at least it's not too windy. Pure Michigan, as the phrase goes for the state.

Today was a slow day, our queue sleeping in a temporary hibernation state. Boss walked into the office, his coffee in hand. He seemed to have relapsed, as he had always talked us up about quitting coffee.

&gt;Boss: You said you wanted to talk about something?

&gt;Me: Do you still have [PM]'s resume by any chance?

&gt;Boss: Not sure, I think it's somewhere, why do you ask?

&gt;Me: Well, you know how [PM] said he had all those certifications?

&gt;Boss: Sorta, why?

&gt;Me: You might want to see if they're legit.

&gt;Boss: I suppose so... I gave him the benefit of the doubt he because didn't have hardly any work experience. Certs can be dumped and passed, been there before.

Boss stood up and took his coffee back to his office, and I could hear RC in the hallway yelling about NOAH on the clinical laptops that were botched last Friday. RC was a cool electronics tech, always talking to me about his RC airplanes, but he was very strict about the clinical process (I mean, you have to be, it's fucking HIPAA), and he'd skewer you if you gave him a machine and said it was done when it wasn't. I mean, I don't fucking do that, I'd rather not get our university sued.

CM arrives at 9, which is a bit odd since he only comes in early on my shift when something is up.

&gt;CM: Hey, we'll need to pull an image and snapshots of NOAH from the VMWare 7 machine for a new lab image. I left the instructions in the ticket, but we'll let the new guys take care of it. You literally have to be braindead to fuck this up.

Knowing how it's better not to curse oneself before setting a goal, I just sigh and slide back into the captain's chair at the command quad. PM walks in talking on the phone, and it always makes me wish I had a Babel Fish nearby so I could understand what he's talking about. He takes a seat at his dying machine, the dull whisper of a fan who found out too late that, no, dust bunnies were not your friends. He opens our tech page and... does something, or really anything at this point is fine by me.

CM heads out to the student gym facility across campus, figuring that PM would read the ticket that specifically stated it wasn't for him or I to do. 30 minutes pass, and PM is lollygagging around the endless depths that is the web.

&gt;*I lean around the command quad*

&gt;Me: So how's that image capture going bud, she ready to roll?

&gt;PM: It's a ticket for the new guys, correct? The ones we just hired?

&gt;Me: Well yes, of course. It says that right in the ticket, did you read it?

&gt;PM: Ya, I'm not the new guys.

&gt;Me: Bud, we hired you 6 months ago, get to work.

A knock on the door of our staging area leads me out into the main room, Reeses, the MCT's manager, had called me to work on his machine. I leave the room and nod my heads towards the VM at CM's command center, and PM slowly slid his chair over there.

I had only started working on Reeses's machine when my phone chirps away in my pocket.

&gt;*PM: Help. What is password?*

Jesus dude, this guy really can't do anything without you holding his fucking hand.

&gt;*Me: It's Administrator's*

I go back to work and fix Reeses's machine. Apparently upgrades over Office 2010 to 2013 don't play nice with regards to Outlook, thanks Obama!

I Fob into the staging area and I find PM looking down at his phone, leg crossed, doing nothing.

&gt;Me: Uh, what are you doing dude? Are you capturing that image?

&gt;PM: The password was wrong.

&gt;Me: What the fuck, no it's not, what did you type?

&gt;PM: ""Administrator's""

*Holy fucking shit*

I walk over and hammer the password into the VM and it greets me with that soothing Windows 7 Logon tone. *""This is how stress kills people""*, I thought.

CM arrives back from the athletic center.

&gt;CM: Holy god how can people not open stuff to check if it works before saying it's broken?

Dunno bud, I'm dealing with a Layer 8 issue here myself and he's getting paid to be stupid.

The delivery guy drops us off from boxes from CDW, Boss decided on [Surface Pros](http://i.imgur.com/lZc0WUh.png), [Surface 2's](http://i.imgur.com/iyHqMVo.jpg), and getting those damn [touch cover 2's. (Those suck even more than the Type Cover 2's)](http://i.imgur.com/FKLcli6.png)

Noon time rolls around and my phone rings with some asshole recruiter from Indiana wanting me to work for HP for like $12.00/hr. I politely tell him I'm not interested and to remove me from his recruitment database. Listen shit head, if I wanted to work for a company I'll directly talk to them, you're not getting a cut of my salary for placement, you ""Talent Acquisition Specialist"" piece of shit. JT1 and Boss walk in to the office, and asks us if we'd like to go to lunch. We all decide to go to a pizza pub literally 100 yards away from the building. PM, not really a pizza guy, decides to stay behind and ""work on the capture"".

An hour passes and we all arrive back with our leftovers in tow. I throw PM the scraps from my mozarella sticks, pizza, and breadsticks, because I figured he was hungry.

&gt;Me: How's the capture going?

&gt;PM: Good, almost done.

That's weird, image capture doesn't take an hour at the most for a clean image. It was 1, so I didn't give a fuck, I had to look after these new Surface tablets with CM and asked JT1 to assist PM if he requests it. Oddly enough our ticket queue wasn't updating CM's ticket, because generally if you're a good person you update what you've been doing to your job you're working on, sounds great in theory but horrendously awful in practice, kind of like comments in programming source code because everyone knows what you're thinking when you wrote that sloppy ass if-tree that's like 5 levels deep.

3pm rolls around and I start leaving for my class on scripting with Ruby, Python, and Perl (fuck Perl).

&gt;Me: [PM], update the ticket it's been dead all day.

&gt;PM: Fine, it's updated now.

I walk along the office corridor and see my boss reading my going-away card I got him (It said ""You're the best boss I've ever had... so far!) and pop in for a chat.

&gt;Me: We're making progress on that VM, but I guess only PM's worked on it.

Boss [twirls open the ticket](http://i.imgur.com/tUZGrPN.png) and takes a sip of his coffee. He lets out a deep sigh.

&gt;Me: Do you know who's going to work here this summer since I'm gone and CM has an internship?

&gt;Boss: The newer guys.

&gt;Me: You think [PM] is gonna come back this fall?

&gt;Boss: I make my hiring decisions in early August, not sure yet though. Seems to be better that way. Have fun at class.

I exit out the corridor door to slip into the stream of students leaving class and heading into campus. The clocktower rings and the chimes are heard throughout the campus, as my eyes move from one face to another. They don't know who I am, or what I do, or what I have to deal with. I guess you could sum it up in a cliche phrase.

&gt;*I'm the one who rocks*

23q9ki,0,2014-04-22,Helplessness Here,dumbvestor,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/23q9ki/helplessness_here/,"I went to one of the best high school in the area, I got my electrical engineering degree from a good college, I have a job downtown in my field.

I *hate* my job.  I told the manager at the time what I wanted to do, he told me they do that all the time, they almost never deal with what it is I wanted to do.  I have been at this company for a little over 2.5 years, I have been sending out my resume for over 2 years.  I have a few big problems though:

1) I have no internship because I got my degree in 4 years when everyone else took 4.5+.  
2) I graduated over 3 years ago so my classes are not worth much and I slacked off so my GPA was less than amazing anyway.  
3) I did not actually plan to get an engineering degree.

In regards to #3, I was originally a Physics major, but I decided I did not want to need a Doctorate before getting a job so I just picked a random degree until I figured out what I wanted to do with my life.  I will point out I did not have a fun college life, I lived at home with my parents and went to a grand total of maybe 2 parties for those 4 years, neither of which involved any alcohol or drugs.  I just showed up to class everyday and stupidly expected something else to fall into my lap like it always did.

So now I am stuck in a job I hate, with a degree which I honestly never wanted, and after 2 years of sending out my resume to any posting which looked interesting almost nobody even replies.

Other random info: I passed the F.E. exam (first of 2 tests to become a licensed engineer similar to the Bar for lawyers) on the first try while still in my senior year at college.  I have lots of little random skills such as some amount of programming skill but no classes to back it up and no serious projects to show off.  I suck at selling myself, and at this point it really is becoming a problem with my self-esteem, but it is hard to think well of myself given how stuck I feel.

The first step clearly is to determine *what* I want to do...  How do I even figure this out?"

I could still change one of my majors and, for example, do Economics and Marketing double major (or possibly Management, Management Information Systems, or Supply Chain and Information Systems).

1)Economics/Political Science or International Relations double major with Computer Science minor

I'm in definite need of life advice. The super short and simple version of my problem is that I am disillusioned with the working world and with my chosen career, only a year after graduating from an elite university with a masters degree.

Here's the whole story:

I've spent the last 5 years of my life building up to the career I have now -- 1 year at the end of college figuring out my ""life calling"", 2 years doing internships, and 2 years in graduate school. But now that I'm actually ""doing it"" (i.e., working in what I thought would be my dream job), I couldn't care less. Before graduating, I had ambitions of having daily goals, keeping a log of things I'd learned, and wisdom gleaned from my senior colleagues. Now I barely use more brain power than is necessary to complete my tasks. Furthermore, even loftier goals that I've had for years now seem like horrible ideas. For instance, I used to want to do a PhD, get a prestigious postdoc, and then acquire a leadership position for a certain organization. Now, I don't want to do any of those things! They all seem like massive wastes of time: doing a PhD and gaining theoretical knowledge that has minimal application in a very political, top-heavy, and interpersonal environment when I could just be gaining work experience; being underpaid and overworked in a postdoc position as more senior employees leverage my cheap labor; having a leadership position in this certain organization that I now see as inefficient, stagnating, and with very little room for creative input and career growth (not to mention the way my superiors are pulled in 10 directions with dozens upon dozens of unread emails, working 10 hour days). 

Anyway, I just used to be so confident in where I was going, and now I just have no idea. Maybe other organizations have better cultures and more stimulating work to offer, but I don't even know where to begin gauging that. And I increasingly feel like just an average joe, after living most of my life under the impression that I was special, uncommonly intelligent, and had a brighter future than 90% of the populace. I just didn't realize the working world was so imperfect. As I ponder this existential crisis, I keep thinking that the working world in general just isn't for me, but that isn't exactly a viable solution. So when it comes right down to it, I don't have a plan; I'm just treading water. 

As you might suspect, with this total change in my life, I'm getting depressed. I just feel like I'm on a hampster wheel. By the time Friday comes around, I'm exhausted, and two days never seems like enough to revitalize me and fix my burn out. Meanwhile, I have 7 years left of loan payments. I just don't know how sustainable this process is, and I just want to be happy again and enjoy my day-to-day life. 


So I guess my question is how do you find happiness (or at least ward off crippling depression) while dealing with an existential crisis such as mine? I know things aren't hopeless, but they sure feel that way sometimes.

All comparable personal experiences are welcome; I'd love to hear how some of you overcame a similar situation. Sorry for the disjointed post.

I'm graduating in June, and I still don't really have any idea of what I want to do, and nor have I gotten any offers, other than the one I mention [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20vmnb/new_grad_informally_accepted_offer_but_having/). 

I'm currently developing a local company's iOS application, and developing a few iOS applications on the side. I really do enjoy it for the most part, more so than I have other parts of programming. However, part of me is really concerned that I should really be learning Javascript and an associated framework and make web applications. I've been dabbling with Backbone.js and Angular, and, while I can't say that I love javascript, the stuff you can do with them is pretty neat. I'd also hate to take a job as an iOS developer to only be phased out as web apps continue to become popular. 

I've been continuing interviewing, but I'm still pretty busy with my internship and courses, that I'm not getting to the next rounds because I don't have enough time to study up for them. I feel like I'm already late enough in the job application status for new grads that the ""sooner-the-better"" mentality isn't holding up, and I should just focus on making applications and studying up for interviews with time over the summer.

So I guess my questions are:

* What technologies should I be learning given I have both an interest in iOS and web application development, and is there any overlap so I could transition between them if need be?

* Should I push aside any more interviews until Summer when I have time to brush up on fundamentals?"

My question is this. After months of networking I've been able to finally get an email to the hiring manager at a show I've always wanted to work at because one of my former colleagues worked for them in the past. 

I finally reached out to the hiring manager last week with my resume, cover letter &amp; the man who referred me asking for any type of entry level job (production assistant) &amp; even an internship if that was their only opening. A week past and he just sent me an email today, responding:

Tips?,[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/23rlyb/second_interview_tips/,"I was recently called in for a business intelligence internship at a large company (my first internship ever). The job is a very general IT internship (based on the description) and the person I would be reporting to seems to be dealing with data warehousing and teradata based off of a little LinkedIn scouting. The first interview was a little shaky for me. I got my talking points across for the main behavioral questions but fumbled with a few things as I was quite nervous about getting interviewed by 3 people at once (2 IT managers and 1 HR).


Low and behold I got a call back and I'm not sure what to expect now. During my first interview, they inquired about my technical skills to which I only said I know how to use SQL and basic excel. Anything I can do to better prep for the second interview? (will be with one of IT managers from the first interview and another guy who works with teradata). I expect this will be a technical interview as my work, school and volunteer experience were highlighted in the first interview. However, given that this is my first technical interview, what should I expect? 

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: For anyone wondering or searching for future reference, the second interview was just to see if I knew my shit in SQL and what other technologies I knew. I got the internship :D"

I'm having some trouble deciding my transfer path. Currently I'm a freshman in my spring quarter in a Top 50 school. I'm miserable here; the school is just a horrible fit for me. I won't get into details because they aren't very important but just understand that I'm not exaggerating when I say I'm miserable. I never wanted to go to this school in the first place, but I received a full scholarship and couldn't pass it up for my parents' financial sake. But since attending, I've spiraled into unbearable depression. It's pathetic really; I've attempted suicide once and was taken into psychiatric care. All of this made me feel crazy because everyone else in the school seems so happy. Although my personal problems definitely played a major part, I've concluded it's the environment that really triggers all my mental problems. (When I went away off campus during breaks, I was happy) I need to get out of here.

Anyway, all of these factors led to me staying in bed all day and missing a lot of class. My classes were not very difficult, but with my crippling depression I couldn't get myself to focus or study. I even ended up skipping a couple of my midterms because I couldn't gather the confidence to leave my dorm. My fall quarter I somehow managed to pull of a 3.6 but my condition exacerbated in Winter quarter where I got a 2.6. Now I'm standing at a horrible (for my standards) GPA of 3.1.

The only thing keeping me going is the idea that I won't be trapped here for long if I can transfer out, but my GPA is really beginning to destroy that hope. It doesn't seem like I can transfer into a university I'd be happy at anymore. I guess what is so frustrating is that I know my current GPA doesn't reflect my true capabilities, but there isn't much I can do to change it. 

Here is some background information.

High School:  
* 3.9 GPA  
* Graduated in the top 10  
* Fantastic EC's  
* Accepted to UC Berkeley, UCLA, UMichigan, Dartmouth, American University (the school I'm currently attending is not listed)  

College:  
* 3.1 GPA  
* Very minor EC's  
* Congressional internship at Capitol Hill (Probably the only thing I have going for me)  

I made the wrong choice with selecting the current school I'm attending, but at this point what can I do? Now, I wouldn't be accepted into any of the colleges I got into out of high school. Some other schools I'd (ideally) like to transfer to are USC, NYU, and Georgetown. 

Should I not even bother applying to schools of that caliber? 

Any type of honest advice is welcome, no matter how pessimistic it may sound. I'm completely lost. I had such high hopes for myself in high school and now it seems like I'll never be able to accomplish those dreams. The futility of becoming the person I dreamed to be is probably the strongest impetus of my suicidal thoughts. I guess I can't seem to find the point in living if I can't be happy with myself and proud of what I accomplished. I've considered taking a year off, but I think that will make me feel even worse about myself. Suicide just seems inevitable for me, but I really don't want it to be.

I'm sorry for posting such a heavy message, but I really don't know where else to go with this. Thanks everyone."

At my current job I was brought on as an intern  a year and a half ago and was paid $10/hr, not bad for an intern!

Then I graduated and they gave me many more responsibilities and had me doing sales work as well as support, while as an intern I only did blog posts and routine content creation for the company website.  As months passed I asked for a raise and was told no repeatedly, even though they changed my job title and bumped me to 40hrs/week and had me doing the same job as someone they fired who was making 50k/yr.

I was fed up and started searching for a job and got a great offer for a position at a great medical office.  I came in yesterday and told my boss of my offer and gave my 2 weeks notice.  He asked ""what can we do to make you to stay?"" ""you can't leave us!"" and I reiterated that I had accepted the  job offer and that it was an opportunity I could not pass up.

He then FLIPPED OUT!

He said ""so you are leaving us for some *doctor's office*?  He then told me I had ""wasted a shitload of his time"" and that he ""didn't respect me anymore"" and that this ""is not the way you leave a job"".  He told me he hoped I would learn how to leave a job with class in the future and that I should have given him a heads up months ago instead of ""being dishonest"" and applying for jobs behind his back.  He then told me that I would not be needed passed this Friday and is giving me the cold shoulder.

I am SHOCKED and am disappointed as I feel I was disrespected and that I DID do things the right way.  I have never heard of anyone ""giving their boss a heads up"" that they were looking for another job!

I would have liked to have gotten an internship this summer but I didn't make the decision until recently and having to stay at school has made it very hard to find one. The problem is that next summer will then be the soonest I can get one. Will I be significantly further behind others in the field?

I have to choose on of these by next week:

-PHP developer in news analytics company, would pay pretty well but would require me to lease a car to get to work from where I'd be living

-Software Dev at nanotech startup, would pay pretty well and would probably involve creating databases and automation for the tests the engineers are running

-Part-time web application developer, pay is not very good and I would probably have time to take some classes at the same time

I'm conflicted. From a monetary standpoint, the part-time position seems like a terrible candidate, but at this point I'm much more concerned with building my skillset and resume in anticipation of the hunt for full-time employment next year, and a job where I am the lead developer on a project and can sink my teeth into angularjs or ruby on rails seems to be much more relevant than doing more PHP work or wrangling this weird science software. At the same time, the people from the nanotech startup seemed pretty cool and fun to work with. The PHP job would probably be the only place where I would be working collaboratively with other developers, but the hassle of needing a car is a major drawback.

What are your thoughts?"

First time poster here with another typical face-palm story. This is more programming support related than IT support, but hopefully it is still relevant for this sub.

I work for an engineering consulting company and we hire an intern every semester to help us with R&amp;D work. This means they're typically using Matlab to crunch numbers on some large datasets. We had one particular student who has never used Matlab before, but did take a C++ course. Since Matlab is essentially the bastard child of C++ and a calculator, we had faith that he could learn it.

Unfortunately for me, this meant I was the go-to person whenever the bad errors wouldn't go away. I try and practice the ""teach a man to fish"" philosophy, so when I was asked about one particular error, I sat down with him and went through it line-by-line.

Me: ""See here, this shows you which function called the error and it even tells you the exact line and a description of the problem.""

Him: ""Yeah, but I didn't make any mistakes so there shouldn't be an error.""

Me: ""Hmmm... it says here you have a 'Matrix Dimension Mismatch', that means you're operating on two matrices of different sizes. Let's take a look.""

I then proceed to click on the error itself, which brings me directly to the offending line of code.

Him: ""See, this matrix contains X data and this matrix contains Y data and I'm trying to compare them to each other.""

Me: ""Well, I'll show you the way I would troubleshoot this. First, let's to check the size of each of your matrices right before you do the comparison. This should give us an indication as to why they're different sizes.""

I proceed to insert a ""size(X)"" and a ""size(Y)"" before the offending line, run the code again, and get results: 14000x1 and 14000x0.

Me: ""It looks like you haven't actually assigned any values to Y, so that's why you can't compare it to something.""

23srad,6,2014-04-23,Delay graduation by a semester for a Fall or Spring internship? Or just finish out and graduate next May?,MrGorillaNoodles,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/23srad/delay_graduation_by_a_semester_for_a_fall_or/,"I'm set to graduate by May 2015, but I'm feeling like I might need some work experience to put myself in a better position.

This summer I'll be finishing up my ""junior"" year at a community college in a 3+1 program and in the fall I'll be entering the +1 portion. This fall semester will be the first iteration of the +1 portion of this program ever. While this local private university has produced CS graduates before, I'll be among only a handful or two of students that will be the first to graduate from their 3+1 program. It's an excellent way to save money on an education, as I'll have minimal debt, but I'm a little worried about the merit of a program that hasn't been done before. I can't be sure of job placement stats, if we'll have recruitment services, job fairs, etc.

I'm also a bit uneasy about how much I'll have accomplished by graduation. I just received my first exposure to programming last semester in a C++ course, and each semester here on out will be a crash course in CS and programming since I finished the brunt of my general education a couple years ago at a university I previously attended. For instance, this semester I'm taking 18 credit hours with Assembly, C#, Advanced C++, and a Windows Networking course. This summer I'll be taking Calculus, another Advanced C++ course, and a Data Structures/System Design course to finish out my ""junior"" year. It feels like it's all coming so fast that I don't know if I'll find a suitable niche in CS and be able to produce from that niche by graduation.

I've got some school projects from this semester that I could polish up and put on GitHub, and I'm either going to teach myself Objective-C and code an application/game or find an interesting implementation for C++ or C# that I'll enjoy coding into a project over the summer. However, I feel like I could use some mentoring since all but one of my CC professors are pretty out of touch outside academia. As a result, all of the programs I've coded, except a couple games, have been problems out of a text book.

With that said, would I benefit from delaying graduation by a semester for a Fall internship? Or should I just finish out school and rely on my school projects, prospective side projects, and whatever the level of merit a 3+1 program will provide?

Thank you guys for your time

**TL;DR:** Worried my 3+1 program won't hold much merit. Cramming all CS coursework into 2.5 years of school, little time has been available for side projects, only 2 semesters of programming experience including this spring."

23t7f4,2,2014-04-23,[Hiring] Sales Intern- Work Remotely,upperdaddy,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/23t7f4/hiring_sales_intern_work_remotely/,"Have ever wondered what it would be like to own your own start-up tech company, or work with a start-up tech company? Here is a unique opportunity for you to see what working with a start-up software company is like. You will get a taste of the most important part of start-up life: sales.
 
You will learn a ton. You will be guided by an experienced sales manager who will coach you on best practices for generating software sales. You will use a combination of contacting targeted companies through phone, email and LinkedIn to reach decision makers. You will also directly witness how sales are closed and participate in closing sales calls with your manager. You may also have the opportunity to work on some media relations with your city's local newspapers and attend some local trade shows.

This is an incredible opportunity to learn about the specifics of sales within a start-up company without having to take substantial risk. The experience will also look excellent on a resume since you will be able to list the results of the work that you've performed. For example, ""Worked with potential clients through the entire sales cycle to close 18 deals, each worth at least $3,000 annually.""

There is no hourly or salary rate for this internship, but whenever allowed by Colleges and Universities, you will be paid a 10-20% commission on deals for which you are the primary contact. Your sales manager will help you close deals, and you will still receive the full 10% commission. Commissions are paid once the clients pay on a monthly basis at the 10% rate for up to 12 months as long as the client remains a customer.  (An example of a 10% commission on a 50-user license at $15/user:  50 x $15 x 10% commission = $75 paid to you per month as long as they're a paying customer up to 12 months. ($75/month x 12 months = $900 total at month 12.) As you can see from a typical deal size, there is significant potential for strong performers.

Here is our website:
www.BreadCrumbTracking.com

We provide software that allows managers of mobile work-forces (e.g. lawn cutters, personal support workers, air conditioner repair companies, etc.) to manage their mobile workers better. For example, at the start of the day a mobile worker can ""clock in"" to an app on his or her phone. When a new job comes up ""on the fly"" the job can be sent out from the manager's computer to the mobile worker's app, complete with all the job details. The mobile worker can then update the status of the job, communicate through notes with manager and send the manager or customer date and time-stamped pictures. At the end of the day, the mobile worker ""clocks out"" of the app for easy timekeeping. The manager no longer needs paper-based time sheets and can easily create hours worked reports for payroll. The manager can also see where the mobile worker has been throughout the day at-a-glance using our patent-pending communication tools. When mobile workers are ""clocked in"", a manager can view who is closest to enable better dispatching, saving time, gas and money.

You will work remotely or from home. There will be 2 or 3 Skype video or voice calls weekly. We use join.me to give demonstrations of the software to potential clients from the comfort of their own office and close more deals. We will set you up with the join.me software.

Your starting and ending dates are fairly flexible. We ask that you commit to at least 12 hours of work per week and ideally 20-40 hours per week. 

If you're interested, please reply with your resume and include the following:                                
-date you're available to start:          
-date you're looking to finish:     
-number of hours per week you're available:                      
-can you work remotely or from home with a reliable internet connection:
 
This is an unpaid internship except for commissions. Future employment is in no way guaranteed but we will definitely consider outstanding interns once we receive our Seed or Series A round of funding, likely in summer or autumn 2014."

Backstory: I have a bach in CS from a college so out-of-the-way some employers have actually thought I made it up. I graduated feeling weak in all aspects of software dev. GPA was just shy of 3.0, for those curious. 

My resume didn't look so great, either, because I (a) have no internships or other forms of experience and (b) no GitHub projects because I recently took down inferior code. Which was all of it.

So I've been working for the past 3/4 months to shore up weak spots and also submitting resumes just so I can gage my progress. I never expected to get the amount of responses I have (about 1 for every 12 apps, which isn't bad for a weak candidate), nor did I expect I'd do as decently as I have on interviews. In tech interviews, I have rarely solved a problem on my own, but often get it with a few hints from the interviewer and am at least able to communicate that there's *some* thought process going on. 

All this in consideration, you can imagine how gobsmacked I was when I got an offer for employment as a junior (0 - 2 yrs exp) RoR dev at a good-sized company. It's a decent offer for my area: 55K/yr, good health benefits, opportunities to work from home 1 - 3 times a week, etc. I'm not even sure how I got past my tech interview, because I did terribly on the brainteaser/logic puzzle stuff. The interviewer was able to talk me through the puzzles, but I didn't get the answers to any of them except one. I didn't do so great on the tech questions, either. I froze up on the BST questions and had to be walked through one of the linked list challenges. Did OK on most of the Ruby or RoR type questions. 

On the one hand, I really, really, *really* want this job. I feel like I could do it, so long as I keep studying during my free time.

On the other hand, I'm not sure I'm ready. It's easy to talk game. It's easy when somebody's there to hold your hand. It's not so easy when you're on your own.

I'm beginning to panic so hard I can't look at this objectively anymore. What do you guys think? Pass it up and do shitwork for a little while longer, take the risk, or what?"

I'm quite experienced with web development and programming in general, having worked with REST APIs, Unix, Front end development, databases, shell scripting, QA, writing page scrapers, agile processes, software/hardware integration, etc. Basically a well rounded intermediate level of knowledge, and I'm coding for 10+ hours daily, working on side projects on github, am working on open source projects and constantly gaining experience.

The issue is, I still live with my parents and they pay for almost everything of mine. I hate the dependance, living with them is making my life miserable, and I need to start earning my own money to move out, but it's difficult in my current situation.

Bottom line is I need to know how much experience I should have before looking into a paid full time job, and how much I should expect to make without a degree.

I would love some advice!

Anyway, here's the setup, 8 weeks of travel to teach week-long summer camp programs to high school students. There will be a supervisor along with around 7 interns at each camp. Each intern will get around 5 kids at each camp to lead directly and watch to make sure everyone's safe. Students will be staying in what are essentially dorms as well as the interns. But there will essentially be 24/7 interaction while at the camps.

Here are the potential problems:

1. Everyone in the program is going to be competing for a job with this company and while I want to maintain friendly and working relations with everyone, I also need to standout from pack. I also want to avoid being sucked into potential drama of the other interns.

2. I'm not entirely sure how to interact with who will be my boss. The boss is the person I want to impress but I want to make sure that my interactions with him come off as genuine as opposed to simply wanting a job. How do I work on building a relationship while performing my responsibilities to the best of my ability?

Are there any other points I should go into further detail on?

I'm open to other suggestions and ideas but the two points I listed are what I'm most curious about. Thanks in advanced for the feedback"

Although I look into studying computer science, I actually didn't grow up having this vision, and thus am very limited in my knowledge about the usual paths for kids that have always been interested in CS.

As of now, I thought it would be nice if I learn how to code a whole website by myself. I know that there are tons of materials out there online on HTML/CSS; however, I thought it would be nice if I can actually take a class on such topic, being supervised by someone. (Yep, I procrastinate a ton if I'm left to work by myself.) 

But apparently learning HTML/CSS isn't in the usual curriculum at engineering schools/for CS majors? For my school, all engineers start off the first year with an intro programming class; then CS people move on to higher level Data Structure stuff, and then onto all the branches of CS. I do not believe HTML/CSS fit in anywhere.

So I was wondering if CS people actually ever learn HTML/CSS? If you guys do, how?

[What is like having parents with money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0cc3c?context=5)|Someone else already asked a similar question.
[Is your sister single?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0bl3d?context=5)|No she isn't, not like you have a chance anyways XD.
[How do you know? Maybe he is a solid 7/10 with long dick.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0cgz4?context=5)|Because she is very picky. Her current boyfriend looks like Michelangelo chiseled him out of a single block of kick-ass-enite.
[How rich are your parents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0aqwq?context=5)|I actually don't know, and I don't really want to. My parents have never wanted my sister nor I to know much at all of what any of these trips cost or how much of a dent it put in their finances, but I could only guess. Great parenting, if you ask me. I'm always very grateful to have done the things I have.
[What are their occupations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0atly?context=5)|My mom is a farmer, and my dad is an engineer.
[That's an interesting combination.  What kind of farm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0lkyl?context=5)|An organic one! Mostly mushrooms, also some fruit trees. Not really anything big, just a lovely little place for my mom to practice her values of being eco-friendly. She got a degree in sustainable architecture and believes everything should be natural and organic. Not my cup of tea, but it makes her happy.
[How do you feel about people showing off with the places they have travelled to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0bup6?context=5)|When I was younger, I always tried to upstage people. I was a terrible braggart. But now, I usually call their bluff by asking them if they tried so-and-so restaurant while they were there.
[Why do u think their lying though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0lssf?context=5)|But here's the thing: if they are lying, then perhaps they learn a lesson in humility. If they aren't lying, then we just bonded over a shared, unique interest. So if someone claims to have been to, say, Positano (my favorite italian city), I might as well ask them if they won a prize at the shooting stall in the city (trick question, no matter what you do the nice old man will give you a stuffed animal and a cheap bottle of limoncello).
[You've fapped on all 7, haven't you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0avqa?context=5)|Whether I have or have not, that is irrelevant. All I can say is this: I wasn't standing on Antarctica for more than a few hours before returning to the boat.
[So you peed on antarctica? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0b5pd?context=5)|Nah, I had to hold it in. Antarctica actually has very strict bio-security measures. Had to wash all our clothing before getting on and off the ship. Not allowed to track foreign seeds or microbes on your boots or clothes, blah blah blah.
[That's pretty amazing.  The tempting question for most will probably be to ask is how did you afford to accomplish this, but frankly, I don't care.  I am more interested in what you have learned on your travels?  What have you taken away from seeing the world at such a young age?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0aqvv?context=5)|Well, one thing I've learned that a lot of people may say about a child's innocence being shattered by the cruelty of reality, especially in third-world countries where you'll get mugged and kidnapped right off the bat. But really, I think that's hogwash. A lot of times, some Turkish dude just genuinely wants to help the lost little white child find his parents.
[Anything else?  I'd like to hear what makes your experience unique from other rich kids (no offense meant, just being honest\).  Edit: wording, not here to offend OP.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0b31a?context=5)|Well, I know of some spoiled brats who are whisked off to Peru on daddy's private jet (I'm fine with flying coach, help my parents out however I can), only to sit in their hotel room, and watch 16 and pregnant. But of course, since we are in the sacred valley of Peru, they had to bring their own flat screen, satellite uplink, and DirecTV box with them. I mean, are you serious?! Get out there, the museums are incredible, the history is breathtaking, and you find some of the best food in these hole-in-the-wall cafes while running around town from monument to monument.
[I came to ask how Antarctica was, but you were there too. Damn.  I'll ask anyway, how was Antarctica? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0aos4?context=5)|Well even in summer it was cold (I had to take that picture quick), and one thing they don't tell you in Frozen Planet is that the whole continent smells absolutely awful. You can smell the penguin and seal dung from a mile away. But other than that, it was breathtakingly beautiful.
[Why so much hate for this kid? I don't understand.  Are you going to try to visit every country eventually? a week or so in each seems to be a very limited amount of time, even for a city with lots of history.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0lbnf?context=5)|Well like I said in another comment, I want to study abroad in college, the only reason I haven't spent more than a week or so in these destinations is because of my age and because they're usually during school holidays. And I think visiting every country is a tall order. I know someone who has done it, and it didn't seem easy. I think I'll just keep travelling to places I haven't been, and maybe someday I will have been to every country.
[How long do your trips usually last and what kinds of things have you been able to do?  Do you keep a travel blog?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0bckz?context=5)|The trips are usually a week to ten days, sometimes two weeks. I have done quite a lot of museum tours, and that's the bulk of it. However, I have gone parasailing in Bora Bora and Mexico, and Jet-skiing in Costa Rica. Unfortunately, I do not keep a travel blog.
[*The trips are usually a week to ten days, sometimes two weeks.*  That barely qualifies as traveling. It's really more like a vacation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0cqxa?context=5)|Basically, these are vacations. When I no longer have obligations for school or a summer job, then I will travel for longer or study abroad, I guarantee it.
[Do you believe it put you on the fast track through that rough patch that holds onto your early life? The one everyone douchey teenager carries with them(some into adulthood\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0b8un?context=5)|Well, I do think it helps a little with my rough patch, but not much. I still have that same old, ""With these grades you're never going to college"" talk with my dad, after which I rub my acceptance letter in his face. But I've actually never been a douchey teenager. I know a lot of kids that pick on foreign exchange students and get into shenanigans with the local police. I'm not one of them.
[He's rich, so he can pay for a wing on a dorm to get you in.  You're cool.  Fuck off all you want.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0dkrj?context=5)|But paying to get your son into college wouldn't be good parenting, would it? No, my dad has a firm resolution to let me pass or fail on my own merits. I've waded through my fair share of rejection letters.
[You got the safety net, you can call his bluff at any time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0e9ox?context=5)|I am already committed to my dream school, so no problem there. I'm very excited for the fall.
[Ugh, pure jealousy on this thread. It's not an attractive trait people. What was your favourite country OP? What did you think of Ireland and where abouts did you go there? What was the weirdest experience you had in any of the countries?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch14c4h?context=5)|I have to say my favorite was Japan. Everything there is ridiculously cool, from the museums to the vending machines. I thought Ireland was very beautiful and deserving of the title ""Emerald Isle,"" but I also wish I could have toured more castles. I guess I'd have to say my weirdest experience in any country would have to be when I was in Japan, I went to a flea market, and this really old man with barely any teeth (and didn't understand a word of English) poked my shoulder, pointed at a penis statue for sale, and then started laughing uncontrollably. I laughed with him. I guess penis sculpture is the universal symbol for humor?
[Why did you go to Antarctica twice in two months?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0fwrd?context=5)|Actually, it was right before and right after new years.
 |Edit: I'm sorry, someone pointed out that I didn't really answer the question: The ship I was on stopped in Antarctica right before New Years, then went to the Island of South Georgia (which has the largest King Penguin colony), then went to the Antarctic Peninsula again after New Years before heading back to Argentina.
[This is one interesting AMA. Thanks for sharing your travels with us. With all the travels you have made, are you willing, if ever, to travel to space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0e2qy?context=5)|Actually, I'm glad you mentioned it. My mom told me that apparently she was trying to convince my dad to buy me a ticket to space for my 25th birthday. Why my 25th? According to her, ""Because 25 is an age at which, should something go horribly wrong, you still lived a full life before dying horrifically.""
[Who is your favorite person from each continent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0f2xw?context=5)|Wow. Toughie. Okay, I'll give it a shot!
 |America: Elon Musk. A hilarious genius.
 |South America: Our guide when we were in the Amazon was a guy named Moses. Really sweet guy.
 |Europe: My aunt Shampsijoon. She lives in London.
 |Africa: We met a friend in Kenya named Taul. I hope he's doing well. Big sweetheart.
 |Asia: My friend Riku. Extremely creative, really funny.
 |Australia: My friend Nicola. Honestly, I've known her since I was a kid, and have always had a huge crush on her. I'm too puss to do anything about it, plus I hate long-distance relationships.
[What's your favourite Stones track?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0anwp?context=5)|I'd have to say a three-way tie between Dead Flowers, Jumpin' Jack Flash, and Sympathy for the Devil.
[Excellent taste young man!  Check out Townes Van Zandt's version of Dead Flowers.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0b8ou?context=5)|Thanks, kind stranger. Will do!
[If you had to make a list (3-20\) of places that EVERYONE should try to visit in their lifetime, what would it be, and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0h0n2?context=5)|Italy- Because food and beautiful coast lines.
 |Japan- Because great museums and interesting culture.
 |Peru- Because they have some of the most well-preserved pre-colonization structures I've seen.
 |Kenya (or other Savannah country)- Because everywhere looks like Lion King.
 |Egypt- Only if you're a serious history nerd. If you are, then you already dream of going here. Or China. China too.
[Thanks! This is exactly what I was looking for. Now I've got something to work towards :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0kutz?context=5)|Tokyo Castle (sometimes called Edo Museum)
 |Toyota Automobile Museum in Nagoya.
 |Nagoya Castle.
[How did you unlock Antarctica, what cheat code did you use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0cfmh?context=5)|I used the Konami code! With a little help from a tour company called Abercrombie &amp; Kent.
[Yeah, but have you been to every single state in the U.S. twice, the Grand Canyon, or even the 4-corners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0fy2z?context=5)|I've been to a few states. And actually. The for corners is on my bucket list.
 |*four.
[What was your favorite place? Where in the world do you most want to go? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0e2xi?context=5)|Well, no matter what, my favorite place will always be home. However, if I had to pick a place to retire, there's a small town called Positano on italy's Amalfi coast that would gain one more resident. The place that I most want to go right now is Japan. I've been there before, and I love it. Plus, I have a close friend who lives there, and I'd like to see him more often.
[As an avid photographer, I'd kill for those opportunities. Were you inspired in any artistic/spiritual way at any or all of these trips to influence your career choices? What do you plan on doing with your life now that you've done what the whole world dreams of doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0riz6?context=5)|Well these trips did inspire me to learn about a lot of different religions, but none of them really worked for me. However, a lot of these trips did become inspirations for some of my poetry. I'm awaiting response from a publisher. And as for career choice, I had a summer job at SpaceX and I loved it. I definitely want to work in the Aerospace Industry.
 |Edit: spelling.
[Interesting. I hope you get published; I'd love to read some of your work. Did you consider self publishing by making an eBook and getting it started on amazon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0wxda?context=5)|I considered it, but I don't have enough material for a booklet, I'm trying to get some published in a literary journal first.
[How old is your sister and is she single? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0cxcj?context=5)|She's taken.
[How exactly did you get your summer job at spaceX? Can you explain a bit about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch1b9uk?context=5)|Well my dad asked his friend at SpaceX to give me a job, and his friend said absolutely not, they don't hire highschoolers. My dad asked if I could at least be given a chance, and he said fine, we'll put him through the same interview as everyone else. No promises. So I went through the phone screening and the technical interview, which was perhaps the hardest thing in my life, and three weeks later I got a call with an official offer. I'm glad I aced AP Computer Science, otherwise I never would have made it through the interview. 
[Wow. Thats super cool. I am 16, so just under you. That is such an amazing experience! May I ask where you actually worked? (Im guessing somewhere in California or Texas.\) And also, what did you do every day when you went to work? It gonna look amazing on your resume! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch1earg?context=5)|Yeah, I worked at SpaceX's main production facility outside of Los Angeles. I was an applications developer intern, so I worked in Enterprise Information Systems. AKA I programmed in a cubicle from 9 to 6.
[What was in your opinion the most interesting and most different continent? Also, what did you think of Europe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch15vue?context=5)|As far as different goes, definitely Asia. Particularly in Japan, which I find the most interesting, everything is VERY different. For example, in Japan it is impolite to show your teeth, and that includes while laughing. So people generally don't laugh out loud, they just do a close-mouthed chuckle. As for Europe, I want to retire in Italy someday. The entire continent is absolutely beautiful, and the food is divine.
[Have you been to Brazil yet? If not, I highly recommend it. You must have learned a lot from your travels, What continent is your favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch1d4es?context=5)|Actually, the mother of my goddaughter is from San Paulo, so I'd love to go with her to Brazil! And I have to say North America is my favorite, because there's no better place than home, but Europe takes a close second.
[I wonder if this would affect your desire to become a go-getter? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0v2y6?context=5)|So do I, only time will tell! I plan on getting another summer job in June.
[Which was your favorite and least favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch17a3e?context=5)|My favorite was Japan, my least favorite would have to be anywhere in the Amazon. Not trying to offend anyone, but to me it is just a huge forest of NOPE.
[What's it like being that privileged? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0k6fg?context=5)|For the most part, I feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude for my dad's hard work. When I was little, we were just a middle-class family. All of this was the result of my dad working hard and getting the promotion he deserved. On the other hand, I feel out of touch with a lot of people, and I find myself frequently wishing that many others have seen the amazing things that I have.
[Have you dealt with any racism (positive or negative\) in countries you visited?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch1r6hn?context=5)|Actually, in China they have a somewhat derogatory term basically meaning ""whitie,"" which we were called, but nothing very major.
[Lao wai?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch28kqf?context=5)|Possibly. That was a few years ago, hard to remember.
[Have you been to any other planets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch321bq?context=5)|Yes, I went golfing in the Vallis Marineris a few weeks ago.
[You may have been in several continents...but one day I will be in your sister.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0fvvr?context=5)|OP will not deliver.

Plus, my current passport doesn't have all seven continents. I've gone through four or five passports already.
[Dude, your passport only has info on the first page. You should have pages and pages of cool stamps that you already show off anyways. Trust me I know cuz I do the same thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0io3u?context=5)|I know passports only have information on the first page, it's just that I still don't feel comfortable posting pictures. You have to remember that I'm still seventeen, and that my passport still belongs to my parents. At the suggestion of some other comments, in the future I'm going to create a travel blog and I will definitely post stamps. But that won't be for a few months.
[That's awesome dude. I live in the Caribbean. Never been outside of it. Traveled to many other Caribbean islands. I like Japan. Maybe one day I will go there. Keep posting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0ukg7?context=5)|I would definitely recommend Japan, but I am a little biased.

I'm not doing this to brag or feel smug, I'm doing this because I was very blessed to be born into a well-off family and very thankful to have the experiences I have had, and it's not fair that others can't have the same experience that I have had. So I am trying to give them as much information as I can about what it is like. That is the purpose of this AMA. Not to be smug, not to feel grand, but to try and share this amazing experience with those who, unfortunately, will never have the experience I have had, which is everyone, because every experience is unique and individual.

23uf3y,11,2014-04-24,Want to make the most of your summer? Try MOOCs.,Ktk_,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/23uf3y/want_to_make_the_most_of_your_summer_try_moocs/,"MOOC: Massively Open Online Course. These have been getting popular these days. KhanAcademy and MIT OCW might be good examples. But for structured courses, check out Coursera and EDX. 

Like MIT OCW, we get professors from top universities giving video lectures for free. The courses are fairly widespread too. We aren't talking Algebra I here, we're looking at ALGORITHMS, OCHEM, SIGNAL PROCESSING, you get the idea. Serious business courses from big name schools.
https://www.coursera.org/courses
https://www.edx.org/course-list

While these are unreasonable to handle on a full engineering + work + EC + research load (Been there, it sucks)... Summer is the perfect time to try one of these out. Maybe you couldn't take that one class because of a conflict. 

For most courses, you get the same passing certificate whether you get a 70% or a 90%, so no stress either, really. Pass/Fail for most of these, though some provide distinguishments, and some have ""verified certification"" which means you pay, but by no means is that required. I mean there's no Coursera-GPA that I know of. 

On your resume, taking MOOC courses can show that you have a real interest in the field. If you have an internship, great. That's from 9-5. These courses take from 5 to 10 hours a week... But you're an engineering student, so let's shave that by 15% or so, shall we? ;)

I don't see either of those listed as RESOURCES on the sidebar on this forum. Probably because the most of the courses are actually based on a timeline, though some are reference courses (Coursera has a Database course by Stanford that's self-study material, no certification - I still found it tremendously helpful)

Ofc, I'm sure many people in engineering have heard of MOOCs recently, but for those who don't... Now you know. Go and learn stuff!"

[What's the most dangerous situation you've been in while working?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0i1pr?context=5)|Almost got used as a getaway driver, at 5 AM. Dude was approaching my car which was occupied with a large kitchen knife hidden behind his back. I saw the knife (got pretty frightened), made a left at a red light and saw about 10 squad cars parked on that block with their lights on. Scariest thing I've experienced. 
[Now that NYC cabs accept credit/debt card, which form of payment is better for the driver? Should I pay my fare by credit card and leave a cash tip or also add the tip the card charge. What would be a good tip?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0ijwc?context=5)|To me it doesn't matter because I drive a garage car and I just get all my money at the end of the day. However, I think people who own and operate a weekly medallion prefer cash because they don't get their credit card balance till the end of the week. Just ask the cabbie, we all have our preferences. I prefer credit.
[Ever drive any celebrities? Accept any crazy forms of payment? (Cash or stash, bjs etc? \)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0hvck?context=5)|I once dropped off an academy award winning director on the upper east side. Didn't even know who he was until the next passenger told me so (who was apparently the directors architect). Sorry, but I forgot his name, the dude looked like he was in his late 70's or 80's.
[Answer his other question too haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0k60h?context=5)|Haha, sorry but I can't be answering questions that might get me in trouble. 
[What do you think about McDonald's changing the numbers of their food? Ive been in the same situation 3 different times where I try to order mcnuggets and I get some kind of ground beef sandwich. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0ibsr?context=5)|Haha, I don't go to McDonalds enough to notice a difference. I don't recommend you do either!
[Any weird passenger stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0jlez?context=5)|Not weird, but this dude pissed me off so I'l tell this story. Basically I just started my shift and I see a lot of cabbies passing by this black guy. So I'm like, you know what, I'm not gonna be like a typical cabbie and not pick a black guy (I'm all for equality). So I stopped by to pick him up. The dude wants to go to Brooklyn, so I'm omw. So he starts to tell me that he had to call his uncle who will meet me there to help pay his fare. He wanted to use my phone. I felt a little sketchy but I let hi use it and tells me his uncle will be there when I arrive and will pay me and gives my phone back... I get to the destination and his uncle is nowhere to be seen.  He uses my phone and calls his uncle again and again and it's the same story, he'll be here any minute now. So About 45 mins. pass and I'm just annoyed so I tell the dude to leave after he calls his uncle for like the 5th time. So I'm like alirght, you don't gotta pay me just leave. So he's sitting in my back seat holding onto my phone looking at it all thugish with his doo-rag and all, looking like he's thinking about stealing my phone. So I'm like, hey man gimmie my phone, don't even think about it. He's just setting there looking at it... After a minute or two, he hands me my phone says ""aight"" and leaves. I was pretty new during that time, but I was pretty let down by that. And I kind of understand why a lot of black  people are not picked up by cabbies. But I kind of understood the cabbie mentality that night.
[Damn that sucks. What do you do now when you see similar guys looking for a ride? Wouldn't blame you if you decided to avoid sketchy looking people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0z86e?context=5)|I'd ask what's up before I unlock my door.
[How do you feel about Uber's services, including UberX and other ridesharing companies in NYC and beyond? Or is that not of your concern since you are young and a student and you probably are not going to be a career cabbie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0iq2p?context=5)|I'm actually an uber driver as well. I like uber, it helps me make extra money. I think it's useful and safe as well as forward thinking. Why not utilize technology that makes our lives easier? It doesn't hurt the cabbie, if anything it helps us. I feel like drivers who use uber make more a little more money, especially at down time. Every driver should have uber but being that cabbies are mostly foreign, I feel like a lot of them don't know about it or don't want to learn about it. Uber doesn't really change the game too much, basically instead of calling a car service, you're just tapping one on your smart phone.
[Do you have a phd? I read that a portion of taxi men in NYC have them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0i2g7?context=5)|No, I'm an undergrad student working on a computer science degree. I do meet a of cabbies who have lots of degrees but drive cab because of circumstantial situations in their life.
[In NYC you can make better money working part time as a Software Engineer intern -- if you are any good at programming.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch1bs31?context=5)|Not at that level yet.
[You'd be surprised how little you need to know to get a job in software that pays better than a cab driver. I am not saying 6 figures, but in the 40's or 50's possibly. Getting that experience early is what will help propel you into the 6 figure job offer after graduation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch2mger?context=5)|Do you any suggestions as to paces I can look for work?
[Have you ever been in a cabbie battle?  I was an 18 year old student in DC heading to Georgetown on a quiet weeknight around 10pm.  All of a sudden my cab, that I am a paying customer in, doesn't like the other cab that just passes by.  We are driving through fairly residential areas but down a main street.  They decide to do, what I can only describe as ""battle dancing"" with their Detroit's finest high mileage former police cars.  It was pure insanity. He was swearing in some foreign tongue and driving as close as he could on the other guys ass and then getting even more pissed when the guy in front slams on his breaks.  They kept swerving faster and pretending they were going to hit each other.  They kept speeding up to 50 mph and then slamming hard, almost hitting each other at least three times. I nearly wet myself and barely had enough lung capacity to yell at him as it was hard to take in a deep breath. It eventually ended with a good flip of the bird and the other guy turning left quickly.  Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0kb1p?context=5)|Hahahaha, sounds epic! I have no idea why though. 
[How hard is it to become a driver, and what is the pay like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0ibc5?context=5)|It's not very hard if you know the city well, city as in Manhattan. It's a basic 50 question multiple choice test. The pay is about $200 per shift, but it varies a lot, more or less.
[Do a portion of your earnings go to the cab company, or do you pay some sort of daily/weekly/monthly fee for using the car?  Who pays for the gas?  What if you were to be involved in an accident?  Do you have a ""favorite"" NYC location ie a club, bar, or restaurant that generates more profit than other locations?  Who's the weirdest, strangest, or funniest passenger you've experienced?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0jwmd?context=5)|I pay a daily lease fee every time I do shift. It's about 120$ but can be more depending on the day/shift. I pay for the gas as well. I am responsible for any accidents or damages. I like to work on the lower west side the most. And Williamsburg if I'm outside of Manhattan. I've had lots of passengers that are memorable, read through the AMA, I shared some stories.
[The end. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0jwmd?context=5)|EDIT: I forgot to add that you can also lease it weekly and it costs less but you are always responsible for that amount regardless of whether you work or not.
[Real question. Whats the craziest shit out of any cab driver story that you've heard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0jaz7?context=5)|Cabbies dying in accidents. This one guy in my garage got into an accident and refused to go to the hospital to get checked cuz he felt fine. Next day, he collapsed on the train and died (internal bleeding). Crazy stuff!
[Why did you decide to become a taxi driver? Were you inspired by R. De Niro?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0i3kg?context=5)|I just wanted to learn the city and earn a little extra cash to support myself. Ironically, I've never even seen that movie. Maybe one of these days. Also, as a college student I make a lot more than my friends who are working retail for much longer hours. 
[You should watch it sometime. Even if just for the view of 1970s NYC. Great movie.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0xkvh?context=5)|Watched it last night, awesome movie. On my favorites list.
[Have people actually had sex in the cab, or have you heard of stories? I've heard several times of people doing it in a cab but never et understood how the driver would let thay fly. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0izea?context=5)|Haha, I've heard other cabbies tell lots of stories about that kinda stuff. Yeah it does happen. I've never had that happen in my cab, though people probably have come close. I've definitely heard some moans here and there.
[Most tips u got? how good are ur driving skills? how to become a cab driver in nyc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0hrw1?context=5)|Ahh, the most tips total for a day: $120. for a single trip: 18.
 |But percentage wise, I once got a 15 dollar tip on a 6 dollar fare, which is almost 300%. So technically that's the most.
 |Also, I think my driving skills are excellent. I get the ""good driver"" compliment all the time. :]
[How the fuck? The guy was like ""oh my fare is $6? Well I only have a twenty one dollar bill keep the change""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0uxn4?context=5)|Yup, it was a tourist. Just gave me a 20 and hopped out, haha.
[Whoa, that doesn't sound at all right. How long are your shifts? I made 400 dollars once after gas and lease and I live in a shitty little town in the middle of no where.  EDIT: I can't read apparently.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0lnpj?context=5)|The question asked for tips.
[Have you ever attempted to flirt with/date one of your passengers? And if so, did it work?  That's how my husband and I met.. He was my cab driver. Still not sure how he pulled that one off, but I'm glad he did!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0ru79?context=5)|I do get a lot of super-pretty passengers. I try to keep it professional though. Sometimes girls will flirt but I keep it casual and don't try to escalate it. I just turn it into chit-chat. Never tried to date one of my passengers before, though I've been very tempted to ask a few times, haha.
[How is the pay? also, have you ever gotten into a serious fight with a customer? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0icb1?context=5)|Nothing super serious, in my time so far, I've only had one passenger who didn't pay me (long story).
[What do you feel about all the tourists in NYC? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0j2bl?context=5)|Well, I love nyc, I believe it's the greatest city in the world. So of course we'll have tourist, it's expected. I love showing tourist some new things or telling them facts they never knew. I like adding to their ny experience. Though a lot of tourist don't know that it's polite to tip cabbies in NYC. I learn some things from them as well, about where they are from and stuff.
[Thanks. We definitely tipped when I was there :\) I did have a really bad experience with a cabbie who seemed to be drunk/high and kept mumbling to himself and driving rather recklessly, and we were too afraid to say anything about it. He also dropped us at a random spot and told us to get out. Are these cabbies common?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0j9vd?context=5)|A lot of drivers are on their bluetooth, so he may have been on the phone (that's illegal). Don't be afraid to say anything. If you feel uncomfortable, chances are the cabbie is not doing a god job.
[What was the most meaningful conversation you had with a customer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0o4v5?context=5)|I had a conversation about love with this passenger once. We shared similar views, and being that I'm young, he gave me some good advice. For example, to be patient with it.
[Where do you usually pick up people? Where are the crowded places usually? - What's the best thing about your job and what's the worst? - Do you make enough to support yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0oy8p?context=5)|95% of passengers I pick up are within Manhattan, rest are mostly in Brooklyn, sometimes queens and of course airports. I like to roam mid-town and the lower west side a lot.
 |Best thing is the freedom and flexible schedule, worst thing is sitting in traffic, especially on a hot day.
 |Yes, I make more than enough to support myself.
[Do you enjoy making small talk with your passengers? Or would you prefer for them to keep quiet so you can just drive?  I've found that some cab drivers like to talk and others will be completely silent.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0rnvd?context=5)|Yes, I usually try to gauge it out. If a passenger seems to be trying to spark a convo, I will go with it. After all, it's a 12 hour shift, some socializing is needed. Plus, that usually helps me get a better tip. I think a lot of cabbies don't like to talk because of the language barrier. I met a lot of cabbies who barely speak English. They can answer basic questions, but not have full casual conversations. 
[In your opinion, what is the best thing about working at NYC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0kk5e?context=5)|I love the view when the sun is rising from the Brooklyn bridge. The tall buildings in Manhattan. The the hipsters and Williamsburg. The little traffic in Queens. The food all over the city from all over the world. The interesting people. Those are just some of my favorite things.
[Aren't NYC taxi medallions crazy expensive?  How did you afford one at age 22?  Or are they a thing of the past?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0kt3y?context=5)|I just lease one every time I drive, from the garage I work at. Yes they are worth close to a million dollars.
[*I just lease one every time I drive, from the garage I work at. Yes they are worth close to a million dollars.*  I understand that these medallions are precious, so if you were to lease it a day/night shift, and you earn an average $160 after your shift(s\) on a day, then how much did you pay for the lease?  In short: How much do you pay for each lease?  Do you pay for the gas after a shift?  Edit: $160 a day, how many leases? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0uvws?context=5)|Lease a day ranges from 115-140 a day, depending on the shift (ex. Sat. night is the busiest). Yes, I pay for my own gas as well. Basically the way I usually look at it is, anything above $200 I make, is mine to keep.
[How long did it take you to learn the ins and outs of the city? You are incredibly young for a cabbie-- speaking as guy that starting cabbing himself at 23.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0smzt?context=5)|Took me about 5 or 6 months to really get the hang of it. Yes, I do get the ""young for a cabbie"" comment a lot, but I love driving. I think it's fun, it's a like a video game to me. Google maps helps a lot, not only with navigation but with traffic as well. And WAZE app.
[What do you think about NYC bike messengers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0nll1?context=5)|Sorry late response but I missed this. I've had a couple of run ins with bikers. They usually know what they're doing though so it rarely interferes with my driving. What's a lot worse along the same lines is the trike tourist rikshaws. Those guys are sooo annoying. They take up a whole lane and cause so much traffic. A lot of them are always on their phones too, so dangerous.
[Does it pay well? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0k503?context=5)|It pays decent, but I wouldn't recommend it as a career (most cabbies won't).
[Ever had a drunk girl in your cab who didn't have any cash at the end of the ride? Did she offer anything, and if yes/no, how do you handle a situation where a client doesn't have the money with him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0vp43?context=5)|Been driving for a year and half, only had one passenger who didn't pay me (I posted the story on another question). Usually if passengers don't have money, they let me know how much they have before I start the ride or will negotiate with me before they get in the cab. I've taken people to LI before who didn't have enough money, because I felt bad they would be drunk and stranded in NYC. Especially if they seem like they're my age.
[Do you like the way NYC does it where you are required to drive a yellow cab with the same markings as every other cab in the city, or would you prefer to work somewhere like Chicago where can drivers get more freedom to drive for different cab companies and have different cars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0szh0?context=5)|NYC also has different companies and freedom of choice. Driving a yellow cab is one of those choices. There a lot of other companies you can drive for with a TLC license. A lot of them are geared towards certain groups of people, races, class, etc.
[Do you ignore traffic laws like every New Yorker would prefer you to do? If not, why not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0mujw?context=5)|I follow all traffic laws to the best of my abilities. If i don't, I can get a ticket with a fine equivalent to what I make in a day. If a passenger says they are in a rush, I do drive more aggressive though, still within the rules.
[What's the worst road-rage incident you had? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0vm88?context=5)|Haha, there is a funny story with this. I seen this one dudette on the highway who was trying to get ahead of the car in front of her, who had a much bigger car. She was tailgating the guy and the guy in front of her had to brake aggressively at one point. The little car front ended the car in front of her. Ironically, the guy with the bigger car didn't feel a thing. He just drove off. However, the little car had a bent hood. So she put on her four way flashers and pulled over on the highway and got out of her car looking like all ""wtf"". The car she hit had minor damage, but he drove off without even notice. I was behind watching the whole thing and the funny thing is I could see the whole thing coming from a mile away, haha. In a way it was a hit and run, but the car that got hit is the one that run. She is lucky he didn't notice, because she would have had to pay for his damages. 
[What is the weirdest thing someone has left in a cab?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0iqv6?context=5)|Nothing too unusual, mostly just cell phones and perfume. 
[What do you do with cell phones and other expensive electronics? Do they go to some sort of lost and found? Is it pretty common for cabbies to just take them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0v1b3?context=5)|A lot of cabbies do just take them, yes. The law is to bring it to the nearest police precinct to where it was found.
[Do you charge people fares to return their phone to them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0v4ir?context=5)|I've returned a few phones. I wish people were more thankful. A lot of them don't even say thank you. -__- So from now on, I will bring it to the nearest police station like I'm supposed to.  
[Perfume seems a bit unusual. How many women are just walking around w/ a bottle of the stuff?! I just have a small rollerball in my purse.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch1dep5?context=5)|No idea, I found 2 bottles!
[How much to take me from DUMBO to that night club no one has heard about yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0jhvl?context=5)|No idea, but if the club is in the city, more than $10!
[What would be your advice for someone from Florida moving to NYC and getting a job as a cab driver to start off?  22 year old as well.  Do you think the money would enough to live off of for a time?  Thanks!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0ue5m?context=5)|Definitely enough money. Just use google maps if you need help with directions, best advice I could give. Also, sleep enough.
[Thanks man!  Any advice would be helpful.  How exactly does one qualify for a cab driving position?  Is it hard to get into?  This is an option I had not previously considered for getting a solid paycheck when I come up there.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0xn7n?context=5)|Just go on the tlc website and take it from there.
[What is your ethnicity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0ma9i?context=5)|I'm from Bangladesh.
[What is your average fare and average tip?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0ik2u?context=5)|An average is hard to give because fares vary so much, but probably around 12 dollars per ride.
[Is a good tip same as in a restaurant like 15% is ok but, 20% is nice? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0s8ox?context=5)|Yes. 25% or 30% is even better. ;]
[How annoying is it when people ask where you're from and all that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0m4hr?context=5)|Haha, it's not THAT annoying. After all, NY is diverse. It's a good conversation starter.
[What's the nastiest thing you've had to deal with? (ie puke, drunks, human remains...\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0jktd?context=5)|Thankfully nothing too crazy. Just had this one dude hurl out the window once. Had to stop by at the gas station and lean the back door a bit. :]
[Do you carry anything for self defense?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0tasj?context=5)|No, but I should now that you mention it. I always felt that the partition is enough protection, unless someone sits in the front... 
[What is the reason for an on duty cabbie on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to pull over to pick me up as a fare only to drive off when I tell him I am going to Penn Station. This has happened to me twice and I can't figure out why.  By the way every time this happens I report it to the TLC and the cabbie accepts the large refusal of fare fine.  I don't get it.

I'm going to introduce my situation before my question.

I'm very interested in Theoretical Computer Science (Computabiliy and Complexity, and more things).

I would like to do a doctorate to be a college professor. I love it.

To do a doctorate degree, there are two things I've to have:

- Bachelor's degree
- Master's degree

Next year, I'll do a Master's degree about TCS. It seems awesome!

I've to present my Final Degree Project this year (june), and one or two presentations, and I would like to research more about my field.

I've been three years in a department as intern (I think it's not the same here than in others countries, I'm not paid, and it's not for an specific time)

To here, all is ok.

Here's the but:

I'm doing an internship (I don't know if it's a internship. Here, is called ""beca"". It's like ""prácticas en empresas"" (""company practices""), but remunerated, not so much. Please, tell me how it's called). The internship is about programming protocols, a little of SE...

The internship finishes at the end of this month. But I think they're going to hire me, so this would be a real job.

The job is full-time, can't be partial, and I come home too late, so I can't do so much about my project or about research...

So, here's the question: do I apply to the job? Or leave it and finish my degree and get free time to study more about my field?

Thank you very much.

Regards"

23wcz9,1,2014-04-24,How did my interview go?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/23wcz9/how_did_my_interview_go/,"I just had an interview for dream internship, literally. I've been working towards working for this company since I was 13 years old (23 now). I've moved countries just so I could work there and have carefully fashioned my education and work experience to meet their every need. 

It was a phone interview as I currently live about 1,000 miles away. But, here's the thing — it was pretty short. 

Here are the pros and cons I could pick out:

CONS: They asked me questions for maybe about 13 minutes before asking if I had any questions for them, which I did
- They did ask my availability after I asked when the internship would start, but it seemed like an afterthought 
-They didn't really talk too much about the position until I asked at the end
- Mostly just asked me questions based on my resume (what was your favorite part of that job, what did you do, what are your goals this summer) 
- I had references listed on my resume but wanted to add a few cell phones. They didn't ask about references (maybe just because I had them listed) but when I offered up cell numbers they didn't seemed pretty neutral about writing them down, not ""oh that's great. thanks, we'll be in touch."" 

PROS:
- They said I had all the qualifications for the position
- Went on for a few minutes about how impressed they were that I was able to track down the lead interviewers email since it's not listed anywhere and doesn't follow the usual format of the company (this is for an editorial research position, so it's exactly the kind of stuff you have to do). 
- They seemed to like my answers and laughed a bit. 
- Found common ground over some mutual interests in the industry
- Said they'd be letting candidates know in the next few days after I asked, but it kind of a neutral tone I guess? 
- They asked if I had applied for any other internships at the company, and i said not yet because they hadn't been posted. 

I guess overall my feeling was that it felt like a formality. I just can't decide if it's because they want to offer it to me, or because they've chosen someone else. The company is known a little bit for its nepotism for internships, so that concerns me. Otherwise I feel like I do have all the qualifications needed for the position. 

Thoughts?"

That was a few days ago. I dont think I have the will to type properly right now, so please just bear with me. sorry if i am all over the place, i cant really think properly

im 17 years old. I am an atheist. tomorrow is friday, when i usually spend the night at my pretty much perfect girlfriends house, although her family is a bit much to handle at times. I am apparently incredibly smart. People have high expectations for me. My principals want me to go into nano technology, but i have no intentions on doing that. i am also the tech geek in my school, i build computers and modify smartphones. I want to drop out of school. I want to get out of my town. i want to put a bullet in my head

I was raised somewhat normally besides my dad having a very open opinion about people of the opposite races, just like his father. in about kindergarten or first grade, my sister touched me and made me touch her. she is 6 years older than i am. she told me to play ""mummy"". a game where one person controls your whole body and you cant move. I didnt think anything about it. i actually realized it at about age 15 when i remembered it and thought about it a bit more. granted, it was a one time thing, it still hurts me. 

when i was 7 years old, i made a friend who lived in my neighborhood. he skated and got me into it. he pretty much convinced me to do bad shit all day, and it was fun. When I was 8, he started to grab on me and it eventually escalated to anal rape. this went on almost every day until i was 11 and he moved to the next state over.  from that, i now have severe PTSD, OCD, anxiety, severe depression, mild paranoia and bipolar disorder. Along with this, I also have ADD and ADHD. i never told anyone because he said he would rape my sister and kill my dog. i should have told from the first touch, but i know now that my 17 year old mind wasnt the same as my 8, 9, 10, and 11 year old mind.

during (9 years old was the beginning of it) and after that i suffered sexual, physical, and verbal abuse from my racist, alcoholic, and overly old fashioned father (he is 60 years old as of January) and from my alcoholic narcissistic super religious mother. When i would try to vent to my sister, she said that since she never got any of that, that i must be doing something awful to them to deserve it. *i was being fucking raped to protect you, and oh how badly i wanted to tell you so you would help me, but instead you told me to stop complaining about abused* 

i dont have the will to go into details about how much my sister was preferred over me, but i will give a glimpse of it. my parents took money from me to give to her when i was younger, she always got new clothes, and anything she asked for, she got. my parents paid for her college and her sorority stuff, along with her *house* in her college town. she didnt get a job in college, but out of fucking nowhere now works for a very esteemed place in nashville, where they illegally hired her. something about not being able to have an intern after they graduate college and keeping her anyway, then eventually she was hired because they were warned of what they were doing. she also has a fiance that is loaded. even before that, she babysat for some very famous people and made about a $800 a week, which didnt include the free trips to new york, hawaii, and a few other places, just to babysit. she was paid during the trips, too. they give her shoes that cost over a thousand fucking dollars in the amount that requires a ***garbage bag to carry them***. she has so much money it is almost funny. almost. meanwhile my parents still pay for her new iphone every year, her phone bill, her car insurance, BOUGHT her a new car for a second time, and constantly pay for her car to be fixed after frequent car accidents. my family spends money on her that we dont fucking have, and meanwhile, i ask for $10 to buy a pair of headphones, and they tell me that i ask for too much and that they dont think they should be funding things related to computers, since ""technology will all fail someday"". they constantly guilt me for paying for the electricity and water bill to me saying that i am making it go up with my tv going and my computer on and showering too long (my showers take about 6-8 minutes, 10 tops, 15 if I am crying, but that is when they arent home). I forgot to throw this in, but my parents paid for my sisters private school education and I went to public school and have to pay for my own college. my parents treat me like shit and they will never in their life admit it.

I did end up going to private school in 5th and 6th grade, because my dad thought there were ""too many niggers now at that damn new public school!"". I was bullied furiously, and eventually tried to hang myself. I was in 6th grade. I tied a backpack through the hinges on my closet door and looped around the other strap and... hung there. i kicked and tried to use my feet, but i just couldnt move, and it hurt so much, i wanted it to stop. I was eventually caught in the midst of it by my parents and the rest was sort of a blur. no hugging and saying they are sorry, just sobs of ""how can you do this to me"" and such. I started therapy the following months. During the first few sessions, i talked about my molestation and eventually, the therapist only wanted to talk about my sister. not in a therapeutic way, but in a normal type of conversation. even a therapist wouldnt listen and didnt care about me. I eventually stopped going because it was making it worse. I told my parents i was better and since my dad thinks therapy is liberal propaganda (i shit you not), so i eventually fell into a deeper depression. people at my school said i was gay, made fun of me for being raped, told people i worshiped the devil (this started when i wore a guns n roses tshoirt that had their heads on the cross. they had never heard of GNR so they assumed the worst they could) and eventually, the teachers started hating me, since they all thought that i was a gay satanist, *in 6th fucking grade*. I left for public school the next year. i became a huge bully because i was starting my reputation over. i was a swimmer, a golfer, and was pretty good at soccer, plus i would occasionally wear nice clothes that i would beg my parents for. I didnt care if they guilted me, i couldnt go back to being bulllied. I was a selfish fuck and i hate my 7th and 8th grade self. 

going into freshman year, i became addicted to k2, a synthetic form of weed. i smoked all day and it really fucked me up, but drugs made me feel better so i decided to keep doing them. i was beginning to lose my religion. that also really fucked with my head. i was still very suicidal, but i was starting to gain a real sense of my real self once i realized that being racist is wrong, that my religion was a lie, and that being a radical conservative didnt give me any type of moral high-ground over anyone. well, later into the year, i was getting close to going to state for swimming. i already went as an 8th grader and was killing it as a freshman. if you swim, i was doing a 23.6 in my 50 free as a freshman and murdering in the 200 IM. i was busted for selling spice about 2 weeks before regionals and expelled from school, and sent to alternative schooling for 14 weeks. i was heavily dependent on my current girlfriend who also treated me pretty terribly, but i took it because i was desperate. anyway, a few days after my arrest, my parents found out that i knew where the gun was in my house and planned on using it within the week. they sent me to a mental health center for drug addicts and people who are suicidal. i spent a week there, since i am manipulative and, like i said, smart. I hated it there, but the food was good i guess. i got out to find that i was now single. my world was turned upside down. i didnt know what to do. i was banned from the internet since i mentioned visiting 4chan frequently and reddit occasionally to my therapist in there, and unfortunately enough for me, she got on 4chan, and went to /b/, which is what i told her i usually go on to vent about suicide and whatnot. she thought it was a nice little internet chat group i assume, but instead found pretty much everything you would expect. so, now that my mind number was gone, i was completely out of ideas, and back to being as suicidal as ever. I secretly dated the girl for about a year and eventually, her parents said i could date her again. shortly after, her feminist friends said that i control her by not letting her go to parties with guys she flirts with. They spun it as ""HE TELLS HER SHE ISNT ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY FRIENDS AND ALWAYS YELLS AT HER AND I THINK HE HIT HER TOO!!!"" I wake up one morning to the sound of my mother calling me in. she said ""that was Mr. ____, he said you put his daughter on pills?"" i had NO fucking idea what she was talking about. apparently, his daughters friends spun it that she needed sleeping pills because i stress her out too much. that was not the case at all, but she lied because she was caught in a lie with her friends. I tried to overdose, but just seized up and vomited until the morning. that was my second suicide attempt, and that was as a sophomore.

I cant take much more typing... ive been typing this for about an hour and a half, with crying and smoke breaks here and there. I am going to summarize quickly on what has happened recently, and if someone needs me to elaborate further then i will. I eventually couldnt stand people and my disorders had gotten worse exponentially, making normal school nearly impossible. i applied for another form of schooling where i could be alone and work at my own pace, and was told that worst case scenario, i will be gone by the middle of the third 9 weeks, this was said to me at the end of the 2nd 9 weeks. I am now told, at the beginning of the 4th 9 weeks, that i will not go this year. i am failing all of my classes besides histoy. I lost my car due to awful grades. i had awful grades because i was told im in a ""transitional period between this school and the self paced school"" and that my classes would start over. I now have about 400 missing assignments that i simply cannot make up. i now will have to go to summer school, and will not get my car back until december. the school ***fucking LIED TO ME AND FUCKED ME OVER***. The only thing i was fucking looking forward to was having a summer free of school stress and people constantly bothering my disorders. here is the thing though, i was put as a low priority because i am smart, and they wanted people at the school who were stupid to get in first due to them being a higher threat of dropping out. 

________________________________________________________

At this point, i am willing to commit suicide because i know it will not hurt. I will not go to hell, i will just feel the way i did before i was born, nothing. I only started feeling this way once i realized how little goes right in my life. people keep telling me that it only goes up from here, and then my life proves them wrong. I dont want to feel pain anymore. i dont deserve it. i knew i would probably die from suicide, but... i didnt think this early. im not ready yet, but i am getting more comfortable with the idea with every day i have to endure. I not only have the means to do it, but now i have the will. i am waiting this week out and will go back to the mental place to try and get through it, but i doubt it will work. if it doesnt work (although i will give it an honest shot) then i will do it, and i wont hurt anymore... Sorry for the wall of text... It has over 11600 characters, so its okay if you didnt read it all. soon i will be dead, and nobody will have to read another wall of text of my life again. "

Is this like a restaurant or something?""",wit3tyg3r,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/23xfbf/menu_is_this_like_a_restaurant_or_something/,"Hello TFTS! I've been a long time lurker of this sub, but I wanted to share an experience I've had from long ago. This will be a long one.
***
  
**A Bit of Background**  
  
Many years ago, while I was in high school, I had the opportunity of having an internship with a private web development company (We'll call them SomeWebDesignCo) that did web design and development for small/private businesses and some personal sites as well. In fact, they have a group of high school interns that sort of run a small company of their own under the supervision of SomeWebDesignCo.  
  
The opportunity is great because high school students get to build skills and experiences with real-world clients. I was brought onto the team about a year after SomeWebDesignCo started the high school internships. I was the lead web designer for the high school group because of my experience with PhotoShop and frontend development (in fact, my digital art teacher was the one who referred me).  
  
As the web designer, my primary task was obviously doing web design. My secondary task was to be the main contact for the clients. Most of our clients were very tech illiterate so it was my job to ensure that the client got a site that looked like what they wanted and to ensure that the developers developed a site that functioned like the client wanted. I was, in other words, the middle man when it came to communicating the clients' needs to the developers.
***
  
*(Remember that everyone involved in this story is a high school student, except for the clients. Also, I will occasionally refer to myself as either Me or $OP throughout the story's dialog)*  
  
I sat at my desk staring anxiously at the clock.  
  
My Physics teacher was lecturing about centripetal force, but I was ready to leave. I had an important kickoff meeting that day. I would be meeting with a new client, which meant a new site to design.  
  
I always enjoyed getting a new project at work.  
  
This one in particular was going to be a site for an African orphanage and adoption center. I was pretty excited with the idea that I would be involved with something that promoted such a noble cause. This was probably going to be our biggest project yet!
  
*BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP*  
  
My school's digital alternative to a bell finally 'rang'. School was over. I buttoned the top button of my dress shirt, tightened my necktie, said my goodbyes to my friends, and walked at a brisk pace to my car.  
  
~ ~ ~  
  
I arrived at work, thankful that there was no traffic on the way. SomeWebDesignCo was located in a busy part of town due to the high number of business buildings, community colleges, restaurants, hospitals, and shopping centers. I was the third of about nine interns to make it, so at least I was relatively early.  
  
I stopped by the Keurig hot beverage maker to prepare myself a cup of Earl Grey tea.  
  
**Me**  
&gt; Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.  
  
Nothing happened.  
  
I sighed as I remembered that I didn't live in the future. I inserted a single-use Earl Grey pack into the machine, placed a large mug under the dispenser, and pushed a button. The steaming hot liquid poured into my cup and I inhaled deeply as the steam reached my nose. It smelled wonderful. Well... only as wonderful as pre-packaged, instant Earl Grey could smell.  
  
I took a sip, relished in the fact that I had at least some type of tea warming my winter-struck body, and headed towards my desk to start the day.  
  
~ ~ ~  
  
A few minutes after 4:30pm, a woman who looked to be in her late 40s (we'll call her $MotherClient) and another younger lady (we'll call her $DaughterClient) walked through the door. These must be the clients for the orphanage and adoption center because that organization was a mother-daughter operation.  
  
The project manager (we'll call her $PM), the president (we'll call him $Pres), and I walked over to introduce ourselves. Upon arriving at the guests, the first thing I noticed was the sheer size of $MotherClient's purse. It could almost have been considered a duffel bag.  
  
**$Pres**  
&gt; Hello! My name is $Pres. Welcome to SomeWebDesignCo. This is $OP our designer and $PM our project manager.  
  
**$MotherClient**
&gt; Hi! I'm $MotherClient$ and this is my daught--  
  
At this point, $MotherClient's purse started making some high-pitched sounds and was wriggling. $Pres, $PM, and I looked at each other in confusion. $MotherClient started opening her duffel purse.  
  
**$MotherClient** *In a tone as if she were talking to a baby*  
&gt; Oh, I know, baby. You've been trapped inside this bag for so long. I'll let you get some air for a bit.  
  
Confusion turned into concern. Was this woman, the owner of an adoption agency, cruelly treating an infant?!?  
  
$MotherClient opened her duffel purse and out popped the head of a tiny dachshund puppy.  
  
Concern slowly drifted back to confusion.  
  
**$DaughterClient**  
&gt; She'll be fine. She's really a sweet puppy, I promise!  
  
**$MotherClient** *Still in her baby tone*  
&gt; Who's a good girl? That's right! You're a good girl!  
  
Still trying to mask our confusion, we led the clients to the conference room to begin our kickoff meeting.  
  
~ ~ ~  
  
**$MotherClient**  
&gt; ...And we think that our mission statement should be the first thing our visitors see. Also, I think it would be a good idea to put some pictures of African quilts as the background. What do you think, $DaughterClient?  
  
**$DaughterClient**  
&gt; Definitely! I think that's a great idea!  
  
**Me**  
&gt; We can absolutely look into doing that as long as all of the text is legible. But, the most important factor is to ensure that you have a website with a good layout. Visitors should be able to navigate the site with as few problems as possible and have easy access to the content that they want. Have you had a chance to make a list of some existing sites that you like?  
  
**$MotherClient**  
&gt; Oh, no not yet. I'm actually not sure what I want.  
  
I felt a small part of my soul die, and I'm sure $PM and $Pres could tell. We were going to have to go through some extensive wireframing. This meeting was going to take longer than anticipated.  
  
**Me**  
&gt; Okay, no problem. We can start off with some sketching.  
  
I got up and picked up a dry-erase marker. The walls in the conference room were coated with whiteboard paint, so every inch of wall space was effectively a whiteboard.  
  
I have an undying love for whiteboards.  
  
**Me**  
&gt; The best place to start is by looking at some sites of competitors or other organizations that are similar to yours. Do you have any in mind that we could look at?  
  
**$MotherClient**  
&gt; Umm... I haven't actually researched many orphanage or adoption agencies. We are actually just getting started.  
  
Another part of my soul withered away.  
  
**Me**  
&gt; Alright...  
  
I stayed silent for a brief moment, trying to think of the best way to proceed.  
  
**$PM**  
&gt; I will start pulling up some adoption agency sites. That will probably be our best course of action.  
  
**$DaughterClient**  
&gt; Okay. We really don't need anything complicated. Just a place for information. We plan to do all of the adoption services in person or on the phone.  
  
**Me**  
&gt; Okay. We'll start with a couple sketches and go from there.  
  
I began drawing a few quick examples of common layouts on the whiteboard wall. I drew one with the navigation bar on top, one with the navigation on the left. I drew a single-column layout, a 2-column layout, and contact form.  
  
**Me**  
&gt; The best way for your visitors to have access to various pages of your site is by the use of a navigation bar. Most commonly, you'll find sites with the navigation bar horizontally along the top. There are also many sites that have the navigational along--  
  
**$MotherClient**  
&gt; Navigation? Like that screen in the car that shows the map?  
  
I looked over to $Pres. He was typing frantically on his laptop. Then $PM started typing. Then $Pres again. They must have been talking to each other via our company's messaging service of choice... most likely making fun of the clients in secret. I desperately wanted to join them.  
  
**Me**  
&gt; Not quite. For websites, the navigation is kind of like a menu that you use on your computer. It allows you to access different parts of the site and keep everything organized. For example, you can have a contact info page, a mission statement page, you could even have a page where you talk a little about yourselves. All of these pages will be links in the menu so that visitors can go to those pages. Most sites have the menu along the top, some have the menu along the left side.  
  
**$MotherClient**  
&gt; I'm really not understanding this 'menu' thing. Is this like a restaurant or something? We aren't a restaurant!  
  
**Me**  
&gt; I understand that. I'm trying to think of the best way to explain. Have you used Microsoft Word? You know how it says 'File', 'Edit', 'Tools', 'Help', etc. along the top? Those are menus. They allow you to access different options and--  
  
$MotherClient starts to look really frustrated. She turns to her daughter.  
  
**$MotherClient**  
&gt; Do you know what he's talking about? I don't understand any of this computer lingo.  
  
She then turned to her puppy.  
  
**$MotherClient** *In her baby tone*  
&gt; Do you understand, babycakes? I didn't think so. I think we should try some other company.  
  
$MotherClient 'packed' her puppy in her duffel purse and walked out of the conference room.  
  
**$MotherClient**  
&gt; Come on, $DaughterClient. Let's go.  
  
$DaughterClient got up, apologized, and followed her mother out of the building.  
  
$Pres, $PM, and I sat in the conference room for a while in utter confusion.  
  
~ ~ ~  
  
A week later, we receive a check from them of the non-refundable up-front payment (a portion of the full estimate) that they were contractually obliged to pay.  
  
We never heard from them again."

I work retail to pay bills, i'm on foodstamps and everyday try get better at my craft and apply to places all at the same time. I moved to LA to try and improve my chances at getting a job about 10 months ago but nothing.

I've also been getting seizures lately which I'm thinking may be somewhat related to the major stress I've been going through and lack of sleep as well.

I'm being laid off my job soon because they're closing and have started looking for jobs and forgot how hard it is to even get a minimum wage job with just an art degree.

Although I'd love to continue trying to reach my dreams, I have to start paying school loans soon and my bills are going to start stacking up soon especially with losing this job and only having two months emergency saved up.

My life has been pretty shit for a while now and I want to try for a job where I can buy food, pay my rent, and maybe even be able to eat out every once in a while.

I want to know what jobs are good for this? I'm actually a hard worker, but I guess I just suck at art and all the hours I've put in to this have been lost because no one wants to hire me. I always got a's and b's in class, maybe some c's in senior year because senioritis, i was an ap/ib student and did always kinda liked fiddling with computers, so I was thinking maybe something in programming?

Everything from languages to techniques to things I don't even know about.,grokfest,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/23yg43/can_anyone_help_me_tailor_my_learning_to_best_fit/,"So I am barely a beginner and am going to be diving headfirst into learning to code to implement this project, but I think I can do it.  But since I know so little, I am looking for some direction that might help me know what I need to learn to implement it.  I am an intern at a nonprofit with background in stats, GIS, and some experience with scripting in matlab, using complex formulas (but not really macros) in excel, very basic python programming that I'm working on.  No web development experience outside of hosting data for a google map on a google site.

So here's what I want to do:

I am building a database with information on clients for the nonprofit.  It includes demographic info, dates, times, categories, text, and numeric data.  I am using a google spreadsheet that I want to be able to query like a database (have looked into this enough to know it's possible) and that will be continually updated as new clients sign up via a google form that populates another spreadsheet that the database will draw from (reorganizing and changing column titles).  I want to build a GUI that can be searchable and sortable, and display the client's information in a useful, readable way (i.e., not a dense spreadsheet or table).  For instance, the staff could search for all clients available on weekends interested in construction work in order to find people to fill a job opening they've found (availability on weekends and construction category interest would both be discrete fields in the database).  Or the staff could search for a client and view their complete file in a readable way.  I plan on hosting the GUI on Google sites.

From a cursory level of investigation, I figure I'll need to learn some XML, become very familiar with SQL querying in databases, understand how an API works, and get a handle on the unique quirks involved in Google products.  Anything else that would work to accomplish what it sounds like I'm aiming for?  Anywhere that I am leaving a huge gap in the explanation where I'd need to account for a whole other system?  Assume I have no relevant knowledge or vocabulary but am pretty reasonable and analytical.  PS: I don't need examples of coding, just want to know where to start and what I'll need to learn, broadly.  Thank you for any help you can give."
23yhu2,1,2014-04-25,"2(+-) more years at a more prestigious college, or graduate and go to Graduate school?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/23yhu2/2_more_years_at_a_more_prestigious_college_or/,"So I'm at a bit of a crossroads.
I'm in my third year of undergrad. I'm spending the year in Japan, doing research at a prestigious Japanese laboratory. My home college does not offer a Computer Engineering as a major, but they do offer a dual degree program with the state college. My college is kind of tiny, so my original intent was to transfer to the larger college (with most of my general studies done, thankfully), do maybe some more research, an internship, then bust my hump for the GRE. How long it takes me to complete college isn't important to me, since I maintain the view that you really only do college once, and it's worth it to come out over-prepared than under-prepared. I just wanted to bounce the idea off some other people. Just to re-iterate here's the two opposing scenarios:

1) I graduate tiny college. Loot:

* BA in CS
* BA in Applied Science &amp; Mathematics
* minor in Asian Studies (woohoo!)
* One summer research in Computer vision (small college)
* Year long research experience in Computer Vision and Robotics (Japanese University)

vs.

2) I go to larger university. Loot:

* BS in Computer Engineering from larger college
* BA in Computer Science from tiny college
* BA in AS&amp;M
* minor in Asian Studies
* Summer Research (possibly x2)
* Year-long research in Computer Vision
* Internship

In terms of career goals, I would like to continue to work in Computer Vision/Artificial Intelligence/Robotics. I'm getting great experience with some really new and expensive tech, and would like to keep coming up with cool new ways to utilize it. Thusly I think Computer Engineering is important. Not to mention I would just like more educational experience."

I'm looking to move my career in a more computationally-based direction and was hoping to get some input on how this would be best achieved. I have a B.S in Mechanical Engineering... Unfortunately, the closest my current position gets to any coding is Excel spreadsheets and horizontal movement within the company is limited. I've done programming on-and-off since a young age and even had a summer internship as a developer, so my CS background is stronger than what you'd normally expect out of a non-CS major. As I see it, my possible courses of action can broadly be divided into more education, leveraging my existing degree for a new position closer to where I want to go, doing projects to build a portfolio, or some combination thereof. What does it take for a hiring manager decide I'm worth an interview over some fresh CS grad? 

I've read the FAQ and am aware of Coursea, Udacity, etc. It's very attractive because of the low cost, easier admissions process, etc, but as educational as I'm sure they are, I'm not entirely convinced employers will recognize their value.

These are my acceptances:

-Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science ($64k/year)

-UC Berkeley EECS with Regents ($30k/year)

-UC San Diego CS with full ride Jacobs Scholarship ($0k/year)

-UChicago ($50k/year)

My family would *just* be barely able to pay the CMU tuition at minor cost of living sacrifices to my parents with 70-80k in loans in total. However, I still feel like it would be a good decision *if* in the long-term a CMU degree would end up paying more than say a degree at Berkeley, which itself is an especially good offer because of Regents/priority class enrollment, etc. 

My family could easily pay off the Berkeley tuition without loans or debt. Another thing that Berkeley has going for it is the proximity to Silicon Valley, though I assume that after a CMU degree I would go to Silicon Valley anyway after undergrad. But for internships and creating a network during college, I think Berkeley has the advantage possibly. I'm not really considering UCSD or UChicago simply due to the strength of the CS program at the other universities.

SCS employment survey: http://www.cmu.edu/career/salaries-and-destinations/2013-survey/pdfs-one-pagers/SCS%20Post%20Grad%20Handout%202013.pdf

EECS employment survey: https://career.berkeley.edu/Major/EECS.stm

One thing to note above is that Berkeley has a much lower respond rate (43% v 94%) and the average student at Berkeley EECS is probably not as good as the average student at SCS, so the stats at Berkeley might be deflated such that comparison to SCS isn't that viable since there are different students at each program.

I'm more interested in straight CS than EE and I want to work at tech companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Dropbox, etc. I'm not considering graduate school right now because from my research, it's not necessary for CS unless you're pursuing a career in academia - so the cost of potential graduate school shouldn't really affect my decision.

I'm a student at USF (South Florida, not San Fransico) and my term is coming to an end. I need to get a job or internship to help pay for college or, in the case of unpaid, get real-world experience and open opportunities. Unfortunately, I can't find anything that I qualify for. This is my first semester at USF, but I do have two years of general college under my belt from a high school early college program and I've self taught myself programming for many years; I like to believe I'm quite fluent in C++, C#, and Java and have a pretty fair understanding of what I'm doing in development. 

So far, all I've been applying for are jobs in warehouses and such nearby - good pay and pretty good work, but I'd really love to start working in computer science, or at least learning what real world development is like, as soon as possible. I want to learn and take the next step to being a better developer and do work that I'm passionate about.

However, all of the internships/jbos my college is advertising require applicants be seniors in the computer science department or have previous experience in the field - two things that I lack. Talking to advisors is fairly futile since they just say, ""get your internship the your senior year or the summer before it - it's on your flowchart"".

Do you guys have any advice for me to help find internships or work earlier than in 2-3 years from now?

EDIT: And of course I don't expect to be programming and my first job in the field to be all that important or exciting, but any step in the right direction would get me giddy."

My personal statements were pretty good, as were my extracurriculars (I'm an Eagle Scout, comp sci intern, and I tutor an autistic guy).

I think I'm going to appeal, mainly because I've been working my ass off and took 20 units this semester in order to have a total of 60 needed for transfer. Maybe they were skeptical and thought I might drop a class..?

Any thoughts?

I have received two internship offers for this summer and I am having trouble choosing between them. One of them would be working as a web developer using some C# and Backbone.js. The other I would be doing primarily QA for a SaaS product and have a few opportunities to do some development stuff on the main product (java and javascript work for job 2) 

The first job pays slightly better but has a worse commute, which neutralizes them on that front for me. I have a greater interest in web development than QA as a full time career but both internships interest me. 

I was wondering if anyone thinks that one job would add a significant amount to my skill set or make me more employable next year. 

Please let me know if you have any advice.

I had to send it to my family home though across the country and it took about nearly a month from me ordering the parts until I was able to go home and build it and then bring it up to my house.

241m5p,3,2014-04-26,Salary/Career Questions? ~3 yr experience (unique story),zmathoftears,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/241m5p/salarycareer_questions_3_yr_experience_unique/,"In 2011 I was set to graduate with a CS degree. Through my own neglect/incompatibility my GPA was &lt;3.0. Due to a complication (money, not grade wise), my diploma was withheld. It's taken me 2.5 years to sort all that out, and I'll be graduating in about a month.

Before I found out they were going to be withholding my diploma, I had already gotten a job offer from a company. When I broke the news to them, they told me they were desperate enough for people that they would take me on as full time intern. I worked as an intern there for about ~2 years before being converted to full time (I'd been doing 40+ hours during the entire internship). 

Less then 2 months after that I was promoted and given a nice boost in pay. I got a small raise at the start of this year for market inflation. At this point I'm making ~58k a year (NE Ohio area for reference).

I am in no way a bad programmer, college just wasn't my thing. I work closely with another developer that graduated from the same school with a GPA in the 3.5's, and I frequently outperform them in terms of both depth and breadth of knowledge. I've also been awarded by my peers/company several times for my performance and dedication.

So my questions:

* Am I being underpaid given my experience? I've looked around (glassdoor), but I cannot really decide. I just don't know enough about other positions to say for sure. I see plenty of new graduates on here looking for 50-60k on hire.
* If I were to look for another job, will the industry recognize my three years, or treat me as a new graduate?
* If I did find a new job, what should my salary expectations be there?

**TL;DR;** I'm graduating in a month, but I've already been working full time (40+ hours a week) as a developer for 3 years. What should my salary expectations be? Could I be hired as if I had 3 years of experience given my graduation date?"

I've been working as an unpaid intern with a small agency for just over a month now. 

It may sound strange, but I genuinely feel employable. Is it totally unrealistic to think that I could land a junior developer position after 4 months of learning? Is it unheard of? 

There may be a position for me at the end of my internship, but I'm not sure I'd take it  – mostly working with templates, they've never heard of version/source control, lots of bad practices etc.."

I am in a bit of a dilemma as I am a graduating senior from the University of Arizona. I double majored in Accounting and Management Info Systems, and was planning on doing a Masters in MIS at the UofA next year still. 

This upcoming summer I have an internship with PwC in their Risk Assurance branch, in Seattle. When I was interviewing with firms last semester, I picked PwC because of the office visits and such, but I was hoping to be able to get into the Consulting/Advisory side, as I had these offers from other firms.

My recruiter at PwC said it would definitely be possible to shadow members of the Advisory branch and possibly interview for these positions. As of right now, I am thinking about foregoing my Master's, as I am hoping to start my career sooner than later and move to a new city. Does anyone have any experiences with switching from one branch of a firm to another after an internship?

Also does anyone have any ideas of where I could possibly look for off-season recruitment of consulting full time jobs at firms such as KPMG, Deloitte, Accenture, etc.

I'm not completely certain that this is the appropriated subbreddit for this sort of post (if not, can someone point me in the correct location?)

Currently, my life is going quite swiftly. Part-time job (typical evening shifts) and internship during the day. This is fine, but I find myself being a little less social then what I really want to be. I have a couple local friends here and there, and a handful of online buddies, however, I really would like to meet some new acquaintances of varies other hobbies.

This is the tricky part! With my internship and partime job, this barely gives me any time I would like to myself. At most, I get some free time during the evening after the internship, or at night after work. I would love to participate in maybe some local clubs/events, but my time somewhat restricts me.

What i'm looking for are some suggestions for some common, easy to attempt hobbies/clubs that typically reside around a city (my current location is Pittsburgh) and may be around my time criteria. My current hobbies already revolve around my computer, so I would like to look at a more broad range of options :D.

CUNY or SUNY?,natantantan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/243xl0/need_help_with_choosing_a_college_cuny_or_suny/,"Hi I am a senior in NYC and want to major in Computer Science. Right now my choice is between CUNY CCNY and SUNY Stony Brook.

CCNY - Great school for CS and ABET credited. Upon graduation I will be completely debt free. Absolutely non- existent social life. Will have to commute 1 hour back and forth everyday between home and the college.

Stony Brook. Also great CS school. It's considered the best CS SUNY school. I will graduate with $40-50k debt after all four years. Will live on campus and in a dorm.

Originally I was considering CCNY because the debt free aspect is extremely appealing. On top of that, for computer science, name of school or even GPA doesn't really matter its all about what you can actually do and your internship. So graduating from both school should net me pretty much similar jobs.

However I am an extremely shy and introverted person and this is something I desperately want to fix. I made some progress in high school but I feel like CCNY would just act as an extenuation of High School. If I went to CCNY i would have to live at home with my parents (which sucks), would lose a lot of social footing/progress, and would generally be unhappy.

If I went to SUNY happiness wouldn't be guaranteed obviously but I would stop being so sheltered by my parents and would be able to finally have some freedom and live like an actually person. I feel like a dorm life would really help me get out of my introverted shell and help me work on my social skills.

Now I am leaning more towards SUNY as I feel this college experience really is worth the $40-50k in debt as it will completely shape me as a person and my future. Social skills are very important in life and if I go to CUNY I feel like I would regress and become even more shy and secluded. Also a lot of people graduate with 200k in debt so 40k isn't that bad. Plus I don't want to be stingy and miss out on a once in a lifetime experience because I was stingy with money.

so

TL;DR Is it worth it to graduate with 40k in debt as opposed to being debt free in order to gain the ""college experience"""

Input needed (Details inside),shamefulanony69324,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/244qtg/difficulty_finding_jobs_with_a_dismissed_criminal/,"First off, I know I will most likely catch a lot of flak for this, and I most certainly deserve this.


I am currently entering my sophomore year at university.

During my freshman year, (first semester) I made a VERY dumb decision, and was arrested, and charged with 3-4 charges regarding marijuana. I payed for my lawyer, and was entered with a plea deal that will get all the charges dismissed, upon a year long probation with no hiccups.  

Now I KNOW this was a horrible mistake, it haunts me in my thoughts every night. Since then, I have given up drinking, smoking, anything that basically inhibits my ability to study or be a better person. I used that shame, that anger at myself, to push me to do my best. My grades have begun picking up, and I have two jobs, both paying very well for a college student.

As of right now, my GPA is floating around 3.0 - 3.1, and I am taking full summer hours this summer as well, in hopes of picking up even more slack, and hopefully raising my GPA as much as possible. 


Now, I have a few questions, and I figured here would be the best place to ask. 

What sort of difficulties will I face in the future? Will finding internships be impossible, or will I be able to correct myself in the future? How do employers view dismissed charges on a record? How do employers view dismissed charges on a record that have a decent time lapse from the event with no other history? (as in, If i apply for jobs when i graduate, 4 years from now, Would employers give more slack to seeing I have changed, or would it be an immediate disqualifier?)

I have used this event as fuel to make ME as good of a person as possible. I hope to learn as much, and more, as all of my colleagues in college, in order to separate myself from them.
 There is not a day that goes by without me regretting my past decisions and idiocy, but whats done is done.  I realize this may be a crippling entity in my search for a job, and my mindset is 
""If I can make myself the best person for the job, regardless of prior charges and history, hopefully they will look over that as youthful indiscretion""

As a side project, I have begun learning the basics of coding applications in android via eclipse and androids SDK, as well as pursuing my studies ahead of time (For instance, I have begun doing classwork and labs for next semesters classes, this summer.) 

I would appreciate any input, tips, help, or support and criticism you have to throw my way. "

The first few days went great, I took it the recommended four times a day and it had effect. After that it went down rapidly. Pretty soon it was down to once a day. For the past two months or so it's become a real problem. In a good week I take maybe one or two pills. Not daily, but across the whole week. I'm working an internship 9-5 and another job plus volunteer work besides that. I really can't afford to be this unproductive.

I've tried a lot of reminders. Put notes on my door, my alarmclock, my bed, my desk, anything. Setting an alarm on my phone doesn't work for me, I dismiss it and instantly forget about it. I've tried apps that are designed for remembering medication. When I ask others to remind me they don't think about it and quite frankly it isn't their problem. When I get ready in the morning there's pills everywhere I go but it still doesn't cross my mind to take one. There's no one to remind me then, nor in the evening. I take them with me too, just don't think about it. I don't have fixed co-workers that I can ask to help, also I feel reclined to say something about having to take meds. 

I forget a lot of things, not just this. But this is directly affecting my daily life in so many ways. My todo list is longer than fits on my window but that's not such a big problem. I know exactly what I need to do and when and how, I just never think about it. For deadlines and appointments I have a wall calendar, that's very effective. My walls are plastered with lists and post-its. For taking pills I can't find a solution though. I have a buttload of work to do, if I don't take my meds I'll be in some serious shit. 

What worked for you? Is there something that helps?"

2. It's UCLA. High school and community college were so easy in my opinion in getting good grades. I know UCLA is a quarter system so I am worried about that as well. Is it really tough there? 

3. What kind of classes do you recommend? Is it possible to minor in something else in two years? Maybe accounting or something related to technology or computer?

Been lurking for a few months simply for entertaining stories, and so comes the time where I have a little story to share.

First, semi-obligatory backstory; I've been doing an IT-focused internship for a small company (10 people), where the main task has been to create an Access database with various functions to ease the time spent on paperwork for the employees as well as the owner. Most of the people here are fairly tech illiterate, and so my responsibilities have grown over time to include anything related to any of the four computers, the three printers, cell phones, ^and^battery^chargers.

I had gotten most of the basic functions, forms, relations, etc in the database to work, and so it was time to set up the front-end on two additional computers. This required me to install Windows 7 because Office 2013 won't install on an older OS (and because screw Windows 8). Something had to have been done eventually anyways, because these computers were completely swamped with all kinds of malware you could imagine. Said and done, I reformat both hard drives and install a fresh copy of Windows 7 onto it, and go through the process of installing the most basic programs needed. I spend the next couple of days implementing a second, more limited version of the database front-end for the employees to use. Then, last friday, I had to call in sick.

Now, not thirty minutes ago, I came back in to keep polishing said secondary front-end. I start working right when the first scheduled break starts, so I hit up the browser to do some obligatory redditing. And *bam*. I am welcomed by the sight of Search Conduit. After leaving this computer unattended for a single day.

Now, I know a thing or two about computers, but because of this fact, I've never had these problems myself. I am probably going to spend the rest of the day and maybe the next tearing my hair out trying to scratch off every little bit of this annoying spyware, and no one seems to take responsibility for it either. We'll see how this goes.

Not the usual stories, just wanted to vent a little."

Currently, I'm about to finish my junior year of college at a highly ranked school in the Midwestern US. I came into freshman year undecided in my major. I thought about pre-med, but quickly realized I'm too squeamish. I also took an advertising class, which I loved. I've always enjoyed advertising as a consumer, and I enjoy expressing myself creatively. Then I found out about how difficult it is to secure a solid job in the industry, and how long the hours are and how low the pay is once you get there. The end of my freshman year was the only time I'd be allowed to apply to the business school, so I did, and was accepted as a marketing major. I chose marketing because it's similar to advertising in many ways. It didn't take long for me to figure out that marketing was kind of a BS major and I wasn't really learning any technical skills. I got an e-mail about the supply chain management major within business. It promoted 100% job placement and the highest starting salary of any business major at the school. This was enough for me and I jumped on.

I don't hate the material, in fact, I find it rather interesting for the most part. For the last couple months, however, I've been thinking a lot about whether or not I can see myself in this field, or any business environment, for the rest of my life. The answer I keep coming back to is no, but I could never figure out where it is I would like to be.

Fast forward to this past weekend. I went to go visit another school for a campus-wide party/celebration. I found myself talking to a girl and found out she's an atmospheric sciences major. She expressed jealousy about how highly ranked the same program is at my school. I asked her about what she studies and it started to dawn on me that this might be the calling I've been looking for. Ever since I was little I've been fascinated by weather. In elementary school I would sometimes spend hours watching the Weather Channel. Whenever it stormed I would stand in the garage to watch lightning. In junior high I took an economics class and was asked by my teacher what I wanted my profession to be (just to give an example starting salary for an activity.) This was the first time I ever had to name a realistic profession (not a football player or something like that) and I spouted out ""meteorologist."" All of these memories came racing back to me converging into a ""holy shit"" moment. ""Holy shit: I want to be an atmospheric sciences major.""

As this thought swirled in my head, I began realizing the actual value to it. With climate change being an issue that will continue to grow, and WILL have an impact on the survival of the human race, this could actually be a field where I could make a meaningful difference. I was never going to revolutionize the way companies order raw materials, but what if I made a breakthrough discovery to help maintain our planet? My first thought while re-reading those last couple sentences is that I'm getting carried away. My second though was THAT'S THE POINT! I've never been as excited about business as I am right now thinking about the possibilities, however unlikely they might be, within atmospheric sciences. It's the first time I've ever had a fantasy about a career that could be a reality.

Here's where that reality escapes me. I'm 2 semesters away from graduating. My supply chain major requires me to have an internship before senior year, so I have one lined up and I'll be working full time in that field this summer. I've already racked up tons of student loans. All of this is in play, and all I want to do is start over. I want to begin all over again as an atmospheric sciences major, but I've invested incredible amounts of time and money into a pair of business degrees.

What are my options here? What can I do? What can I do to avoid working a passionless job for the next 40 years?

TL;DR Met a girl studying weather and realized I've been in the wrong major for 3 years. Want to start over but have invested enormous loads of time and money. Looking for options."

I, and most law students, have never set foot in a courtroom in an attorney role during law school. The positions I apply to aren't ones that require intricate technical knowledge. 

I feel like I'm viewed as an impostor applying to many non-attorney positions. I can run through job postings and highlight almost every single skill/requirement as being something I directly did in law school/my 14 months of internships during school/my work exp before law school - yet I feel like my application goes in the trash BECAUSE I went to law school.

How do I overcome this ?  I know positions which I can use my network would be a lot easier, but there are many where I don't have a connection and I am left with two paragraphs of a cover letter and a single page resume to try to convey how good of a candidate I would be for their position.

247fp6,1,2014-04-28,Need help with choosing a college. CUNY or SUNY?,natantantan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/247fp6/need_help_with_choosing_a_college_cuny_or_suny/,"I am a senior in NYC and want to major in Computer Science. Right now my choice is between CUNY CCNY and SUNY Stony Brook.

CCNY - Great school for CS and ABET credited. Upon graduation I will be completely debt free. Absolutely non- existent social life. Will have to commute 1 hour back and forth everyday between home and the college.
Stony Brook. Also great CS school. It's considered the best CS SUNY school. I will graduate with $40-50k debt after all four years. Will live on campus and in a dorm.

Originally I was considering CCNY because the debt free aspect is extremely appealing. On top of that, for computer science, name of school or even GPA doesn't really matter its all about what you can actually do and your internship. So graduating from both school should net me pretty much similar jobs.
However I am an extremely shy and introverted person and this is something I desperately want to fix. I made some progress in high school but I feel like CCNY would just act as an extenuation of High School. If I went to CCNY i would have to live at home with my parents (which sucks), would lose a lot of social footing/progress, and would generally be unhappy.

If I went to SUNY happiness wouldn't be guaranteed obviously but I would stop being so sheltered by my parents and would be able to finally have some freedom and live like an actually person. I feel like a dorm life would really help me get out of my introverted shell and help me work on my social skills.

Now I am leaning more towards SUNY as I feel this college experience really is worth the $40-50k in debt as it will completely shape me as a person and my future. Social skills are very important in life and if I go to CUNY I feel like I would regress and become even more shy and secluded. Also a lot of people graduate with 200k in debt so 40k isn't that bad. Plus I don't want to be stingy and miss out on a once in a lifetime experience because I was stingy with money.

so

TL;DR Is it worth it to graduate with 40k in debt as opposed to being debt free in order to gain the ""college experience""

2493iw,2,2014-04-29,On getting into graduate school.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2493iw/on_getting_into_graduate_school/,"I'm graduating from college in about two weeks, and I've just finished a four year program that wasn't quite CS but I'm not sure what the equivalent program at most schools is called.     
The program covered a lot of programming languages and frameworks and the main emphasis was on software engineering and web development, with an optional minor in game programming and an optional minor in graphic design. I went with game programming. I'd like to get my Masters in CS, really just to have the opportunity to go over all the CS that I missed in an environment where everyone's doing the same thing. I've compiled a list of Masters programs that assume the student has never taken a CS course before, essentially they go over the ""core five"" CS courses that I don't have, plus some electives that I mostly already do have.

In terms of real life experience, I've co-founded two tech startups, but other than that I don't have any internship or work (for a larger entity) experience. I'd like to keep doing the startup thing, I'm most interested in more schooling so I can learn more, not necessarily because I want to look better for employers.

Anyway, is there anything in particular I can do to look better, seeing as my undergrad degree isn't in pure CS and I don't have any internships?"

Premise: I recently moved to the Seattle area for eight months on a co-op job (some call this an internship). I intended to bring my desktop, with the CPU, GPU, RAM, and PSU detached from the case. I also bought a new ASUS IPS monitor which was delivered to a friend of mine from here.

Back in Canada, nothing really was an issue. I'm suspecting it's a GPU problem. It seems to boot up fine but then what used to happen was that the colours seem to be really screwed up. Everything seems to be red and blurry. The first image might not show justice but the second one is semi-reflective of my problem. Some of the boot screens aren't here either.

NOTE 1: I am certain it is not the monitor. My friend's laptop hooks on and uses it without issue. Monitor is a 239-H.

NOTE 2: This is the build as scoped on PCPartPicker. The card in question is a GTX 650 and I am under warranty. I am not currently interested in purchasing a new card.

24aqrx,4,2014-04-29,General Questions Answered. Resources to learn new material or to expand your skills.,Sinnedangel8027,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/24aqrx/general_questions_answered_resources_to_learn_new/,"This is a general post. I have seen quite a bit of the same questions and asking for resources. Such as; What should I do, careerwise? How do I get my foot in the door? Where can I learn such and such? Etc. So I am creating this post to answer questions that I can answer and for others to ask questions and answer them. 

Here is a small list of resources that I copy-pasta'd from another post of mine. 

1 - [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) provides a great many classes, actual classes taught by well respected college professors, across many subject areas including Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Programming, etc. These classes are mostly free and some offer a certificate of completion (could be used as proof of knowledge in a resume) and some of them have a small fee for the class. They do have a grading system and whatnot. Coursera has been a great tool in learning new skills for myself. 

2 - [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) is a self paced and free learning environment for learning some programming languages. It is very easy to use, very explanatory, and kind of measures your success. It is not a classroom environment and does not have a lot of support but is useful nonetheless. 

3 - On YouTube there is a guy who does IT videos over almost all of IT concepts. He is great, explains terms and concepts very simply, is easy to understand, and provides examples. The Channel Name is [Eli The Computer Guy](https://www.youtube.com/user/elithecomputerguy)

4 - [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), [Server Fault](http://serverfault.com/), etc. There is a list at the bottom of these sites providing links to the various forums. These sites/forums are an incredibly valuable resource for any thing IT/Programming/Coding related. There are many commenters and users on there from various fields and levels of experience. I have found it beyond valuable in my work experience.

5 - [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/) / [TechNet](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/) / [ScriptingGuy](http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/) These guys are great and provide tutorials, explanations, documentation, and even forum support for many topics related to Microsoft and their tools.

There are also the Reddit resources as well. Some that I advise are /r/netsec , /r/sysadmin , /r/IT_CERT_STUDY , /r/DailyProgrammer , /r/LearnProgramming , /r/Networking , and /r/CarlHProgramming . 

I don't care what anyone says about Carl H. His legal business is none of mine and its quite honestly jacked. But he provided a very very useful set of topics and discussions on programming that were quite amazing. His personal transgressions are not relevant to learning new information.

Also if you have no internship, contract, or full-time/part-time experience in IT. You need to find a Help Desk/Service Desk/PC Support/Service Technician/Desktop Support/Desk Side Support position while you're in school. Those are all essentially the same position. However, some are phone centers and others are desk-side (in person). This will get your foot in the door and give you the experience and understanding necessary to begin your career once you finish school."

- I didn't get an internship during the summer after my junior year.

- I have a low GPA...~2.3

What I do have is:

- Some projects from project courses.

- A 3rd place prize for an iOS medical app from a school competition.

 I try to emphasize those, but it seems like I still don't do well when I talk to representatives. Especially when they ask about my pitfalls above. Any advice on how to make myself appealing despite what I listed above would be much appreciated.

My interests in CS really just consists of programming. I'm also interested in business administration--majoring in Finance as well as CS.

24c2be,3,2014-04-29,How do I deal with an unwanted favor done behind my back?,entai1832,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/24c2be/how_do_i_deal_with_an_unwanted_favor_done_behind/,"I’m a rising college senior and there’s considerable social pressure to get a summer internship. I’m interested in the political arena and wanted to have a go at a job in my field of interest at a political consulting or communications firm. The obvious place to look is DC, but I live pretty far away and in a state that doesn’t exactly host a lot of opportunities for my party affiliation.

My dad’s coworker had a connection to a firm that doesn’t normally have a summer internship but calling in a favor the coworker talked with the firm and they agreed to interview me over this past winter break. It went well and they pretty much guaranteed me a position for the summer once they planned their calendar and budget for the new year. This was understandable given that it was early January and the midterm elections for my state were rising. They tell me they’ll get back to me in a few weeks with specifics on the position.

The agreed date goes by and then an additional month goes by without hearing from them or responses to my SOS emails. I assume that something went sour and proceeded to find and apply to 20-25 more internships that are mostly in the DC area. After I get all my applications out, I finally hear back from the initial firm in my home state (which again is pretty much the only firm of my party in the state) stating that they can only offer me an unpaid position which was different than the original, though unwritten and unofficial agreement. I’m cool with it since I’ve sent out plenty more applications, I tell them thank you for the opportunity and that I would rather stay in the state (a lie) but I need a paid position and I’m waiting to hear back from other opportunities and we left on a good note.

Here’s the twist. My dad’s coworker finds out about our agreement through the grapevine and gets pretty peeved. Apparently the firm had told him they were planning on paying me and said coworker of my dad proceeds to strong-arm the firm within the past couple of weeks into paying me. I was not aware of any of this happening and did not encourage it. I was at the point that I wanted to find my own position and not let others do the work for me.

Now that I’m in this situation, I’m at a loss for what I should do. Do I take the position without waiting for the other opportunities to even reply, if they reply? There’s no guarantee that I’ll even get a position in DC, but I would rather be there this summer, though after living expenses I would probably hardly break even, but the experience would likely be far more valuable than staying at home. How do I juggle the social interaction with the firm at home without seeming ungrateful for the favor or for the sudden “discovery of a new position”?

TL;DR- Dad’s coworker helped me find a summer position that is my first but not most desired availability, but was done so with some coercion and I don’t know what to do."

Once I graduate I want to either get a graduate degree or work in the US. Will it be difficult to get a good job in the US with a degree from a foreign university? 

On the other hand, what I really want to do is to get a graduate degree in the US (machine learning or computer vision) but I think it will be difficult with my grades (slightly above 80%). They are pretty good for my university but when I read about everyone getting 4.0's in other places it seems like I won't have a chance. I recently found out about the ACM-ICPC programming contest and read that if you do well in it, it could help you get into a good school so I've been reading a lot of algorithm and math books and doing practice problems, but it's a team contest so that might hurt my chances. This has also affected my grades since I've been studying algorithms for many hours a day instead of doing actual classwork, and I'm worried that in the end I might not have anything to show for it.

Lately I haven't been able to sleep because of all of these doubts, so I thought I would ask here for some guidance. Should I forget about the ACM contest and instead work on some side projects so I have something to show when I apply for jobs? Should I forget about graduate school? I was thinking that maybe working on some machine learning projects could help me get into a good graduate school, but I don't know if it's a waste of time. 

I wanted to go to college in the US but even a state college would have been prohibitively expensive since I'm not a resident so I didn't even try. As I expected, I've been very disappointed with my education here, so I've spent a lot of time studying independently which has hurt my grades. Now as I get closer to graduating, I can't stop worrying about my future and could really use some advice from people with more experience. I've also been reading a lot about internships in this subreddit, but I've never heard about that in my country and I don't think we have them, so that has also made me worried because I'll also have that disadvantage when looking for a job.

I didn't really think anyone would agree, but to my surprise they all though it was a great idea, so I posted the status. It took him a while to find what I posted. When he did, he chuckled, and asked who's brilliant idea it was to post this (you could hear a pinch of sarcasm in his voice). I laughed back, and told him it was me.

Apparently, I had offended my coworker, because he's actually homosexual. The rest of the office obviously knew that, so they encouraged me to post it on his Facebook. I got a long speech about it, but I didn't get into any serious trouble apart from the fact that it's really awkward now, because I think my coworker hates me and probably thinks I'm  homophobic. Also, he is dating the co-owner of the company, so I get dirty looks from him too."

I got their reply today morning saying that they would like to have a followup interview on the phone on friday. What do i expect? The person who has emailed me is different from the one who took my first interview. First interview was fully technical. The guy who wants to speak to me tomorrow according to LinkedIn is a staff engineer. Is the followup interview a good sign?


I hope I land this position. It's one of the best IT companies around and pay is good too.

24dkqe,8,2014-04-30,Just really frustrated with no outlet,Miathermopolis,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/24dkqe/just_really_frustrated_with_no_outlet/,"Hi. I have a rant of sorts, if you read through, thanks.

I attended Boston Reed College in 2010-2011. I was going for the Pharmacy Tech course. I reached the point in the course where you have to start your unpaid internship, and realized that it was just way not for me. I don't want to be responsible for people's Rx meds, I can hardly keep my own life in order, and that's too much pressure for me. 

I have a habit of starting things and not finishing them. A bad trait to have, I've been working on it since then. Anyway.

I dropped the course about 2 weeks into my internship, on the day of the final exam. 

Now, with Boston Reed, if you have completed more than 60% of the course, you are required to pay the remaining balance on your tuition loan. I signed contracts stating I'd do this and all that. At the time I dropped, I was still supposed to complete something like 4 months of unpaid internship hours. I can't really remember, but there was a significant amount of time left, so I guess I called because I wasn't sure if I'd completed 60% of the course. I now realize that the internship isn't part of the course, it is however required to complete everything and obtain the certificate. This was my misunderstanding.  

I had called Boston Reed, and instead of checking my records like I should have, I simply asked the woman I spoke with:  

Whether or not I'd be penalized for dropping  and 

Whether or not I would owe any more money to Boston Reed.  

Her answers were, ""No there is no penalty,"" and, ""No you will not be responsible for the remaining balance.""

So I called my mom, informed her, she wrote it down in her calendar (she documents everything and had helped me with my initial down payment), and I moved on with my life.

2 years went by.

I received an email at the beginning of this month stating that I had a past due balance of something like $970, and unless I paid within the next 5 days, it'd be sent to collections.

I was, to say the least, very confused. We tried to get them to find the phone record of the conversation in question (they record phone calls for security purposes), and I was told that I could delay my first payment until the end of this month.

Today rolls around. I call and ask if they've found any information (my mother has been dealing with the back and forth since she had it written down and since I'd stupidly gotten rid of all my Boston Reed stuff, again, this is all my fault, and I realize that), to which I was told ""no, you didn't give us the number you called from so we couldn't find it.""

I talked to another guy who told me that he just learned that they only keep phone records for 6 months. Makes sense. Could have told me that a month ago, though.

I asked why, if I was indeed still responsible for this balance (which I would have gladly paid! I had been paying it down), was I not notified the first month I missed a payment? Why have 2 years gone by and not a single late notice, not a single notification of any kind, only ""your account is going to be sent to 3rd party collections or we will use legal means to obtain this balance"".

Basically they couldn't tell me why, the guy apologized but said there really wasn't anything he could do. I understand, I signed the contract, it's all in there. It was my mistake trusting the staff at the school I was attending to be knowledgable, and trusting the complete lack of contact as verification that nothing was amiss. 

It was my mistake, in the end. 

I am still extremely frustrated. I work 20 hours a week. My paychecks are maybe $180 at a time. My payments are $163. It's not the end of the world, but I feel completely helpless, stupid, frustrated, and small.

And I just wanted to rant about it because I had to suck it up and finally just pay the first amount so that my already bad credit doesn't get any worse. Here's to giving up practically an entire paycheck each month to an institution that did fuck all for 2 years and is now threatening me with legal ramifications if I do not pay up. They got to wait 2 years but I better jump the fuck up and get it done asap.

Thanks, life. thanks so much.

24dnhr,7,2014-04-30,Enough compensation for my first internship? How do I negotiate salary?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24dnhr/enough_compensation_for_my_first_internship_how/,"I'm a CS major/Math minor at a state university in NE. Rising sophomore, female, not a ton of coding experience. I was lucky enough to score an internship as a freshman, so I'm pretty thrilled about that, especially since it was competitive, and at a fairly prestigious company.

I'm interning at MathWorks this summer (Boston area); doing a mostly coding, some technical writing, a bit of hardware stuff, and a tiny bit of marketing/presenting. It's exactly what I want to be doing, maybe even after graduation. Perfect job for me. I'd have to drive maybe an hour or so everyday to get there and back, but it's not a problem for me.

I was offered $16.50 per hour, which is a good $10 lower than the rates I saw for MathWorks interns on Glassdoor. Other perks I get are: my own office, flexible hours, some meals are paid for, casual dress at office (this is considered a perk for me), and stuff like that.

Is the salary offer too low?

The HR rep said there was a bit of room for negotiation, so I want to try to go a bit higher, but... I don't know how to negotiate salaries. At all. It seems rude. And the only other job I had was a generic customer service job in high school, paid $8 an hour, so this is looking much better.

Is it a good deal for my first internship as a freshman, or should I be negotiating a slightly higher rate?

Thanks! :)"

 Hello everybody, my name is Ryan and I'm currently a student at Boise State University. I grew up in Boise (since I was 9 years old) and after spending the last semester in Arizona State I made the decision to return to Boise by thinking that a lot of things would be the same, only to find out that in some ways Boise just couldn't compare to the education/ people at Arizona State. I'm at a point where I must now choose a school for the next 3 years while I finish my education (keep in mind that it is NOT an option to transfer later, it's now or never) First some background on me: I'm currently a political science major. I have been interested in career politics ever since my senior year of high school (I'm now completing my freshman year) when I first took debate, which I fell in love with after getting the chance to travel around the states partying/ winning with my friends/ team.. I have the opportunity to come fresh out of college making 100k in Boise if I become a financial advisor like my dad which I thought I wasn't interested in but over time I have decided that it might be a good way to get myself to a governor/ public office position (so with that being said, if I did go to Arizona, I would PROBABLY come back afterwards unless something (such as my internship) crazy steered me otherwise. I originally moved back for a few prime reasons: Money, family, debate, and a girl that I had date off on and for a couple years. However, when I returned she was upset with some of the things that had occurred while I was at ASU, and used it as an opportunity to hurt me as bad as possible by moving to Cali with another guy. Although she ultimately realized it was a mistake and came back and is now a part of my life again, and she really loves me more than any other girl I've ever met, it just isn't the same anymore now that I feel like I can't trust her, so she should be negated from the argument. 




**Arizona State Pros:**
 I got approved for a double major (Political Science and Business Entrepreneurship) (and a course overload for next semester) and can pull it off over the next 3 years I made some of the best friends I've ever made in my life, whereas I really haven't like most of the people I've met at Boise State thus far, I'm the kind of guy who likes to party on the weekend, whereas a lot of the people I've met here are trying to be wasted every day and they are kind of (not to stereotype) your typical Cali douchebags.. 




At ASU, I am a member of Barrett the honors college, a well put together community within Arizona State 
I felt like I was learning more at ASU, and looking at my next semester class schedules, this would likely continue to be true (Although at the end of the day is it just a piece of paper)




 Phoenix is a pretty great city (Suns games, First friday, etc) 




The Weather 




I do Ballroom dance/ hip hop coalition at ASU 




Young Democrats club is decently well put together (No politics in Boise) 




Better concerts/ general nightlife 




I have to give it up that there are certainly more beautiful women 




McCain institute internship in DC during one of my summers (probably my junior year summer?) 




U of A nearby, friends/ rivalry/ parties 





Gorgeous campus It feels like I'm in college... Whereas Boise State is currently a bit of a commuter college, it gets a lot of older people and even the younger people here have no school pride/ don't want to be here.. and it reflects in many people's shitty attitudes. 




**ASU Major Cons:**




Away from family




 Potentially much more expensive/ residency hassle. (If I go back to ASU, I'm going to have to try to attain residency for my third year. If I do, my scholarship is nearly full tuition (I pay like 400 bucks a year) however, if I don't, i continue to pay a hell of a lot more than I do at BSU (My scholarship is like 13k a year.. I think it's close to 30k a year to go there.. Do the math.. All this being said money is no object as I will get through college however I have to, and a little bit of debt (since I can't accumulate more than 30k anyway thanks to how much money my dad makes the government won't give me any) 





No debate (see later) 





**Boise State Pro:** 





I love the city of Boise, there are plenty of outdoors things to do, if I can find the right people to do it with (however, two of the best friends I still have here are leaving in this summer/ fall)




 My family is here, and I'd really like the opportunity to be a big part of my sister's life, as she is moving into her sophomore year of high school and might need the influence (although I've never been a big part of her life before, I'm trying to be now that I'm here) 





4 seasons of weather (no Arizona summers :P ) 




Make my connections where I think I'll live (whereas it's possible that I'll go to ASU and end up moving back, therefore making a bunch of connections in a place that I won't live) 




And the Kicker: Boise State Debate: I mentioned that I love debate, and the debate opportunity is the only thing that is making this decision impossible for me, here is why: Over the next 3 years I have an opportunity to be a part of something huge. This team has won national championships before... This opportunity literally involves getting all paid for trips to 8 out of state trips a year (oregon, Washington, and they even go to Nashville and Indiana each year) Furthermore, most of the students that are a part of the program receive a 1/3 tuition scholarship based off of GPA and service (roughly 2k a year where the tuition is only like 6.5 a year at Boise anyway) and she does offer a few full tuition scholarships for her captains and such... Although ASU does have debate, there are no scholarships, and they only do one type of debate that I won't participate in.. So I might do speech, but it just isn't the same. Debate is a huge commitment, we're talking 6+ hours a week before extra practices or tournaments, plus mandatory community service. I did love debate in high school, and I will probably love it in college, but it's obviously at a whole new level.. 




I have a spanish minor at BSU that I wouldn't probably attain at ASU 




**BSU Con:**




 No Double Major 




Still looking for friends (which I would hopefully find on the debate team) 




A much less collegey college town




Well I think that's about it. I'm about to start a job at PF Chang's here in Boise, which is a great job, but there is one on campus at ASU too, and I don't doubt my ability to pick up a job there, so that is probably negligible .. If I think of anything else I'll post it. Thanks for reading guys and I really look forward to your input because this decision has been impossible for me."
24eclj,2,2014-04-30,[Advice Needed] Temporary job in the hand vs permanent job in the bush,CEjobseeker,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/24eclj/advice_needed_temporary_job_in_the_hand_vs/,"TL;DR I need advice handling a situation between accepting an offer for immediate but temporary employment or waiting for a very promising full time position in the exact areas of expertise I want to work in. How terrible is it to accept a temporary job and bail after a month if I am offered the permanent one?

I earned my MS in Civil Eng. in December and I have been job searching for a few months. I have had my heart set on eventually holding a water resources/environmental engineering position, which my degree and internship experiences (2+ yrs exp.) were focused on. 

Long story short I have a second interview for a more general (also temporary 1040 hour limited) Civil Eng./Construction Inspector position tomorrow. It's more of a tour of the department etc. ""to see the work I will be involved with"" and I am pretty confident they are going to extend me an offer. I am sure that I could enjoy this temporary job but it's not what I want to do long term, however my student loans begin repayment in June and I am basically broke and mooching off of my SO.

I have been keeping in touch with previous employers and a senior consulting engineer that I worked with a bit during an internship (for a different company) contacted me Monday about an entry level engineering position with his company. It is exactly the type of position I have been trying to get into and would be the perfect start for my career. I talked with him on the phone today and he basically guaranteed me an interview for the position sometime in the next couple weeks, saying that he was sure my resume would ""rise to the top"".

Now I'm conflicted with what to say if I am offered the general civil/inspector job tomorrow. It would be very hard for me to turn down this job offer, which I would have been satisfied with temporarily if this magical new opportunity hadn't come around. My dad, a senior engineer and another engineer I asked for advice both told me to accept the temp offer and then bail if I get an offer from the permanent position. I have some qualms about this as I know they really need someone right away for the inspector position and I don't want to screw them over or burn any bridges.

If they offer me the position tomorrow, I am thinking about asking until Monday to give them a decision and being honest about having another opportunity that I am considering. "
