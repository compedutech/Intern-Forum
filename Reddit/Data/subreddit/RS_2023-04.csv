I got accepted into 8 schools. PLEASE give me some financial advice. I'm so lost and broken cause I can't afford any of this and I'm not sure what to do and risk.

I got accepted to:
UMN, Iowa state, Case western, Umass amherst, USC, UC Davis, Illinois wesleyan, Colorado state. Im majoring in bio, looking to work in biotech. 
 
I can afford to pay only 30k/yr.
So far, im considering the below but their cost after scholarships/aid is still too expensive: UMN(didnt announce scholarshipsyet), Case (i have to pay 56k/yr), UMass (44k/yr).

Case would be a top choice but idk how ill afford 56k. Would loans be worth it? Thats like 104k I can't pay in total. Would I be able to work during college, do paid internships, and work 1 year after graduation in the US to pay it back before my masters? 

Or would Umass or UMN be better? I'm not sure how good the opportunities are here compared to case.

Iowa (34k/yr) is most affordable but people told me that its a big sports school with less emphasis on academics..I dont think itll be worth it.

I feel quite devastated as I literally have no place I can afford comfortably."
12857y4,536,2023-03-31,Why I Fear the Look-a-Me,Saturdead,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12857y4/why_i_fear_the_lookame/,"When I was six years old, I followed a red bird into the woods. I didn’t think much about it, it just made a funny sound and I wanted to look at it. So I wandered off. My mother had fallen asleep on her sunbed after toting about in the garden, she was usually very attentive. Once the bird flew away I tried to turn back, only to realize I’d wandered off the trail, and I had no idea where I was. It was the first time I truly feared for my life. The forests of West Virginia can be so dense that they eat your screams; no one could hear me calling for help, and I couldn’t hear my panicked mother looking for me.

I ended up moving further and further into the forest. I went the wrong way. The sky slowly turned dark as the hours passed, and I found myself following a river. I was thirsty. It eventually got so dark that I couldn’t see my own feet.

At some point, I put my foot down wrong and twisted my ankle. It just broke me. I couldn’t straighten my leg out or put any weight on it. I just sat there by the river, completely devastated. I cried my eyes out, screaming for help, but no one came. It was just me, and the dark. And the dark was ready to eat me alive.

&#x200B;

In the darkest hours of the night, as the fear had reached into the back of my heart, I just sat there; shivering. It was as if the panic had subsided into a sort of revelation. I imagined Death waiting for me at the other side of the river. I knew it was there.

I never saw it, but I painted a picture of it in my mind. I figured it had a really long arm, with a single painted nail. If I looked at it, or talked to it, that arm would grow longer. 

But it wanted me to look. It wanted me to know it was there.

*“Look-a-me,”* it whispered. *“Look-a-me, little boy.”*

&#x200B;

Sometime during the night, I passed out. They found me by the river just before sunrise.

And although my leg healed, my mind didn’t. And from that day forward, I’ve always had the sense that something lurks in the dark, just out of sight. Something that wants me to look. To find it.

To reach me.

&#x200B;

Ever since, I’ve had an anxious relationship to the dark. Some would call it nyctophobia. A sort of fear of the unseen. I’ve always held that gnawing feeling of something waiting on the other side of the river, just out of reach; but one misstep, and it would get me. Even as an adult, I still get that sense of dread. An all-encompassing panic. The sense that you’re not getting enough oxygen, despite hyperventilating. Blood rushing to your head so fast it starts ringing in your ears. And then and there, in my most vulnerable moments, I can still hear it.

*“Look-a-me, little boy. Look-a-me.”*

&#x200B;

Over the years, I’ve been to various therapists. I’ve had treatments. And honestly, just being open about my fears has helped tremendously. I’ve faced my fears time and time again and channeled them into creative outlets. That’s how I eventually became a screenwriter.

I worked my fingers to the bone. Sometimes out of ambition, but most often just to distract myself from that all-consuming darkness that sneaks up on me late at night. I moved to the West Coast in 2011. An internship lead me to a position as an uncredited assistant screenwriter on a popular sitcom. I can’t name any names, but I’m sure there were quite a few *nerds* enjoying our fourth season. 

I got my first job at a movie set in 2016. I mostly worked on last-minute edits and consultation, but it was the first time I saw my name on the silver screen. I’m sure some of you horror fans out there enjoyed it. And to those of you who’ve gained a lifelong fear of dolls; I’m sorry.

&#x200B;

I worked several stray projects until 2018, when I met a very influential man. Let’s call him Patrick, or ‘Pat’ for short. Pat and I met at the wrap-up party of another project, and we got a bit too drunk. We started talking about horror movies, and the two of us ended up talking about our fears and anxieties. It was a “drinking red wine from the bottle at 3-am” kind of talk.

I ended up mentioning my trauma. It sort of just slipped out. I mentioned my sprained leg, and sitting there at the bank of the river. I mentioned a presence in the dark. The long arm, growing longer the more I tried to see it.

“Wha… what’s it called?” Pat asked, flabbergasted.

And in that moment, I realized I’d just pitched my first screenplay.

&#x200B;

Pat fast-tracked the whole thing. He was aching for a producer’s credit, and he genuinely loved the imagery of the ‘Look-a-Me’. A creature lurking in the dark with an arm growing taller the more you paid attention to it. He thought it was absolutely chilling, and he kept hyping me up about it several times a week.

I had a rough draft ready in two weeks. I tried to channel my childhood fears into a cohesive story, but instead of a kid stuck by the river it was more of a classic horror setup. A group of young adults who got lost in the forests of West Virginia, being relentlessly hunted by this primal force. That first draft was rough, but I got a good outline.

I worked with two other writers for the second draft. Kellan, who mostly worked crime drama, and Morgan. She was a comedy writer who wanted to break into a new genre. There was a lot of late night rewrites. Morgan was also an amazing concept artist, which brought every piece of our story to life.

&#x200B;

I remember one night as we worked on the second draft. Kellan was rambling on and on about what the ‘Look-a-me’ represented.

“It’s too simple,” he sighed. “It can’t just be death. We’re not making a… a Jason Voorhees. It’s something new. It means something.”

“I think it’s trauma,” said Morgan. “Like, how it gets worse the more you poke at it. The more you look at it. It’s painful.”

“What the hell kind of message is that?” Kellan scoffed. “Are we telling people not to confront their fears?”

“No, we’re… we’re telling them to not get… goaded into it. To do it on your own terms, you know?”

&#x200B;

It felt like a good and bad conscience chattering into my ears. But at the end of the day, it was my script, and it came down to my decision. Kellan wanted to paint the picture of a threat, something symbolic. Morgan wanted to send a message, using the Look-a-me as a tool. Neither of them was getting the point.

“There’s nothing to it,” I finally said. “It is not a message. It is not a symbol. It’s there, and it hunts. Just like a bear, or a shark.”

“So we’re just making a monster movie,” scoffed Kellan. “Jaws 4, deep forest boogaloo?”

“There was a Jaws 4, actually,” smiled Morgan. “It was called The Revenge.”

“Oh please.”

They argued back and forth. They argued about how bad the script could get if we continued down this path. They argued about the clichés we were wandering headfirst into. And it dawned on me; they were just scared of the dark. They didn’t have control. I did.

“I got it from here,” I said. “Take the night off.”

So they did. They were still arguing in the hallway, on their way out. Moments later, Kellan turned back. He leaned in and gave me a final look.

“You know you have to show it, right?” he said. “No matter what, we can’t just have it hidden in the dark. We have to show it.”

&#x200B;

That’s where my writing stopped. No matter how I twisted and turned it, I couldn’t picture the Look-a-me. All I saw was this long arm reaching towards me, coming out of the dark. A woman’s hand, with a single painted nail.

*“Look-a-me, little boy.”*

But the more I thought about it, the more my anxiety spiked. I knew I could see it in my mind, if I wanted to. I could. But looking at it too closely, in any way, would give it the power to reach me. My mind wouldn’t let me see it. My reptile brain was reaching through my anxiety to rattle me into looking the other way. To turn my mind away from the page.

I couldn’t describe it. All I got was that… that long arm.

And I could’ve sworn I felt it brushing against the back of my neck.

&#x200B;

The second draft stalled for a couple of weeks. Pat was getting impatient. He called me into the office one rainy Wednesday afternoon to have a “serious conversation” about the rewrite.

When I got there, I was ambushed by a whole gaggle of writers. An entire team. A room full of people, who’d all been briefed. They all had printed-out copies of the first draft, and both Morgan and Kellan had told them about the issue with the rewrite. Pat wasn’t playing around; he wanted this done.

I barely got a word out before we were ushered into our seats and pushed into finishing the draft. There were about a dozen of us. Some were pretty big industry names, called in to give some pedigree to the script. One of them had worked on prosthetics for a big zombie show, and he came out swinging.

“Let’s just expand on what we got,” he suggested. “Instead of a long arm, why not several? Just… all arms.”

“Yeah,” someone chimed in. “Like it, a… saves them. The arms, I mean.”

“It adds to itself,” someone laughed. “A literal growing fear.”

“Ringu meets The Blob. Love it. Love. IT.”

&#x200B;

They were all talking over me. Through me. Past me. They didn’t know any better, and as a collective, they all looked at the Look-a-me. Not literally, of course, but figuratively. They were bringing it into focus. And even there, in the bright lights of that film studio meeting room, I could feel that darkness coming over me. My breath growing shallow. My vision turning into a pin. And in the back of my mind, I heard it.

*“Look-a-me, little boy.”*

I ran out of the office, locked myself in the bathroom, and puked my guts out. I screamed into the toilet bowl, waiting for the panic to stop. I could feel that long arm reaching for me. And the more I thought about it, the closer it got.

*“Look-a-me,”* it hissed, its voice echoing off the bathroom tiles. *“Look-a-me!”*

&#x200B;

I didn’t return to that meeting. I got in my car and went straight home to take my backup anxiety meds. I hadn’t used them in a while. I fell face-first into the bed and just collapsed into a nightmarish mid-afternoon nap. 

Later that day I poured myself a bath and a glass of red wine (non-alcoholic); even brought out some bubbles. I figured I’d stay in for the rest of the day and get takeout.

Just a few minutes into the bath, my phone started buzzing. Turns out Pat had run out of patience. They’d finished the second draft, and they were going ahead with it; with or without me. I was invited to add to it, but they weren’t gonna budge on what the ‘consultants’ had come up with. 

I skimmed it. And there it was.

&#x200B;

They had been poking at the Look-a-me for hours. There was concept art, vivid descriptions, and even a storyboard sketch.

The Look-a-me. A hundred arms from a hundred victims. An eldritch Medusa. Ringu meets The Blob. They had comparisons, charts, mood boards… one of them already had a casting suggestion for the voiceover.

&#x200B;

Then the power went out.

With a snap from the ceiling light, I was enveloped in complete darkness. In a heartbeat I went from a screenwriter back to a little boy; lost and alone in the dark. I imagined myself submerged in that forest river. I scrambled to get out. I kept slipping, as I felt the bathtub give way for river stones. I could feel them. I could smell the algae.

*“Look-a-me, little boy,”* the darkness hissed. *“They gave me a body. They look, little boy.”*

A long nail brushed against my neck.

*“You made them look-a-me. And now I can reach much, much further.”*

&#x200B;

A warmth against my cheek, as something leaned in. Sticky lips parting, like slowly pulling off a band-aid. It was right there, in the dark.

*“Thank you.”*

&#x200B;

As the lights came back on, I felt my heart skip a beat. Every square inch, every bathroom tile, every towel and shampoo bottle; it was all covered in handprints.

And for the first time since I was six years old, I screamed like my life depended on it.

Like a part of me was still stuck in those woods, hoping for my mother to find me.

&#x200B;

Over the next few days, my fear of the dark kicked into overdrive. Every time I stepped out of the light, I heard it. Little remarks, snickers, and laughter. Just closing my eyes was all it took for the sound of tapping fingers to creep closer.

I couldn’t help but to imagine it. It was no longer just an arm in the dark, it was this… this amalgamation. It poured out of every dark corner of every room. It had so many more things to say, and its arms were so much longer.

And no matter how many lights were on, and no matter how much light I let in from the windows, I could still sense it. Out of every unseen corner, out of every closed door; it was there.

And it wanted me to *look*.

&#x200B;

I was getting regular updates. They were on a third draft. Kellan and Morgan had completely taken over the writing, and I was turning more and more into a “consultant”. The project was running away from me. More concept art. More lines. More dialogue.

They were *looking* at it. I had pointed it out to them, and now they were all *looking*.

I was in a feverish panic. I could feel it growing stronger, bigger, more assertive. It was no longer just something lurking in the back of my mind, it was reaching across the river. And at every turn, at every corner, there it was.

*“Look-a-me, little boy.”*

&#x200B;

I’ll be honest, some of those days are a blur. I remember a rainy evening in the middle of the week. I was sleep-deprived, exhausted, and mentally torn.

I don’t even remember going to see Morgan. I just had this drive to stop her from looking too closely. I had to stop her from whatever was going to happen if she looked for too long.

I had to *save* her.

&#x200B;

The moment I put my hand to her door, it opened. Morgan looked at me with sleepless eyes, her hands shaking. For a moment, the two of us just looked at one another.

“I, uh… I thought you were sick,” she said. “They said you were.”

“You don’t… don’t look too great yourself,” I said, forcing a chuckle.

Every light in her apartment was on. Even her TV, a flashlight, and her laptop. Her curtains had been torn down and spread across the floor. It might’ve been evening outside, but her place was bright as day. I could put two and two together, but it felt strange saying it out loud.

“You’ve… you’ve seen it. You’ve looked, I mean.”

Morgan nodded, her head shaking up and down like a bobblehead. Poor thing was exhausted.

“It’s real,” she stammered. “How… how can it be real?”

&#x200B;

She invited me in. I sat down on her sofa, on top of a flowery curtain. Morgan’s hands were shaking so bad I could hear the spoon in her cup of tea rattle back and forth.

“It, uh… started a few days ago,” she said. “And it just… it never stops. The more I try not to think about it, the more real it gets.”

“It wants you to look,” I said. “It wants-“

“It wants to become this… this real thing. It wants us to create it. It has lived in the back of your head for years, and now it’s clawing its way out.”

“That’s… yeah. Something like that.”

“So how do we stop it?” she asked. “What, do we… do we kill you?”

She sat down next to me, holding her cup tight with both her hands.

“I don’t, uh… I don’t think so. It’s already out there.”

“But we can’t un-look at it. It’s done. It’s… it’s happening.”

&#x200B;

And the thought hit me.

What the hell would happen once an audience of thousands, or tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands, watched it? How long would it grow, just from test screening? How far across the river could the Look-a-me get, if everyone was eager to watch it?

A cold chill went up my spine. Maybe this was the plan. Maybe this was what it wanted. Maybe it pushed me towards writing to begin with. Maybe it lived in me, putting me on a path to birth it onto the world stage.

I felt sick.

&#x200B;

“I… I can’t let this happen,” I said. “If that… if it… if we shoot anything. A promo, a… a trailer. Anything. If we do the goddamn casting, or there’s a leak, or… or…”

“Oh my God.”

Morgan covered her mouth, her eyes going wild. 

“D-do you think-“

I just nodded. We were thinking the same thing. This… this mind-creature, if brought to the public, would be unstoppable.

&#x200B;

We got our coats and got out of the apartment. We had to see Pat. Maybe he was experiencing something similar. Morgan fumbled for her keys and almost stumbled over her own feet. I could hear her swearing with frustration.

The moment we got out of her apartment, it was as if time stood still. Morgan was right behind me, but something happened. There was this strange ammonia smell in the air. I slowly turned around, holding my breath.

I hadn’t thought about it, but the hallway light outside her apartment was broken. And for a moment, we were standing in darkness.

&#x200B;

One by one, the lights in her apartment went out. Twinkling on and off, like dying stars.

A pair of pale fingers dug through her hair; a single painted fingernail poked out behind her ear.

So many fingers.

&#x200B;

Morgan gasped. We looked at one another, breathlessly.

It could reach all the way across.

It could reach across the river.

&#x200B;

In a heartbeat, the door slammed shut. There was a visceral tearing, and the sound of something rolling across the floor. And outside, the lights were starting to die.

**“Look-a-me, little boy,”** the dark said. **“Look-a-me.”**

Long pale arms crawled out of every corner, reaching for me. It wasn’t even dark yet. It didn’t care.

It laughed.

&#x200B;

I refused to get trapped in the elevator, so I ran down the stairs , feeling the sole of my boots trample curious fingers with every corner I rounded. I could feel them nipping at my clothes, grasping for my neck.

I burst through the exit to the street level, knocking over a middle-aged couple as I scrambled towards my car. I didn’t even hear their insults. All I heard was my heartbeat, and that little voice growing louder every time I left the safety of the streetlights.

&#x200B;

I drove past red lights, broke every speed limit, and went down the wrong end of a one-way street. I was in a frenzy and ended up frantically knocking on Pat’s front door.

I tried to compose myself, but there was no use. My eyes were wild, and I couldn’t stop my legs from shaking. My lips quivered, like I was hypothermic.

Pat was having a small party, just like the one I’d first met him at. He was about to invite me in, but he stopped himself. Clearly, I wasn’t well.

“We gotta… we gotta stop this, Pat,” I said. “We gotta stop production.”

“What are you talking about?” he smiled. “There’s no reason to-“

“No, you’re not hearing me. This… this is not a-a… a debate.”

“I’m sorry, but I’m not going to let you talk to me like-“

&#x200B;

I heard it. That snickering, pleading little voice. Asking me to turn around, to look into the dark of the night.

*“Look. Look-a-me.”*

&#x200B;

I snapped.

I shoved the door open and forced my way inside. I picked up a small wine glass from a nearby table, stomped into the living room, and tapped it with my phone for attention.

It could be a thousand times worse. Ten thousand. A hundred thousand.

No.

&#x200B;

I barely even noticed the glass breaking, and everyone staring. At least three dozen industry professionals. People I’d looked up to my entire professional career. Hell, one of them was an A-lister.

“We’re, uh… hi,” I stammered. “We’re cancelling all production of the, uh… The Look-a-Me.”

There was a murmur in the crowd. Little smirks and pitying smiles.

“It’s happening,” I said. “It’s done. It’s gone.”

“You don’t know what you’re talking about,” groaned Pat. “I’m calling the police.”

“Do whatever you want, but if I see a single goddamn still from that production, I’m burning the goddamn studio to the ground.”

“You gotta be-“

I grabbed Pat by the collar and pushed him up against the wall, rattling his wine glasses.

“I’m *burning*. The *goddamn* *studio*. To the *ground*.”

&#x200B;

Career suicide.

Complete, absolute, career suicide.

&#x200B;

I collapsed back into my car, still holding the broken wine glass. I turned on the dome light to drown out the darkness, but it didn’t work. I flicked it a couple times, but nothing happened.

A pale hand pushed down on my door lock.

Click.

&#x200B;

*“Time to look-a-me, little boy,”* a voice whispered from the back seat, as a cold hand stroked my cheek. *“Time to look.”*

I thought back on that night from so many years ago. That absolute terror. That certainty of death. And just like then, there was this moment where fear gave way to revelation.

Of course.

&#x200B;

“You can’t kill me,” I said. “I’m the only one who’ve… who’ve really looked. I’m the only one giving you this reach.”

Cold fingers curled around my neck.

“That’s it, isn’t… isn’t it? It’s because of me. Otherwise you would’ve killed me. You would’ve stopped me from going in there.”

There was no response. Just a tightening grip. Long nails brushing my hair, grabbing at it.

“Without me, and without that show, there’s no one to look. All the drawings will be tossed. The script forgotten. It’ll just be you and me, and… and if I’m gone… there’s just you. And you’re nothing. You are, literally, nothing. You never were anything but… but nothing.”

And I turned around to look, at the look-a-me.

&#x200B;

And all I saw was a pale white hand retreating into the dark.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, it’s… it’s been a while.

I’m no longer under a studio NDA, but I’m not taking any chances. No charges were pressed, no production came to pass. It was easier to just shut it down and move on. 

You might’ve heard about Morgan. The details were graphic. And no, of course that’s not her real name. They said she had some kind of episode, and the results were… tragic. How you can do something like she did to her own head during an ""episode"" they conveniently left out. But I know.

I'll always know.

Some things out there defy our explanations. Our rationale. Some things aren’t a message, or a monster, or a theme. It just *is*. It exists because we make it exist. And it wants to be *seen*.

To me, I don’t know where the Look-a-me came from. Maybe it came from me. Maybe it ***is*** me. Or maybe it was just something that found me in the dark, and decided to stick around.

But now I know that as much as I will be stuck with it, for the rest of my life, at least that thing is equally stuck.

With me."

**Final Thoughts & Advice:**

Well, clearly,  this whole application process is so random. I didn't get admitted into any UCs except Santa Cruz, Davis, and Berkeley, so who knows what's going on there. Getting WL at Irvine was also strange, but oh well. Ensure you apply to enough schools, but ensure your essays are in tip-top shape—they must be genuine!!

I'd like to mention that using Chat GPT for general research on schools is an underrated tactic. It genuinely helped me figure out the vibe and idea behind all of these schools and saved me countless hours of research. Definitely use it, but don't abuse it (Chat-GPT essays are GARBAGE).

There are a couple of things I wish I had done differently during this application season and in high school in general.

1. GPA: Your GPA is vital to you getting through their initial filters, and if you look at almost any college's common data set, they value GPA to the max. On a 4.3 scale, my GPA was actually below average for many of these schools, and this was due to 2 Bs in Math and English. An engineering major having a B in math isn't exactly a good look, so it is imperative that you are acing the classes your major is directly related to.
2. EC List: I believe your EC list is as important as your essays. Framing a good EC list is terrifying, to be honest, and in my ED/EA round, my ECs came out as pompous and over the top. Reframing everything for the RD applications helped me come across as more genuine and a real human. Don't fluff up your hours!!! Nobody can work 18 hours a day, and AOs will be extremely suspicious seeing so many hours but a disproportionate amount of impact.
3. Essays: Be genuine. Don't try to act like you're writing a paper for your final English exam. This isn't going to be graded on a scale of 0-100 for formality and grammar, but the AOs will be grading your personality, who you are, and how you'll fit into their next class. If your essays aren't realistic, truthful, and clear on why you want to go to that school, you won't have much success.

As for where I'll commit, I have no clue yet. Check back in a month, and I'll have updated this post. Feel free to drop your thoughts; deciding between CMU, Berkeley, and Dartmouth is not something I am looking forward to.

128708j,8,2023-03-31,Is this internship worth it or should I keep searching?,kitt3ny,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/128708j/is_this_internship_worth_it_or_should_i_keep/,I had an interview for an internship and they said I would be a good fit and sent me a coding evaluation. After doing it I was thinking more about the position and whether or not it’s worth it. It’s part time and pays 15$/hr which is only 3$ more than minimum wage in my state. I’ve seen other internships of similar sized companies that are offering double that. The job is an hour away from where I live and goes through an underwater bridge notorious for accidents. I don’t really want to put all those miles on my car + money for gas if i’m only making 15$ an hour (as it is my car already gets awful gas mileage). I’m a junior and besides some junior dev minor experience in high school i don’t have other intern experience. should i keep looking for other options or take this? I don’t want to sell myself short knowing there’s better opportunities out there but I also really want an internship

The early and regular rounds felt like two sides of a coin. After getting accepted to nearly every EA college, I had a lot of confidence and hope for the RD round only to get snapped back to reality.

Although I got rejected from hella good schools, I'm grateful I got into a lot of schools, especially USC and Cornell. It took tremendous stress off of me throughout the entire school year and honestly made the senior year a lot more enjoyable.

If I had to give any tips or advice, don't get hooked on a specific school. I really didn't understand how random this process was until now.

**Essays/LORs/Interviews:** 

**Common App Essay 7.5/10:** The essay I worked on the most I ended up scrapping after applying to a handful of school regular and wrote a completely new one in one night. So roughly half my schools received the og draft and the latter half (schools w/ deadlines past Jan 5) got this one that I am rating. It was definitely reflective of my interests and values, and read somewhat smart. However, I think it doesn't really purvey my authentic voice and isn't all that creative. I really regret not working harder on this essay.

**Supps 8/10:** These obviously varied from school to school, but generally, I would say mine were pretty standard. I thought some were really good, and others were just alright. I wrote most of these in two weeks over winter break (something I also very much regret doing--should've managed time better). Strangely, I was rejected or waitlisted from schools I thought I wrote well for and accepted to those I didn't. Like the common app essay, could've worked longer and been slightly more creative with these. 

**LORs**

American & Russian History Teacher 10/10: This guy is my all-time favorite teacher and I am certainly one of his favorite students. We have built a very personal relationship since junior year and we share a lot of common ground (he also loves philosophy); this guy is really more of a personal friend than he is my superior. We've read various books together (outside of the curriculum) and meet up outside of school to debate and/or just talk and catch up. We both fangirl over Dostoevsky or Nietzsche who are the centerpieces of many of our literature discussions. I get great grades in his classes as well. He actually offered to write my LOR and said that he ""would not disappoint"" so I think it's safe to say this was a strong one.

Stats Teacher 9/10: Had this teacher in 9th grade Alg II Honors and in 12th grade stats. I do very well in her classes and really try to go above and beyond in comprehension and quality of work (which she has explicitly recognized). She has a reputation for writing strong LORs and was more than happy to write one for me (based on her reaction when I asked). 

**Interviews**

Georgetown Interview 7/10: My interviewer was super relaxed and low-key which was nice, but really just wanted to get through his questions instead of striking up an interesting conversation. Overall it went fine and my answers were good, but nothing remarkable about this one.

Stanford Interview 8/10: My interviewer was also fairly relaxed but tried harder to instigate a conversation. The first bit was mostly just going through his questions, though he would add in tangential questions based on my answers which were engaging. We started conversing for the last bit about the Hoover Institute which was great. I covered all my major talking points so I felt alright about it. However, to be totally honest, my interviewer had a bit of an accent which at times was somewhat difficult to understand (especially via Zoom), though luckily no major misinterpretation or slip-up of any kind occurred.

**Additional Information:**

I would’ve applied to Stanford REA but I got seriously concussed a week and a half before the deadline and couldn’t finish my essays. 

My path in high school was unconventional. I only really started thinking seriously about college at the end of sophomore year and some sub-optimal grades in my freshman year did some damage to my GPA. Needless to say, I had a lot of self-doubt and criticism regarding my odds at many of the schools I applied to, given the aforementioned setback. I would also describe my ECs and academic interests as somewhat unconventional, which made it hard for me to gauge whether my expectations were realistic or not. In retrospect, I realize my ECs were relatively mediocre, and my essay writing could've been better and I think my results are reflective of that. Unfortunately, I have a lot of regrets about how I spent my time in high school and the effort I put in, and I can't help but feel I might be in a better position had I worked harder. To this point, what is most disappointing is not which specific schools I got rejected from or accepted to, but knowing that their rejections are symbolic of unrealized potential (in staying consistent with being a philosophy buff, I don't measure my self-worth based on school names, or try not to at least). In the end, however, I believe my relatively unique path kinda worked out for me and I am content that I tried to stay true to my interests and values instead of entirely bending to the will of A2C haha. My advice would be along those lines: pursue things that actually interest you at a high achieving level and you will find success not just with college admissions (which is never a guarantee), but more importantly, in life."

GT:
Pro: I like the people (from office visit), and commute is only 25min. They’ll also allow me to take 2 classes. 
Con: less pay, no bonus, not big4

I’m thinking about taking GT, because I already have a Big 4 offer with EY. But what would you do?"

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

history teacher(8/10) - my junior year teacher, and we are pretty close. he's not my teacher anymore but i still talk to him. i did very well in his class, and apparently he tells other people how good of a student i am

&#x200B;

math teacher(9/10) - had him in 8th grade, 10th grade, and 11th grade. he was very familiar with my interest in math and i sometimes showed him my coding projects. did very well in his class

&#x200B;

crew coach(10/10) - he let me read it and i thought it was good. very nice words with specific details.

**Interviews**

MIT - cool guy, but a little awkward. talked a bit about an anime we both watched. kind of short but it was pleasant.

Princeton - kinda scary guy, but at the end, the conversation felt more natural. not amazing but i'd say it went well

**Essays**

looking back, my essays seem cringe. a lot of it was around being a queer person in STEM or my love of computer science. i felt that they were all truthful though. i wrote a lot of them over winter break as i was shotgunning schools, so i'd say i spent around 3 hours on each school's supplemental. my common app essay and mit essays were a few months of work thouh

**Additional Information:**

looking back, i wish i dug deeper into my interests during high school, but i didn't really figure out what i liked until senior year because of COVID limiting extracurriculars. i also wish i spent more time on my essays, but i freaked out and started shotgunning schools after being deferred from MIT. my profile definitely isn't the strongest in comparison to people on here, but i think it all worked out. i really do regret shotgunning all these schools, because a lot of my rejection list were schools i didn't like that much anyways"

**Letters of Recommendation**

I asked my English teacher from sophomore/junior years to write my first letter, because I believed that those had been some of my best classes. We developed a good connection with each other, and hopefully she was able to attest to my analytical writing skills/conversational skills. (I also completed all the homework assignments for one month in one weekend, so maybe she mentioned that too 💀 ) (8/10)

For my second letter, I asked one of my math teachers - I don't think it was my best class ever, but I feel like I demonstrated my desire to succeed in this class by always making sure to attend the office hours she hosted (she was a really awesome teacher, she hosted one hour of extra learning time literally every other week!!), and I always submitted any optional assignments she posted. Hopefully this letter provided a balance to the previous letter. (8/10)

For the additional letter of recommendation, I asked one of my private instrumental teachers - since we have worked closely together for many years, I have no doubt that she provided a really good recommendation letter!! (10/10)

**Interviews**

Princeton Interview: This one went really well!! I was able to connect with the interviewer really well, and we shared some common interests which was really cool. At the end, they mentioned that they wished they could accept me! (19/10)

Dartmouth Interview: Also went really well, and the interviewer got me super interested in Dartmouth! :D (9/10)

UPenn: Good interview as well, we didn't have much in common, but I think we still had a nice conversation :) (7/10)

Yale: This one didn't go so well - instead of flowing as a conversation, it was just a very standard ""going through the list of questions"" kind of interview. Oh well lol (4/10)

**Essays**

The amount of time I spent on essays between all the schools I applied to varied, so I'd say most of them fall in the 7-9/10 range lol. I mainly focused on how writing connected to personal experiences in my life, and about how much I truly love studying the environment despite not actually having any extracurriculars related to it. I also devoted some time to mentioning my love for studying the classics (I've been studying Latin/Greek/ancient history since 1st grade lol!), and chess.

This gives me a potential option to speed up my graduation.

Pros:

* Speeds up my graduation by 1 semester from June 2024 to December 2023
* Would get me into the job market quicker -- Would this be a pro or con?

Cons:

* I will likely miss out on certain 400 level CS courses that aren't offered in the Summer or the 1 Winter semester I am there (likely missing one of Distributed Systems and Intelligent Systems)


I also have the option of just taking 1 or 2 classes to reduce load on my final year of university so I can really focus on interviewing for jobs.

Note that I actually do have a verbal return offer from a previous internship, though I don't know if that offer will still stand by the end of the year, so I don't want to rely too much on that being an option when I graduate.

In this situation, what would you recommend doing?"

I posted a similar post about a month ago but that was more so in regard to my ECs. As I'm currently in limbo and trying to plan for the future, I wanted to post a ""Chance Me"" to see what this subreddit thought about my chances.

Backstory: Current Ivy student (Brown/Columbia/Penn) who is applying after a traumatic SA experience this past fall semester. No hooks, also requiring some financial aid. Am currently a junior, and am only applying due to my SA experience. In my Personal Statement/Why Transfer essay, I did honestly and transparently explain my reason but made sure to focus on why I believed \_\_\_\_\_ school was a good fit for me in other supplements. I recognize that I'd have to redo my junior year, but as I sit here typing in my dorm, I can't imagine returning here after what I've gone through.

College GPA: 4.0/4.0

HS GPA: 3.99/4.0

SAT: 1550

Demographics: Asian Female (from Malaysia), applying for financial aid (partial)

Major: Psychology, Sociology

Recs: Should be all 10/10 as I'm very close with all the profs I asked, had 3 professor recs and 1 peer rec

Honors: Numerous Honor Roll awards at current Ivy, Cello National Awards from HS, 3x State Champion  in high school competitive club (think DECA/BPA/FBLA/FFA/HOSA/FCCLA), 2x International Finalist (Top 10) in high school competitive club (think DECA/BPA/FBLA/FFA/HOSA/FCCLA), Special Recognition from college professor for Special Achievement in Psychology

College ECs:

1. Internship at a reputable strategy consulting firm
2. Founder of early-stage education nonprofit
3. Research scholar in a prestigious program at school (neuroscience-focused)
4. Research assistant in the energy department at my school (focused on psychology of energy usage)
5. Executive leader of political consulting firm (oversaw congressional/gubernatorial campaigns, including some currently elected officials)
6. Membership chair in sorority

ECs started in High School, still active in College:

1. Musician/Composer (won national-level awards in high school and releasing music on Apple Music/Spotify soon)
2. Independent Creative Writer (written and published over 300k words online with over 40k reads and over 500 reviews)
3. Academic/Cello Tutor (paying for college through self-employed tutoring business, 98 students in past 5 years)

High School ECs (at least the ones mentioned in my apps):

1. Varsity Swimming Captain (also school record holder)
2. President of 103-member Competitive Club (think DECA/BPA/FBLA/FFA/HOSA/FCCLA)
3. President of 84-member Competitive Club (think DECA/BPA/FBLA/FFA/HOSA/FCCLA)
4. Founder of a student-run nonprofit organization (raised thousands of dollars, think 5 figures, for underprivileged Diabetes patients who can't afford treatment on their own and research)
5. Internship at a reputable biotech company (studied systems health and researched social/psychological impact of certain diseases on patients/loved ones)
6. Volunteer at a hospital in Malaysia for a summer (my family is from there)

Colleges Applied To: All Ivies besides Princeton (and my current one ofc), Duke, Northwestern, Stanford, I also haven't applied yet but think I'll shoot my shot at UChicago since it's rolling (I recognize it's on the late end now).

I know some people thought I could get into these schools after seeing my ECs before, but am curious if after hearing my story (read: current junior/SA victim) they believe it's a longer shot now. I recognize that all of these schools are so so hard to get into but I'm just so desperate to leave. Unfortunately, my parents told me they don't want me ""transferring down"" which to them is everything besides these schools, and I need their financial support."

**Additional Information (REFLECTION):**

This is my almost my 2nd anniversary since I discovered A2C/Chanceme/collegeresults. As a disillusioned sophomore student, I was so shocked to see the other people's applications, especially the CS students. USACO Plat. International awards. T20 Research. Internships. I had no idea these opportunities even existed beyond the overtly competitive atmosphere that is present around these subreddits. I really had to start ramping things up during my junior year to ""catch up"" with all these other CS students but ultimately I ended up being an ""average"" student compared to some of the monster applications I've seen on here before. You'll notice that I had no ""hooks"" for my extracurriculars. I think my extracurriculars were definitely one of my weakest points of my app.

As for this year's college admissions process, I think it was pretty tough. Record lows for several top universities. CS definitely being oversaturated nowadays made entry even more difficult for the schools that I applied to. Intl makes it 10x worse. I can't find the link right now but a couple months back, someone posted the acceptance rates for top 20 CS schools and they were pretty much all <5%. Absolutely crazy. I learned that the application process is literally the lottery, and it's the numbers game you have to play in order to have somewhat successful results. 

My essays weren't any spectacular works either. I spent a fair amount of time on them, but it was certainly difficult to manage \~50+ college essays while studying for first term mock exams and doing two IAs and an EE in the same month (IB students know my struggle 😤). One thing I look back on and hoped that I did was starting sooner. I spent my summer not doing much work besides studying for the SAT. I wish I spent the hours that I wasted on the essays.

With that being said, I am definitely proud of myself in getting into UMich. It was definitely one my top schools to attend, and I am very honored that I have the opportunity to attend. 

If you're a sophomore or a junior like I once was, I want to give you my three most important advice that I can give to find success in your college process.  


1. Do NOT compare yourself to other applications you see on here or on chanceme. As a matter of fact, you should minimize the time you spend on here. I think it's a toxic environment to be in considering the idea that you're constantly in the mindset where you have to be competing against these absolute monstrous academic weapons to attend the school you want to go to. It's not a bad idea to see what you're up against, but if you're constantly on here thinking whether you're ""good enough""... you got other problems to worry about. Work hard, do not take the chance to be lazy, and be resilient to the inevitable problems you will face throughout your high school years. 
2. START EARLY. I can't emphasize this enough. I know that some people on here might disagree with this point, saying that you should enjoy your time throughout high school, and you don't need to dedicate your entire life towards the admissions process. Yes, that advice is true, but I hold the belief that you should not neglect the things that need to be done. If you had the chance to start first in a race and get an advantage, why would you not go first? 
3. If I could give my biggest piece of advice, it would be this. KEEP MOVING FORWARD. There will be days when you don't feel like writing supplemental essays, and there will be days where you get a bad grade in your calc test and now you're unmotivated to do anything else. You must keep moving forward. When a rocket is flying out towards space, it doesn't stop in the middle. There will always be new mountains to climb, but they won't be climbed if you don't keep walking. 

Hopefully my words and my thoughts will have some value to whoever stuck through and read through my little rant/reflection. If you have any questions for me, please feel free to shoot me a DM! I would love to help out. Lastly...

**Letters of Recommendation**

Counselor: likely very generally positive, I knew her decently and had many talks with her but there was no real personal connection. She did give me a perfect score when she rated my course rigor, however.

History Teacher: Really liked the guy, but again, likely generically positive. No real connection, and I only have him during my junior year.

C++ Professor: It was a self studied class over the summer. I was the first to finish his class so he offered to write me a letter. I accepted, but the trend continues. No real personal connection.

**Interviews**

UPenn Interview: Went really well. Very nice older lady, she helped me get more enthusiasm for my ED school before promptly getting rejected.

Stanford Interview: Almost perfect interview. I managed to elaborate on my first EC greatly while also showing a high level of intellectual curiosity. Very comfortable interview.

**Essays**

UC Essays: These were decent but not my best work. Displayed some of my passions as well as my service hours/leadership.

UPenn Essays: Pretty bad. I'll leave it at that.

USC Essays: Slightly better than UPenn but still not great.

Stanford, Duke, Brown, Rice: My best works, simply as I had the most experience writing at this point. Stanford in particular was very good imo, I was able to express my intellectual curiosity. The important part of these essays is I was able to write (imo) strong Why Us essays.

**Additional Information:**

Alright, this little experiment of mine is complete. I know that a couple of people were interested in this course of action, so hopefully, this post will be enlightening to a few people in the future. 

There are a couple of points to keep in mind when viewing these results. My early application essays were relatively mediocre. The USC and the UPenn ones in particular were very much lacking. When viewing my decisions from private schools, I think one factor that negatively impacted my application significantly was my recommendation letters. I honestly don't think that they provided an especially impressive view of me. Generically positive, sure. But I don't think they depicted me as a brilliant student or anything like that. 

Overall, I'm pretty neutral about my results. UCSD and UCSB are great schools, for which I am happy that I got accepted, but I definitely greatly overrated my application when looking at how I got a clean set of rejections to basically every private school. 

At this point, I have a couple of options to consider: 

1. I commit to UCSD, which is my current top choice, and pray to God for my waitlists. My issue with this option is that the school I got into within UCSD is not great for STEM subjects (ERC has a ton of humanities requirements). Also, I would ideally like to study CS. 
2. I can attend community college for one year, graduating a year early from high school, and transfer (local CC has an 80% acceptance rate to UCLA, yes I realize that this is not the same for CS). My hesitation is that I will miss out on a significant amount of connections and might have a harder time making friends. 
3. I can continue and take my senior year with a heavily restricted courseload (I'm burnt out as hell). During this year, I will spend the majority of my time grinding out college essays and improving the current essays I have written out. My concerns here are that I am not even close to guaranteed improved or even the same results as this year. 

I really need advice on which course of action would be the best. One thing to consider is that I am set to travel overseas this summer to work in person at an internship for a couple of months, which might substantially help my application."

128dh0f,2,2023-04-01,Questions about RU-NB from a CS student,k_dao,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/128dh0f/questions_about_runb_from_a_cs_student/,"Hey all,

I'm an international student who've got admitted to Rutgers-NB with a major in Computer Science, and the registration deadine is coming up but I'm still stuck between R-NB and another school. Because of that, I have some questions regarding Rutgers-NB as follows:

1. **Location:** is Rutgers-NB far from the city centre, and are there any great and/or bad experiences living in living in New Brunswick (I'm particularly concerned about the weather, since I come from a tropical country, so I'd love to know more about how to cope with the cold here). Also, is it compulsory for international freshmen to live and eat on campus?
2. **Activities:** RU-NB is a big school with lots of clubs and events, so I really want to know your club recommendations, specifically CS and engineering-related clubs, but any club will do.
3. **Courses for Comp Sci:** are there many projects/researches in the curriculum, or do I have to independently search for them? Do the professors hold classes most of the time, or will they give the undergrad classes to TAs (since I've heard that does happen in some schools)?
4. **Honors College:** I've been invited to Honors College, and I want to know what kind of privilege I can have over non-Honors student. Will I have access to special facilities, and can I actually lose my status if my grades drop?
5. **Opportunities:** is it easy to land an internship in RU-NB, and will it be difficult balancing intern jobs and studies at the same time? I'm going to do my best to keep my FinAid, so I don't want to risk and lose it all.

These are my questions, and I'd love to hear your answers, since anything will help me tremendously with my decision-making.

Thanks a lot guys and have a nice day!"

My potential merits are my grades (GPA 3.9) and coauthoring 6 papers (but in a large variety of fields when I wasn't sure what I wanted to do - biology, quantum physics, biochemistry, and economics).

UChicago - wrote some of my best essays here. Quirky essay revolved around a previous prompt that i edited a bit, and managed to connect a v niche thing to my ancestral heritage and culture. Why UChicago was also filled with unique experiences cuz of my sister.

Wharton - amazing essays according to all who read them, included a lot of specific stuff and stories as well.

Essays for the rest were also decent I’d say, not something that’d make me an auto admit definitely, but pretty good i guess.

**Decisions:**

*Acceptances:*

* USC (EA) w/ Presidential Scholarship (half-tuition)
* Northwestern University (RD)
* NYU Stern (RD)
* UCSD

*Waitlists:*

* UCLA
* Dartmouth University (RD)
* Columbia University (RD)

*Rejections:*

* UChicago EA → RD deferred, then rejected.
* Harvard RD
* Yale RD
* Princeton RD
* UPenn Wharton RD
* Stanford RD
* Duke RD
* UC Berkeley

**Thoughts**:

**#1** \- It didn't all work out the way I'd have wanted. NYU Stern is fucking great, I def know that, but can't help but feel a bit saddened by all the rejections, especially Wharton, given the amount of Wharton-specific stuff on my profile, as well as the LORs from Wharton-affiliated people, and the fact that my best essays were for them.

**#2** \- Another thing that could've affected me was that there were also some issues with my school since there was some drama regarding an applicant faking their resume, and that resulted in the school getting only 2 ivy acceptances in RD, while we have historically gotten more than 10 every year. We also got no acceptances from Duke, Stanford, or UChicago, despite historically getting at least 3-4, and having really great applicants this year.

**#3** \- Nevertheless, for all you internationals out there - there's a lot of luck involved in this process, especially if you're an applicant from an extremely competitive country like India or China. So definitely ensure that you've got good backups somewhere. I went all out for the USA, applying only to super-reaches because I knew that I had a good backup in India in case nothing worked out.

Keep looking out for opportunities for all types of extracurriculars, since they're a really important part of your application, and definitely ensure that your essays don't look refined or artificial, they should be something that makes the AO feel a personal connection with you.

**#4** \- Most importantly, don't let college decisions ever define you or what you'll achieve in life. If y'all have any questions whatsoever, feel free to DM, I'll be down to help out. Good luck to my juniors, wish y'all the best!"

I was wondering what good safety/target/reach schools I'd pick for applications next year as well as anything I could do by next December to further improve my profile for admissions. 

Here are some schools I've been looking at and where I think I'd stand for them (I could obviously be super misguided): 

1. Reaches: Stanford, MIT CSE, CMU, Berkeley, Princeton MSE
2. Targets: UT Austin, UIUC, GTech, UCLA
3. Safeties: Purdue, NEU, UW-Madison, others?

My Profile (not international): 

1. 3.8-ish GPA CS w/ a Math Minor at a T10 CS School (graduating in 3 currently finishing up my second year)
2. 2 Internships (one at F500 and one at a FAANG this coming summer)
3. 4th author publication at a pretty good security conference
4. Course Assistant for 2 undergrad courses for a semester each. 

Appreciate any advice I could get. Thanks."

So is it better to leave and focus on targeting good companies, considering market is tight. Or should i stay here, gain some experience and then switch."

&#x200B;

***Interviews***

Georgetown - Was the most stressful yet coolest one. My interviewer gave zero f\*\*\*\* and was utterly blunt. Super intimidating but he definitely liked me, even though he grilled the life out of me. 9/10

Rice University - Kinda mid cause the guy didn't say much at all. Seemed really timid and sorta just absentmindedly there. Wasn't good, wasn't bad. 6/10

Northwestern - Pretty good, guy was super chill and more so focused on who I was as an individual as opposed to what I accomplished. Fun interview. 8/10

**Essays**

I would say my personal statement was pretty solid, and I felt that it covered who I was pretty well. 8/10 

Supplements were usually dicey across all schools with me having barely any ideas on what to really write. This was especially true for schools like Harvard and UMich as my parents basically forced me to apply for those. 5/10

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

***Acceptances:***

* Texas A&M (RD)
* UMich (RD)

***Waitlists:***

* Cornell (RD)
* Carnegie Mellon (RD) (Technically priority waitlist)

* Northwestern (RD)

Final Thoughts:

If I were, to sum up this whole experience, I would say that there is always a chance. Going into this I knew I was pretty much fated to be rejected from most of these schools. My ec's and grades just weren't good enough to get in. Still, there is always a chance that a fluke happens. That something completely out of the blue comes and lands on your lap. And for me, that happened. I know for others, they got rolled, and I'm not saying that whoever is reading this won't also get rolled, but I just wanted to tell you that even if you think there are the slimmest of chances, that's still a chance. Shoot your shot because, in my opinion, in the end, you can at least say that you gave it your all.

And a last tidbit on top of this tidbit, is that getting waitlisted for me personally may have sucked, but it also made me happy. Happy about the fact that my application(this very weak one) was competitively viable and that not all my time was wasted.

Look on the brighter side of things, because you never know what the super-intoxicated admissions officer will do to your application. They could very much accept it.

Stay hopeful.

**Letters of Recommendation**

I waived my rights via FERPA so I’m just guessing here.

English Teacher (7/10): Had her for both junior and senior year, had a pretty good relationship with her in class and always did my work- nothing extraordinary. She's a good writer though, so I trust her letter!

Bio Teacher (6/10): TBH only really chose her because I thought you needed one STEM and one humanities rec for every school. She definitely saw my academic side (I pestered her a lot about my Bio IA...) but beyond that I'm not sure...

Counselor (7/10): Didn't really know counselor too well, but I filled out her worksheet pretty thoroughly. She also asked for some of my other teachers to give her insight, so I had my IB Music and my orchestra director give her more info about me from a different point of view. She has lots of experience writing letters so I'm sure she was able to put together a good letter from all of the info she got from me and other teachers.

**Interviews**

Georgetown (6/10): my first interview, it was in-person and in the interviewer's office. Needless to say, I was terrified and spent 5 minutes in my parent's car just doing last-minute rehearsing before actually getting out. It went OK- it was decent for a first interview, but I think I rambled a bit too much about my academic self and didn't really get into my personality/hobbies and what really made me, me. Interviewer's interests didn't really line up with mine beyond academics so thats what we naturally focused about. It was a solid hour, but very chill in the end (I shouldn't have been that stressed lol).

Princeton (7/10): Was much more prepared for this interview. It was virtual, and lasted like 40 minutes. She asked me a few questions- I think I was definitely able to express and articulate myself a lot better compared to my Georgetown one, but I'm afraid I was thrown a bit off guard about the ""Why Princeton/major"" question she asked me and so my answer for that wasn't as perfect. Otherwise, I spent the last like 10-15 minutes asking her about Princeton stuff. It was a standard interview.

Columbia/Sciences Po Dual Degree Program (9/10): this interview was definitely my best interview by far because I was hella stressed for it, so I researched as much as I could about it- I really demonstrated my interest in Asian politics through specific examples, and I was well-articulated about why I wanted to attend not one, but two prestigious schools in the span of 4 years (and like, why France specifically). The Sciences Po admissions officer was having some connectivity issues but besides that it was a very solid interview.

Franklin and Marshall (9/10): It was with a current, international student, and we basically bonded over wanting new experiences in college and like this idea of college in general. He said that I was one of his favorite interviewees so that was nice?? Got to ask him a lot about the school and I was very passionate in my answers, much more chill than Georgetown/Princeton ones (tbh those top-schools kinda psyched me out...)

Wesleyan (7/10): I can't really remember what went down in this one tbh. At this point senioritis was kicking in and everything was mostly a blur LMFAO.

**Essays**

My CommonApp essay was... probably not the best. Topic was kind of basic, and the writing was meh. Unfortunately, I didn't really have time to edit it, because I got super busy with MUN things in the fall + senioritis hit early... so I really tried to perfect my supps. It was still a solid essay overall and I liked it, but I wish I started brainstorming about it earlier so I could've found a more niche idea/used some of the ideas I had in my supps for this main essay. Definitely should've done my dream school applications (ie, Georgetown) last instead of first since I naturally got so much better over time. Don't underestimate how your writing ability can skyrocket in the span of 5 months!!

**Additional Information:**

This whole journey has definitely been a process. I came into the college app process thinking I had a solid chance at schools like Georgetown, Boston U, and Northeastern, with UPenn as a hard reach. I ended up not even applying to UPenn and getting rejected from Georgetown, BU, and NEU, but got some amazing acceptances that came really out of the blue (still reeling over WashU.... like I applied on a whim???).

I do really regret applying to all of the OOS public schools that I did- especially the UCs- since I can't afford OOS tuition,  but I think overall my list was rather balanced. Seeing all of those reaches reject me stung (Georgetown sent me on an emotional rollercoaster and my heart dropped when I found out that BU had a 10% acceptance rate this year) but all it takes is one reach for there to be success! I'm most likely going to end up committing to Columbia/Science Po (top school in France AND in US??? Hell yeah!), but all in all I'm so glad that this process is finally over <3 going to take a long fucking nap."

Interviews

* Upenn (10/10): The interviewer and I discussed even more than the allocated time. He was an intl student too, did IB, and I name-dropped a club at Penn in which he coincidentally took part so we really saw that we had a lot in common. Great experience.

Essays

* UC Essays (7/10): Truth be told I wrote my UC essays on the same day with no one but my friends proofreading them.
* Common App Essay (9/10): My Common App essay on the other hand was proofread by my counselor and a LOT of my relatives. I spent relatively 8-10 hours in total perfecting it. Briefly hooked the reader by mentioning my wide family lineage (grandpa had 132 kids, I’m a child from a polygamous family). I intertwined this fact with the bullying I received in middle school and high school due to my background and my good grades. Ended up with the success story of creating a zero-tolerance bullying policy in my school, IG page against social anxiety, and being willing to help anyone that comes my way.

Additional Information:

* I would recommend using Collegevine to review your essays. You will find some really cool and nice people that will give accurate feedback rather than paying thousands of dollars to experts and maybe end up rejected.
* These admissions taught me that college admissions also include luck because what where the odds of me getting such finaid and acceptances when I did most of my college apps alone and depressed after my Harvard deferral? Anyways best of luck to the class of 2028.
* The journey will be excruciating and demanding but please have an appropriate amount of safeties, targets, and reaches to finish this journey with at least one uni.
* My SAT score wasn’t that great but I still managed to land 2 ivies (and a likely) so I would really emphasize on being well-rounded and having a pertaining story. Your application needs to have a theme and paint a clear image of who you are as a person."

If I don't take the summer classes I'll graduate Fall 2024, which means I'll be eligible for internships during Summer 2024. What should I do?"

128keq2,40,2023-04-01,About Deciding on a Career Path (and a bit more),S4stalavista,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/128keq2/about_deciding_on_a_career_path_and_a_bit_more/,"Hi everyone,

My question is basically how to decide on a career path, but the post will be a bit long as my background is not very ordinary. I’d appreciate any advise.

I’m (27 M) a 3rd-year(3/4) computer science student from Turkey. I did a detour of studying medicine before this, so I’m officially an M.D. but am not practicing medicine. I’m studying and working as an intern at a very small company doing data engineering for the last few weeks now. I want to move to Europe after graduating next year (maybe US too) if my country doesn't show any sign of improvement.

Some background:

I studied medicine because my parents kind of pushed me into it. Few months before graduating I realized I managed to get through university, but I wasn’t gonna be happy and would have to ""get through my entire career"" if I continued on this path. So I decided to wait a few more months to get the degree and do what I would have done 6 years earlier. Follow something I’m (kind of) passionate about: problem solving, math, computers(spending time looking at a computer screen). I knew nothing more than an average person before starting computer science. I tried learning python by reading an endless blog during med school once. Couldn’t figure out how to stop my while true loop and left it there to study cell biology I completely forgot about now.

Right now I’m still quite far from being competent in any branch of computer science. I’m a decent student. I’m very responsible, have a relatively high GPA and still am kind of smart. But I definitely don’t feel like I did in my prime years of learning. For some of it I blame med school. Since I didn’t like it I just tried to memorize and pass the exams. So I ended up getting dumber and lazier over the years. I forgot most of the math I knew and I’m still not as good as I used to be 10 years ago in high school. The rest is all me as I’m refreshing my social media most of the day and can’t get focused on anything unless I’m trying to automate something in a few hours that takes me 2 seconds a day.

No matter what, I’m loving computer science and am really glad I started doing this. However, as you might have understood, I’m not very good at letting things go. I couldn’t even quit med school. Now I’m having the same issue with where I want to go with my future career. I “feel like” SWE jobs won’t be very safe from the AI, but I enjoyed my few small projects. I’m kind of into data science and machine learning as there are numbers and I still love numbers, even though I’m not great with them. Finally, I’m learning computer networks this semester and kind of enjoying the assignments so far. I’ll definitely take a cybersecurity course next semester, but other than that I never even used Linux and my knowledge level is watching Mr. Robot if that counts for anything.

I wanna “catch ‘em all” and not give up on anything(\*) but doesn’t seem realistic or necessary and I’m aware I need to decide before too late as my internships start shaping my career already. Cybersecurity and AI/ML internships are not very easy to come by and unless you have an internship or some serious experience the few positions are very unlikely to hire you as a junior. Initially I was waiting to be taught what I need to learn. Then I realized it won't work this way and I have to practice a lot and trial & error will teach me the most of it. But then I had an exchange semester and an internship that I only wrote a few unit tests.

Right now I'm trying to catch up with everything by doing regular workload of courses, an internship, watching YouTube videos to have some general knowledge about CS etc. But I don't and won't have much time to experience cybersecurity/machine learning/SWE. I can work for hours on end. But while I'm trying to learn Javascript I can't stop thinking ""Why am I not learning cybersecurity right now or trying to make a model to predict the number of players for that game I made a year ago, it will be a good ML practice?""

**The Question / TLDR:** I'm a bit indecisive and don't have a lot of time to choose between the fields I'm most interested in. So what would you say that I MUST know or experience about each field(cybersecurity, SWE, AI/ML) or in general before deciding on one of the career paths and following it? I'm gonna be 28 when I graduate so I don't really want to continue for an MSc.

Sorry for the long post. I wanted to give a proper background and convey my feelings. I read a few posts about physicians considering switching careers, I can also try answering your questions if you have any.

**P.S.:** I had some interviews with companies doing medical stuff but they are all reading and writing medical papers nonstop. I’d have been a professor if I wanted to do that. So unless I can focus mostly on the programming side I don’t really want a job like that (that is unless you want to pay me a lot of money).

(\*) *“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”* \- Sylvia Plath"

Maybe I underestimated myself by not applying to more reach schools but I am satisfied with my results. Here are my stats:

**Demographics**

* Gender: Female
* Race/Ethnicity: African-American (a US citizen but grew up in Nigeria)
* Residence: Illinois
* Income Bracket: Low-income
* Type of School: Selective public high school
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): URM

**Intended Major(s)**: Business (Accounting or Finance), Statistics at some schools

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 3.9 UW, 4.8 W
* Rank (or percentile): school does not rank
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 1 AP class completed, 4 Dual Enrollment
* Senior Year Course Load: AP Calculus BC, AP Comp Sci Principles, Orchestra, English, and a Paid Internship which I get credits for

**Standardized Testing**

*List the highest scores earned and all scores that were reported.*

* SAT I: 1500 (720RW, 780M) \*Digital SAT
* SAT I: 1490 (730RW, 760M) \*Paper SAT
* AP/IB: AP Physics 1 (3)

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

*List all extracurricular involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc.*

1. **Paid internship (definitely the most important thing on this list):** I was lucky enough to get an internship with a law firm's accounting department. It's a one-year internship which counts as a class that I get graduation credits for. I have to work 4 hours a day, 5 days a week (one day is in-person) but I am allowed to call off from work 3 times a quarter. During long breaks, like Spring break, I work full-time (8 hours a day). With just part-time work, I make about $1,100 a month. 20 hrs./wk.
2. **Co-op Education Program:** The program that gave me the internship above. They basically taught me about accounting over the summer and since school started, I have to attend meetings where we talk about post-secondary options, college applications, decisions, and financial aid. 3 hrs./wk.
3. **Tutoring Job:** This was my first job. I got it March last year and have been doing it ever since. Basically, I help kids, ages 4 to 16, with different levels of math. When I first started, I was working about 12 hours each week but now, I only work on weekends so 3-5 hours. On Common App, I put 12 hrs./wk.
4. **Orchestra:** I entered high school with no musical experience and chose to play the cello. Progressed into a higher orchestra and am now first chair. There is an even higher-level orchestra but I was not good enough/prepared for that. 7 hrs./wk.
5. **Community Service:** I was part of Key Club and volunteered whenever the event seemed fun. At the time of applying, I had 63 service hours. No leadership positions or awards. 3 hrs./wk.
6. **Family Responsibilities:** I added this because I do spend a lot of time taking care of my 3-year-old nephew. When his mother, my sister, is at work or sleeping (she does night shifts), I take him to and pick him up from daycare, feed him, make sure he is not self destructing. She takes care of him whenever she is off work and does not need to sleep in the morning, including taking care of his hygiene, doing his homework with him, communicating with his teachers, etc. Just adding that to show that she is in no way dumping her responsibility on me and I am just helping out when she needs me. 34 hrs./wk.

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.* 

I did not get a lot of awards so I added honor roll. Principal's scholar is like honor roll but for students with weighted GPAs higher than 4.75.

1. Honor Roll
2. Principal's Scholar
3. College Board African American Recognition Award

**Letters of Recommendation**

These are guesses because FERPA.

1. Junior year math teacher: She is super nice and I was one of her high-scoring students. She was also my advisory teacher. Probably my favorite high school teacher. Was super excited for me, teared up even, when I told her about my acceptances. I would guess 9/10.
2. Summer accounting teacher: 0/10 because he never wrote it. Asked him for a letter of rec in November, reminded him in January and February. He was super nice every time I asked again and would tell me that he would do it. By March, it felt awkward bothering him for a recommendation when he is not required to write one so I just let it go.

**Interviews**

None

**Essays**

Common App - My personal statement talked about the time I visited my father's hometown as a child. I talked about how, compared to children from our country, I realize that I am privileged and would try my hardest to make the most out of the opportunities I have access to. Pretty normal stuff tbh so 7/10.

UChicago - Wrote their quirky essay in a day. I chose the ""find x"" prompt and wrote a story about a private investigator trying to find the heir to a large amount of money. I would give it a 6/10.

Wharton - I am way too lazy to go check what I wrote about and if they were good because it didn't matter after I didn't turn in a second letter of recommendation.

I did my best on all my essays because I knew that they matter so nothing was half-assed. Well, except all the ""Why University?"" essays.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

I applied to 14 schools because I had a fee waiver. 8 of them were safeties which all accepted me, except UPitt (waitlisted). Here are the remaining 6 schools:

*Acceptances:*

* NYU Stern (granted a full-ride scholarship 😮!!!)
* UIUC (rejected for business, accepted for Stats) (granted full-ride with a combination of merit and need aid)
* University of Wisconsin-Madison

*Waitlists:*

* UChicago (accepted spot on waitlist)
* URichmond (rejected spot on waitlist)

*Rejections:*

* UPenn (I'll never know if this was an auto-reject because no rec letter or if they actually looked at my application)

**Additional Information:**

NYU's acceptance shook my entire family because they didn't even know I applied. I didn't do their essay because it was optional and just applied because I wanted a chance at one more reach school. I think my internship played a big part in this tbh so I am thankful for that. I already committed to UIUC but I will most likely withdraw and commit to NYU.ヾ(≧▽≦\*)o Can't wait to feel major imposter syndrome."

I've been accepted into both programs but I have not made up my mind. Brief overview of the programs: Michigan's program in survey and data science is more focused on survey methodology and sampling while the master of arts in computational social science is more about big data analysis and modeling.

UMich
Pros: master of science in survey and data science is a program slightly more directly aligned to what career I hope to do (survey statistician), really interesting classes as part of the program, smaller class size (40), very large alumni network, required summer internship

Cons: expensive, cold, Ann Arbor not close to many of my friends or family (not a huge deal)

UChicago
Pros: 15k per year cheaper than UMich, huge name recognition, program more flexible in elective options (I can take survey and sampling courses that I would otherwise lack), job prospects more flexible as well as a result, more academically inclined, hyde park is a beautiful place to live, strong alumni network, advisor recommends the school highly and thinks I would fit in nicely.

Cons: program slightly less aligned to my career goals but still highly applicable to related fields, also cold

If anyone has any opinions about these programs or schools that would also be greatly appreciated."

**Essays**

CommonApp, 7.5/10: I worked for like two years on it, it was about my hatred of sand on my toes at the beach, and how I learned to make peace with the large waves in order to overcome hardship, despite my fear of water. Metaphor for facing difficult situations head on. I SWEARRR its better than what I'm explaining lol, but a little quirkier than I would have liked. I also kind of fucked up the last sentence.

Art Supps 10/10: I really liked all of them !!! Way more than my IR ones...but I guess the unis didn't like them back hahaha. Mainly centred around colonialism and how I mix my passion for history w/ fine art.

128lz0g,9,2023-04-01,Math major w/ CS certificate or Transfer out?,bluefantong,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/128lz0g/math_major_w_cs_certificate_or_transfer_out/,"My graduation year is 26’ but I started a semester late, so instead of fall 2022 my first semester is spring 2023 (this semester). I am already at a disadvantage since I started a semester late, and my goal is to graduate by spring 26’ or sooner. I am a first gen student so honestly I was/am really lost about college process, so I committed to UT as undeclared in the CNS when I didn’t get the major I wanted. After entering UT undeclared I realized how hard it is to internal transfer. I really want to major in CS, but internal transfer to CS is next to impossible. Also, they only accept applications during spring, so I would have wait until next spring to apply and IF I get in I would start fall of 24’and essentially it will take me 5-6 years graduate. I am already a semester late plus adding another 2 years, that is assuming I get into CS, is just not realistic!

My options are to:

1) Major in math, get a certificate in elements of computing, and minor in business. Do internships and build personal projects on my own to get into the tech field.

Cons:

When I told my advisor about wanting to major in math and getting a certificate in CS she seemed a bit apprehensive, I don’t know why. Plus just having a bachelor is Math won’t have many job opportunities and I don’t plan on going to grad school or math field in general. I just chose math as possibility since many people here on Reddit seemed to have taken the route of Math and CS certificate if they don’t get into CS. 


2) Transfer out of UT.

Cons: 

I am finally settling into UT, I really like it here, and I am in state student so the tuition is manageable. I also don’t want to go through the application process and start over at a new school. 

Finally…
What should I do? I am really confused, I know my who life isn’t depended on this decision but that is how it feels like right now. I am seriously considering option 1, does it sound realistic and feasible? I know math major is going to be hard and I am not the smartest but I work hard, but will hard work be enough? I really don’t want to consider option, but I will if I have too."

**Letters of Recommendation**

1. English Teacher (10/10): super close with him. we talk weekly about both academic and non-academic things; he was close to my sibling as well and knows my family. he's known for writing fantastic recs and explicitly stated that mine was the best this year. he read a part to me - very personal. so thankful for this one

2. Calc Teacher (6-7/10): taught me two years & kept in touch this year. was a strong student and participated, but didn't really stand out. probably generic

3. Engineering Teacher (9/10): she's known me for 7 years; was my mentor & coach for basically every science activity. very close to her and she wrote about pretty unique things, but she was only my teacher pre-high school so used as an additional rec when possible.

4. Research Mentor (8/10): we were fairly close; she knew a lot about my non-research activities and expressed that I was a very strong intern. used this anywhere that accepted additional recs.

**Interviews**

Had one for MIT, Stanford, Duke, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, WashU, Rice

They were all 7-8/10; none really stood out to me other than my MIT interview, which was almost 3 hours long and also my first interview lol... everything else I think I connected solidly with each but nothing exceptional

**Essays**

\- common app (7.5/10) was about my job as a bobarista and how making drinks changed my mindset towards breaking out of my comfort zone... lowkey kind of stupid but the writing was ok

\- spent 2 months on MIT supps but they ended up over-edited and not genuine. they were my first supps written so not the best

\- basically every non-ivy was a copy pasted essay that was slightly edited (6-7/10)

\- yale, duke, harvard i spent a good amount of time on; very school-specific and personal (8/10)

\- i think my stanford supps were the realest things i've ever written so was a bit disappointed about being waitlisted (10/10 lol)

&#x200B;

overall i could've spent a much longer amount of time on my essays, but since i was shotgunning i didn't have as much time to use. i really recommend saving your top schools for the end, since you'll have much better ideas and experience with writing/drafting and your essays will be more genuine. if you'd like to see specific essays or want more advice feel free to dm.

i'm also not the best personal writer :(

Nonetheless, super excited - will be hoping to get off of Stanford's waitlist - and I'd love to answer any questions/provide any advice! (Speaking of advice, I've always wanted to mentor some people through the college process for free but am I even qualified to do that lol... lmk)"
128mfbs,3,2023-04-01,TLDR: VERY rocky transition into new leadership role and addictions facility. Do I submit to pressures of group or do I stand my ground?,angstelique,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/128mfbs/tldr_very_rocky_transition_into_new_leadership/,"  Hello everyone, I am a recent MSW graduate/LSW and LCADC intern who has been interning at an outpatient detox/PHP/IOP facility, and was recently promoted to a program coordinator position at another location. I wanted to hear some feedback from other therapists about the do’s and don’t of getting your first leadership position and the ways to balance the way this transition is uncomfortable for the clients. 

I have just finished my second week on the job, and things are getting increasingly more difficult. I am transitioning from a detox location where we were much more structured and firm with the clients, and the population I am working with now are more high functioning, and as a result, surprisingly way more resistant to the rules, changes, and being told “what to do”. There also seems to be several cliques of people that are “frequent fliers” who are very intimidating and openly gossip about staff members and other clients. 

I’ve been introducing some rules little by little, such as going over group rules and asking clients not to sit and huddle around a table during group, and rather join the group chair circle, and I’ve also had to intervene when needed, such as when a group of the \[same\] frequent flier clients left the facility to hang out in the cars and go to Walmart (which they cannot do for a number of reasons). Im significantly younger than half the clients, as most of them are between 30-60 years old and I am 25, and essentially feel more unpopular and awkward every time I run groups, as the clients make fun of me sometimes and tell me they don’t like my groups, and that affects my performance as a clinician, which turns into a vicious cycle of me sucking more and more. 

Yesterday I addressed a client’s outburst towards me individually and he told me none of the clients like me, I’m a hardass nitpicker with “new guy syndrome”, I go into the room with an unattural “act”, and he refuses to see my point of view because he does not “rock the boat” whenever he starts new jobs. The worst part is the other staff I work with do not seem to back me up, and even one guy who said he “had my back” addressed the group and told them “you can’t like everyone and her approach may need to change.”

My question for other therapists/addictions counselors/MH professionals is…what would you do in this situation? I know myself and what I am asking of them does not feel terribly unreasonable. I value a client’s autonomy and hate being a stickler for the rules “just because”. I have tried to build rapport before/during establishing changes in the facility, but I am feeling gaslighted by clients and the staff around me that I am asking for too much…do I submit to the pressures of the group or continue with my leadership plans/style as intended?

TLDR: VERY rocky transition into new leadership role and addictions facility. Do I submit to pressures of group or do I stand my ground?"

**Additional Information:**

I did EA at Yale and was completely shocked when I was rejected. In March, not one acceptance was coming out so I was extremely worried I had worked for nothing.  I had no expectations for the next ones. But then, the Harvard interview came (I am in a limited interview country so it had to be a sign) so I became more hopeful.

Ivy Day came, and I was accepted to GTown, so my hopes went up for the ivies that were coming out an hour later. But then, I got rejected everywhere except Dartmouth, so I gave up. I left Harvard for last as I had a little bit of hope for it.

And then, it came! I was accepted to the Class of 2027! I was shocked and still am.

So remember, the process is not over until it is ACTUALLY over. And remember that good interviews don't really mean anything...

PS: I think the main problem for all those rejections was my financial need. But I'll never know!"

*I didn’t read any of them so I can’t really rate.*

3. *Teacher #2: super awesome teacher, also knew of ECS and goals; I did not do super well in their class, but I got along with them really well*

**Interviews**

* Harvard (8/10): Had to cancel/ reschedule to virtual last minute, interviewer was impressed with my grit, courseload, and passion for teaching
   * Honestly my favorite interview; helped me realize something new about myself
* uPenn(7/10): Very sweet interviewer, harder to connect since he was older, reminded me of family, really casual and fun convos! (Talked about hobbies, movies, books, even realized we both worked at the same place at different points in time); I think he liked that I laughed a lot / seemed extroverted
* Rice (8/10): interviewed with a senior student, they prob could tell how much I loved this school

**Essays**

* Common App essay (7/10): Submitted a really ROUGH version for UT + Northeastern, refined it for Harvard and every college after! Nothing too special, but I think it really tied in my passions of teaching, art, and learning. I talked about growing up Vietnamese/ familial struggles with the English language.
* Sup essays:
   * UT (5/10): rushed and not super cohesive
   * Northwestern (6/10) spent two days on the SINGULAR Northwestern essay, thought was pretty good
   * Duke (4/10) were rushed + very robotic/ copy and paste-esque
   * Rice (8/10): hardest to write because I love this school, tied “Why Rice” back into all three essays
   * UPenn (7/10): genuinely enjoyed the “Thank you” prompt, took casual approaches to all 3
   * Harvard (3/10): l accidentally submitted the same essay for two similar prompts (didn’t bother to fix because I didn’t think I’d get in), wrote a list of books for the optional essay
   * Tufts (7/10): Hella demonstrated interest

Disclaimer: I withdrew my app to my safety as soon as I was accepted to my program of choice at UT (target).

**Decisions**

***Acceptances:***

*Harvard (RD) --> full-ride -->* ***committed!***

*UPenn (RD) --> almost full-ride (surprisingly had the weakest aid package :0)*

*Rice (RD) --> full-ride*

*Tufts (RD) --> almost full-ride*

***Waitlists:***

*Northeastern*

**Thoughts and Reflections:**

1. My Harvard Interview definitely played a part considering my essays were weak. Interviewer was really insightful and impressed with my activities and interest in teaching. The interview helped me give nuance to the written parts of my application; it helped me show more of my personality and context (since my supps didn’t do a super good job of that).
2. My optional essay for Harvard was merely a simple list. But I think in the end, it made sense for me and was cohesive because of the contents of my common app essay!
3. UPenn interviewer seemed to like that I had diverse interests + offered to show them. Both Ivy interviews were casual, flowy, and fun conversations!!
4. I submitted a 2 page resume to UPenn with in-detail accomplishments of my EC’s.
5. My EC’s aren’t CRAZY high-impact, but I think the context of my accomplishments is what got me in.

**Advice:**

1. Don’t sound stuffy/ stuck up/ pretentious in your essays and interview. I feel like it’s easy to get nervous or caught up in your accomplishments, BUT JUST relax.
2. Have a few ECs related to your major of choice, but also pursue extracurriculars that you GENUINELY care about (not only because it looks good.)
3. DO NOT WRITE YOUR DREAM SCHOOL’s ESSAYS FIRST. You need to refine your writing skills and the message you’re conveying first.
4. I realized this a little late, but your essays are supposed to breathe LIFE into your stats. Amazing scores and impressive extracurriculars are cool, but your essays should discuss WHY you did those, or focus on how you’ve learned/ grown from those experiences. If you choose to write about an adversity, make sure you’re able to show how you’ve overcame that.
5. Make sure to use the additional info boxes to list ANY extra programs/ ECs/ awards, as well as the COVID boxes. Make sure the info is concise as possible.
6. Apply to safeties please!! I'm lucky enough to be from TX where my audo-admit schools (UofHouston, UT, and A&M) were already amazing and I didn't have to apply to too many.
7. Edit #2: Start early so you can spend time crafting your application. Submit your application when you know it's the best application you can submit. I took a gamble by not continuing with the QB match, but I'm glad I didn't because my essays/ EC list would NOT have been well put together by then.

Conclusion: Overall, I’m super, super grateful for the options I’ve received :”) I discovered A2C during COVID freshman year and it has opened so many doors since then. If you guys are on that subreddit, please use it as a vehicle for self-improvement and motivation rather than comparing yourself to everybody else! Though I'm not the most qualified, PM me with any questions you might have."

I don't have *any* extracurriculars from high school, and since I was diagnosed with a chronic illness at the beginning of the year I wasn't able to focus too well on school, so I couldn't do well at school or have time for extracurriculars or work experience

I don't have any internships for this summer, but I was looking to actually get one for the summer between sophomore and junior year. I'm better now, so I really want to lock in and learn a LOT so I can do interesting projects that I can put on a resume.

I constructed a pathway for myself to follow, but I wanted others' advice on what I'm using to learn.   I tried to choose a general-purpose language and a scripting language, so I chose C++ because I heard it is way easier to learn any other language after you learn C++, and I chose Python because it's simply the most popular and I heard it's the most used in interviews. I have a strict deadline of perhaps mid-August so I can start doing projects as SOON as possible so I can apply early, so that's basically four months between now and then. But here was my plan:

From now until the end of May:

1. Complete CS50 and Learncpp.com and freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing Python Certificate in about 31 days.
2. Go through Grokking's Algorithms by Aditya Bhargava in 22 days.

From the beginning of June until August (all items will be worked on at the same time:

1. [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/dsa) for learning Data Structures
2. freeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python in 24 days.
3. MIT Missing Semester

I'm not sure if these resources were all enough for me to consider applying. I'm not even sure if these are *good* resources, because I feel like every time I want to find a good resource to learn something there's one group of people who'll say this is good and another group who'll say this resource is absolutely terrible. Some of these I got from r/learnprogramming's FAQ and some are from posts in that subreddit as well.

But I would like to hear your thoughts on the resources I chose."

128pue9,1,2023-04-01,Would these set of resources be good enough to prepare me for an internship?,ZealousidealFan9219,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/128pue9/would_these_set_of_resources_be_good_enough_to/,"I am a CS major, and I am a freshman. I don't have *any* extracurriculars from high school, and since I was diagnosed with a chronic illness at the beginning of the year I wasn't able to focus too well on school, so I couldn't do well at school or have time for extracurriculars or work experience

I don't have any internships for this summer, but I was looking to actually get one for the summer between sophomore and junior year. I'm better now, so I really want to lock in and learn a LOT so I can do interesting projects that I can put on a resume.

I constructed a pathway for myself to follow, but I wanted others' advice on what I'm using to learn. I tried to choose a general-purpose language and a scripting language, so I chose C++ because I heard it is way easier to learn any other language after you learn C++, and I chose Python because it's simply the most popular and I heard it's the most used in interviews. I have a strict deadline of perhaps mid-August so I can start doing projects as SOON as possible so I can apply early, so that's basically four months between now and then. But here was my plan:

From now until the end of May:

1. Complete CS50 and Learncpp.com and freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing Python Certificate in about 31 days.
2. Go through Grokking's Algorithms by Aditya Bhargava in 22 days.

**Letters of Recommendation (FERPA exists so I'm guessing)**

Engineering teacher- 6/10 (probably). He's very dry but I would say we're friends. I worked on a robotics portfolio for MIT and Columbia with him and he helped me when I was studying APCSA.

Geometry/AP stats teacher- 6/10. She was the academic team advisor since my freshman year and we were very close. I'm not sure how she rated me as a student, though, since these classes were online and I didn't have a learning plan for my testing anxiety.

Research Mentor- 10/10. He said I performed at a graduate letter and that I was one of the best students he's ever had. I was recognized to perform undergrad research during my internship by him.

English/Philosophy Teacher- 7/10. We're friends, but he only had me in person for our philosophy course. He recognizes how hard I've worked, though, and he used my brag sheet to write the letter.

Music teacher/Band director- 8/10. I held the presidency for the band before he left and was in his room practicing for most of my school life. He wrote this from the heart without a brag sheet, but I have no doubts it was genuine.

Counselor(s)- 7/10. Both of them used a brag sheet and I'm sure it was very cookie-cutter, but they really love me and know I worked hard for a spot.

**Interviews**

UPenn- 10/10. I loved this woman so much and she said she highly recommended me.

Georgetown- 9/10. I don't remember most of this tbh, but we had a really good conversation and he knew how much I cared abt activism and how it applied to Gtown.

I was not offered a SINGLE other interview :) I'm freaking out, guys.

**Essays**

I spent about two weeks on essays. My personal statement was about living my life as a cartoonish frog character and everyone I've sent it to rated it super high. I'd honestly say a 9/10!

My supplementals were about spending time in Japan and Algeria as well as my motivation as a student in physics. I also wrote about how important being multidisciplinary is to me and how it could benefit the world in the future :)

**Additional Information:**

submitted a maker portfolio as well as one in visual arts and theater. i'm fluent in 5 languages and learning 3 right now. i also added a resume for acting and one for jobs/internships that i use with a bunch of other school clubs or smaller activities that didn't fit on the app as well as paid work.

my silly little counselors didn't submit my transcript or school report until mid-feb which is insane bcs i kept reminding them. i sent an explanation to a few of my top choices' local admissions counselors, but i was told it won't handicap me in the process when i called offices.

**i wrote a bunch of papers, 3 of which are published for biomed, psych, and physics with significant impact!!!!!**

**Side note:** What did I do wrong?? Who got in instead of me?? I worked so hard for my dream schools for seven years and have NOTHING to show for it. This completely destroyed me and idek what to do anymore...

I did everything I could with a *genuine* love for learning and this is what I get? Idk how to feel and I'm really sorry if I sound conceited :( I'm just so disappointed in myself and feel like the biggest loser."

Company told me that they had 2 projects that they were working on: maintaining a 10+ year old legacy project, and a newer project that would be built from the ground up and was still in the process of forming a team.

Initially I was to be assigned to the newer project. I asked what stack it would be using, and they showed me a chart for it, there were a lot of new and familiar names both open source and proprietary. I was sold on the idea that we were gonna learn and apply all these tech and make something original on our own.

However, some time after I was then told that Id be working on the legacy project instead as that was their priority. I asked for the tech stack again, and was just told that it was going to be Java 8, SQL, and the rest were proprietary software (which were not named). I asked what the day to day would be like, its gonna be 3-6 months of training, then afterwards its just gonna be fixing bugs that clients submit.

It was a bit of a downer tbh cuz I already set my sights on the newer project. Pay is decent but not competitive. Plus its 5 days onsite. I was willing to overlook that and focus on the growth, but with the change in project assignment im sort of worried that I may not be doing myself any favors with dated/proprietary tech. Plus already did bug-fixing for the majority of my internship, and while not a bad experience, I feel it did little for my growth (anyone else feel this way with debugging?). So far I'm on the fence, but I think I'll ask anyway if I can start on the newer project and pass on the offer and look elsewhere if not. Is this a good idea? Or am I just jaded after changing projects and does the legacy project sound like a good place for growth still? Ive been told that if ever, I can switch projects after a while, which I think would take 9 months to a year (taking training into consideration)."

I'm a third-year software engineering student and recently started a new job as a backend developer intern. In my team, they mainly use Go (Golang), which is a language I've never worked with before. I've tried to familiarize myself with it, but it's not as intuitive for me as Java or Python.

Now, my main struggle is this annoying imposter syndrome that's haunting me. I'm lowkey terrified of how I'll do at the job, and the thought of code reviews has me stressed. I can't help but think that my manager and teammates will take one look at my code and go ""WTF is this mess?"" 😓

I get that I'm just an intern, and my code doesn't need to be A+ material, but this feeling of being a fake drive me nuts.

Has anyone else been through this kind of thing? I'd love to hear how y'all dealt with imposter syndrome, especially when learning a new language on the job. Thanks, and may the code gods have mercy on me! 🙏"

This is mostly a collection of all the information that I've managed to gather throughout my process, and I've also collected input from other previous UC-UC transfers.

It's currently WIP. If there's anything you wish were added, feel free to let me know. 

A link to the formatted guide is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRb4-Bnrc45CoY06wQpxD6WwwrDEsyq1ltmqeyiJ67qryaufKID7jm_ajE2Px8GHa8dsNydWdI5cLGy/pub

****
Hello future UC-UC applicants! I’ve decided to write this guide to help consolidate all of the incredibly spread-out bits and pieces of information available on the process of transferring from a UC to another UC. I know it can be incredibly stressful when there’s a dearth of solid information, and my hope is to ease some of the concerns that you may be having in this (at times lonely-feeling) process. I myself transferred from UCI CS to UC Berkeley EECS so I know how stressful it can be, and have also tried to gather some information from other successful UC-UC transfers. 

Note to those that haven't started at a UC yet: **CC will nearly always be the far superior option for transferring to a UC.** 95% of transfers to a UC come from a CC, and admissions offices prioritize transfers coming from a CC. This guide is meant for those who have no choice but to go to a UC but still want to attempt to transfer (already started at a UC, pressure from parents, etc.) If you haven’t started at a UC yet, going to a CC has benefits like a higher acceptance rate, staff support for your transfer process, TAG (transfer admission guarantee), far cheaper tuition, and CC-UC course transferability agreements.

Note: I’ve geared this guide towards applicants coming from UC schools, but a lot of this information is applicable to applicants from other 4-year universities applying to transfer to a UC.

***
#General tips
* **SAVE YOUR SYLLABI.** This is one of the **most important** things to know about not just UC-UC transferring, but transferring from any 4-year university. Unlike CC transfers, there are no agreements on course transferability! The UC you transfer to will need your syllabi to figure out what courses you’ll be granted credit for. This could have a huge impact on how long it takes you to finish your degree after you transfer. I myself forgot to collect most of these and ended up having to retake a class because I was ghosted by my UCI Discrete Math professor.

* **DECIDE EARLY.** I know it sounds counterintuitive to decide to leave a university right when you’ve arrived, and there’s definitely wisdom in waiting to get a true feel for the place before leaving. Unfortunately, the timing for UC-UC transfers is just incredibly tight due to needing to take a large amount of classes to guarantee the best chance of transferring, so you can’t really afford to take a quarter/semester of classes that might end up being wasted should you choose to take the path of transferring.

* **You don’t need to transfer into the same major!** As long as you take the required classes for the major you're applying to and demonstrate interest in the major that you’re applying to through your extracurriculars and essays, you will be fine.

* **Some UCs don’t read essays at all for transfer admission!** As of the Fall 2023 admissions cycle, these UCs are Davis, Merced, Riverside, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. See page 45 of https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/_files/documents/quick-reference.pdf

NOTE: As per the PDF: “While campuses vary in their use of the personal insight responses, all use them to evaluate gaps in applicants’ educational history or in the evaluation of applicants for certain scholarships.” In other words, there is still a benefit to writing the essays if you want scholarships or if you have a gap in your college studies!

* **It’s not required to apply in your second year!** Most UC-UC transfers I’ve talked to haven’t done this, but if you really want to do a 1st year transfer, you can absolutely apply in November of the year that you start at your home UC. Your best shot will be in your 2nd year as that’s when you’ve had enough time to build a good case to transfer, but this is still an option. As for applying to transfer in your 3rd year, you may run into problems with exceeding the unit maximum for transfers from a 4-year college. See the discussion on unit maximums in the below section for more information.

****
# Choosing your classes

Since you’re not a CC transfer, there isn’t a clear pathway like a guide on ASSIST or IGETC to follow. You won’t be excused from meeting all the requirements for EACH individual UC! This means that you may have to take far more classes than what may seem necessary just to satisfy the requirements for each one that you apply to. There’s also additional confusion in the fact that it’s sometimes not entirely clear what classes will satisfy requirements at another UC. Visit the transfer information website for your major for **every UC** that you’re applying to, and read the information thoroughly! Each UC will have its own requirements and its likely that a not-insignificant portion of the requirements won’t overlap. Usually, each UC wants you to complete at minimum the lower-division technical requirements and a lower-division writing requirement to transfer.


**Try to finish your general education requirements.** There’s something called a “Letter of Reciprocity” where if you finish your general education requirements at your home UC, you won’t have to take them at the UC you transfer to! This doesn’t apply to all majors at all UC’s--the College of Engineering at Berkeley is one place that doesn’t accept it. After you’re accepted, email your UC’s registrar to find out how to request one and have it sent to your new campus.


**Be aware of a unit maximum!** Unlike CC applicants, there are UNIT MAXIMUMS for UC transfers! For some reason, the unit maximums for each campus are hidden in this obscure counselor’s guide that I always end up losing the link to. Here is the PDF (unit limits for each campus is on page 34): 
https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/_files/documents/quick-reference.pdf

There’s a LOT of very important information from pages 33-49 in this document, and I would highly recommend taking a look through it just to make sure your planned college schedule still stays under these requirements. The unit maximum information is on pages 33-35. UCLA in particular seems to accept NO juniors over the unit limit, so this is incredibly important to be aware of.

**Many of your major classes will not transfer.** Lower-division general math and lab science courses usually transfer (courses like linear algebra, multivariable calculus, an introductory physics sequence, etc.), but major courses usually are not accepted for specific course credit! (UC credits will still always count as elective credit, but they won’t help you with specific classes that are required for your degree after you transfer.)

**Attempt to finish part of your home UC degree.** It’s likely that a lot of classes you need to transfer and a lot of classes you need to take at your current college won’t overlap. I highly recommend still attempting to finish at least part of your degree at your current college just in case you don’t end up being accepted to any other UC that you apply to, but this will mean that you may have to take a lot of classes. I took at minimum 4 classes a quarter and 5 during my freshman-sophomore summer, so just be prepared for that.

**Use ASSIST.org to help plan your requirements.** Definitely check the UC’s specific website for the major/college you’re applying to so you make sure you get everything, but you can also use ASSIST.org to help cross-reference courses and see what CC students would typically need so you can match it to your home UC. You won't be able to exactly follow this as its meant for CC students, but its still helpful to have a place where you can see what the UCs want for specific majors.


Overall, make sure you manage to keep track of every single requirement at EVERY UC you apply to. It’s a lot of work to figure out everything, so make a spreadsheet to help you organize the requirements!

# Extracurriculars
Since you’ll be in college, you have a chance to go much further than ECs that you may have pursued in high school. There’s no exact recipe that you can follow to guarantee admissions, as everyone will have their own interests. 

If you’re struggling to think of extracurriculars to pursue, you have a great opportunity to do **research**! Since you're coming from a research institution, you have a far greater ability to gain experience doing research in the field you're applying to. Every college has a different process of finding research, but don’t be discouraged just because you’re an undergraduate. Definitely look into this as soon as you arrive on campus, as you don’t have much time left! 

I won’t write much about extracurriculars as its generally the same as for community college applicants, and I’m mainly trying to focus on things specific to UC-UC transfers. Any online resources and Reddit posts with tips for general transfer applicants will apply the same to you as a UC-UC applicant.
****
# Writing the essays

The process for writing the essays is pretty much the same as for CC applicants. Even though most resources on this topic target incoming freshmen or CC transfers, the advice will still apply to you. The UC-UC essay writing process is exactly the same.

**You don’t need to write about a reason for transferring.** I’ve seen many people on transfer subreddits say that you need to have a strong reason for transferring. This may be true if you’re transferring to some other university that specifically asks you to write about your reason for transferring, but the UC transfer application doesn’t actually ask this anywhere. My reason for transferring was terrible, but I didn’t have to write about it at all and I still got in. Don’t worry about this!

# Helpful links:
* https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/_files/documents/quick-reference.pdf

Starting on page 41, there is a lot of valuable information detailing policies for transferring to every UC! A lot of this information can’t be found anywhere else, so I would highly recommend looking through this. I am not affiliated with UC and can’t answer a lot of questions relating to these policies, so if something confuses you, contact the admissions office of whatever UC you’re looking at.

* https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-majors/majors/

This link provides a lot of valuable information on the specific major and campus you’re applying to including whether it takes senior transfers. **Check this first!**

You can use this link to find average GPAs for other transfer applicants that came from your UC and filter it based on the UCs you’re targeting. Click on the tab “TR GPA by Yr” and search for your college, and then select the UC you’re interested in under “Campus”. 

* https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/transfers-major

This link shows you how many applicants there were for each major at each UC, how many were admitted, and the GPA range for admits. Note that this includes CC students and isn’t just UC-UC transfers.

* https://admissions.berkeley.edu/transfer-courses-for-reading-composition-by-institution/

This link is one of the few that shows equivalencies for classes from other UC’s to satisfy the English requirement at Berkeley. Not every UC has this, and I’m including this one because its the only one I know of for the colleges I applied to. It’s possible that there may be more of these types of links, but you’ll have to do some digging. I’ll update this guide if I ever find more.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Do I need to apply to the same major as my original UC?
No. As long as you take the required courses for the major you're applying to and demonstrate interest in the major that you’re applying to through your extracurriculars and essays, you will be fine.

##Do I need to apply in my second year?
No, but its the year where you have the best shot. See the bullet point in the “General Tips” section for a longer discussion.

##Can I reuse my original UC essays?
I don’t have a definitive answer for whether its strictly allowed or not, but I would highly recommend not reusing them. You should be writing about experiences that you’ve had in college, but you can use the same topics if you’ve expanded upon them in your college experience. From u/purple103:  “i'd recommend personally using different piqs to show your growth and especially to demonstrate things unique to you that may not pop up immediately on your application or based on your stats.” (see u/purple103’s section in the “Successful UC-UC Transfer Stories/Tips” section). If you really want to know whether its actually allowed, contact the admissions office for the UC you’re applying to.

#Misc.
Unlike CC applicants, your GPA WILL transfer to your new UC. 
****
This process can feel incredibly lonely at times, as UC-UC transfers don’t have the community that CC transfers have for transferring in addition to a lack of good resources with information on this topic. I’d like to reassure you that there’s a lot of other students across the entire UC system going through the same journey, and you aren’t alone in this. 

Good luck!

#Successful UC-UC Transfer Stories/Tips
This section contains stories and tips that previous UC-UC transfers have had to share. I highly recommend reading through this section, as there’s some very valuable insight from previous transfers. I am currently in the process of contacting more UC-UC transfers.

## UCI CS -> UCB EECS, u/wafflenut
* My section is more anecdotes to help reassure readers and less providing tips on what may work for you. Feel free to skip to the next person’s section if you want more concrete insight on how to succeed.
* I had NO research and NO internships and was accepted to UCSD CS and UC Berkeley EECS. These are great opportunities that I absolutely recommend for both transferring and career reasons, but you don’t necessarily need these things to successfully transfer! I know it’s cliche to say to do what you’re passionate about, but I think you’ll find that in college you’ll have so much more freedom to really try new and exciting things instead of just following a generic extracurricular formula like you may have done in high school.
* I ended up receiving course credit for only one CS class. I took 13. It was quite unfortunate.
* I wrote all of my essays on the last day. I am absolutely not encouraging you to do this, but if you’re sitting here on the day of the deadline or later in a state of despair and hopelessness after realizing you should have started sooner, don’t beat yourself up too much! It’s not the end of the world. Still, if the deadline is far away, START ASAP. You will thank your past self later.
* The reason for getting accepted is different for everyone, so don’t take this as a surefire way to get accepted, but I’m pretty sure that the main reason I was accepted was that I took an incredibly high amount of classes and got an A or A+ in nearly all of them. My extracurriculars were okay but not great, and I’m definitely not proud of my essays (see previous bullet point). Taking a lot of courses and still getting a high GPA probably showed the admissions office that I could still succeed after transferring.
* For Berkeley’s College of Engineering, they do NOT accept the Letter of Reciprocity, so don’t bother doing your GE’s if you’re only applying here. However, it is REQUIRED if you’re applying to Berkeley L&S.
* Coursework changes form (don’t remember what it was called but it was a form you submit if you ended up taking different courses than what you put on your application. not the TAU): This will be more relevant to you after you apply. I submitted mine AFTER I was accepted and was incredibly stressed about this for like, a month. Definitely try to let your colleges know as soon as you end up taking different courses as what you listed on the application, but it’s not the end of the world if you end up forgetting (but still absolutely do it ASAP!). I ended up completely changing my schedule in my last quarter and even ended up not getting the Letter of Reciprocity despite saying that I would on my application, and it still turned out okay!

## UCSB ChemE -> UCI CS, u/Idroxide
* I think my essays were the strongest part of my application and I had a very good system to get it down
* basically I started ~4 months early and I went through many drafts. As I refined the stories, I had many different proofreaders—people who knew me well. I basically asked: “if you saw this with no name could you tell this was written by me” and “does this essay put you to sleep” 
* I only let each reader read twice also and did not ask them again for later drafts, except for only one person
* My proofreaders also did not look for grammatical mistakes cuz that was left for the very end since I wanted the focus to be on the content and vibe of the essay and fixing grammar stuff distracts from the reading
* I transferred from UCSB ChemE to UCI CS so you’re also not limited to transferring into your direct major. Just make sure you have the coursework needed

##UCSD -> UCB, u/purple103 (willing to DM for more details!)
* i used 3 completely new essays for piqs and 1 essay that was related to my original essay for the same prompt, but that i had updated and changed. i'd recommend personally using different piqs to show your growth and especially to demonstrate things unique to you that may not pop up immediately on your application or based on your stats. 
* in college, i got involved in research in my major, had a tutoring job on campus, had a summer internship after my freshman year, and more. i think this demonstrated that i would get involved on campus no matter where i transfered, and that i was committed to my major. in transfer admissions, major prep is super emphasized by the UCs, so its important that you show that you are passionate and ready for the major you're applying for and that you will be able to graduate from that major within 2 (ish) years.
* i got into some majors at different schools without all the major prep requirements they said they needed (ex: psych and brain sciences at ucsb says they highly recommend one year of chem and bio, i took neither and got in). don't feel shut out if you don't have all the major requirements, but be aware that if you don't, it may take you a while to graduate
* i DEEPLY REGRET not doing the letter of reciprocity and getting my ges done at my original UC. i didn't plan on transfering, so i never planned to do the letter, but if you have any inkling that you might want to, i highly recommend starting on it especially if your current UC has a ton of GEs.
* i had a relatively low gpa (around 3.7) for transferring when I applied, and one C in a major relevant class -- not from my first quarter either -- but i still got into uc berkeley. as long as your overall gpa is good, don't feel discouraged by one bad grade. gpa requirements also vary widely by what major you're applying for transfer in (CS and engineering are always quite high) so check for your specific major
* if you end up transferring, PLEASE submit your petition to get your old classes counted for your major asap. i waited until fall semester to submit and had a bad time waiting for my GEs and major prep classes to count. my friend who submitted as soon as she got in had her classes appear on her academic record in the summer, which let her take upper divs easily.


##UCSD General Biology -> UCB Molecular and Cell Biology, u/Big_korean_daddy
I transferred from UCSD to Cal… kind of by accident. 😅 My goal was to transfer to UCLA since my mom went there and have always had that idea of “I’d want to go where my mom went”. But before we get to that part… I heard about UC->UC transferring here and there but never really gave it a thought. When I got to orientation at UCSD I was just happy to be there since I didn’t even have a good SAT score or an interesting college application. I got accepted to UCSD with a 1780/2400 SAT and 4.2 weighted gpa. I was just happy to be accepted. The thought of transferring came to me randomly during my first quarter after my first week.
I went to my counselor and he just said “let’s finish first quarter, see where your grades are at, and go from there”. With transferring on my mind, I felt that I focused a lot more on my studies and didn’t spend much time joining clubs and orgs. It was pure study. And I think that’s what you should think about before committing to transfer… know that you won’t have as great of a freshman, sophomore experience. I finished first year with straight A’s and that’s when I knew I had a shot at transferring.

I applied in the fall. Santa Barbara(safety), UCLA, Berkeley. From that point, it was a waiting game! I told all my friends about transferring and so many of them really doubted that it was possible. And the day finally came. Wednesday was when UCLA released their admission decisions and I called two of my close friends to be with me to open my decision letter. It was gut wrenching that I was rejected and I cried a lot. At this point I thought my chances of transferring was zero since my whole intention was to transfer to UCLA. I went home the next day even though I had class, and I just cried and cried. On Friday, I went with my dad and brother to the cemetery to visit my grandparents. We went to eat sushi afterwards and while we were eating, I got a spam of emails from FAFSA and Berkeley. 

I was accepted. 

I totally forgot about the Cal application and I was accepted.


##UCSC Proposed CS -> UCSD Political Science: Race, ethnicity, and politics, u/WingWrong6320
* if your transfer courses are only crediting for electives, see if theres a minor adjacent to your field they might count towards. i declared my minor in my first spring quarter at san diego & i only needed one more class to complete it. 
* be prepared to start completely over. anything you thought you knew, you dont. every uc is owned and operated completely differently and any preconceptions youre carrying from your last uc need to go. go in with an open mind, pretend you’re a freshman all over again. 
* create intimate relationships with your professors. uc professors really want to help transfer students and you have an even bigger leg up coming from another uc if you have research experience. just talk to them. 
* reiterate whats been said to save your syllabi once again. save your connections too, it pays to have friends all over."

**Letters of Recommendation**

Didn't read any of these but

*English Teacher* \- (8/10) Former professor at T10 if that matters. Had her for 3 years, so she's basically my mother. Told me that she vouched incredibly hard for me and I don't doubt her for a second

*Calc Teacher* \- (6/10) Didn't do well in his class Junior year but probably said something like ""worked her butt off."" Honestly no idea how this was

*Research Mentor* \- (7/10) PhD from T50 if that matters. Probably said something like ""weirdly super into neuroscience and super into programming.. fascinating."" Only gave him 3 weeks to write LOR

*Counselor* \- (8/10) Knew me pretty well and has a ton of experience in college guidance. Understood my personal situation (was able to talk about changes in my transcript), my goals, and was able to turn everything into a compelling argument for why schools should invest in me.

*CBO Sticker of Approval* \- (7/10)

**Interviews**

*Columbia* \- (7/10) Really nice finance bro. Called me well-spoken, eloquent, impressive etc. but I can't tell if it was lowkey racist or not

*Cornell* \- (9/10) Talked for an hour, alum told me to keep in touch and we just had a really great conversation about New York and life

*Northwestern* \- (7/10) Was a little awkward in the beginning but we ended up picking things up at the end. Had to end abruptly because she had to meet with another student but it was pretty ok.

*Barnard* \- (10/10) Basically a verbal likely. No joke.

**Essays**

*Personal Statement* \- (7/10) Wrote about the furniture in my bedroom and how I chose furniture over a party for my 7th birthday. Pretty weird concept but I delved into how my furniture has evolved overtime and now contains traces of both my memory and identity. Recycled from an old class and didn't make super huge changes.

Didn't submit a UChicago video which probably obliterated my chances and managed to make a couple typos in other supplements. If there are any rising seniors reading this.. please proofread your applications and really put in 110% into each application instead of using a general template.

I think my strongest supplements were my Cornell supplements. I poured my heart and soul into them and refined my entire ED application to cater towards their A&S school. Overall, I rate my writing a calm 7/10 and truthfully I think my application was pretty average although a bit all over the place. I made sure to write about how my love for gaming (LOL) and studying human behavior in the context of decision-making and UI/UX ignited my love for neuroscience. I talked about how indebted I feel towards Black figures, specifically those from my country, and how a lot of my research addresses conditions that often go untreated/unrecognized within the Black community (namely ASD).

**Letters of Recommendation**

I was given the opportunity to read all of mine without asking, so this is my personal rating.

1. **AP Lang Teacher / NHS Advisor - 9/10;** She praised me very highly, referring to me as ""one of the most remarkable students"" she's ever met. This letter showcased my balance between extracurriculars, employment (20hrs/wk), and academics while also making sure to note my quiet confidence and courage in taking initiative in overcoming adversity and helping others in overcoming their similar adversities. This teacher loves me to death lol.
2. **Engineering Instructor - 9/10;** This has been my teacher for engineering courses the past two years and I asked him for a LOR because he has seen me work in my field and work in a team. The letter was very well-written, but he spelled my name wrong... But he did advocate for how I worked in a team and that, although I was not the loudest, I was always recognized by my team members in high regard and always voted to be team leader etc.
3. **AP US History Teacher - 7/10;** this LOR wasn't bad, it was just very standard. It kind of vomited my entire application back up in a debrief type format. However, he did show a lot of praise for my generosity and extracurricular involvement. He said in the letter that it would not be enough to know me through an application, but that one would have to speak to me in order to truly grasp my sharp and witty yet laidback personality. I thought that was really sweet.

&#x200B;

**Interviews**

1. **UPenn -** standard interview... I was the one keeping the conversation going and my interviewer was lowkey a robot. Super sweet guy but he talked really slow and I am not sure if he knew what he was saying half of the time.
2. **Princeton -** really good! He thought that my experiences as a first-generation student were extremely commendable and basically read me what he was going to write in his recommendation or whatever.

I didn't get any other interviews, probably because of my rural location. 

**Essays**

I adored my personal statement. It was about my favorite pen snapping over my poetry journal and connected to a story about how I overcame my family's bankruptcy through creative expression. I continued this theme in some of my supplementals, but instead of writing through things like upcycling and embroidering clothes that my family could not afford. I do creative writing in my free-time, so I would say my essays were one of the strongest points of my application. My supplementals, however, were probably pretty standard. I did most (if not, ALL) of them last minute or after they were due. By last minute, I literally mean an hour before the deadline. I don't think this was a huge issue because they still seemed well-written-- I just potentially could've done more research, especially for the ""Why X College?"" essays.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**CLOSING THOUGHTS**

Although I have undoubtedly worked hard, I am extremely privileged and fortunate to be in this position when others who are so much more accomplished than me simply lost the luck of the draw. I did not know what the ivy league was until going into my senior year. I did not expect to go to college at all until I was told that I would likely be valedictorian. I did not craft my success story through A2C. Everyone on chanceme told me I would ""maybe"" get into UT (I'm auto-admit...) because my extracurriculars were all over the place. In the end, I believe so much of this process comes down to fit. You are qualified and deserve the best, in a sea of applicants who are also qualified and also deserve the best. It boils down to what perspectives the college wants in their upcoming class, and a lot of the time that includes factors that you cannot necessarily control. I am a hooked applicant and I acknowledge that it likely had a significant influence on my results. 

Otherwise, I truly believe that my essays were one of the main reasons that I got into Brown and Duke.  Being well-spoken no matter what your story is will get you so far... and that does not mean hiring a college essay consultant to revise them for you. It means speaking from passion, whether to you that means making jokes in a heavy-hitting essay or nerding out about your research in a why major essay. My lack of STEM extracurriculars still got me into Duke biomedical engineering, and I believe my wide variety of interests is what Brown saw in me to utilize their open curriculum. 

To the class of 2027: it is over. I cannot thank A2C enough for helping me through this process and exposing me to what is likely now my future home. I know you've heard it enough, about how even if you got rejected you'd be ""the type of person to succeed anywhere."" Just know that all of your efforts were not in vain. You are someone outside of your university, and it is the people who act the opposite that are problematic. While this subreddit is a shitshow most of the time, I do think it is kind of moving that we are all in this together-- we experienced the epic highs and lows of high school football together and together our generation will become leaders in our respective fields.

To the class of 2028: it will be okay. :) 

As of right now, I am torn between Duke and Brown (which could both coincidentally be used as synonyms for ""shit"")-- I will need to negotiate financial aid before committing. If anyone would like to read an essay of mine, feel free to reach out and I will be glad to share them with you. If you need emotional support, I am here too! Thanks for reading."

I’m staying in Orlando this summer and want to knock out a rough class (or two) given the opportunity. I have a MAD2104 credit from dual enrollment which covers the prereq for CS2. Gerber is teaching it this summer so I’m strongly considering taking it. Discrete 1 is also an option but Meade is the only prof for this summer. Ideally I’d knock out both courses this summer, just a little uneasy about the workload and dealing with Meade. My other choice is either one of those two with Security in Computing. Easier for sure, but it makes my sophomore year comparatively rough. Would love some thoughts and input here."

**Letters of Recommendation**

Read them all, don't know what the rating scale would be but History, Physics, Calc BC teachers all gave me very positive reccomendations, especially discussing my leadership and importance in the classroom.

Outside Recs were from my manager at #3 who gave a strong rec on leadership, technical skills, and work ethic. Other one was from my contact at #4, very positive

**Interviews**

MIT, Harvard, Duke were spectacular! Georgetown, Harvey Mudd, Northwestern were very good! Yale and Princeton were rather average. I think I had like a couple more but I don't remember tbh so they were probably like just normal.

**Essays**

Good overall, I think I'm a solid writer. PS was abt growing up in a heavily under-resourced community, moving and finding my love for robotics, and eventually growing to a point where I could bring those opportunities back to my old community. I think one big issue was that several of my topics were kinda risky? Firstly for my ""time your views were challenged"" essay I talked about my gun culture advocacy journey, which a lot of people told me not to do but I really loved that essay. I got straight rejected everywhere that essay went LOL. Another one talked about my work helping 3D design rememberance models at a hospital for terminally ill children. Using this experience may have rubbed some people the wrong way? Not too sure to be honest.

*Acceptances:* (arranged in order id go to them in)

* **UPenn SEAS Committed**: Lowkey the perfect school for me! I always wanted to pursue a combination of CS and business (which is why Michigan is my second choice above the likes of Goergia Tech) and there is no place in the world better for that combo than UPenn. So so excited, and I plan to visit on Quaker Day! Only downside is that I'm going to miss all of my friends a lot. The nearest ones are going to be at JHU and Harvard (and maybe one staying in New York on a gap year?) but I look forward to the chance to meet new people, I'm sure it's gonna be an amazing time 😁😁😁
* **UMich**: Was between this and Penn for me but in the end I went with Penn. Love this school and would have loved to go but Penn is too hard to turn down!
* **Georgia Tech**: My other main choice. Do not think I would have been happy here though.
* UIUC
* UCSB
* Purdue
* Boston University (Transfer plan)
* UCSC

*Waitlists:*

* **Harvard:** Only waitlist I intend to stay on. Would heavily consider it over Penn, but to be honest I think Penn is the perfect fit for me (which is a lot easier to say when I don't have a Harvard acceptance letter). Let's see how it goes.
* Cornell
* Northwestern
* UCLA
* CMU
* Johns Hopkins
* Harvey Mudd
* Claremont McKenna
* UC Davis

*Rejections:*

* Stanford
* UC Berkeley
* Duke
* Princeton
* Columbia
* Brown
* Yale
* Georgetown
* MIT
* Caltech
* UChicago
* UCSD
* USC

*Withdrew:*

* NYU
* NEU

**Additional Information:**

1. I'm just happy the whole process is over. This year our class of 600 only had 2 ivies and a stanford, and I feel lincredibly blessed to have been one of that number. 
2. I think fit probably matters a lot more for colleges than I might have initially guessed. Penn and Michigan were the perfect fit schools for me, and I was headed to one of them either way
3. Shotgunning worked for me at least, but I don't know if its a good fit for everyone? I applied to every T10 and 17/21 T20s, got into 1 and got waitlisted at 3 T10s and a T20. Had I applied to like half the schools, I think I'd probably be Michigan bound right now? Though also I would say that shotgunning doesn't work because of the fact that admissions is a ""lottery,"" but more so because the same student might meet the institutional priorities at one school but not any others. If your app is strong enough for T20s though, I think it is smart to apply to several. 
4. I have no idea what happened with my UC apps lol. I'm pretty sad that I didn't get any of the top 3 UCs, especially considering the fact that I got accepted to all 3 of the <5% oos CS programs (umich, ga tech, and uiuc) as well as an ivy. I feel like as an in-state student I should have gotten at least one of those 3. Cal and ucsd rejections + ucla waitlist wwew absolutely soulcrushing for me. It is what it is though, I would not have taken any of the UC schools above Penn so in the end I'm happy someone else got that spot there.
5. Have fun! I had so much fun throughout high school, partially because I was able to manage my time really well and partially because I loved everything I was doing and didn't do anything specifically for college. In all of my activities I was leading a larger group of people who I really got along with, making them all great times to.
6. Quick shoutout to my robotics team! Out of the 11 graduating seniors, our commitments read: UPenn, Harvard, Harvard (not at our school though), Stanford, UCLA, UCLA, UCLA, Georgia Tech, Cal, Cal, UT
7. Michigan IS SUCH A GOOD SCHOOL. Michigan is lowkey the perfect school. Everyone should apply to Michigan. I think if I do go to grad school that is where I am planning to go. That is where I plan to send my little sister. Go Blue!

**Helpful info**:

1. Forbes feature: This just happened because I'd gotten a LinkedIn setup early and I was active in all my organizations. One of the people I met through EC #2 writes for Forbes, and when they began writing on the topic of teenagers making impacts through tech, they reached out to me and I was happy to oblidge! I think a good way of getting features like this (which I know because that's how most of the other teenagers featured in that article got in) is just emailing authors for these websites who have written about similar topics before.
2. Internships: All of my internships also came through networking! EC #3 came from a robotics team mentor (who we recruited through LinkedIn) who found our work impressive and thought we could help his company. EC #8 came from a random internship program I heard about through friends, and EC #9 came from a parent of one of the students I taught through my non-profit who was impressed by my teaching skills and talked later. After finding out about their business, I went ahead and asked if I could get involved, and they were willing to let me pursue some projects for them!
3. Standardized testing tips: It's better to practice then to study. When I'm reviewing for AP tests, I always just do practice tests generally, not like reading through the book, and all my ACT prep was restricted to weekly practice tests I took for a couple months. Also for AP CS A, I think the reason I was able to perfect was that I was actively teaching the curriculum to others too, which meant that I HAD to have a deeper understanding of the content.

**Letters of Recommendation**

Teacher 1: social studies jr year teacher, got along well and participated a lot in class (prob top 4), he also ran a club I was part of and admired my leadership there, not sure how in depth it was able to be compared to other peoples but was pretty good overall 8/10

Teacher 2: English teacher jr year, wrote me an excerpt for another award about how I always approach challenges with a smile and was able to overcome a lot, had a bit of rocky time in her class but came out better on the other side, known for being good at writing them 7/10

Additional rec (only top school sent to was Barnard): former band teacher who now works as a school admin, very good relationship with, helped me get drum major, wrote her a long email about possible things to include in my rec but idk how many she used, admired my dedication to the program 9/10

Note: I did not include a stem lor because it would have had to have been my physics teacher and while her and her class were fine, we didn’t have a personal connection with a lot for her to write about. I had much more connection with my English teacher. 

**Interviews**

USD: Went well, definitely nervous at first (was the first interview) and rushed through my words in the beginning, but got more comfortable as it went on, present myself and my passions well, an informal talk that lasted around 35 minutes 8/10

Occidental: talked a lot about his work as a student and the activism community of oxy and gave me some good material for my supplementals, not sure of how much he liked me as a person lol 7/10

Macalester: I was awkward in the beginning but it got better, presented myself as a very community oriented person and the interviewer was impressed with my extensive involvement in my high school, talked about her work in the civic engagement office and community outreach at Mac 8/10

Georgetown: probably one of his last interviews before apps were due so I don’t think that looked great, completely blanked when he asked me to go deeper on a world history topic I was talking about but I was kinda able to switch topics? Spoiled the rest of the interview for me and I didn’t feel confident at all. Was able to talk in depth about other topics but I don’t think it made up for it all that much, lasted about an hour 6/10

**Essays**

Personal statement: about my journey w feeling pride in America and about how I have taken and can take more steps in bridging divides and improving my country at home and abroad. Could have spent more time on it imo but I liked it overall, might have been too nation focused for an IR major tho  (7/10)

UCs: some were pretty good some were meh, talked about interest in how economics applies to government and policy, my work in creating a multi school justice conference, getting cut from sports team, and newspaper articles that focused on local issues as opposed to national or international

School specific: Best ones were probably Barnard, Macalester, and UW Seattle. Overall I could have spent more time on top schools essays but was swamped w senior year. I'm not torn up about it lol

After getting everything back I felt pretty crappy, especially with not getting into UCLA or UCB. Looking at this sub, however, puts a lot of it into perspective. I was nowhere near the top person at my school and I don't have the accolades and internships that top students do. There are people here that did way more than me only to end up with less and I'm grateful for what I have. 

Although my ECs aren't the most impressive, I'm known at my school for doing a lot and people expected me to get in somewhere better. While I am happy with my choices, it's hard when people keep on telling you how sad they are that you didn't get in to any ""top"" schools. If anyone else is going though this, I feel for you and I hope it all works out. 

Overall, I feel like I focused too much on school and school ECs when I should have been looking into more summer programs and internships in my field. My application doesn't have anything that can really distinguish it from others, and by the end of junior year I felt way too burnt out to apply for summer internships that I absolutely should have gone for.

If anyone is curious, my top choices are uw seattle (honors), macalester, and ucsb. If anyone has anything they want to share about these schools please let me know! If you have any questions about the school I applied to and why please reach out as well. 

Lastly, thank you to r/collegeresults for sucking up way too much of my time that should have been spent doing other things. If this is you, stop now and get help cause overthinking this sub is not worth it.

someone who is glad all of this is over :)"
1296ncq,3,2023-04-01,Got Accepted As Transfer For Fall 2023,AtlasGlobe,uofm,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1296ncq/got_accepted_as_transfer_for_fall_2023/,"Hey guys! 

This is my first time posting here, but essentially I got accepted as a transfer to the University of Michigan College of Engineering as a Computer Engineering major (might change to Computer Science). I heard applying to the College of Engineering as a transfer is much harder to get into, so I was kind of surprised.

Regardless, I just wanted to speak on a few things in terms of financial aid. Those who transferred or came here as a freshman, how generous are they?   


**Some Information:**  
I'm coming from out of state. My EFC is 0000000 (basically I get full grant money). I've been in Community College for 3-4 years with 2 associates: *Computer Science & General Engineering* with a 3.98 GPA in CS and 4.0 in Engineering.

I'm a Jack Kent Cooke Semifinalist, won multiple scholarships and awards like coca cola, have been a president in multiple organizations, College SG, and campus clubs, and have been in leadership positions within Phi Theta Kappa. 

I'm currently 21 turning 22, have interned at Nexon KR, SAMSUNG Scholar something (forgot the rest of the name), an online NASA Scholar project, and am currently an intern as an IT and software engineer at a hotel in collaboration with Amazon.

I'm probably missing a few more I don't remember off the top of my head, but that's about it. I'm applying to Columbia as well, but I heard they're notorious for transfer financial aid.

Basically, going back to the title: How generous are they? 

Any Merit Aids, or amazing need-based aid? Cause I'm thinking of taking a gap year if I don't win Jack Kent Cooke Scholarship or any aid for that matter. 55k+ tuition is crazy."

**Extracurriculars/Activities:**

1. Foreign Exchange — Spent every year since freshman year applying and getting involved with the foreign exchange students in my own region from other countries and got inspired to do it myself. Canceled due to covid until junior year. Majors (SPE'S) included poli sci, sociology, geopolitics, and econ (these were all given to me as they were the most literature heavy hs majors) Wrote some essays about how I was always pushed into science courses and how this gave me an opportunity to explore the humanities and finance coming from a stem hs/ms background. This also gave me the opportunity to write about cultural strife and language learning.
2. Paid work- Orthodontic Assistant & Records Coordinator - Family business (mom is an orthodontist) but ended up getting employed by an associate who was understaffed and just ended up staying with them throughout hs. Started this job as an 8th grader so it was cool way to spend summers and learn about medicine, sterilization etc over time as well get my assistant cert as a senior and work on patients teeth officially after just being a helper for the last 4 yrs.
3. Co-Founder and Vice President of a free tutoring program for underprivileged kids (community is known for being pretty suburban wasteland with tutors being really expensive) gave a bunch of volunteer hours to other hs kids.
4. Emergency Dep Intern at Hospital - Basic internship restocking and helping nursing / triage staff
5. 3 year of varsity polevaulting (2 years captain)
6. Work / Art - Work as a contributing fine art photographer for a regional magazine for a personal feature page every month since 2018 (55 editions published!)
7. Speech Pathology Dep Internship - Same hospital - Alot cooler wrote a few essays about this experience as it was something I didn't really expect to really like. Helped speech patholists perform neurotherapy sessions on trauma patients (mostly heart attack and car crash survivors)
8. Lax Player Freshman year - hated the sport but it gave background to how i originally met and got interested in being an exchange student as this is how met the first one at my hs. 
9. Summer Scuba Diving Internship in Costa Rica - Assisted Costa Rican diver masters in collecting data for climate and overfishing research used to shape legislation in federal parliament. (Kinda a well roundedness activity but I was actually quite passionate about it and honestly I was running out of things to mention, lol)
10. Monthly foodbank volunteering - Self explanatory

**Awards/Honors:** (list here)

1. Rotary Youth Leadership Award
2. NHS Member
3. 1st student to have an exhibition in regional museum. 

**Essays/LORs/Interviews:** (briefly reflect/rate) Essays: Personal statement was foreign exchange changing life perspective (especially as a student)

LOR: 

International Studies Teacher - wrote a great one about having me as a student during covid and being quite literally one of two students who ever engaged all year. He inspired me to further pursue foreign exchange after the first shutdown 9.9/10

Spanish Teacher - He doesn't write very good English but it was a really sweet essay about my character 7/10

Friend of Mine's mother - Met formally during my study abroad during a spring break trip to Switzerland about competency as a global citizen 6/10

Interviews: 

Georgetown - In person went really well as I actually knew some of their colleagues and had connections to Pitt where they did their residency

Pitt - BS/DSS went well enough felt a little dumb after though as I didn't have an published research like most candidates did

**Additional Information:**

Overall I feel like foreign exchange made me a very toss-up candidate since I wasn't really given the chance to prove myself in a lot of APs. No science courses for a year definitely was a negative for my reaches so I don't really know how to feel since the schools that seemed to read through my app gave pretty decent scholarship (not many straight acceptances w/o scholarships except McGill where I'd be an international student). Thankful for the acceptances and I am beginning to reflect on the rejections (especially Georgetown and BU lol)."

I am aware that my application is far from perfect, but god this sucks. The plain fact that I am intl applying for aid completely ruins my chances.

1298rwk,8,2023-04-01,Update on Termination: Now Potentially Terminated from Program,oatmilkbar10pm,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/1298rwk/update_on_termination_now_potentially_terminated/,"
Continuing from my last post, I'll give a quick run-down and the quick update.

I spent time outside of my school, out of state, to do a remote internship with a non-profit organization.

While being there, I experienced culture shock, but also generally felt unwelcome, neglected, and even coerced. The clinical practice was confusing and inconsistent (I'm not allowed to counsel alone, where is the supervisor?!). 

After three months of this kind of stress, I wrote a letter to the supervisor at the time, addressing my concerns about the environment, including strong feelings of stress. I used strong language, such as ""risking emotional abuse,"" because some of the behavior was indeed this to a degree which could be argued for as a brand new counseling intern out of state and away from my school for the first time. 

Without warning, no meeting, no processing, no initial ""sit-down"" to discuss anything - the supervisor fired me on reasons which were based on speculation with no hard evidence. The main reason was responding to my stress letter, thinking I was ""defaming"" the organization with ""accusations,"" when instead I was doing what I felt I was permitted to do in an otherwise ""safe"" and ""welcoming"" place. The supervisor wanted to see how I could grow, and this felt like I could be honest. Apparently not. 

The supervisor also tried to diagnose me or suggest in speculation that I had autism, simply because of my relational stress - but this felt unprofessional, and she provided no resources or more genuine evidence to suggest these things. I could speak on many more questionable events, but I will try to keep this brief. Again, I posted on this a week ago when the termination happened. 

Coming home to my school, the meeting with the clinical faculty was short, and felt sterile. They had read the letter I sent to the supervisor, including an additional secondary record of anecdotes I wrote to give more context to the questionable practices and experiences. No processing, no real discussion, just lot's of administration-speak, and suggestions of ""Keep your options open,"" as they said they will decide on whether to terminate me from the counseling program in order to ""Gatekeep the Profession,"" and how they thought I may not be fit for ""clinical work,"" even ""breaking their trust.""

My GPA is above 3.5 in all classes, with A's in clinical skills classes and practicum. My last supervisor (before this one that fired me) gave great reports on my clinical skills. I have received other great reports, and have not shown any deterioration or hindrance thus far in the program. Not that I am perfect, knowing I clearly have things to work on, but no one sat me down ahead of time to warn me, talk with me, or formally require me to work on things. 

And now they're considering to terminate me, after three hard-earned years and almost the full 88 credits, as though none of that even mattered. They said I am ""one of their own,"" and they would make sure I was ""taken care of,"" but I don't see how termination is the answer. 

Again, all of this, whether during the out-of-state internship, or even during the program here at home, could've been 100% preventable if someone formally warned me, discussed with me, required me (in writing) to do something, or put me in a remedial plan to recover - if there really was indeed an issue with me. Instead, I have received none of this. 

""Gatekeeping the Profession"" sounds like preventing me from becoming a counselor, or pursuing the mental health field. They said we will meet again next week for the decision - yes, they said they'll just take a week to decide. A week to decide whether to cut three years of progress away, or to let me continue and finish. 

So after that meeting, I have been paranoid and frantically thinking, future-planning, researching school programs, ANYTHING to assure that I can absolutely continue and pursue the mental health field and become a therapist. Their words scared me into thinking that if I bring this stacked resume, but nasty termination based on speculation and misunderstanding, that other schools wouldn't accept me if they check back to my school and hear them give their reasons. 

This current program is a Master's LPC program. 

I have begun to relax a little, now during the weekend and all, but this has all been such a whirlwind in the past few months, and just the past two weeks. I already feel pain just recapping what happened, and this may be a type of trauma that will need to be processed and treated in my own therapy later on. 

Does anyone have suggestions? Wisdom to share? Assurance about other schools and acceptance?

 I'm praying for the best and preparing for the worst. I refuse to let everything I have been doing go to complete waste. Everything - coursework, trainings, hours, research, and more - will not be considered worthless because of a an apparent mistake on my part for reacting poorly (was it though?!) to a particular type of stress (understandable!) that can otherwise be improved upon with some time off (and therapy) and a smooth return later, not termination."
1298zvb,14,2023-04-01,Pulled during my plan to be informally told I’m not being rehired,lpiunrspelye,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1298zvb/pulled_during_my_plan_to_be_informally_told_im/,"TLDR; my principal approached me during my plan to casually tell me my contract isn’t being renewed. I think his delivery was inappropriate and violates policy. I’ve been in a constant state of anxiety ever since. 

Edit: My issue is not that I’m being let go!! I understand this happens to people everywhere. My issue is the way the news was presented to me and I was then expected to finish out my day like everything is fine. 

Late last week my principal entered my classroom during my planning period, which is the very first part of my morning. We talked for a little bit about student behaviors and he kept complimenting me on how well I was handling things. After a short conversation he casually slipped in that they are planning to search for another candidate and he was doing the “professional courtesy” of letting me know early. I was entirely blindsided as I’ve been given nothing but positive feedback this year and this meeting was entirely unplanned and unofficial. 

I immediately began crying and tried to hide it, which he noticed and kept mentioning how I was really “handling this like a professional.” Once he left my room I sprinted to my car where I began having a full blown panic attack. I was expected to pick up my class from music 20 minutes later. I ended up emailing him that I would need to take the remainder of the day off because I needed time to process the news. 

I ended up going to the ER that night because I was having back to back panic attacks for more than 14 hours. 

My issue is not that I am not being rehired. I understand that I’m on a temporary contract and they have every right to not renew. My issue is that I feel like the way my principal approached me was incredibly inappropriate and shows me how truly undervalued and under respected I am. 

Per my district’s negotiated agreement my principal is required to notify me both verbally and in writing. I have yet to receive any written notification in the two days since it happened, though I have been to anxious and have not been back in my building. 

I also think it’s important to note that months ago I overheard another teacher telling a student intern that they would likely have a teaching position open in my grade and they should apply. I am one of two teachers in my grade and my partner is definitely not planning to leave. I really wish I hadn’t ignored that red flag and asked about it at the time. 

The whole situation feels very inappropriate and I’m so uncomfortable. I’ve been in a constant state of anxiety and I’m not sure what I should do moving forward. 

I’m waiting to hear back from a union representative but it could be a couple of days before they respond. I’m uncomfortable going to my own union rep because she has a close personal relationship with my principal. 

I’m honestly not sure what I should do but my body is filled with anxiety over the situation."
129a803,0,2023-04-02,Should I renege PWC cybersecurity consulting internship for a SWE internship at Y Combinator backed AI company?,Relevant_Departure_5,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/129a803/should_i_renege_pwc_cybersecurity_consulting/,"I got an swe intern offer recently from a small but somewhat established(as in it has been around for few years) Y Combinator AI company that is invested in by OpenAI and is based in Silicon Valley. As someone interested in AI, the only downside from this company being a dream company is the prestige of being big tech or a brand name.

I already accepted a PWC internship a while back for cybersecurity consulting. While cybersecurity is interesting and the PWC name brand speaks for itself, I am not sure if it is worth it since past posts make it seem unsure if it is very coding heavy.

This is my 2nd year so I will have two more internship year before graduating from a probable 1 year masters. My dream as most aspiring swe is to get into a FAANG or unicorn level company. I am ready to burn bridges for better offers if needed to reach that goal since it is not like most companies rely on undergraduate students who aren't even in the company yet to make a true impact, and most companies favor themselves first too these days with layoffs so why should I be loyal unless I have a truly special relationship or am hurting someone.

Essentially my questions are:

1. Which internship sets me up better to get into big tech in the next 2 years?
2. If anyone knows, do PwC cybersecurity interns do any coding work even if it's just Python scripting?
3. Does being a Y Combinator actually boost the prestige compared to a regular startup company? This is going to sound artificial/silly but I feel that is how recruiters who look at resumes for 10 seconds can only be. If I were to choose the Y Combinator company, should I write on my resume Company (a Y Combinator company) to give my internship some sort of credibility.
4. As an aspiring SWE, how detrimental would reneging a PwC offer be if I were aiming to apply to other big companies in the future (like no mass blacklist)?"

Genuinely one of the nicest people ever, and extremely supportive, even when would get in trouble for bs at school this guy had my back!!! Counselor mentioned that it was one of the best recc letter he has ever seen.
2. ELA Teacher (10/10): Taught me 3 AP classes and was strange at first. Once you unlock his personality tho, he was a menace. Bro was an avid UFC fan, and we would chop it up about Khabib, Jon Jones or our personal favorite KHAMZAT!!!
3. Counselor (8/10): Told me I wasn't going to get in anywhere and once recommended I apply to Northeastern and Stevens. Even though in those instances he pissed me off, he was really good guy.

**Additional Information**

All in all I would say my college admissions process was interesting to say the least. I definitely regret not applying myself more through high school, because I know if I had put in the same hours as the try hards at school I would have gotten a 1550 and a 4.0. ""If you think the cost of winning is too high, wait until you get the bill of regret"", and as corny as it may be after Ivy Day I received the bill. I still have some nice options under my belt though, so if anyone has any advice on where I should go please feel free to mention it. Is it worth it to go to UMich if I am not at Ross, or should I just go to UT?"
129bvob,1,2023-04-02,Should I stick with my current job or switch to my internship?,N0tYesterday,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/129bvob/should_i_stick_with_my_current_job_or_switch_to/,"Hey guys I feel like I'm in a very unsure position in my life and I'm just looking for some advice.

First off, a little bit of my scenario.

 I'm still in college and won't graduate for a couple more years. To say the least my college path has been less then ideal. I started in engineering and then later took a gap year before switching to business administration with an certificate in supply chain management.

&#x200B;

As for my current job position, I have been working at a national, direct to consumers warehouse for about 3 years and have gotten multiple promotions pushing me into positions where I have gained more responsibility and many pay raises. I've been through a lot of highs and lows where I hate my job or I feel satisfied going to work.

Lately, along with may other companies we have gone under layoffs. While I personally don't feel like I'm at any risk (because of some specialized trainings I've received). We have also cut hours from 2 full shifts to working 1 shift. They however, have not laid off anyone at my level in the warehouse. This means that we have enough people at my level to run two full shifts. To add on to that we have excess supervisors and the level above me has almost entirely taken over my responsibilities. I haven't been ""demoted"" or taken a pay cut. But lately I've been working in a lot in positions that are equivalent to if I would have been demoted.

I currently make about \~$21.50 per hour and have access to a 401k, even as a part-time employee. This company has a rigid work schedule that you can either make work or not and isn't very close to my apartment.

&#x200B;

As for my Internship. I have been hired on for this summer but have been given the idea that many internships can continue on, even meeting a couple of interns who have continued with the company in full time positions and as interns. I have accepted this position for the summer.

The internship is with an established company but in a much newer warehouse division (they're technically still a part of corporate level of new), where they are attempting to establish a warehouse presence and supply their own subsidiaries/fulfil direct to consumer orders. In my interview where I was talking to my GM/ the person I will be responding to, I was told that I was actually desired for my position and work with my current company and that they would like to use my experience to help grow the current warehouse system through some of their beta programs.

I feel like I have a lot of room for growth in this company/position as they want to expand in the next couple of years from 1 warehouse to somewhere in the range of 4-5 warehouses, spread throughout the US. I genuinely believe it's a reasonable goal based on the growth rate of the main company as well as the rate they are buying up subsidiaries. If nothing else I hope to get good experiences to put on my resume after this summer.

My pay here will be at $18 per hour but will be much more fluid schedule that will make picking up more hours easier. It's also much closer to my home and school and is a much more laid-back work environment.

&#x200B;

Here's my issue.

I feel like my decisions now will dramatically effect my relationships with both companies. I feel like I can work around this summer if I just work 7 days a week (it would suck but also fix my bank account) along with my summer classes. The internship has already been very open to letting me work the hours that I want. However, it is encouraged that I work full time here during the summer (10 weeks to be exact). I could just work my current job on weekends while working the internship over the week.

My concern is which job should I take come the school year again ( I know it's a problem for the future, but it's eating away at me now), and what if I don't even get an offer to stay on with the internship. I don't actively want to work at my current employer, but am not at a point that I would really be considering quitting if I didn't have another offer come up and I am struggling to make the logical half of my brain accept the lower pay I may be making (my solution to this is to hopefully negotiate pay at the end of my official internship if I get an offer to stay on).

I feel like if I work 7 days a week I will burn out very quickly and get to the point of wanting to quit one of the jobs before the end of the summer or will start to struggle in my classes.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any input or advice it is appreciated."

Currently debating between Cambridge and UCLA lol; Cambridge has a super strong math program (ranked so highly worldwide) and only three years of college but UCLA also has super good academics plus the sunny weather, in-state tuition, and after I graduate I'll have some connections in the US instead of in the UK… but then my parents are willing to pay for either one so…

I think the main problem with my application is my GPA; it's way too low for schools' liking. I shouldn't have trolled during my sophomore year--honestly I don't think I even tried-hard in high school in any year besides my freshman year--but I'll take the consequences. Once again I thank the UCs for not rejecting me and UCLA for finding value in me.

I am graduating from an Agtech degree that is heavy on the GIS and am keen to work in some GIS role (there's a massive demand in my area and I have been shown interest at places I have interned). 

Basically, I have a lot of free time in my final semester and my local vocational school is offering free Certificate 3 surveying (basically introductory skills, goes for 9 months). I was wondering if it's worth learning some surveying skills or if I'm just better off using that time to get a related part time job/another internship?"
129dvwq,6,2023-04-02,My company hired every intern but me to continue working for our department. Now I’m screwed,RadioDude1995,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/129dvwq/my_company_hired_every_intern_but_me_to_continue/,"As the title states, I’m feeling pretty low, since I’ve found out that I’m being dismissed from an internship. To be entirely fair, the internship was going to end no matter what, but I’ve been informed that I won’t be sticking with the company after my last day. 

Ironically, it’s not because I did a bad job, but rather I just wasn’t aggressive enough (which is entirely my own fault). All of the other interns have been hired on at the company and will have the opportunity to stay. The company seems to have been pitting all of the interns against each other, just to see how far they could push us before we break. I’m just too nice and easy going of a person to let these tricks get to me, and now I’m paying the price. I tried to be a “good” employee and do what they say (and even sacrifice my own well-being to try and show some dedication) but the company definitely used that as an excuse to take advantage of me. After speaking to the other interns in my department (in private), they told me that they gave the company strong ultimatums, and demanded to have some formal offer of work after the internship was scheduled to end (and it worked). I didn’t, and here I am. If I could go back time, I would have threatened to quit months ago so I could have gotten the same deal that they received. I had the opportunity to do exactly what they were doing, but instead I tried to be nice, collaborative, and hopeful that my efforts would be recognized. They weren’t. 

As of now, I’ve been given the excuse that there’s simply no budget to hire on anybody else (the other interns took that budget apparently). Is there really anything I can do at this point to make this situation any better? I just feel entirely screwed over, but I know there’s only one person to blame, and that’s the person looking in the mirror."

I'm a recent computer science graduate with an AWS CCP certification, and I'm on the hunt for a DevOps internship. I've been searching for over a month now, but unfortunately, I haven't received any responses yet.
I'm passionate about DevOps and eager to get hands-on experience in this field. I've applied to several internships online and customized my resume and cover letter to showcase my certification and relevant coursework. However, I still haven't heard back from any companies.
I've been networking with my friends and family, but I feel like I need to expand my reach. That's why I wanted to reach out to the DevOps community on Reddit.
If anyone knows of any DevOps internships or has any advice on how to land one, I would greatly appreciate it. I'm open to attending networking events, building my portfolio, and being persistent in my search.
Thank you in advance for your help and guidance. I'm eager to start my career in DevOps and can't wait to see where this journey takes me."

Based on my RP the below courses are most likely  (99% chance) what I’ll be offered by the respective big 3 

1) NUS business (I’ll take a specialisation in finance and double major in literature to maximise CAP) 

2) NTU accountancy and business double degree 

3) SMU business and economics double degree

8 months ago, I found this sub-reddit. Me,27 years old, seeing that was not bad of an age, became eager to become a programmer. I was already good with computers (you know what I mean, not programmer-good lol). I had left half a CPA and a big 4 job behind (toxic as hell) and figured this could work.

I didn't even have a laptop, my dad had to buy me one.

I used to read about people quitting but I never figured I'd be one of them, although my reasons differ. I finished both the web dev camps by Angela and Colt and like 25% of Angela Python camp.

Projecting the fact that my job hunt would be solely based on luck alone, my motivation waned. Even for an internship it seems they expect you to know everything. And it doesn't help that I'm from India, where the competition is so intense and where most people get jobs through college placements. And there's just so much information, and every employer is looking for something different. And seeing the job cuts was an addition.

Nevertheless it was kinda fun. I liked programming, learning it was a bore though. I guess it just added to my knowledge and nothing to show to an employer. I cried a bit. Now I think I'm gonna finish my CPA and get a job(sigh. So much for work from home and non- toxic culture).

But anyway thanks guys, I would have never taken the plunge was it not for this sub. At least I have a practical deeper understanding of the programming system now. ( A great hobby.)"

UW is the better-ranked college + Seattle seems to have more internship and job opportunities however it's really hard to give up a great offer by UMD which guarantees me a major l'm interested in.

UW Seattle would be around 8K USD more than UMD but the cost is no barrier.

129gogg,54,2023-04-02,internship alert for TMJCians and uni students,seasohtwo,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/129gogg/internship_alert_for_tmjcians_and_uni_students/,"hi, i had been doing this internship for about more than 2 months now. i wanted to post this to caution those looking for internships after a levels, especially tmjc students and uni students doing this as part of their curriculum. to my knowledge, every year a few tmjc students are offered around a 6 month long internship by some teachers at 2 companies, which are research/healthcare related. i, along with a few friends, took up this offer at one of the companies which researches gut science and had experienced a few red flags:

- was kept in the dark about the initial details: we completely did not have any information on this internship whatsoever after the teacher called/texted us about the offer until we had to email and call the hr liaison at this company. the teacher wasn’t even given any information at all either and could not give any.

- messy arrangement process: the company will try to ask you for the area of interest to be allocated to, no. of working days, part-time options etc. in my experience, these things were not even communicated by the hr liaison to the rest of the colleagues, including my own boss. i was not allocated to my area of interest (lab research) despite voicing it out and requesting for it, and i did not intend to sign the contract if i was allocated to a different area. while trying to ask for changes in arrangement, i was rushed to sign the contract by the liaison and was told there will be a rotation of job roles and i could change my job role during the internship itself. the expectation they set was that i would be rotated over to the lab department after 2-3 months. however, the liaison did not arrange the rotation and did not inform any of the involved parties at all. during the internship itself, i got offered a temporary lab job role for 1.5 days instead, which contrasted with the liaison’s initial offer. for future interns, you might have a different liaison so this may be different. 

- toxic work environment: this was not applicable to all the interns, including myself, but i have heard a lot of instances of very unsubtle bullying of other colleagues during meetings, colleagues who disregard working together and deliberately refuse to communicate to them, colleagues who order others around to do the work they were supposed to do, pushing others to do their work, disregarding others’ effort, and even expecting interns to greet and acknowledge them without reciprocation etc, and these instances are rampant and stretch across more than one department. although this is regarded as normal in the corporate world, a red flag with rose tinted glasses on is still red. 

- the budget is suspiciously tight: i’m an a level graduate, so i am paid a “transport compensation” of max $550/month for full-time. as a part-timer working 3 days per week, i am “compensated” around $200-$300/month. uni students here are “compensated” $1K/month. because this is filed under “transport compensation” and not “salary”, there is no cpf. for most of the effort my friends and i are putting in (testing samples, writing content, literature searches, event planning, packing orders, working on company projects etc) and working the full working hours as regular staff, i feel that we are very underpaid. at the lab department with both uni interns and a level grad interns, all the interns do the same work and have the same job expectations, however, the a level grad interns are still paid less than the uni interns. another red flag was the expectation that company events are allocated VERY little budget, with their first open house being expected to have $0 budget. that is literally impossible if you are inviting people over to the office and holding a small convention there to promote your products and company ideas. staff who are working for these events, which are outside of working hours, are NOT compensated at all. and these events are COMPULSORY.

these are just my personal opinions and experiences and it’s okay if you disagree with me. despite the many bad aspects of the internship, i enjoyed lots of good ones. i had a good working environment in my department and made some friends and happy memories here too. 

i know that every year more prospective interns, especially those who are a level graduates and are not protected by any higher organisation like uni or poly students, are exploited here. they are even searching for more interns now. internships are supposed to help students gain work experience and learn rather than earning money, but there is a fine line between genuinely giving students learning opportunities and using it as a guise for exploitation. 

if you want a good first internship experience, i STRONGLY advise not to take up one here as not every department here has good work ethics. please be aware of what you might get yourself into and don’t be afraid to ask more questions! if you’re a tmjcian and lucky enough to be offered an internship from a teacher, please choose the one at NUH. good luck and stay safe while searching for internships!!"

I’ve been thinking about this question lately.

If you’re an employer, would be prefer to hire someone who has accumulated many related internships/experiences but average in GPA, or someone who has a first class honours (FCH) instead?

I understand that perhaps this question depends on your major/ industry. And of course it would best to excel in both. 

But for someone who could only focus on one, what do you think? Great internships/experiences with normal GPA, or FCH with normal work experiences. 

Furthermore, could someone who has many internships be preferred over a FCH? How much do employers value FCH in the industry/ workforce? 
(Other than Govt sector because I think they value FCH a lot haha) 

Thanks for reading and have a great day ahead! 😊

For context: I’m from computing, but would love to hear from other degrees as well!"

I am not from US and in my university, the transcript won't show your backlogs if you finish them within 8 semesters. But recently I found out I will have at least 1 subject that I will only be able to give after my 8th semester. That means I will have to wait for next semester's final exam to retake that exam. After that it takes at least 3 months for the results. This means at least 9 months wasted. I need to apply for masters and was planning to apply for masters in december for fall intake next year as my 8th semester exam finishes in september, I get results in late november and I can do my GRE and TOEFL, SOP from september to november. But now the whole plan is sacked.

This has literally pushed my life at least 1 year back and I don't even know how much this will affect my chances of getting into masters in USA. I already will have low gpa (3.1). If I score 315+ in GRE and get really good score in TOEFL ( I had 7.5 overall score in IELTS), will it help? I will have 5 to 10 month experience including internship.

Having applied to Oxford for History last year and been rejected w/o interview (I really messed up the HAT entrance exam), I decided to take the gamble and try again - but this time, applying to the US at the same time!

**Demographics**

* Gender: Male
* Race/Ethnicity: British Pakistani
* Residence: London
* Type of School: Competitive private
* Income: Large enough for us to probably receive no aid even from places which fully cover need for admitted students, but small enough for full $80,000/85,000 to be a real fucking pinch. Despite the fact that our income level was probably ineligible, we still applied for aid bc many of the need-aware places stated that to be eligible to apply for aid at any point in your 4 years should your circumstances change - a live concern for us for reasons I won't go into - you need to have applied at the point of admission. Make what you will of that. Did it hurt my chances? Maybe not as much as someone with greater need, but probably at least a bit.
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): None

**Intended Major(s)**: History (Public Policy and English as well if multiple spaces allowed for)

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): N/A

Additonal Info: I talked about my Gap year job in more depth. I also outlined my other gap year plans: interning for a nonprofit in NYC over the summer, self-funded, from my savings from my fundraising job.

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1-4. Various awards as a finalist and/or commended in national and international essay competitions.

5. Multiple academic school prizes at final school prizegiving - also gave a speech at the event (4 in the year of 200 did - somewhat analogous to valedictory addresses for Americans. Ig this might give a rough guide to what my 'class rank' would be, if we had that).

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

* English Teacher: 9/10. She knew me from many different activities in my school, and was also my Head of Year. We got on extremely well, and since I began a job at the school in my gap year that's only continued. 
* History Teacher: 10/10. Claims that I was in the top 2-3 students he'd encountered in a 30+ year career. 
* Counselor: 6/10. We got on fine and as above, having me around the school this year would have helped. However, not sure that we really know each other that well. Without giving too much away, at our school (a top private day school in London), very many people have started applying to the US (approaching half the year group), so she deals with a heavy caseload.
* Dartmouth Peer Rec: 10/10. One of my friends who's also on a gap year wrote this for me (he's going to an ivy next year - won't say which). Was incredibly kind: he shared it with me, but I didn't ask him to make a single edit.

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

* Princeton: 8/10. In person. Started off scary but we really hit it off in the second half. Spoke for 1hr 15m
* Duke: 9/10. Virtual. Bro showed up late, but was really chill. Offered to put me in touch with his daughter, a current Duke student.
* UPenn: 10/10. Virtual. We spoke for 1h 30m, and shared very similar interests re History, PubPol, etc. She was early 20s and so easier to speak to; she'd also come over to the UK for a Master's, so we had lots to talk about!
* Harvard: 7/10. In person. I had this interview a few hours after a rather \*\*chunky\*\* acceptance (a tale of two Cambridges...), and so was on cloud nine the whole time. Tbh the interview itself wasn't THAT great - spoke for 45m. It included the very Harvard question of 'where do you see yourself in 10 years time'...tf....I only give this interview a 'high' ranking bc of my mood at the time.
* Dartmouth: 2/10. Virtual. Nothing that awful, but interviewer was literally the most boring person. If watercress corresponded to people, bro would be a whole salad. 
* Columbia: 7/10. Virtual. Interviewer had just graduated, but was a little nervous and very mechanically rattled off a list of questions one by one, and gave one-line responses to some of my more extended answers. He did say he really liked me by the end and would give me a particularly high recommendation, but maybe he says that to lots of ppl yk.
* Stanford: 5/10. Virtual. My hardest interview. Bro really drilled into the 'whys' of my activities, so I hope I came off well. 
* Yale: 9/10. In person. We really hit it off and talked for about 45m. Strange, since our interests were polar opposite (mine are more literary/historical, his were more AI/techie), but he really sold Yale to me. 
* Cambridge: 8/10. Virtual. Two interviews with two people in each interview, one after the other on the same day. Obviously a whole different kettle of fish to the US interviews. First interview was a solid 10/10. Honestly one of the best academic discussions I've ever had, about everything from fin-de-siecle Viennese culture to the development of Russian Radicalism in the 19th century, through to the relationship between British industrialisation and George Eliot's fiction, not to mention the dialectic of various architectural styles such as Art Nouveau or Brutalism, and how they can symbolically function as bellwethers of historical trends....ahhhh was just so good. Second interview was a 5/10 LOL. Both interviewers had slight colds, and seemed somewhat distant. They quizzed me on climate history RIP - I spewed some absolute trite about ice cores and carbon concentrations in geological formations like the second-rate geographer I am. However at the end, we were discussing the American Revolution - he asked me how a specific event fitted into my analysis, I replied that I hadn't heard of the event, and upon his brief outline I gave a spontaneous response that they both seemed to love. Ig it showed adaptability/flexibility and most importantly, 'teachability', which seems to be the key quality these Oxbridge interviews look for when assessing who'd thrive in a tutorial/supervision context...

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Obviously the prose of this caffeinated Reddit submission aside lmao, I've been told by many teachers that my writing is particularly strong, which I guess the essay competition wins might also suggest. In my fundraising job this niche was singled out and I've been constantly thrown different drafting/proofreading tasks...so the essays came pretty naturally to me. My counselor told me they were up with the very best she'd seen in her career at the school.

* CommonApp: about navigating my relationship with religious parents in light of my atheism, and how it's taught me the value of never sacrificing people for ideals. 9/10.
* Supplements: varied pretty wildly, covering things like my parliamentary internship, movies, books, chess, activism responding to sexual abuse amongst young people, my relationship with my baby cousin, and even an extended essay upon what my accent (which many people comment on a being uniquely strange, a weird blend of Southern British English with a foreign tinge, and the odd Americanism thrown in too - some have said it resembles one of those natty midatlantic accents you hear in old movies...) says about me - used that for my UChicago quirky essay. Honestly the quality of the prose was never an issue, it was more the challenge of tweaking the tone here and there. Feedback from one or two close friends, counselor and one other in-school uni advisor was always great. 8/10.
* UCAS Personal Statement: basically a sequence of short commentaries upon niche literary tastes and books I'd read. 9/10.

**Reflections:**

When I was rejected from Oxford in my last year of school, I hadn't applied to the US. I figured I should in my gap year. I realise in retrospect, though, that my application was probably always angled towards Oxbridge/UK unis more than the US. My real strengths and 'spike' always surrounded my intended major/subject of History and writing abilities, with other extracurriculars pretty mediocre by Ivy standards.

For this reason I don't think my application for aid mattered much - my application probably wasn't enough for Ivy+ even had I not applied for it. And our need was negligible/non-existent: we applied, as above, in order to be eligible for applying for aid later (at all the non need-blind places) should our circumstances change. I don't know in the final analysis how much impact it had, really - any thoughts?

However, if anyone - particularly future applicants - is interested in learning more about the Oxbridge application process, please PM! As someone who has been through the process twice and received both decisions (with the 'yes' from the better one, I would argue!), I feel I can give at least a little guidance on things like PS/UCAS/Interview Prep/Entrance Exams/College Selection and Strategizing.

Thank you, reader\*, for trawling through this absolute novel of a r/collegeresults entry. Please - any comments or thoughts, whether kind or positively sadistic, are absolutely welcome.

So you can do the math on when i will hopefully graduate with my bachelors degree in Information Technology. Taking as much courses as i can each semester. 3 sessions each about 7.5 weeks long. 

So my question is should I start applying for part time help desk role positions now for more experience and knowledge about the field? ( Very new to IT with little information on it )Or a full time help desk role after I graduate college ? Since I’m attending online university, It would probably be easier for me then others to physically attend the place etc …Hoping to be a system administrator , tier III , support analyst etc … in the future once i learn WAY more about the field , just something along those lines. I’ve also been applying to internships too! But not help desk roles yet."

I got offers from CMU ECE 2024 spring term and UW ECE PMP.

Letters of Recommendation

(Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)

AP Calc Teacher - 10000/10: She is an absolute Goddess, she wrote recs for every school and scholarship I applied to and she genuinely cares about me, even though I got a B in her class.

AP Bio Teacher - 10/10: Thé recommendation was good, but generic, but she specifically talked about my personality and work ethic more than just my accolades.

Retail Store Manager - 7/10: The recommendation was short but it alluded to my work ethic and the kindness I show toward my peers and customers. I love my boss!

HS Principal - 100/10: The rec letter was very personal and showed the best sides of my character, while saying my stats were pretty nice. I think this one stood out because my principal is over 3000 students and he doesn’t write recs often.

Interviews

(Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)

I’m not going to rate every interview simply because I had too many but here were things that consistently went right for me in my interviews for Yale and Duke.

-I answered the “tell me about yourself” question with talking about my heritage and connecting it to community service.

-I was on time and researched each school I was interviewing for before my interview. For example: for Duke I learned about tenting and random clubs; for Yale I learned about Gilmore girls and secret societies.

-I googled my interviewers and tailored my answers to them and either their heritage or the activities they did at the school for example: my Yale interviewer was a geologist so I prepared myself with som questions pertaining to rocks

-I asked actual questions about their life at the school and their post-grad life, not just basic things like “what was your favorite class?”; but real thing like “what did you do with your degree?”

Essays

(Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)

Common App : I’m not rating it because it was good, but the message was a little all over the place. I wrote about the US/African cultural divide and how I bridged the gap when I went to Africa for the first time.

Why Major: 10/10 - I connected engineering to my volunteer work with water treatment in west Africa and how I want to use engineering to help the people there.

Why University: 6/10 - I was basic and talked about my heritage and engineering for all of them, the more simple I wrote this essay, the better school results I had.

Opposing Idea: 100000/10 - I talked about how my bigoted AP World teacher consistently spread islamophobie and racism in his lessons and how I stood up to him by calling him out in class.

Additional Information:

College apps are confusing, but after going to BSAI I realized that schools are actually holistic.  The people who I got into the same schools with were very similar to me personality-wise. They are looking to create a class, and that is how they decide to admit. Like I was heartbroken over Penn, but I just wasn’t meant to be a Quaker, I was meant to be a bulldog. Even if you didn’t get into the school you thought was your dream, you’ll be ok and thrive wherever you do end up 🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾. 

PS. Do not be discouraged by the people on this sub. College results is kind of toxic and people are going to say whatever because they are salty. It’s not about the extracurricular that you do, it’s about how you impact your community and build your character throughout high school. Unless you love science Olympiad and are positively contributing to your community by being in it, maybe you should become a soccer referee instead."

Applying for software engineering/dev jobs for the summer+ has yielded much lower results than I initially anticipated (hundreds of applicants for each job on LinkedIn, for example).  The summer is approaching and I am starting to get desperate to make money.  I (perhaps rashly) applied for a ""Cloud Automation Test Engineer"" intern position and it looks like I may get an offer for up to 12 or 16 months.  Would this be a bad decision (i.e., a downgrade from my previous positions, look bad on resume, etc.) - should I be more patient for a Software Developer job, or could this internship be a good step in becoming an Intermediate Dev?"

LORs: Chem, Psych

Teacher 1: I've known for 2 years. Very good relationship with teacher, and they have written me LORs for summer programs in the past. She likes me a lot as well and we’ve had a lot of discussions about what to write.

Teacher 2: I've known for 4 years, a similar situation to the previous teacher.

Heard that both were too long to be submitted to the UK so assuming they had a lot of good stuff to say about me. Probably a 10/10.

Counselor Recommendation: We talk often. She’s writing mine personally after interacting with me. Something did for a handful in the grade.

Final Thoughts:

I don't know man\~ something must've been terribly wrong with my US App cause it didn't make a lot of sense. Might be my demographic, maybe my CAE? I got it reviewed by multiple ex-AOs as well so eh\~

What confuses me more is how the other countries worked out very well and in the US I got waitlisted at a place with a >30% AR. Definitely wasn't expecting that. The subjectivity in the process is confusing. Ngl I'm very disappointed that I probably won't be coming to the US because that's what I've always imagined my life to be for the last 4-5 years. Now it seems like a broken dream.

Will probably commit to Cambridge or St Andrews and am super stoked about it though. 

Feel really broken and need emotional support but I'll be struggling with IB Exams. Eh curse it we ball."

**UMD** (Total Cost: $60k)

**Pros:** 1) Pretty straightforward and simple to get into Computer Science major (I am guaranteed admission if I complete 3 gateway courses and achieve 2.7 GPA in each)

2) $10k cheaper compared to UCI

3) Close Proximity to Washington DC

**Cons**: 1) I got into Carillon Communities Program so I am guaranteed an AC dorm but the dorm is still pretty meh.

2) Most recruiters in DC are government contractors which may not prefer international students for jobs and internships.

3) Not as highly ""ranked"" as UBC

**UBC Vancouver** (Total Cost: USD 45k)

**Pros:** 1) Cheapest out of the three (also, I still have a chance to get a scholarship offer before May)

2) Work Permit in Canada is very easy to obtain after graduation for internationals as compared to USA

3) Highest ""ranked"" among the three

4) Beautiful campus and city

**Cons:** 1) Very competitive to get into Computer Science specialization in second year. The cutoff average reached 85% last year. So it's possible I may have to sacrifice my intended major.

2) Lesser tech jobs in Canada compared to USA

**UC Irvine** (Total Cost: $70k)

**Pros:** 1) Located near LA in California (good internship and job opportunities)

2) A lot of flexibility in the CS Curriculum to take electives of my choice

3) Tuition cost will be constant for all 4 years

4) Direct admission into Computer Science

**Cons:** 1) Most expensive of the three

2) Lowest ""ranked"" of the three

**Letters of Recommendation**

IB Math Teacher **(8/10)** \- *Not sure what he wrote but it got me into SSP. We have a pretty good relationship.*

IB English/TOK Teacher **(11/10)** \- *He sent this to me and he wrote it like I walked on water. It was absolutely insane the simpery this man did. He was at my feet praying for me like I was Jesus and he was my disciple. Called me most intuitive, hardworking, and gifted student he's had in his 11y of tenure and said I would be an absolute game changer in my field.*

Director of Higher Education **(8/10)** \- *Like standard employer recommendation but better? She basically attested to me being a girlboss leader in my internship (heavy project leader) and said I was making substantial change in education and my communication skills were godsend (not sure how true the last part was but I did file all of my paperwork for this at SSP lmao).*

**Interviews**

Harvard **(7/10)** \- *Second coolest guy I've met in my entire life. Double PhD + MD Harvard grad alum who said I would succeed anywhere but would be a great fit for Harvard. Weird because his residence is in Canada but he lived in my area 20+ years ago. Lasted probably 1h 15m.*

MIT **(6/10)** \- *Also a very cool guy. Described the struggles of taking 6y to graduate from MIT, gave me expert life advice, we connected over shared fields of interest. Lasted about 1h.*

Princeton **(5/10)** \- *Dude was so uninterested until I mentioned research and then quizzed me on Princeton's honor code LMAO. Asked me what I thought about eating clubs.. interview lasted 30 min because he had hard time limits. He said he wanted to do everything he could to get me into Princeton and I was one of the most impressive applicants he's interviewed.*

Dartmouth **(2/10)** \- *I never want to relive this experience again. I rambled too hard and this guy started grilling me on absolutely all of my ECs to make the snarkiest comments and then ask me what my parents did for work and cringe about my family. He still said I was impressive and I'd be a good fit for Dartmouth somehow.*

**Essays**

My commonapp essay was pretty good in my opinion. Many people told me it was nearly excellent. It connected experimentalism to different fields where my identity was formed (I discussed music, art, and astro) and then tied it back to my culture as a 2nd gen immigrant. Used a pretty risky metaphor about soup that was on the line between stupid and absolute genius but I think I pulled it off.

Supplementals were good. Kind of copied and pasted a few bases I made and reformatted things for most. I did spend time on these and my writing was very good apparently.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* *University of Arizona (EA), WA Franke Scholarship + 4.0 Scholarship + NMS Scholarship + Honors College.*
* *Columbia University (RD, Committed!)*

**Additional Information:**

Yes, I had one safety. I was going to commit to University of Arizona because they are so goated for astrophysics and it would be so cheap. I also went test optional for every school except Dartmouth, Harvard, Georgia Tech, and University of Arizona. Idk how I clutched RD but I did. Glad the season is over, this was exhausting."

I would greatly appreciate any advice on selecting between these universities. Thanks!

**UMD** (Total Cost: $60k)

**Pros:** 1) Pretty straightforward and simple to get into Computer Science major (I am guaranteed admission if I complete 3 gateway courses and achieve 2.7 GPA in each)

2) $10k cheaper compared to UCI

3) Close Proximity to Washington DC

**Cons**: 1) I got into Carillon Communities Program so I am guaranteed an AC dorm but the dorm is still pretty meh.

2) Most recruiters in DC are government contractors which may not consider international students for jobs and internships.

3) Not as highly ""ranked"" as UBC

**UBC Vancouver** (Total Cost: USD 45k)

**Pros:** 1) Cheapest out of the three (also, I still have a chance to get a scholarship offer before May)

2) Work Permit in Canada is very easy to obtain after graduation for internationals as compared to USA

3) Highest ""ranked"" among the three

4) Beautiful campus and city

**Cons:** 1) Very competitive to get into Computer Science specialization in second year. The cutoff average reached 85% last year. So it's possible I may have to sacrifice my intended major.

2) Lesser tech jobs in Canada compared to USA

**UC Irvine** (Total Cost: $70k)

**Pros:** 1) Located near LA in California (good internship and job opportunities)

2) A lot of flexibility in the CS Curriculum to take electives of my choice

3) Tuition cost will be constant for all 4 years

4) Direct admission into Computer Science

**Cons:** 1) Most expensive of the three

2) Lowest ""ranked"" of the three"

I am currently a 2nd year computer science student with a keen interest in technology, coding, networking, and IT. During my first year, I completed a 5-month full stack developer internship, and I'm now looking for advice on how to position myself for a successful career after graduation.

My goal is to be able to enter any junior role in my field of interest once I graduate. To achieve this, I plan to get an IT internship or part-time IT role (e.g. IT support, help desk), ideally I would work this role until I graduate so that I can graduate with a year of experience already. To help me achieve this, I will obtain my CompTIA A+ and AWS CCP certifications. While I study to finish my 3rd year, I'll continue working on my coding portfolio and obtaining my CCNA and AWS Associate certificates.

Once I graduate, I plan to apply for roles such as full stack developer, IT support, network engineer, or cloud/devops, depending on my interests at that time.

I would love to hear your thoughts on my plan and any advice you might have on how to achieve my career goals. Thank you in advance for your help!"

4. National Hispanic Scholar

**Letters of Recommendation**

Local nonprofit executive director (6/10) - she knows me really well since I've done a ton with this organization, but she was cramped on time so I helped her write some of it. Definitely could have been stronger but I think it just corroborated my ECs. Didn't add a new dimension though.

AP math teacher (7/10) - I've had him for two years and he definitely highlighted some good qualities, like the fact that I challenged myself to take AP stats as a junior despite it being a nearly all-senior class and did really well, and the fact that I skipped AB and I'm excelling in BC (I have a B, but still). I don't know him super well but he likes me, and that's impressive considering the fact that he's low key hard to please.

Freshman history teacher and history honor society club sponsor (4/10) - uhhh so I don't think she likes me anymore but at the time she did. We were close and nerded out about history together for a couple years since she became the librarian so I figured she'd make a good recommender. I'm sure she wrote a very generic one, and I only assigned her to University of Richmond.

Biology teacher (??/10) - I had her for freshman bio and AP bio. She probably wrote me a fabulous rec letter but I was a terrible student freshman year (think classic ADHD gifted kid; I was rly good at the class and she loves me but she also moms me a lot), soooo it could be a bad letter. Wild card.

My counselor from Thrive Scholars wrote me a rec letter, I think. Not sure. If so, it was probably a 6/10. Not super close and I can't seem to be on time for our meetings, but I'm a good student.

**Interviews**

NONE. T\_T

**Essays**

My personal statement was just an essay I wrote in AP Lang that my English teacher really liked. It was about the struggle of having to choose between being ""masculine"" for the sake of a career in business or being ""feminine"" to raise a family. I hate it but it's whatever. (4/10)

Supplementals were all written the day of the deadline or the day before. Creative topics, poor execution imo. From an unbiased standpoint, I'd say 7/10 for creativity, 3/10 for execution. (so 5/10?)

**Decisions (all RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* University of Richmond (w/ Presidential Scholarship I'll pay 13.5k/year)
* Williams College (8.5k/year) - Windows on Williams (fly-in program) attendee
* Stanford University (will pay 10.5k/year)
* In-state safety (not naming for privacy reasons but will pay 23k/year)

*Waitlists:*

* none, surprisingly

*Rejections:*

* Harvard University :(( first and only rejection lol but this one hurt my ego because my family filmed my reaction (didn't for Stanford tho)

**Additional Information:**

Parents' marital conflict increased sharply during COVID, so I took on much more household responsibilities. The pandemic disbanded clubs I was a part of during my freshman year, so all of my ECs are from 10th grade and beyond.

Dad was military for 20 years (enlisted) and we lived at the poverty line for much of my childhood; my parents both came from working-class families and didn't go to college so I did all this on my own.

&#x200B;

All in all, I'm pretty impressed with how college admissions season went for me considering the fact that I didn't shotgun and procrastinated on all my essays. If anyone needs help preparing for apps this next year, feel free to hmu in my DMs!"

I'm a Junior right now at a low tier university.  
CS major, Math minor (3.62 GPA; Dean's List).  
I have a little bit of experience in every programming language but I don't think so I can call any of them my main speciality.   
Also, I can't think of anything interesting to build.  
   
No Projects.

129txrn,14,2023-04-02,My parents say I’m not ready for college,Crazyfiagro22,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/129txrn/my_parents_say_im_not_ready_for_college/,"I have always been looking forward to college because of all the new people and experiences. I have decent grades and keep up with my work pretty well. I have a medical condition where sometimes I have to stay home because I’m sick and that leaves me having a lot of make up work due to missing so much school. I usually make up that work within the week I get back to school and besides from absences I would say I’m a pretty good student. 

I have been in between two colleges to go to and still haven’t made the decision where to go. I don’t like talking about it with my parents because it stresses me out that I don’t know which school to pick. Im thinking about going into pre-med and something research wise because of the medical condition I have and I would like to research more about it along with some other things. One college has an amazing health program and it is surrounded by hospitals where I could get an internship or work directly with doctors or technicians. But I don’t like the campus as much as I would like to. Now the other college is also a good school and I’m okay with the program I’m enrolled in at the moment but I feel like I won’t get as many opportunities here than at the other school. I love the campus and overall I could see myself living there. So I’m stuck.

Now my parents don’t think I am ready to go to college due to my many absences this year. They also see that I procrastinate a lot but in the end I always get my work done. I honestly have no idea what to do because they keep getting into fights about college. The whole thing stresses me out and they said that I should be excited to go to college (I am but I just don’t show it) and if I don’t want to go then I should not go. I know they are trying to be supportive of me but at the same time I feel like they are constantly pushing me down for not being ready for college in the social aspect along with the academic aspect of things. I personally think I am since I really do try hard at everything I do but I think my procrastination is overshadowing that. 

I just wanted to rant about that since I’m super stressed out by the whole ordeal😅🫠"

Spoke very highly of me at parent-teacher conferences, praised my final project greatly, and mentioned that she would use it as an example for future classes.

**Interviews:**

I LITERALLY GOT NONE WTF

**Common App Essay and Personal Essays:**

Pretty good imo but nothing exceptional. My common app essay analogized my life to the software development life cycle. I liked it and thought it was very authentically ""me"", and my English teacher really liked it also.

My other essays were a bit more mid, except for my UC essays, CMU, and UChicago essays, which I thought were pretty strong. I definitely got better at writing essays over time, so my RD essays were a lot better than my EA/ED essays. I tried to avoid cliches and make myself seem unique without being cringey, I think I did an okay-ish job at it.

**Overall Thoughts:**

This really was really quite a rollercoaster. At the start, my plan was to apply to 16-18 colleges at very most (my counselor told me to keep it to 12, but was unsuccessful in convincing me lol). Unfortunately, my Binghamton deferral back in January forced me to reconsider everything, and so I frantically added on Drexel, Stevens, Rose-Hulman, and RPI as safeties (and a few more target schools, like UMass, Purdue, and Case). I also realized that I could send my UC app to as many schools as I want, so I added UCLA, UCI, and UCSD in addition to UC Berkeley. Hence, I wound up with 26 applications. Oh well.

The weirdest thing, in retrospect, is that one admissions committee at Binghamton (a school which almost nobody with a higher GPA than me from my school has **not** gotten into) waitlisted me, while the admissions committee at Purdue (which had a \~6-7% acceptance rate for OOS RD CS applicants) accepted me, despite getting basically the same application.

My takeaways:

* Shotgunning is good, actually. I added Purdue on at the last minute, because I wanted to have more chances to get into a T20 program, and it worked. If I hadn't done that, I'd probably be at McGill, which is an excellent college, but a less good CS program.
* Apply to a lot of safeties EA. I wound up in the unfortunate situation of getting my first acceptance in mid-February. DON'T BE LIKE THAT. Also, this will give you a good opportunity to get practice writing essays early in the game, so that your RD reach essays will be better.
* Apply to OOS public schools EA (especially if you're doing Comp Sci). Some schools, like UMD, Purdue, UMass Amherst, and UWisconsin-Madison have great EA acceptance rates, but much lower RD acceptance rates (I basically lucked out with Purdue). I did not know this. I'm also pretty sure that the only reason I didn't get into UMass was because I applied RD rather than EA.
* McGill is an awesome choice if you have good grades and not great ECs/awards/recs. They literally only look at your grades, and [they make the cutoffs very clear](https://www.mcgill.ca/undergraduate-admissions/apply/requirements), so you basically know in advance if you'll be admitted. It's a great school in a great city, and the tuition is only $22k internationally. University of Toronto is like this as well, although their tuition is higher.
* Don't be discouraged by some bad news. Getting waitlisted at one safety does not mean you won't get into a more selective program. Although I theoretically knew this advice was true from the beginning, I really had to see it to believe it.

That's about it. Goodbye yall, it's been nice reading this sub."

I applied for the MPCS program in University of Chicago and recently got acceptance. My background is I have a CS undergrad degree from a top school in India and working in FAANG for last 1.5 year. I want to work in Computer vision though and that's why pursuing Masters. I also have one offer from Boston University MSCS. 

Wanted to understand, with the MPCS program costing 6.5k$ per course and 12 course program taking 15 months only including na internship, is it worth it?

I want to work in the US ultimately and figure that although the course is shorter, it means I can apply for a job more quickly. 

I'm torn up bcoz some ppl say the course is below undergrad lvl especially with people joining from diverse backgrounds with zero CS knowledge. Why then would I go for this degree?"

I have the rare opportunity to take a graduate level CS course next semester. However, I've heard that sophomore year fall semester is the best time to go look for internships and recruiting season can get crazy. However, I really want to take this CS course and I could be passing by a really good opportunity too if I don't take it. On the other hand, it seems more practical to focus on trying to get an internship rather than having my time consumed with coursework from this class. Should I focus entirely on this class if I take it, try to focus on both somehow, or not take this class?"

Through absolute luck I managed to land an IT internship last Summer and this Summer I'm doing SWE for a no-name government facility.

Will this give me a chance at getting interviews with bigger companies? I have 3-4 solid projects (in my opinion) to go alongside on my resume.

What should I do for the next 3/4 months to best prepare? I assume LeetCode mainly? I've solved like 40, mostly easies. Is there anything else I should spend time on to prepare for next Fall applications?"

How can I do this when every other software engineering job is highly competitive? Should I start learning C++?

Hello, I'm in my freshman year at a non target state school and I'm currently studying business. I wanted to get into investment banking but I honestly don’t have the gpa for it. However, I’ve recently developed an interest in game development, specifically gameplay programming. I’ve decided I’m going to change my major to computer science next year, as my school does not offer a game development program and I have zero coding experience.

I’ve done a little bit of research and I’m aware of the crash and burn pattern of the industry, and so naturally I'm pretty concerned about future job prospects. I've seen a few other reddit posts on this subject and people say things like “don’t get a game dev degree, get a comp sci degree and you’ll always have a well paying job” and “it’s all about your portfolio and who you know” etc.

But it seems like most new cs grads apply to hundreds of software engineering jobs and can’t get an interview? Not unless they’ve spent hundreds of hours doing leetcode challenges and studying interview books, completed 3 summer internships and built a nice portfolio of side projects, none of which are game related. They are also fluent in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, Python and SQL all at once!

While on the other hand, it seems like you can only get hired at a game dev studio if you are fluent in C++ and C#, proficient in at least one game engine, as well as having an impressive portfolio of games and multiple years of professional experience.

I don’t want to spend the next few years of my life working on the wrong skills and end up graduating to a job at McDonalds. It would seem like a comp sci degree would open the door to many different career paths including game development and software engineering, but in actuality, the skills and requirements for both of these industries seem to be completely different? How can I pursue a career in game dev while keeping software engineering as a backup if this is the case? If i start learning C++ now as my first language, will that skill be transferable between both industries?

Any help or guidance would be much appreciated, I'm kind of stuck in analysis paralysis right now. Thanks!"
129yn3i,1,2023-04-02,CE Undergrad Research,Ok_Conclusion7199,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/129yn3i/ce_undergrad_research/,"I just received an offer for Computer Engineering for Fall 2023 and I have a few questions about undergraduate research. While I'm unsure if I want to go directly into industry, do graduate studies or try my shot at starting a business after I graduate, I have a strong interest in conducting undergrad research. I do have some research experience (did some research at a particle accelerator, not much to do with ECE/CS, and did well at the Canada-Wide Science Fair) and did a software engineering internship, but I've never published anything. 

1) What are the best ways of finding research opportunities? I know you can email professors, but does that usually work? What are professors looking for in undergrad students helping them with research?

2) If I do contact professors, would it be better to ask to join their research project(s) or should I reach out about them mentoring me on my own research ideas?

3) I was looking throught the different research groups on the [ECE website](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/research/research-groups) and only one of them (the Real-Time Embedded Systems Lab) explicitly stated that they are open to undergrad students working with them. Would it be possible to contact the professors in the other groups or do they not allow undergrads to work with them at all?

4) For undergrads who do conduct research, when do they typically start? Would it be better to wait until third or fourth year, or could I start contacting professors first year (assuming I teach myself the skills/knowledge the professor wants)?

5) How feasible would it be for me to conduct research with CS professors/research groups as an engineering student?

6) Do you have any other advice or tips about undergrad research?

I'm sorry for the long post and if I got anything wrong about Waterloo/research. Thank you all for all the help!"

Naturally everyone discouraged me from going in the UAE considering my options, but I followed my instinct as I believed in the development of the MENA region and the prospects it would offer me.

Turns out committing to NYUAD was the best decision I’ve made. I am having individualized research opportunities, am actually able to work as an intern and obtain compensation with lower taxes (besides everyone telling me the internships are limited there), have been traveling in five different countries, and the list goes on.

My point is follow your instinct. Don’t succumb to peer pressure, because at the end of the day you’re the one spending 4 years of your life in that place."

I’m a senior interested in taking a gap year before going to college. I am currently valedictorian of my highschool with strong ecs, and the alternative to taking a gap year would be attending NCSU. 

As much as I think NCSU is a great school, I’m bummed because I feel like I didn’t send out enough applications (I only sent out 6, I was waitlisted at Duke and I feel like I kinda messed up my application by not marking myself as being able to do interviews) and I haven’t gotten a CENT of merit scholarship money from NCSU. It is also “the school everyone goes to” and I’m not sure if it’s what I want.

So why a gap year? 
I have a few reasons:
My mental health has been extremely poor and I’m worried that I will get to college and feel burned out, I have passion projects that I could work on in a gap year, I feel like I have missed out on a lot of fun because of all my hard work, I could save more money for college, and I really would like to reapply to more schools next year.

Hypothetically, I would try to intern at an engineering company and also try to learn solidworks and get certified.

I’m not sure if anyone in this sub has taken a gap year and been able to get into better schools because of it — or highly reccomend a gap year for other reasons, but I’m looking for any and all feedback.

Thank you!"

When I first got the news that I didn't get into UT’s McCombs, I was pretty bummed. I had my heart set on going there, and not gonna lie, I was feeling pretty salty about not getting that 40 Acres scholarship either because I'd have to pay the full cost, which definitely wasn't ideal. But then I started getting a couple other acceptances, but most surprising was Notre Dame. At first, I wasn't sure about the distance and if it was gonna be the right fit, but after doing some research and talking to some current students, I realized that it'd be the best move for me. Go Irish!!!"

I've had a few interviews since Grad, but no luck there. some my fault, some external. 

It's become pretty clear after 3 months in this market that without an internship, interviews for entry-level roles are going to be really rare. To add insult to injury, I'm living in a Ontario, Canada where internships can't be unpaid, so 99.99% of the time internships are for students because of government grants. As well I find my friends who are dual citizens or have big tech backgrounds can really only find work in the US.

With most postings having at least 20 genuine, decent applicants (not bots, people with no experience and non-citizens) and demanding quite a bit of specific knowledge, hovering near the average just won't cut it. 

Anybody got some guaranteed for breaking this paradox beyond sheer brute force applying?"

I currently don't have faith that I will get one. what are some opportunities that are available for the summer (doesn't have to be internships) or even things I should do over the summer to build myself up for the next year. i would greatly appreciate any sort of feedback/ suggestions! thank you

The pay has been good and benefits amazing, but am starting to feel the toll on my body for being in this industry for so long. Currently I am taking some online college courses to work on achieving an AA degree in cyber security and then work on achieving relatable certs after the AA degree. I assume I am going to still need to start from the bottom like an internship and work my way up. I have some IT knowledge due to typical trouble shooting I do currently with my work … but was curious if anyone has farther advice for someone entering this field somewhat later in their life."

* Counselor: 8.5/10 - we know each other well and have a good mentor-student relationship, which really improve when I was a junior! Definitely now super tight asf, but I definitely had trouble getting to know her in freshman and sophomore year.
* Art Teacher: 8-9/10 - she has known me for 2 years and has seen a lot of my struggles and successes. Even though her class was difficult, I found that I grew a lot from her advice and guidance.
* Intern Manager: 9.5/10 - we worked really closely together on a lot of intern-related business. Also had both a great work relationship and friendship <3 Literally love her sm. 

**Interviews:**

* Tufts. 
* Rochester. 
* Cornell \[info session\] 

I hardly remember them, but I don't think the interviews for these were horribly bad. I actually enjoyed connecting with both my Tufts and Rochester interviewers - they were really nice and helpful, and we had a great conversation. My Cornell interviewer was a nice guy, but he made a small comment about my weight & expressed his love for his frats :P 

**Essays:**

**Common App**: I changed my Common App between ED and RD. For ED, I wrote mainly about my job at my town's bakery and how it helped me connect with other people and by extension, helped me in other activities throughout my life. However, I changed it in the RD round to talking about how art has played a role in my life and how it has made me more persistent and thoughtful. I don't know if this was the right decision tbh - I think the Common App could have been one of my weaker points in my application. 

**Additional Info**: Basically, it was supposed to demonstrate persistence and how I learned from something. I'm being vague for the purpose of not wanting to dox myself :P

Accepted:

* **University of Southern California (currently, one of my top choices, the deferred EA ==> accepted RD trope is real).**

* Rutgers University. 

Waitlisted:

* Tufts University (still on the waitlist). 
* Carnegie Mellon University. 
* UCLA.

* UW. 
* Case Western Reserve University (withdrew >:() 

Rejected:

* WashU (ED1 ==> ouch, this actually hurt so bad. Literally gut-wrenching). 
* Emory University (ED2 ==> my counselor never sent my Midyear report :P).
* Northwestern University. 
* Cornell University. 
* UNC. 
* Boston University. 
* NYU. 

**Reflections:**

Gosh, I don't even know how to explain how lucky I am - from the amount of support I had throughout this process, to being able to afford to attend college in the U.S.. I'm so grateful to my parents, my teachers, and my friends for being there and having my back while I literally cried so much at every rejection. I remember when I got rejected ED how one of my friends dropped everything and ran to my house & gave me a hug, how my Mom read my essays and gave me feedback on them, and how others - kids in my science class, my gym teacher - congratulated me when I did get in places. This is such a mentally taxing, long, exhausting process for a high-school student, but the support and sheer luck I have had is literally unreal.

When I went into this process, I had about four schools that I had strongly in mind: Tufts, WashU, Emory, and NYU. I was rejected to all of these schools (except, WL from Tufts), but I'm feeling okay. I'm happy with the options that I have so far, an

That being said, here are several tips that helped me out here, and looking back, I wish I could have done if I were to begin this process all over again. 

**Tips:** 

1. **Start SUPER EARLY.** I crammed a lot of RD applications into my winter break, and it was not fun at all. It drained me a lot of my energy for midterms, and I am just coming back from a huge case bout of burnout and senioritis. I've been super depressed for the past few months and am still trying to heal from the rush and stress that was plaguing me in December. 
2. **APPRECIATE THE LAC's.** They are actually such gems in the college education system - small classes, good reps for careers/graduate schools, superb education from the professors! I also noted through what I have seen so far from schools like Carleton and Hamilton, the students and faculties are genuinely so kind, welcoming, and friendly - not a drop of elitism or arrogance. I highly, highly, highly recommend looking into some LAC's if you are interested!
3. **Apply to that school, even if you think you have a small chance.** One of my biggest regrets this application season was not applying to Barnard College - it was after my ED rejection and a deferral that made me believe that I wasn't good enough. Looking back, I still have the thought: ""What if I had applied? Would I have gotten in?"" 
4. **Don't slack off for Mid-year reports.** I did, and while I did have accomplishments and awards to report in my LOCI's, my academic performance did dip a bit. While I was still thankfully accepted into some schools RD, if you are aiming for more T20's, they definitely will not like this drop in academic performance :P Trust me, colleges do look at them. 
5. **Don't be afraid to pursue what you are truly passionate about.** This is super cheesy, and sometimes I do have trouble believing it myself. I didn't take AP Biology and was actually rejected from my school's science class. A lot of people - my parents, my parents' friends - have actually discouraged me from doing medicine, saying that it was too hard for me and that I couldn't do it - added to the fact that I could potentially be going across the country for the first time, alone. **And yes, I'm terrified - absolutely, paralyzingly terrified.** But as someone who declared pre-med on my application for USC, I didn't think I was actually going to get in, and sometimes now, I still think about whether I am capable enough to take on this rigorous course of study. It's still again, the question of: **""Hey, what if . . .?""** I might not be the best at science, but I know that if I went with doing something else as a major, I would have spent the rest of my life asking myself why didn't I at least given myself a chance and given it my all. The sky can be the limit if you want it to be. 
6. **Mental health, first \[TW HERE\].** I kid you not, this is so important. I let my mental health during the college admissions process slip so poorly, especially when getting rejected ED and several deferrals, and I started spiraling into straight negativity to the point where I contemplated ending it once. I would immediately go into this mindset of learned helplessness, thinking that I wasn't able to do anything about any of my results and that college admissions was the one-all, be-all \[I think that is how the expression goes\], that I would be a failure, and that I wouldn't get in anywhere. Regardless, I think one thing I took away from this process is that **at the ripe age of 17-18, your life is not defined by XYZ college, that no college acceptance/rejection is worth having your mental health turn into such a dark, dark place, and that when you do \[and I'm positive this will happen\] ultimately get to where you want to be, it will be even more special & rewarding.** And obviously: this applies to your friends! Many teens and young adults around the world are going through this stressful process - **make sure to check in on your best friends, random strangers on Reddit, etc., etc. and provide support and love!** I was lucky to have a very supportive group both inside and outside of my school \[S/o to 4 of my friends for getting into their dream schools ;)\]. 

Here sums up my college application season: my results, my takeaways, my tips. Feel free to PM me for help or just to talk :) I wish you all the best in college and next year for the CO'24!!"

**Additional Information:**

Pretty big loser in HS. Classic gifted kid ADHD never had to work suddenly needs to and can't hack it. Most people at my school are doing incredible shit - research, internships, etc. I did none of that. Not to mention every year of HS except freshman I missed week to months of school due to health issues. Surprised I got in anymore

Can't really decide on a school. Worried about drowning and getting lost at a big school but my smaller acceptances are pretty grueling schools and don't offer great humanities for my double-major/minor. Then there is the cost thing. I have decent aid and can afford them all except for UMD, but I want to eventually get a joint JD/MBA from a prestigious grad school and saving money for them by going to in-state might be helpful. But it's so huge I'm afraid of drowning like I said."

1. Ivy League status
2. Apparently good CS program
3. Apparently Good alumni structure
cons:

Philosophy Teacher (10/10): I honestly can't give this big a rating because I never saw it, but she reviewed my essay and believed her rec was absolutely parallel with it and she described me perfectly. Out of any teach her I would trust her with a recommendation without question. Had her for three years and one of the kindest people ever who always enjoyed having me as a student.

APUSH Teacher(8/10): Another teacher which I really enjoyed having throughout high school. He also taught Econ which I am in right now, and I find ourselves talking after the bell for ten minutes about recent inflation and banking news. Definitely the most skilled teacher I have ever had in the classroom. I always had A's but wasn't his best student, I am sure he remembered all the times I fixed a tech issue or helped put on a movie in class lol.

Counselor (9/10): I loved her!!! She was super amazing and helpful throughout this whole process and really pushed me to apply to a target school which I will never stop thanking her for. She knew me very well. She did advise me to be **test-optional to most schools and I didn't listen** because A2C thought my score was good enough :(

**Interviews**

UPenn interview (8/10) was actually pretty nice. I really stayed true to who i was and showcased that off entirely. Even if I wasn't the best student of all time with the best stats, I displayed myself. Later found out her daughter went to my school! At the end she told me she believed ""I would be a great fit for Philly""

Georgetown (7/10) The lady was also pretty chill and nice. It was in-person and I had just recently fractured my foot but fought thru it lol. Basically talked about how well regarded the institution was in my family and we bonded over stuff like basketball and other things. Left the place kind of awkward cause I didn't want her to see me limp LOL

**Essays**

Personal Statement was about my Sikh identity and what it has meant and taught for me throughout my life. My Philosophy teacher loved it and though it was very me and honestly I'd say the same. It had a recurring theme that I loved about the symbolism of the iron bracelet I wear everyday. Chose the diversity prompt.

**Additional Information:**

Okay. First off I totally blame myself for having two VERY conflicting interests. All my life I thought I wanted to be a doctor, but then sophomore year I fell in love with finance and investments, but still really liked my science classes. I decided I would apply Finance if the school was amazing for it and biology if not. It was pretty damn even, but now I realize I had no where near the EC's for those top finance schools. The best was the UPenn summer program I pursued, but other than a school club that was it. Also, my SAT probably was just not good enough to send everywhere. The things I would do for 20 more points!!!!!! I know I probably could've strengthened by application by just sticking to Bio and pursuing those EC's more, but I guess I wanted to try it my way. I know I am very fortunate to be in my position to go to college and I know my two acceptances are AMAZING, it just sucks that I put so much work in high school and I will probably end up exactly how the rest of my family did and IU and not leave the state like I hoped to. Really disappointed in myself  and am sad :(. Can't thank this sub enough for teaching me so much! Good luck to all those juniors, my advice would be sticking with a singular interest and just go for it!! Good luck guys :)))))))

edit: forgot to mention my strategy all along was to apply to IU and only reaches. Was hoping one would work out, but I'm so glad my counselor pushed me to apply to UCSD ang give me another option :) also if you know who i am shhhh tryna help ppl"

**Letters of Recommendation**

English Teacher (AP Lang & Lit, Literary coach): 9/10. I never read it, but she showed me that it was 2 pages on a Google Doc single spaced, and said she cried writing it. We're really close, and we've known each other for \~3 years, so I think this letter was probably very positive, showing my impact around the school and how I am in the classroom =)

Math Teacher (Honors Precalc, AP Calc BC, Math Team): 7/10. I also never read this one, but she really likes me and I perform well in her class, so this was probably also a pretty strong letter.

**Interviews**

Harvard: 9/10. This was my first interview since I applied REA, and it went really well. My interviewer was a really interesting guy, and we talked for like an hour and a half about his experiences at Harvard, art, theater, jazz, comedy, and transferring.

MIT: 4/10. My interviewer was pretty old, seemed deeply uninterested in everything I was saying, and this lasted about 20 minutes!

Princeton: 10/10. Me and my interviewer had so much in common. She studied a similar field to me in college, and we talked a lot about activism, study abroad, elitist culture in the Ivy League, and she seemed really interested in my environmental work! I love her

Yale: 6.5/10. This was by no means a bad interview, but it didn't stand out to me as anything special. He seemed impressed by me, but we mostly talked about his experiences at Yale. He kept bringing up talk about jobs and the job market, which I thought was weird, but overall it was fine.

I did not receive an interview for Columbia, and didn't know we had to request one for Northwestern

**Personal Essay**

My personal statement was about activity #1 and how it taught me that building community is the best way to solve both big and small problems. 8/10 :)

**Supplements**

UGA: 6/10. This was a passable short essay, but nothing to write home about

Georgia Tech: 7/10. Same as above

Harvard: 9/10. I put a lot of effort into these and thought they showed my personality pretty well!

Williams: 8/10, recycled this from other supplementals

Northwestern: 8/10, solid, strong supplements

Columbia: 8/10, solid essays

Yale: 9/10. These were probably my strongest essays alongside MIT's, thanks to the admissions podcast

MIT: 10/10. Even though I rushed these the day before the deadline, I felt that I wrote really good essays that showed my personality well

Princeton: 8/10. I hated these after I wrote them, but looking back now, I think they're pretty good (aside from a few cringy lines)

**Additional Information:**

I'm pretty sad that I got rejected basically everywhere, but honestly, it's probably what I deserved. I slacked off a lot in junior year (you could blame it on the divorce) which caused a big dip in the GPA. I didn't study for AP tests or the ACT at all. I took the ACT once and gave up. I'm a lazy bum who lives by the mantra ""get the most out of the least possible effort"".

But I'm still glad I did what I did to get here. All those college courses I took (because I couldn't stand self studying APs, plus they're so expensive) could get me graduating college an year or more earlier. Building games and apps, gardening, robotics, and most other stuff (except for debate lol) I genuinely enjoyed and would definitely have done regardless of college apps.

Right now I'm considering UCSC, SJSU, or community college for transfer. I'll most likely be going to UCSC.

Would be really nice if I got off a waitlist. But if I don't, oh well, it is what it is."

12acjn7,1,2023-04-03,Research or Work this summer?,Soviet_Onion-,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/12acjn7/research_or_work_this_summer/,"Hey guys! I would like your opinion on how I should approach this. I am a rising Senior and currently my aspirations are wanting to go to grad school and pursue a computer science PHD. This summer I am doing a REU research experience. I also want time to study the GRE for grad school. The issue is that I received some offers for SWE internships, but I feel like I don’t have the time commitment to actively be working (as I want to pursue research). However, I do wanna make money for the fall semester.

Should I take the offers and chance it (I feel like I would do a bad job as I am not as focused compared to my research)?

Is there any chill IT positions or even jobs where I can do my work/studying while on the job? 

Are SWE Intern remote work chill? Is there a specific industry that isnt as software intensive but offers SWE intern positions?"
12acl26,0,2023-04-03,"""Entry level"", what does this mean?",Nr1864,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12acl26/entry_level_what_does_this_mean/,"Tldr: Entry level does not mean starter level. Entry level is just the natural progression point where people from a position beneath it can enter or advance into. 


Every job has a career path. In order to advance through this path, you have to climb the corporate ladder. Each stair on the ladder is a position. The natural flow of these positions, for my career path, are:  technician>>>analyst>>>specialist>>>developer>>>administrator>>>manager>>>director. 

When a job is listed as ""entry level"", all it means is that it is the entry point for those that are from a step below to advance into. Hence the name. Even leadership positions start off as entry level jobs. Think of an Engineer 1/2/3/4. Engineer 1 would be the entry level position. 

For an example using my career path, the entry level administrator position would require 10+ years of experience from all the positions beneath it. Of course, these can be substituted with similar held jobs.

Unfortunately, it is notoriously difficult to find a starting position fresh out of college. All grads are applying to those same positions en masse. If you've taken an internship throughout school that is related to an entry level position you are applying for, then you will have a much easier time getting in. My school almost forces everyone to get internships for this very reason. 

As an example, this is why an analyst position can have hundreds of applicants a day. Especially if remote! These are not the bottom step of the ladder, and people with internship experience are the ones who take these up.



So, what can you do to help making finding a job easier? 

1) If you are still in school, get an internship!!! Most universities have it to where you can have an internship that counts for credits towards your major! Mine was 9 credits/hours! These will have the greatest impact on getting a good starter job. 


2) If you didn't have an internship, you will have to start at the bottom of the ladder and work your way up. You'll be paid less off the bat, but you will find a job much faster and your growth will also be quicker.  


3) Be proactive on your applications, especially if you are still in school! There is no such thing as too early. 


4) If applying for an entry level position that is on the 2nd step of the ladder, you will have a much easier time getting it during the middle of the semester! These are the positions that get a flood of applications as soon as the semester ends. 


5) Try to create a portfolio to show examples of what you can do. Class projects are amazing for these. Plus, it looks good on a resume. If you have taken coding classes, make a github to show some examples of your code! 


6) Make sure your resume looks amazing. If you don't have any professional experience, list out your related classes instead! You can quickly, easily, and cheaply have someone create/edit a resume for you. A popular website is Fiverr. 



I know it can be difficult and even hopeless at times trying to find a job. But, keep your chin up and know there are plenty of opportunities out there! Hopefully this will help guide some people."

Basically my client wants a new app from scratch which will automate his whole trading process with the help of expert advisors and MT4. 

How do I tell my manager to assign me with some other project, due to lack of interest in trading I feel demotivated right now.

I'm currently completing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Data Analytics. I'm expecting to graduate next summer, and i would like to move to either the US or Canada to work.

I already have a Bachelor's and Master's in Political Science and have worked in immigration for a year before going back to university. I am also currently completing a Data Analytics internship at an international company, so i will have 1 year of experience in my field when i graduate.

I wonder what pathways are available to me to immigrate from the UK to either the US or Canada. I hear that it is very difficult to get a work based visa unless you have lots of experience and a company sponsors you?

I also have an older sibling who is a US citizen if that helps? It's one of the reasons i would like to cross the pond and live in NA.

I’ve been wondering what my chances are at getting into MS CS programs at top schools like Stanford, Berkeley, CMU, MIT, etc. 

Profile:
- B.S in Mathematics from Arizona State University. Philosophy Minor. Used to be a CS major and took most core CS classes. 
- 3.94 GPA. 
- Interested in: Algorithms, discrete math, graph theory, theoretical CS. 
- I haven’t taken the GRE yet but I feel like I can score 170Q. I scored a perfect 800 on the SAT math sections in high school and have gotten significantly better at math since then. 
- Software Engineering Internships at Meta and Amazon.
- Am currently writing an original book on algorithms and discrete math. Aimed at offering a mathematical approach to solving algorithm problems.
- No research.
- No letters of recommendations.

Additional info:
- Have a youtube channel with 145k subs.
- I do standup comedy.

Could I make for a competitive applicant? I didn’t gear my undergrad to get into grad school, but suddenly have been thinking it could be a good idea. I didn’t really take undergrad seriously because I thought i’d go into industry."

Switching comms career to developer,Upset-Masterpiece195,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/12alfjd/help_switching_comms_career_to_developer/,"For sometime I have been thinking about changing my career from communications/marketing to software developer. I graduated in comms. During my studies I did have an introduction to web developing using html, css and java. Also had to do some UX/UI. I loved this classes so much. However it was during my second year and I was thinking just finish my degree.

It's been 2 years and I have been thinking about switching because I actually despise working in the comms. So I would like to switch to careers but.... I have couple questions.

I currently have two paths 1. Go do some bootcamp/self study > internship > work for a company to gain experience > move to / remote work in switzerland

Get a Cs degree > move to / remote work in switzerland


With option 1. I'm not so sure if I would land a job in switzerland because no degree of Cs. Option 2. Not so sure if going full time would be great since I have to take care of myself + if I do part time studying it will take more than 3 years....and I wouldn't want that + I would have no experience at all.

Would option 1 work?

**Letters of Recommendation**

Business Management Teacher 1 (9/10). Very close to this teacher but this letter was kind of rushed since she decided to change schools last minute. She was familiar with my public speaking skills.

Business Management Teacher 2 (10/10). She said that she used superlatives in her rec letter eg, she claims that she said that she wrote that I was the best student she had taught in her 15 year career. I am very close to her and I talk about my environmental work with her alot. She also said that this was the best rec letter she has ever written

Physics Teacher: (9/10). I am very close with him as I help him with lesson plans and we also share an interest for the environment. We often bond over how we both think there is a lack of urgency in the corporate world. He claimed that he spent hours on my letter and that he said that he wrote that I was the best student in his class (but not best in his career so that's why it's a 9/10).

Design & Technology teacher: (10/10). He said that he 'burned some midnight oil' trying to perfect the letter of recommendation. Also, he claims that it was the best letter he has written. Over the course of my education, I have become very close with him and have written a research paper under his guidance, which he has mentioned in his recommendation letter. He also claims that I was the one of the best students he has taught in his entire career of 30+ years.

Counsellor: (8/10). I am very very close to my counsellor, but as my school has a 30ish:1 student to counsellor ratio (my initial counsellor changed school), I feel that it would be very difficult for my counsellor to write a superb letter. One thing my counsellor and I share is that we both do LGBTQ+ advocacy, and we bounce ideas off each other outside of normal student-counsellor meetings. He did say that he did spend a long time on my letter.

**Interviews**

Georgetown: Interviewer was very nice (studied undergrad at Georgetown and is a current Masters Student) we bonded very well and we were able to get into a pretty nice discussion on sustainability. I got to ask some pretty decent questions, and he said that the questions I asked were really great as well. We ended with more discussion on the environment, but it was cut short as he urgently had to attend a meeting. He ended the meeting saying that if I go to Georgetown, we should continue the discussion and that one of his current professors would like me.

**Essays**

CommonApp: Very proud of it, worked on it for a VERY long time. Counsellor claimed that it was percisely what he was looking for. 10/10

Supplementals: Proud of all, counsellor said they were all very strong, but I knew that some could have been better (especially my UC ones). 8/10 for most, 6/10 for UCs and Carnegie Mellon, 10/10 for Wake Forest and Emory. (My counsellor said my Emory 'song made for you' essay was fantastic and one of the best he has seen.

And, as the tech team is small no DevOps guy is there. My manager wants me to handle the DevOps part, I recently developed an internal tool using .net for executing database changes in different shards, creating the new db files on the server and then finally commiting the changes to the bitbucket repo.


Now he wants a ci/cd system so that everytime new commit is pushed to the repo, a slack message (if build successful or failed after new commit) is sent to the slack channel.


He told me to study Jenkins for this and said if you want you can build it on your own from scratch for the ci/cd thing. 

I'm confused how should I proceed? Use Jenkins or build my own tool.

Any advice is appreciated because I have no idea about DevOps."

I'm currently in school and will be graduating in the fall with bachelors degree. I'm looking to get a job in the field so I can at least have some experience when I graduate. I have two options right now and I'm torn about which path might be better

**Option 1**

This is an IT internship that leans towards help desk preparation. It is a part time role and I would basically be doing basic help desk tasks. It's a new company and their IT department is fairly new so I'm thinking there could potentially be more opportunities. 

**Option 2**

This would be a traditional full time help desk role. 40 hours a week - one week remote, one week in the office. It's for a larger company so it has full benefits.

Any advice or input would be appreciated!"

I am currently an undergraduate at WGU studying cloud computing, hoping to graduate by Spring 2024. My main goal is to end up in some type of cloud position such as cloud engineering or cloud support. I was hoping for your guys' insight and criticism to my current plan.

I currently hold an A+ and I've read that building a strong foundation in networking/sys admin type of roles is essential to getting your foot in the door for a cloud role in the future. Also, since I recently quit my job, I've been getting extremely aggressive in my job search for a help desk position to expose myself to all things networking and sys admin.

The job search is a pretty rough right now and frankly, I would like to improve my candidacy by any means necessary. I am currently studying for a CCNA to really beef up my resume/CV (it's overkill I know). However, I know that I would like to transition into some type of network admin type of role soon after help desk so I can build that networking foundation. 

I would like your guys' opinions on if that's a pretty thorough plan or not, and any next steps from there. Others have recommended that I check out this: [https://www.madebygps.com/cloudcamp/](https://www.madebygps.com/cloudcamp/) Would that 6 month study plan be sufficient in gaining a knowledge base for a cloud role? I know I'll have to work my way up through help desk and the works but I would like to study up in any way possible. I will also be looking and applying to any cloud internships in the future.

**Additional Information:** Wow, I am shocked! Everyone told me that I had no chance in college applications. My parents seriously thought I would end up at UC Riverside because of how their Indian friends told them about how their kids did. Indian communities are notorious for fearmongering and overexaggerating their student's accomplishments relative to their results. I am absolutely amazed at how well this turned out, and I am so excited to attend UC Berkeley for EECS (despite not getting into the MET program). I am also excited to see how the Harvard Waitlist turns out."

**Standardized Testing**

Didn't submit because the school in question doesn't accept them!

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. (2 years) Independent study & reading: Designed a study curriculum for junior and senior year because my school’s curriculum was really old and not cool. (Attached it as supplementary material.) Critically analyzed 150+ books and research papers targeted at exploring the liminal space in post-colonial literature, architecture and art. Wrote a research paper on my favorite music band, liminal space, and post-colonialism. (Yet to send it out for publication!) Huge time commitment. Loved every bit of it ong.
2. (10 years) Creative Writing: Self-published my first book when I was 13. 3 books are out so far—2 poetry collections and 1 novella. 450(?) copies sold in total internationally. Got a few small awards too (my writing style is so much different now.) Published work in 30+ very selective international magazines/journals (\~5% acceptance rate for a few.) I write math poetry, experimental and hybrid fiction that usually encompasses a 'liminal space' -- I’m very much into the whole idea of it, as you can tell by now... lol.
3. (2.5 years) Founding editor in chief of an international experimental literary mag. Received about 1,000(?) submissions from 31 US states and 23 countries.
4. (4 years) Creative writing mentor to a group of middle schoolers. Had a blast teaching them!
5. (4 years) Student government stuff at school—president of student council, increased student participation in literary activities by a decent amount, founder of the first ever literary magazine and creative writing, peer tutoring, and reading clubs. My high school was new and underfunded which certainly inspired me to get involved with the community much more enthusiastically. I'm so glad I was able to make this kind of impact along with my peers!
6. (gap year) Attended around 4 prestigious creative writing workshops on a full scholarship. (Adroit, Kenyon, etc)
7. (gap year) District-wide legislative advocacy stuff related to book bans and higher-ed.
8. (gap year) Internships at 2 literary mags
9. Miscellaneous hobby I would get clowned for
10. I wrote about playing mad libs as an experimental fiction writer and how it helps me to deconstruct language—my research interests include deconstruction so maybe this made sense? (Though, it doesn't have to make sense, really.)

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. Foyle Young Poet Award
2. Pushcart Prize nomination; Best Microfiction nomination
3. New York Times contest runner-up
4. Winner - a few international writing contests (large-scale)
5. Winner and honorable mention - a few international writing contests (small-scale)
6. School academic awards (smushed them all together!)
7. 100 under 30 in a global list (don’t know who nominated me. Got to know about this in 11th grade. I did NOT put this anywhere in my application... thought that it would make me look weird and manufactured lol. It was not Forbes so it was not like admissions were going to care anyway. Sigh.)
8. \+ few other writing awards that I didn't put... oops!

**Letters of Recommendation**

I didn't get to read my letters as I had already waived my FERPA! In total, 4 letters were sent:

\- Academic Coordinator

\- English teacher

\- History teacher

\- Harvard alum who is also a pretty cool and noted writer! I worked with them over summer on something. They told me they love what I write.

**Interviews**

None!

**Essays**

Ahhh one part of the college app process that I actually looked forward to!!!! Writing my essays gave me SO MUCH ADRENALINE and I loved loved loved writing them. I'd say that my essays represented my original voice. My common app essay was about why I write and why I published my first book at the *very mature and wise* *age of 13.* It's called ""On Being an Unexpected Reader."" (Wrote first draft, sent first draft. I might even end up publishing this somewhere I guess.) Supplemental essays were about all kinds of things! The favorite essay that I'd written was about capitalism, TikTok and the tropification of novels.

I also sent Bennington an essay about how I wrote math poetry out of the problems I missed in my math exam in soph year. My AO specifically commented on how much she liked it in an email she sent to me!

**Gap Year Info:** I also took a gap year (I'm HS class of 2022) to focus on my reading + writing. I'd say it has been a pretty formative year. I'll also be attending a gap year art history program in London this summer. Yayy!!!

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* **RD Bennington College w/ John Dewey Scholarship (335k - full ride!!!!) - COMMITTED**
* RD University of Cincinnati w/ honors college + 90% scholarship

*Rejections:*

I applied to a couple of Ivies and other top schools but things didn't work out. :(

**Additional Information:**

When it came to applying to college, I researched a lot about Bennington from its unique field work term to colonial housing and I found out that Bennington is the PERFECT school for a certain kind of student—someone like me—who have always found normal school structures to be oppressive. You know, ""memorize these things and regurgitate them and take an exam then forget about it afterwards."" It's for people who want to *learn*, and then implement what they've learned in some fashion, to *live* what they're learning which coincides with my personal values so I found the school to be a perfect fit for me. Also, interacting with some of the admitted and enrolled students has assured me that Bennington has one of the coolest people ever who are doing all sorts of amazing things!

I ended up applying as a literature and art history major, primarily because I wanted to consolidate what I’ve been looking for in my college experience—which I was also able to incorporate in my application thoroughly! (Also, the Bennington supplemental essays allowed me to express myself much more originally, freely, and creatively which I valued a lot.) Needless to say, I'm stoked that I got accepted. My post-college plans include grad school (probably law or academia) and I think I would be able to study what I love at Bennington.

Please feel free to ask me any questions! I hope you have a nice day and congrats on your decisions—I'm so inspired by everyone on this subreddit!!!! :)))"

I also have a full ride to SDSU for cs, so transferring to UCSD for math+cs(70% acceptance rate) also an option.

Which would you recommend? I think it is also worth mentioning I have pretty strong coding skills and a project that will be used by my City to upgrade a paper based system, which could also help get internships."

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

Chem teacher: Had him for 2 years, participate often in class, he nominated me for the student of the quarter award

Physics teacher: Also scioly advisor, known him for past four years...I literally don't know lol this section is ridiculous I'm not rating my relationships with people

English teacher: Uhh not sure I think he liked (?) me and I did well in the class but not fantastic since there was a lot of talking required and I don't like talking

Research Mentor/Advisor: From EC#7...Hopefully it was good...he kept on telling me I could get into any school I wanted to but also I didn't send his rec to the HYPSM schools I got into lmao and the ones I did send his rec to I got rejected from

Research Mentor/Advisor #2:  From EC#2...so I didn't think his would be that good since I only knew him for a summer but I got into 2 of the 3 HYPSM schools I got into with his rec

Person who helped with a lot of my science enrichment programs:  I think they simultaneously saw me as an incredibly motivated and dedicated young person and somebody with a lot of faults (have been reprimanded multiple times for being ""too quiet"")...but their rec also got me into 2/3 of the HYPSM schools (this acronym is so obnoxious but I had to use it for the click bait)

**Interviews**

So-so.  I'm kinda introverted and sometimes I say weird things in a panic!  I really clicked with my Yale interviewer though (except for the part where I told him I wanted to go to Berkeley lol but he was a really cool dude) and I was strangely similar to my MIT interviewer (we went to the same school, both wanted to get away from home, did research in HS at the same uni, and her kid was in one of the science enrichment programs I run).  Did not click with my Harvard and Princeton interviewers...it was giving ""I'm better than everybody else since I was selected to attend this prestigious institution"" vibes (no shade tho!  I'm sure they're incredible people in their daily lives).  No interview at Stanford.

**Essays**

5/10 -- average, definitely not ""OMG SO MEMORABLE""...I read them and I sounded like the most average A2Cer you've ever met in most of them lol

EC essays: talked about science enrichment programs I've started + how it helped me grow as a person/leader

""Intellectual"" Supplementals: Love for history + interest in preserving stories, connected to my more humanities based ECs

Other supps:  I like writing.  Very quirky roommate essay.  #womaninstem.  I like puns (still cringing from reading these).  I am nerd.  Are you?

CA: journey w/ science, from immediate family being diagnosed w/ life-threatening illness to working in lab --> how it made me want to become a physician-scientist (I got the lowest grade I've ever gotten on an English essay for this essay when we had to turn it in in my English class and my former English teacher said it was trash so I tried to reform it but it did not work and it was close to the early deadline/I had procrastinated on the RD deadline so uh yeah)

Harvard: >!Rejected (mild oof but true Harvard Legacy L, living up to this post's name...there's so much irony in this since all the other schools are what Harvard is compared to but oh well...life works in mysterious ways)!<

Duke:  >!Waitlisted!<

Stanford: >!Accepted? (WHAT? PINCH ME??)!<

Yes, I applied to almost 30 schools.  After getting deferred from Harvard I got super panicked I wasn't qualified for anywhere since I overestimated the legacy boost and I didn't want to feel like I could've gone somewhere if I had just applied.  I guess it's advice time! 

(DISCLAIMER:  I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL BY ANY MEANS AND THESE ARE ENTIRELY ALL MY OWN OPINIONS)

1. **START EARLY** (like, June) -- essays genuinely matter.  Yes, everybody says this, but also, EVERYBODY SAYS THIS SO MAYBE IT MEANS SOMETHING.
2. **Controversial, but don't apply to your dream school(s) early.**  You get a lot better with writing as you continue to go through the process, and I'm convinced my Harvard essays are what got me flat out rejected...they likely would've been a lot better if I had applied RD
3. **Apply to schools with early scholarship deadlines** \-- I applied to USC, Vandy, and Emory early for their scholarship deadlines and I got some big money at 2/3 of them.  It also significantly lightened my RD stress because I knew I had already applied to 12 schools early (including UCs and Harvard), so all the other applications I was doing were just icing on the cake.
4. **Lower your expectations and have multiple dream schools.**  As a middle schooler I had HYPSM dreams and what not, but by high school I realized it wasn't a good mindset to have a T5 as a dream school, so I instead had several relatively achievable schools as ""dream"" schools -- Rice, Northwestern, Penn, Berkeley, UCLA.  Obviously they're still incredibly hard to get into (got waitlisted by half of them lmao), but it was still an incredible feeling to get into Berkeley and UCLA after watching tons of vlogs and knowing friends/family who went to the schools and made me excited about them.
5. **Also controversial, but shotgun if you have the resources/fee waivers**.  After 10 or so schools, a lot of the essays are the same and reusable.  The admissions process is so random (how did I get waitlisted by Emory and not get into any other T10s except T5s?) that applying to just a few schools isn't going to cut it unless you're a cracked applicant or just very lucky. 
6. **Don't be afraid to be yourself** \-- I wrote about dancing in my room and writing bad songs in my Stanford supplement and I told USC I would like to have lofi girl as a roommate and I'm a ""Cali girl"" at heart.  It's kinda cheesy but I think the cringe makes you stand out!!
7. **""Spikes"" are overrated:  be well rounded!**  I guess I kinda have a science spike, but it wasn't just a science spike -- I did community service, some writing, some advocacy.  I was interested in a lot of stuff throughout high school and dipped my toes in a bunch of places.  It's a lot more fun to do a variety of things too, and you get to interact with a lot of different but interesting people.  I also think it shows you're more human?  Like you're not just some robot who studies and does research and enters olympiads all the time (for STEM kids -- if you're a humanities kid you're prob fine just writing/doing history research/doing cool advocacy stuff).
8. **Learn how to say no.**  Being well-rounded works up to a point.  If you're too spread out, you can't really develop strengths anywhere and you'll end up being a member (or worse, a leader who doesn't do anything...) in all of the organizations/initiatives you're a part of.  Choose maybe 2-3 areas you really want to focus on and figure out how you can excel there, then stop accepting positions/opportunities outside of those areas.
9. **If you end up with leadership, actually do something.**  There are tons of kids at my school who are president of a club but don't actually do anything with the club.  That works to an extent...but they forget that you actually have a description and essays you need to write for college apps.  Saying you led meetings and created presentations on xxxx topic is fine, but AOs can see you didn't really do anything except make a Google slides presentation during third period to present during lunch.  Look for competitions to study for, volunteer programs to join or create, and issues in your community that you want to address.                                                     
10. **In a similar vein, think of ways you can expand your prestige, social, and monetary footprint with your activities.**  Prestige = competitons/recognition/awards.  Social = people impacted/involved in initiatives.  Monetary = funds raised/managed.  I hate to say this, but that's what the AOs are looking for in your activities descriptions.
11. **You don't need to be voted in to be a leader -- start your own thing.**  I am by no means a popular kid, and I lost most of the elections I ran for.  When you start something on your own, you have a lot more freedom with what exactly it does, how it operates, and the influence/power of the initiative.
12. **For summer programs/activities:  things you start (passion project™️) > paid > free > you have to pay.**  RSI/SSP/Ross/SUMAC/Olympiad Camps/governor schools are exceptions (lol that's actually a lot).
13. **Participate in class.**  Go to office hours.  Ask questions.  If you're worried about LORs, you can fake it until you make it.
14. **Always be on the lookout for opportunities/awards.**  There's a lot of low-hanging fruit, you just need to find it.  Ask your teachers, ask your counselor, look on online databases, look through Instagram hashtags, look at the tagged posts of \~accomplished\~ people, go down the ""free summer programs for high schoolers"" or ""awards for high school publications"" or ""writing contests for high school students"" or ""grants for youth community service projects"" rabbit hole on Google. 
15. **Don't underestimate yourself!**  There were multiple points in my high school journey where I felt like I wasn't good enough (ie getting rejected from tons of summer programs, not getting scholarships, people not joining clubs/initiatives I started) or I was trying hard for no reason, but I genuinely think anybody can get into a good college if they have the will and initiative.  If you apply to enough things, you'll eventually get something decently selective/prestigious, and then you can milk the life out of it everytime you apply for anything else.  Also, even if you don't get into a ""good"" college, you really do learn a lot along the way.  I grew my self confidence, my leadership, my friendships, and my time management skills throughout high school by doing what I did, and those are skills/people that I will cherish for the rest of my life.
16. **Be nice to people.**  If you take anything away from this, please let it be this point.  I met some pretty...unsavory people (really just one person, but if one person exists I am sure there are multiple others in other schools) in high school who were obsessed with winning competitions and gaining leadership positions.  I'd get threatening texts and conversations (like this person literally pulled me out of a class just to tell me I was a terrible leader just because she didn't get her way??) and I had to go to multiple counselors just to deal with the person being so power hungry, and that was not fun.  So be nice.  College admissions may seem like the world to you right now, but it's really not that big of a deal, and I think how you treat others says a lot more about you than what colleges you get into.

Anyways, currently trying to decide between Yale and Stanford for pre-med!  If anybody has advice, please let me know..."

Despite several interviews, I have yet to receive an offer, which is causing me a lot of stress and anxiety. I was hopeful that my MBA program would provide me with ample opportunities, but it's been challenging.

Adding to the recruiting strain, my dad passed away 2 weeks before the start of the program. In addition to the enormous psychological hit, it also put a lot of strain on my finances. I had to decline a much-needed government loan (3% APR) because it required my dad to act as a guarantor.

As a result, I am pessimistic about taking out a private loan right now, with interest rates being so high, to pay for my second year. I even wonder if it is possible to ask for financial aid from the school, but I believe it would be a very long shot.

I know that the job market is tough right now, and many people are struggling to find work. Still, it's hard not to feel discouraged when I see my peers securing internships left and right. I am trying to stay positive and keep networking, but it's not easy.

I would appreciate any advice or words of wisdom from fellow MBA students or alumni who may have gone through a similar experience.  I would love to hear your thoughts and insights.

Hey everyone,

I will be graduating from a state university in December with a Bachelors in CIS. I found out I was very passionate about programming my junior year, but can’t switch to a CS major due to financials at this time. I will mostly likely not graduate with an internship under my belt due to having a dog, so my choices are severely limited.

A local technical community college offers an associates degree in programming with decently high regards. However, I’ve heard that boot camps will teach more in depth depending on the field of software development you want to go into. I know the associates degree teaches data structures and algorithms, but I’m not too sure if most programming boot camps do.

One key factor is that the associates degree would be significantly cheaper than a programming bootcamp.

I already have multiple projects. My main need is learning the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms and CS related mathematics.

I’m also wondering how a CIS degree + an associates would compare to a CIS degree + a bootcamp in the eyes of an employer.

If anyone has advice it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you."

I hope you are all doing good.

I am an **iranian** woman living in **Italy**. I graduated from university of Bologna in tourism economics and management. However, 2 years ago I found out that I m more passionate about IT sector so I decided to switch to developing websites (front-end).

I followed a 2-month course of Java and I autonomously learned React. Moreover, I worked 2 months as a junior full-stack developer in a consulting firm.

I am currently looking for a job as a junior front-end in Italy or **remote-working** in Europe (mainly netherlands , germany , belgium, Luxembourg or other countries in european union). However, all the job offers that I encountered needed experience (as least one year experience).

I will be very thankful if anyone of you provides me with some suggestions to the the following questions :

* How can I find a job in Italy or **remote-working** in Europe (mainly netherlands , germany , belgium, Luxembourg or other countries in european union) ?
* Are there any websites where I can apply ?
* How easy/difficult will it be to find a job in these countries for a permanent resident in Italy.

PS : I recall that I don't have experience so I am open to all junior and internship positions.

Thank you all in advance."

I'd like some advice in how to improve our Data Architeture in at our client. Currently I'm a intern at a a consulting firm in Brazil and we are exploring some options on how to improve our clients Architeture.  


Ir goes as follow:  


1. We have a virtual machina which extracts data from SAP and store it at our Data Warehouse (SQL Server) in excract tables.  

2. We consume this data at our ETL pipelines via Azure Data Factory, currently using Data Flow to perform transformations to  such as Joins, Filters... as much as the client requires.  

3. The data is then stored at a temporary table in which we perform some validation and then stored again at our DW  with a view for that specific client/business process which is then made avalaible from the client to consult of feed into his/hers BI tool.  


We are trying to move away from Data Flow (2) into Databricks but are still figuring out the detalis of such a move and if it is a viable option at all. I've done some data transformation with databricks instead of Data Flow but mostly used Pandas instead of PySpark and as far as I've heard, the later is much more efficient at dealing with larger datasets.   


Tables extracted from SAP can have from 10k to 10kk rows, so I pretty sure any given process may need some exemptions according to data size.  


  
Any tips are appreciated!!"

I am currently a Junior studying finance in a small commuter school. I have applied to over 150+ internships and I have gotten only 4 places to get zoom interviews with. 2 of which ended up being mlms (Primerica and NWM) and the other interviews were over zoom and I botched both of them. One of them was a actural postion and I choked up when they asked about a software I had no idea about. The second was a small wealth management firm and I folded when they only asked me basic questions and expected me to ask most of the questions when I only came mainly to answer questions about myself. Luckily after those two I'm now more prepared for future interviews but I haven't had any companies reach out to me about internships since. I've spent plently of time cold messaging Linkedin recruiters only for them to ghost me after sending my reusme or tell me that they didn't have any entry level postions. When I was able to get a call with anyone on Linkedin they would usually just give me some basic advice all of which I put into practice as much as I could. Not even nepotism is on my side. I reached out to 2 people working in Finance that my mother knows, One works as her Financial advisor for Merrill Lynch, the other is her friends husband working in Asset Managment at BOA.  When I get out of college I either want to work in The public sector of Finance or Become a Financial Advisor but I've applied to anything Finance Related since I can't afford to be picky. I have an in person coming up interview to be a part time bank teller at a local bank. It looked like the perfect entry level postion for the summer. The issue came when they said I had to commit staying after the summer while working 5-6 days a week while only working 3-4 hour shifts during the day time. Since the bank 30 min away even at the $20/hr pay not only would a large part of my would pay go towards gas alone, but my schools finance program is so small that by senior year theres usually only one time slot for each class and if the class is during the day I'm screwed. I'm just looking for advice from anyone who was in a similar situation. As well as any way I could change my resume to better fit what I am looking for without straight up lying(unless thats my only option)."

I am a chemical engineering student trying to find an internship for this summer, but unfortunately I have had little to no luck finding an internship for this summer after applying to over 100 on LinkedIn, so I think I will end up going back to the internship where I worked last summer as a lab technician at an analytical laboratory testing soils and environmental samples. I don’t mind going back because I enjoyed the job and made lots of money because we were allowed to work overtime, but I read on past Reddit posts that for engineering that the analytical lab intern position is as good or not good at all for experience as an engineering internship.

My question is is working at an analytical lab as a lab technician really that useless or not good for an engineering student? Should I continue pushing hard to find a better internship for engineering students, or am I fine going back to the lab? A lot of the other internship positions I applied for are also positions in labs. I am entering my junior year of college now because I am a year behind and am majoring in chemical engineering.

Thank you for the help!"

I know it's an odd season with it getting closer and closer to the summer so I know im not the only one but people actually reaching out to me has slowed down. Throughout this process, I've taken the time to clean up my LinkedIn. By that, I mean provided updated more appealing descriptions for past jobs, updated the about me bio, and if anything the only im lacking is a solid professional headshot. I've grown my LinkedIn connections by over 80 people within these past 3 months. I don't mean to just talk about everything I've done thus far, but I'm just trying to avoid getting discouraged. 

The platforms I use to look for positions is LinkedIn, WayUp, and InternXL. If you have any familiarity when it comes to looking for internships on these sites; I'd really appreciate it. 

If anything my furthest lead thus far was almost securing a software engineer position with a company out of utah. Made it through all the interviews, but was informed that I didn't receive it."

The MEng ECE looks the best in terms of the university prestige, but it is a continuous program with no breaks in between for a summer internship.

Would you guys say both schools offer the same/similar opportunities for big tech (I know UIUC takes the lead for fintech but I do not see myself wanting to go into fintech)? Are internships more accessible as a UIUC CS student as opposed to being a CS student from UMich?

I also have questions about UIUC itself: How is the course availability at UIUC (especially for popular upper-level courses such as Operating Systems)? Does the Math portion of the degree take a lot of time (I heard w Math it is harder to take all the CS courses I want to take)?

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated; this decision is nerve-wracking as both are great options."

I'm finishing my third year of a CS degree, and I'm a top student etc. but I couldn't even get into an internship (I think mostly because my ADHD ""helps"" me flunk technical interviews) - and the way the market is and where I live, job openings that might consider an inexperienced fresh-out-of-college graduate are basically nonexistent. This kinda sucks, because there's really no way to gain experience like this. The only real way to gain experience in my situation is a student job/internship - which is in my case a non-option, since I'm in third year etc. (have less than a year of studies left, not enough time for an employer to make good use of).... I sent out dozens of resumes, had people look them over, but no responses at all from employers - Seems like it really is the case that no employer would consider me for any position, at this point in time.

So a while back I thought of an idea, which on the face of it sounds silly - ask (as in pay) someone who is actually employed as a software engineer/intern (preferably someone who works remotely or in open source) to ""teach me the ropes"", and eventually let me ghostwrite code for them - I would gain experience and knowledge, although nothing to put on my resume. I know this sounds silly because, well, why would anyone agree to this kind of arrangement? Aren't software engineers busy enough? But I'm afraid I'm in a position where this sort of thing is looking more and more like something that is actually worth considering.

What do you think? Do you know of anyone ever doing this? Is this even feasible? Would I sound like a desperate whackjob if I ask one of my employed friends to do this for me?

I just feel so left out, because even after 3 years of college, I have close to no idea what a software developer actually does - I've been left out in this cold to ""pull myself up by my bootstraps"", and I'm really scared of finishing my studies and having a snowball's chance in hell of getting hired - because I lack experience I have no way to gain other than working somewhere :("

&#x200B;

\----

As I reflect on this time period, I become more and more thankful that it is over. If I could go back and change the way I had done things, I would have chosen not to apply to the UCs in the US. Why? I am an aid seeking student and the UCs offer none :( Moreover, I may have not applied to the US at all. Although my grades are excellent, my extracurriculars were average I would say. I had only a couple leadership roles and US unis (esp competitive ones) loooove leadership. Coupled with the lack of leadership roles, I had requested for financial aid while being a middle income international student. I feel like that made my chances fall even more.

As for the UK, my rejection from LSE was somewhat expected. I applied for Econ +management in all my UK unis except for LSE, where I applied for just Econ, and my personal statement was 60% Econ and 40% management related. This may have affected my chances but I am certain that the major determinant was the fact that I did not take further mathematics in A levels.

&#x200B;

To conclude, the college application and decision process was very very rough this year. Acceptance rates plummeted - look at NYU's this year for example. It is okay if you were not accepted to your dream university, an IVY, Oxford, Cambridge etc etc. What matters is that you make the most of what the university u do end up at has to offer. Exploit ALL the opportunities you get at your future places of study. I wish you ALL the best of luck on your academic journeys.

&#x200B;

And if you will be applying soon, please do not procrastinate - speaking from experience.

What should I do?",GrandpaDouble-O-7,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/12bc7h2/graduating_next_year_with_low_gpa_and_my/,"Long story short, I have a 2.91 GPA right now, but I've had a 3.9 average GPA for the last 2 years (long story....).   


I've been wanting to get an internship at KPMG, and I've been in talks with a recruiter for a year now, but a year ago, their minimum requirement, at least at the office I was applying for, was a 3.0. they have dropped it to a 2.8 this year for audit/tax, but I already got another internship for this summer since I wasn't eligible last year when I was recruiting, and I'm graduating next year in june. I still tried to get a winter internship for next year, but my recruiter said since I have another internship this summer, it's not possible because they would be afraid I will accept a full-time return offer from this year's internship (its none big 4) and won't accept KPMG's return offer when the time comes.  


He suggested I can apply for full-time positions fpr after I graduate but he said those positions will be posted around September. The last time I talked to him was at the beginning of this year. Now he is switching jobs (idk where yet), so he won't be at KPMG come September, so I will have no contact with a recruiter there. I know a couple of associates from attending networking and recruiting events but haven't been as much in contact with them.  


Also, I'm more interested in applying for their advisory roles, and advisory requires a 3.0 minimum which I won't have until I graduate so I still won't be eligible for advisory roles when positions get posted in September. 

I'm open to the other big 4s as well but Deloitte has a ""preferred"" GPA of 3.2 but idk if they have a minimum or not on the backend. Lets say a 3.0 or something. Because technically audit/tax at KPMG also says 3.0 preferred but my recruiter said they have a minimum 2.8 requirement that's not listed on the job postings. PWC seems like it has a 3.3 preferred so idk... it seems like the rest of the big4 are even harder to get passed the minimum GPA requirement.

I would appreciate any advice on what I can/should do!"

First off, I am not in the US or UK, so sending resources from there will unfortunately not help. 

My father and his wife have been struggling financially ever since they got together, and they have my 5yo little brother together. 

They both have mental health issues, there has been violence towards the wife in the past, he has a short fuse after ignoring everything that goes on around him for ages. The police was there after we spoke with one of the wife's adult daughters, but did nothing. 

I tried to get him psychiatric help for what I think is ADHD, but he got put on relaxants/antianxiety medication instead and now he sleeps a lot -> doesn't take meds because he still has to work (wfh/unstable income as a contractor) -> has a short fuse (although no violence for the past 7 months as far as I know) and is irritated -> realizes he has to take meds again -> sleeps a lot. 

When he sleeps a lot, the wife is alone with my brother who so far shows no sign of wanting to 💩 anywhere but the floor. He speaks, but only of his own incoherent thoughts/games in his head, never when he has needs. He still can't communicate properly and shows signs of being left behind peers of the same age to an alarming degree. 

She is mentally unstable to begin with - I can hear on the phone that she can just go on and on about something like dad's tone of voice, interrupting with sporadic noises. When mentally unstable, she often turns to alcohol, always has. She is not taking her own medications. 

I know a lot of it is down to financial stuff, but I don't know what to do. The police did nothing, much less so when there is no overt physical violence,  and social services might well deal with my brother's conditions even worse in our country. 

I am 25, live in a rental with my girlfriend who is not a local (getting residency as an EU citizen), we are not married because we are both trans (I am FtM myself). I have a disability of ADHD and asthma myself, as well as being LGBT, and thetefore would never be even considered as an official carer for him, were the services to get involved. 

He would probably end up further stunted, with no chance at normal education nor specialized attention, in an institution, and grow to hate us as much as the next local. Right now, for all his poops, he is still a kind, open-minded and exploring child and the worse he gets traumatized from any and all sides, the more I fear that disappears. 

However, even if his parents agreed to let us care for him informally, we would not be able to access any state support, not be able to put him in school or kindergarten, I can't get time off work to deal with him because no official guardianship, and this is not financially feasible. 

His adult sisters are both even worse disabled than me (autism to a worse degree than any of my disabilities), which probably runs in the family. They can't even babysit their mum to make sure she doesn't drink herself to oblivion even if we DID get my dad away from her and took my brother in, because they both have to make a minimum wage living and they rent a room in a flat, which means neither can help. 

Dad also has me in a chokehold with property, which he holds over my head as both a carrot and a stick - if I report him anywhere, he will not let me have any of it, especially the summerplace I grew up in, and I'll find myself on the street and in financial ruin. Which means that if I report anything, I won't have the chance to care for my brother anyway, because they have every excuse not to - us being queer, me having no property of my own,  no finances to care for a kid or to pay off the people in charge of who he goes to to be raised by, no money for special education for him.  

Dad has three properties, one that is essentially a moldy asbesty biohazard from the 80s in a really bad neighborhood (but has insulation and internet), a very remote cottage without electricity, insulation and running water, which they live in full time, and a summerplace on the coast with shitty internet, no insulation, but with running water and electricity. He refuses to sell any of it, despite neither having a stable job (wife unable to work, too unstable and never held a job for more than a week). 

The situation at home is out of control and I can't watch him grow up like that, with no chance to recover from everything he has been through. I need any advice I can get.

* edit: Forgot to say I live 2.5h away in a different city, am still in school part time and work full time, and our rental is a studio with a convertible couch as a bed. 

Gf has to return to home country for internship for 2 years, some of which I hope we can alternate with me staying there with remote work 3months at a time, then her, then vacations, and so on. 

But it's not feasible to take a child with us as not-legal-guardians. We are the only somewhat sane refuge he has, but it's been made pretty impossible for us."

I am a physics undergrad finishing my senior year and I have been trying to switch careers to data science and AI. 

To make it clear, I'll just put my current skills and experience. 

- Been programming in python for the last 4 years. Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, Pandas, Scikit-learn. And of course, standard libraries such as os, sys, subprocess, multiprocessing, requests, BeautifulSoup, re, etc. 

- Good basis on OPP and functional programming.

- VERY general knowledge on HTTP protocols, API calls, ORMS, Multithreading. 

- Good basis on SQL, plus relatively experienced in using PostgreSQL on python beside MySQL. Obviously I can manage JSON, CSV and any data type format. 

- standard knowledge on git. Init, Branching, Merging, Checkout, add, commit, ignore. 

- Solid knowledge on bash/shell scripting. 

- 4 months of experience as an intern doing mostly the above, plus whatever they would give me. A little bit of TensorFlow and keras. The craziest thing was translating their web app in Angular using TS dependencies through pipes into HTML code

I know this is pretty much an opened question and I assume it is a bit outside of the scope of this subrredit. This is the only question like this I'll ever post.
If you have any advices or requests, I accept them all and I'll appreciate every bit of advice. Thanks to all of you in advance."

**Letters of Recommendation**

1. **Bio Teacher (9/10)** Said I'm one of his best students of all time, top of his class, and I have a close relationship with him
2. **Econ Teacher (5.5/10)** Very average relationship but seems to like me and we have many things in common and was excited to write a LOR for me
3. **University professor (7/10)** Had a very close relationship with him and still work with him to this day, but I definitely was not his best student and I understand it.
4. **Local university debate society leader (10/10)** Allowed me to write the recommendation and worked closely with me to write and edit it as much as possible. Have a close interpersonal relationship.
5. **Counsellor (6.5/10)** Was very excited to write a LOR for me but barely ever interacted with her.

**Interviews**

Only interviewed for MIT, Stanford, and Tufts. MIT interviewer was super nice but the interview wasn't very special and it was mostly me talking. Stanford interview was an extremely pleasant interview and turned into a very interesting and in-depth discussion on various aspects of the research fields I want to go into, and life at Stanford. Tufts interview was the best interview and the interviewer seemed to really like me and said that I'm the perfect fit.

**Essays**

Tried to be special with a very personal and probably pretty niche scientific goal of mine while tying into other parts of my personality and life. However, it turned out to be quite scatterbrain and it was mid at best. All supplements, including UC essays, were written last minute, and weren't really that special, except one of my UC essays about debating which I wrote a few days prior and I really liked.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

Applied everywhere as computational biology major if available, otherwise CS.

*Acceptances:*

* UC Berkeley CS (Committed!)

**Additional Information:**

*Before my Junior year I just messed around and thought that I just needed to get a good grade to easily get into Harvard, and knew almost nothing about US universities except the most prestigious ones. Luckily I stumbled upon A2C in junior year and realized the caliber of other students to match up to. I started trying like crazy after 11th grade and unfortunately, most of my best awards were received after the application period. I think I really lucked out with UC Berkeley.*"

I was promoted to a new position 2 years later with still bad pay at 19.50hr, commute, same thing same co with same rules. 

I’m miserable in my new position. My boss does not support me, it’s not my old life pre-COVID. I’ve been applying like a maniac and feeling hopeless. On top of this, my company has started to make lay offs. Thankfully, I was not one of those individuals. My husband and I are thinking of going back to school and home with a paid internship opportunity. We are anxiously awaiting to hear back. It starts August 1st. We have a game plan with our finances and how to make it work.

I have an interview next week for a position closer to where we are (5min commute), with slightly better pay at 21.50/hr. We aren’t sure if we are going to get the internships, but would it be wrong of me to take a position and leave 3-4 months after? Would it be bad to leave my new position? Please help. :("

The college I am currently at does not offer a computer science degree, just a computer systems and cybersecurity degree. The other colleges that do have computer science degrees from my research have a bad reputation for having a bad computer science program. That's why I am considering an out-of-state transfer to another university that have, from what I can tell, a pretty good computer science program.

I was just advised and they say that I will have to take 3.5 years to finish the degree.

My main concern are financials because I will have to pull out additional loans beside the federal loans for this. My pell grant is running out too so it will not cover the full 3.5 years. From estimates, it looks like I might rack up to 100k in loans if I take this route.

Another option that I am considering is that doing a postbacc online degree from Oregon State University that would be faster and cheaper. I am just worried that it is an online degree so it would lack the networking opportunities.

Also, this might be really stupid to admit but I think I missed out on college experience as a whole since I didn't get involved and just did my work so I was hoping this would be another chance for me but I don't know if its worth the loans."

My university does not offer the course over the summer so I'll need to take it elsewhere.

It's also more likely CC courses will be asynchronous which would be very helpful since I have an internship this summer. The issue is I am having a very hard time finding Theory of Computation offered at any CCs this summer, so I am wondering if anybody knows of any.

I am curretnly working on an oracle database where i retrieve the data then extract some descriptive statistics, then check for uniqueness (still not well implemented) and the last step are a bunch of rules validation that i just made for the sake of the POC (future plan is to make a business rule engine).

Can anyone explain or guide me to ressources to how relevant it is in general ?

My thoughts are:

Berkeley:

* Goated CS program, I'd continue doing research with my current lab which I already really enjoy
* Classes are more interesting to me than Harvard's
* Low/no tuition because I would be TA'ing

Harvard:

* Private school with possibly more resources and different perspectives on research, classes
* New experiences, Boston (+ snow)
* I already did my undergrad at Berkeley so could be worth exploring something new in terms of research, classes, university in general

Both are 1 year programs and I'm planning on going into industry after regardless (and I've done 3 SWE internships so as long as the economy doesn't collapse I'm not too worried job-wise) but ideally will do something beyond SWE in a few years. Would appreciate any advice 💖"

Paying 60% for supervision seems crazy as I don't have much overhead costs with her. We use simple practice which is like, $20/mo but I don't have insurance through her or any other costs.

It is unbelievable that I have the chance to get into any of them, but luckily I have the chance to choose from them. And I hope someone would help me to choose from them.

For myself, I am not so sure about what to do next. I majored in Electrical Engineering as an undergrad but had chosen a lot of courses about computer science. I want to get into work as a software engineer but the situation seems to be not so good last year. So I would also consider to pursue PhD degree(as far as I know, UIUC is most friendly for PhD among these three). My research interests mainly focus on artificial intelligence, and it seems to be a tracking that requires PhD degree to find a job.

For these three programs, I consider the UIUC as my top choice because it can offer me both the opportunities to find works or to do research. And it also ranks the top for ECE  and CS area among these three. However, the lower university ranking maybe an issue if I finally return to my home country.

For Cornell, I love the courses and all the things of this program except its cost and time limitations. Its time limitation makes it hurry for me to find internship and full-time job. Also, it is not friendly for further PhD degree if I failed to find a job because it is a professional MEng degree.

For UPenn, the courses seems to be more about hardware, which I have little interest in. But it is a two year program and offers the chance to do research with professor. Also, the ivy title may help if I finally go back my home country. However, as far as I know, the admission bar of this program is much lower, and the reputation of this program is not so good.

Thanks for all your attention!

Computer Science Teacher - (8/10) Pretty good relationship, participated and held lead positions in multiple of the clubs and activities he sponsored.

**Interviews**

MIT (7/10) - Not bad, although it was pretty typical interview style, she seemed interested when I talked about creating an FRC team, and talked about how it was very similar to starting a business.

UPenn(8/10) - Won't go into specifics, but was very engaged the whole time and we both liked similar types of music. Talked about majoring in STEM and minoring in humanities/music, which is what I want to do.

**Essays**

Was really sad about Duke, as I thought I had a chance of at least getting waitlisted. Not really sure where I went wrong for all of these waitlists and rejections, maybe scattered ECs and cliche personal statement? However, I don't really regret anything I did, as I believe my HS career has been full of growth for me, and everything I did, I did for myself and not for college clout or anything.

**Letters of Recommendation**

Counselor **-** average: I had a new counselor this year cuz of a dumb last name change. She was nice but of course we didn't have a relationship, did an interview for her to get to know me. Probs pretty mid.

AP Lang Teacher - pretty good: i did well in her class, was a good student, also participated in her lit mag club (low effort and it was lowkey fun), had a relationship with her. Im sure she wrote a great LOR.

Physics Honors & AP Physics teacher - really good: Have a good relationship with him as well, spent time with him outside of class; got a chance to read this one. Biggest accomplish/compliment he gave me was the quality/level of writing in my lab reports. I personally love physics as a subject and after taking lang, apush and seminar junior year I got really good at writing so I made my reports look professional and really made sure I had everything I needed down for them; he actually didn't believe I wrote my labs myself without any help and I had to talk to him after class about it when he handed back our first labs in the fall.

**Interviews**

Bruh, I had NONE! Idk how because people around me did; I really do think they don't interview candidates who they aren't serious about, aka me.

**Essays**

I thought they were good, for my acceptances only my common app really matters so I'll just put it here since idc and college apps are over, I think it was good, probbaly the main reason NEU worked out; lmk if you want me to read it, ill post a tik tok here of me reading it!

Also my common app essay wasn't some deep metaphor or something crazy; pretty standard basic essay format imo. I did start early on it (end of summer) so there's that.

* My dream career throughout high school was in finance (BB IB/MF PE), but knowing how much connections and pedigree matter for that field and the fact my decisions were trash I've pretty much given up on that dream. Tbh I'm a more quantitative person I think I'd enjoy the work in SWE more than finance; and I also care more being at the top of my field then the field itself so i'd be happy working in FAANG SWE or quant roles if possible. Also a business degree is worthless imo; a technical degree is at least worth something; and I would hate my life if I worked in something like big 4 or MM IB. Also I like programming from my experience in those two side projects in my ECs and my time learning python before high school and APCSP and APCSA during HS; its basically just problem solving.
* I've also made a lot of bad choices in my life as a kid, like classic 'bad kid' behavior ig, maybe a little more extreme then that too; I decided to stop all that and take life more serious during covid (pretty much caused by covid); I was always good at school but during HS I didn't try (my remedial schulude during freshmen year) until covid hit and from there I started caring.
* Lmao I took 7 APs + 1 Honors junior year and had a ton of stuff going on 2nd semester and burnt out and let one of those AP classes slip and fucked up and failed it. Oddly enough not my biggest failure in life (refereeing the bullet above). Life's a funny thing man. I get called one of smartest people in my grade by my peers and get compared to two literal geniuses while my decisions were so ass compared to other ppl in my class at my school. I wont say im humble, but i genuinely do think I know where I fall in most cases. Either way I know ill be able to succeed moving forward. Overall, i'm surprised and happy this worked out in the end; ill be attending NEU!
* Also for those programs; I applied for scholarships and won them so I attended for free. they were great experiences and honestly if you're parents have money like that I would say its wroth it, but they weren't anything too crazy so dont worry about it. I doubt they had any factor in my decisions.
* Btw to all you seniors out there; please focus on your AP exams! Its my only focus for the rest of this month and I think the credit I get for my scores will pay off, ik we are all tried but its worth the extra effort to finish off strong! - coming from someone whos missed over a month of school this semester as a lazy senior (still all As thou lol)"

Backstory:

I work for a small company where ""everyone is family"" which is literally the case for some. The president's wife is my direct boss. There's several other people who are related or dating. Clearly, there's a lot of room for drama, and it doesn't help that the president is very emotional.

A few years back, I had the opportunity to hire an intern. The president liked him because he could tell that the kid didn't have many opportunities in life and had to really work for everything he had.

As an intern, he was just OK, but I didn't have a lot of time or skills to mentor him. Not sure why I thought it would be a good idea to have one, honestly. President asked how he was doing, and I think I said he was doing good. Then, he was essentially offered a full-time job without me knowing. I panicked that I wouldn't be able to provide him with the tools he needed to be successful, so I said something to the president about it, and then the intern was told we'd just extend the internship for a few months and then end it.

I think having to do that broke the president, because he gets so emotionally invested in everyone. He started treating me differently. Before, we'd go to lunch 2-3 days a week, but then not at all. He quit stopping by to chat. And when we did interact, he wasn't very talkative.

Onto now...

Over the past year or so, he's been a little more social with me, but it still feels awkward. For example, today we were interviewing and discussing hiring someone to join my team. At one point, he said, ""or maybe we could hire that intern..."" And then looked at me with a weird smirk, like he was looking for a reaction from me.

But he also said stuff like that he trusts me to judge someone's skills, since he knows he can trust my work. So maybe my anxiety is making me read too much into it.

It might be stupid, but we recently started a ""thank you"" box where we can write notes to other employees, so I wrote one to him thanking him for his trust. I'm just wondering if I need to sit down and discuss any personal issues he might have, but that seems real awkward..."

The degree is a total of 3 years, and the university is accredited and recognized. But since I'm a US citizen and not an EU one,  I've been looking for anything part-time+remote+all-year OR full-time+in-person+summer in the US, not here (no work permit). 

Issue is, although I've been doing pretty well on OA's, have a few mini-projects on the portfolio and have a pretty good pre-Covid internship at NASA , (with referrals! and a decent GPA), I can't seem to land anything (not once getting called for the next steps). (Maybe I can get some tips on what I might be doing wrong as well?)

Since I've been getting rejected with all these applications, I've started branching out for any work for the summer, and managed to get a position working in HR at a PE firm adjacent to the tech industry. 

The dilemma is: the likeliness of me landing something in this field for the summer is getting narrower by the day, so should I take this gig with HR (potentially get to do some networking in the field) and try my luck for the summer next year after graduation? Or should I spend the summer grinding away at personal projects, etc. and try my luck for next summer/something part-time+remote throughout the year? Any advice is really appreciated, not sure where to get guidance on my particular situation.

Also, if you have any advice on where to find the part-time + remote undergrad opportunities, I'd also really appreciate where to start with that."

I know that with a decent GPA (Mines 3.2) my degree can be pretty lucrative. I just have no idea what to go into. I was never good with circuit analysis and terrible at software engineering/programming. So I've always felt inadequate and screwed but decided my degree opens so many doors for me so stuck with it. The past year I've gotten alot better with microcontrollers/devices but still pretty shit compared to my peers.

Knowing this I decided to try for an internship in computer networking and since then have been interested in security (im still terrible at these things). Because of this experience I was able to land a Network Security Analyst position starting this summer making $70k which I know is quite low compared to other Computer Engineering/engineering grads.

I was excited when I was applying for the role as I felt it was the perfect position for me. Now that I got it, I'm worried that by going into IT and not making use of my computer engineering degree, Im pigeonholing myself into a worse career. My biggest worry is that I'm probably going to be bad at it and then will be stuck in IT and not be able to achieve the big goals and aspirations I have. I want more and I want to be better, but i've never been able to achieve better. I feel like I've just taking random shots in the dark never hit."

I have an internship interview today (2ND!! interview Electrical Eng) and god fucking damn. She kept calling because I would not answer my phone for 30 mins!! (just 30 MINS) and the notifications kept popping up on my screen and I could not concentrate on the interview at all. I panicked.

God fucking damn. I have been spiralling lately (just not feeling motivated at all and dealing with suicidal thoughts too) but holy shit it was a fucking wake up call. I am graduating soon (early actually, i will be holding a engineering degree at 20, a lot of my frens ask why I don't do a Co-op, i rather not take more money from my mother)

But shit man, the shame of not being able to answer the question was so bad. the interviewer looked so disappointed lmao. But yea better buck the fuck up. Its my life after all and I cnt let myself stay on the ground can i?

Time to get back to matlab :D

Edit: Should probably mention that Im not blaming her for me fucking up the interview. Just the fact that I can't just continue sitting ard and mope using my home situation as an excuse

Edit 2: Just got screamed at for not picking up the phone (she called 12 times in 30 mins) and she threatened to smash my tablet (that I got with my own money), RIP to keeping myself focused but i will do it for myself"
12bxq6h,4,2023-04-04,Admitted to a program I'm not interested in anymore -- I need advice pls!,taroboba61,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/12bxq6h/admitted_to_a_program_im_not_interested_in/,"I'm currently in Grade 12 and having a crisis :,).

For a long time, I was dead set on becoming a biomed engineer, so I only applied to ME/CHE engineering programs. I've only applied and been admitted to UWO general eng, UofT CHE, and UW ME. However, I realized that I would much rather study SWE or CS. UWO was the only school (I would consider going to) that would accept my late CS application.

&#x200B;

**Here are the only options I could think of on how to move forward:**

1. ***Accept UWO CS / General Eng*** *and have a more difficult time finding a job afterward (I live nearby so I would save a lot of money). Maybe try to transfer to UW after first year although it's extremely unlikely that I would be accepted.*
2. ***Take a gap year*** *to work and reapply to UW. I have a 95% average and decent good EC's (ex. intern at UWO and developing an app for medical students to practice cardiac surgery, children's hospital volunteer, president of clubs). \*\*Would experience A LOT of FOMO which isn't THAT important but will make me extremely sad :,).*
3. ***Accept UW ME anyway*** *and either attempt to fall in love with ME again or try to transfer into Tron (slightly more coding) or SWE and CS, even though I most likely wouldn't be able to.*

&#x200B;

I would much rather do CS because I find it more enjoyable and satisfying (I LOVE MATH A LOT, to me science is interesting but just ok). Also, from what I've read online a CS degree will be slightly easier and allow me to explore other passions via electives. I'd also get significantly higher pay as a computer scientist/software engineer. 

I really do not want to be a hardware engineer, but when it really comes down to it I'd be fine with doing CS or ME because I like both enough and TBH I'm not incredibly passionate about either and probably would not go into tech if money was not important for quality of life. 

**I don't care about becoming a billionaire or working exclusively at the biggest tech companies like Facebook or Apple. What's most important to me is that I end up with a decently high paying job (at least $80,000), good work-life balance, and have a genuine positive impact on the world.** 

**If you were in my situation, how would you move forward? I would appreciate your advice/thoughts very much --- I'm feeling quite uncertain! Thank you! :)**

&#x200B;

**TLDR; I was admitted to UW ME, but I really want to do SWE/CS. Should I accept UWO SWE/CS, UW ME, or take a gap year and reapply to UW SWE/CS even though I probably won't be accepted?**"

I am pretty bad at writing, so please understand. I will be dividing my issues into some segments so it will be long, but to anyone who reads it all I deeply appreciate you. 

So to start things off, I am M(23) and I am an only child in an Asian family household with traditional views. I have a perfect and wonderful girlfriend (24) who is also my first relationship and one of the few that I love a lot. I am a recent college graduate who is unemployed. I landed an internship in the summer that I just took because it was better than nothing. Currently, I am unemployed until then, but being home alone doing nothing has driven me to bad spirals that affect my motivation in life and in general. To describe my problems, I am quite an anxious overthinker who cannot seem to deal with negative emotions quite well. 

Family

As a child, I always dealt with some sort of insecurity (body image, money, fashion, etc.) and whenever I brought it up to my parents they were really not much help and I was not really given heart felt advice. Due to that, I learned to bottle it up, but it came with consequences. I had anger issues that started in elementary school, but I slowly suppressed it in high school and now I never get mad or anything, but sad and anxious. Now, I do not tell my parents of how difficult life is for me because I do not want to make them worried. I only told my mom about my struggle as my dad is not really a great communicator and he only talks about himself. My mom just encourages me to get through the hardship and that its just a phase, but what I realize is that it's just a phase if I can get through it. I am not really close with my relative and due to time zone differences I cannot keep in contact with them easily. Therefore, I have no one to necessarily talk to within my family. Moreover, I have never really gotten anything that I wanted. I took part time jobs and stuff because although, I know my family is financially stable, I do not seek out for financial help due to my father having a frugal mindset and whatever I purchase is a waste of money. I took part time jobs when I was young to fulfill my desires, but it was never enough. I always had to resort to low cost and low quality alternatives. Due to that I have never been able to fit in with other kids when I was young. I did not have a phone until high school, nor did I play any games with friends at home. Now that carried over to the present me where although I want to ask for help from my parents I don't and I do not plan to. 

My Relationship

Like I mentioned before, I have a wonderful gf who is my first relationship in my life. I met her when I was in my last year of college and things were amazing. I was having fun with her and college life was great. However, during my early days of my relationship, I was always insecure about stuff about her like her history which I took unhealthily back then by being overdramatic about it and overthinking. I learned to accept the past is the past, but I am always worried what if she happens to become attracted to her past hooks ups. I cannot help, but compare myself to all that past guys she has been with or did something because they are well off and way better looking than me. Me? I am not financially stable, I do not have a job, and I was always insecure about my acne ridden face and semi-okay body. I know for this my remedy is to go to the gym, but currently I do not have the luxury to pay a monthly fee for anything. I am constantly applying for jobs that I want to do and trying to find ways to make money, but I had no luck. So that is where I have a negative feedback loophole in my thoughts. Moreover, I always happen to feel very moody when my girlfriend says she is going to concerts or events without me. She is somewhat last minute and seizes the opportunity while I am left out waiting for her to return. As bad as it sounds, I always make scenarios in my head like what if she gets with a guy and etc. and I will never know about it. I really fear getting cheated on and I always hated cheaters. It is within my moral code to never cheat and never date a cheater. I am a firm believer that once a cheater, always a cheater because I honestly think cheating is the worst unpunishable crime there is. However, I tell myself that I trust her and nothing will ever happen, and I start to beat myself down for thinking such thoughts. 

For the past few months I have been in the lowest part of my life, and I have shown that to my gf. She is the only who knows that I have a issue with my anxiety and panic attacks. To be honest, I relied on her to help me out, but I realized that its affecting our relationship where I feel like I become a burden to her and she told me its unpleasant for her to deal with it constantly, but she will always support me. I totally agree with her because most times we are together, I just become out of it and deep in thought. Now I regret my decision to act how I did and how I reacted to things she told me and how emotionally vulnerable I was to her. I know women seek men who are more emotionally stable and making them self. However, I feel like I have done things that are irreparable and made her more likely to fall out of love. I honestly think I should break up with her since I do not want to make her life difficult and not be stuck with some depressed dude like me, but at the same time, I wanna mature and learn from her as she also dealt with similar issues as I had. I feel like I am not masculine like she wants to be and I want to improve myself somehow, but I do not know where to start. 

One last point, I found out that I have high neuroticism which exactly describes me. I was looking for ways to find out how to improve my relationship and this was the perfect way to describe me. I was looking for ways to lower neuroticism, but all I was guided was therapy and as of right now I  cannot even pay for an hour of a session. 

I really appreciate my gf. She was the first one out of my family to actually show me love and somewhat guides me into becoming a better and motivated man, but there are internal issues about the person I am that I want to change. I want to be happy so she can also be happy. 

Regrets

I have a lot of regrets in my life generally because of outside influences I cannot control. I want to change my perspective on things, but life just always hit me with BS that I do not think anyone deserves. I got into my dream university, but COVID hit. I could not go on a high school graduation trip because of my parents who I constantly reminded them that I really want to go for 5-6 years. There are so many things such a graduation pictures and Coachella that I really wanted to go *my gf is going last minute* , but I cannot because I am going out of states with my parents ( I asked to go last month when I was doing literally nothing, but they refused and said that it had to be April). I was supposed to go to a trip with my friends post college, but I cannot due to circumstances. I could not find a job because of all these events with the economy. I will never ever get these experiences back unless I travel back in time. These are things that drive me insane. I cannot enjoy this trip because of FOMO and just being left out in the dark. I have nothing to blame except myself and these forces are all something that I cannot control.  I hate the world for what is it, but I really want to change my pessimistic mindset around and become optimistic about things. I do not want to lie to myself that everything is going to go well, but I want to believe it. 

Motivation 

Leading on from my regrets segment, I have lost my faith in my abilities. People around me compliment me and put me in high regard, but I never accepted it. For example, people say I am good looking, but I do not believe that. My friends commend me for finishing college and achieving a lot of things. However, I cannot accept that because I have a high standard of life that I want to reach. I have so many goals and an image of what, where, and how I am going to be in the next 10 years. I have high ambitions, but seeing where I am right now, I just cannot seem to put in the grind anymore and lost a-lot of motivation. Even while I am working and studying, I let my negative emotions and thoughts take control of me and I resort to playing games. I have tried a-lot of things from going outside, reading books, games, and hobbies, but nothing really has helped me out so far. I lost interest in my own hobbies because I even think it is a waste of time. Also, it is the fact that I have so much free time right now, but I am achieving nothing and nor am I enjoying the free time because obviously leisure comes with money and I wanted to go on trips, amusement parks, the gym, pick up new hobbies, and therapy, but well I do not have money. I honestly felt the need to just rid myself of this world, but what kept me from making a dangerous decision are my family, friends, relationship, and regrets. 

What I am looking for

I am just honestly looking for any advice and some ways to alleviate this ongoing pain I have. I am emotionally, mentally, and physically weak and I want to grow. I want to be mature and become a ""man"". I want to achieve things beyond what I achieved. Now entering society as an adult, I do not want to waste my early 20's rotting away in my house. I want a mentor who can help me with things and give me advice, but these days its hard to find one because of all the profit seeking gurus. It is hard for me to trust people when I cannot even trust myself. 


Thank you for reaching this far and reading through. I just wanted to reach out to people who are well versed in mental health and this was the only free resource I had."

**Essays**

Common app main essay (7/10): I had two for EA/RD. For EA, it was pretty generic - what fueled me to become interested in the intersection of MedTech/Business.

**Final thoughts + Reflections:** 

I’m super happy to go to Berkeley. I’ll be honest though, in the 4 months since my Wharton ED didn’t go through, I felt completely down in the dumps and would incessantly regret not working harder academically, about how much time I had spent on my ECs, and think constantly about “What If’s.”

I still don’t know what got me into Berkeley and not into any other colleges (like UCI or UCSD). Whenever I've talked to the seniors at my school (which I get is not particularly accurate in terms of understanding college apps), we always agree that, once your stats + ECs meet the threshold, it comes down to the subjectivity of the AO reading your essays."

**Letters of Recommendation**

Spanish Teacher - 9/10– maybe 10/10? I’ve known her since middle school; I had her 7th grade, 9th grade, 11th grade. I believe she had a lot to say about me and my leadership skills within the classroom :)) 

AP Calc Teacher - 9/10 ?? I was really close with her last year- She helped me a lot both outside and inside the classroom, I was also one of the only kids who attended office hours so we were able to get to know each other on a personal level :D

**Interviews**

Tufts - 8/10, my first interview and I was terrified lol. But we bonded a lot of orchestra and about public health.

Rice - 9/10, she was really nice and it was quite chill. We talked about coming from far away from Rice and she gave me suggestions for stuff to check out in Houston since I have family there. Overall she was very sweet :)

Columbia - 7/10, I was kinda nervous but it went well, but I felt like she kept asking so many questions and after my answer she would just say “makes sense” 😭 BUT she asked a lot ab my family and we talked ab JROTC more

Stanford - 9/10… I was terrified bc my interviewer was a Doctor and yk that’s what I wanna do- but overall it went amazing. We talked a lot ab medicine and he even asked me what I thought made a great doctor. Overall he was so sweet and even emailed me separately after :D

UPenn - Canceled after getting in ED2

**Additional Information:**

I feel like definitely attending the HSF YLI helped me a lot in college readiness. I went into the college app process much more confident and with resources I wouldn’t have otherwise. 

I also applied to a LOT of schools- 24 in total- it was mainly me freaking out after I applied to my original 14 and thinking I wouldn’t get in anywhere. But lol I ended up getting into Hopkins ED2 so I feel like I stressed too much 🥲"

Im super excited, but have a few questions.

1. How difficult is the business program? Ive heard of some weed out classes, but genuinely curious to see the amount of work I may have. This is because I am also planning on pursuing a CS minor or major as well
2. Does anyone recommend a CS and business dual major? Or should I go for a CS minor?
3. Lastly, how are the opportunities for internships or co ops at BU?"
12c1g4p,2,2023-04-04,I am looking for any suggestions on IT Apprenticeship programs.,DebtOk9533,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/12c1g4p/i_am_looking_for_any_suggestions_on_it/,"I am looking for any IT apprenticeships (Software development or cloud ) programs or companies that offer such services as I want to start my IT career. I don't have any IT professional experience or internships yet after graduating from college, and I believe an apprenticeship would help me gain real-world professional experience. 

I am grateful for any feedback or help. Thanks"
12c2w4x,0,2023-04-04,I have to make the decision this week and would like your input: UMich CS vs UIUC CS+Math,ThrivingRN123,uofm,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/12c2w4x/i_have_to_make_the_decision_this_week_and_would/," I do acknowledge that bias can play a role here but I would like some input on how umich's cs program is vs uiuc's cs+math program I know UIUC is slightly higher ranked for CS than UMich but UMich is 25K cheaper across all four years. My goals are to get into big tech (hopefully) as a SWE, do cloud computing/cloud infrastructure stuff, and AI/Robotics stuff as well (hopefully make a startup). Would you guys say both schools offer the same/similar opportunities for big tech?? Are the internship opportunities pretty much the same/have the same amount of accessibility at both schools?

I also have questions about UMich itself: How is the course availability at UMich (especially for popular upper-level courses such as Operating Systems)? What courses should I get out of the way this summer before starting? How are the internship/research opportunities? I know UMich offers UROP which is definitely a plus. What are some of the concerns of the CS program? I know CS was just capped for this upcoming year so do you guys think in 3-4 years in time, would popular courses be more accessible? How are the Systems/AI/ML courses at UMich?

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated; this decision is nerve-wracking as both are great options."

Have the required degrees (EE) but that's about it.  Heard you should wear just a polo shirt to an apple interview? 

How do you even go about addressing questions on ""why do you want to work here"" and ""what do you know about XYZ topic"" or ""why should we hire you?"" 

I don't even know where to begin, I'm just frantically looking up the terms in the job description to not sound clueless and trying to tie them to my past experiences in some kind of way. I see it as an exercise to practice interviewing and dealing with panic 

**How do you sell yourself? ""I know similar skill X, and I have potential to the learn the skill because I succeeded in internships ABC/classes in the past"" - Not sure what I'm going to gain but it looks like a chance to practice interviews and face my panic, how do you answer questions where you don't have any hard experience to back why you'd be a good candidate?**"

The final transcript will not show which subjects I had to retake, just final scores. I will have 6 to 10 months of work experience. I am not sure about internship because it is very difficult to get internship where I live. 

I have pretty good english (IELTS score 7.5) and am confident I will score above 315 in GRE and above 95 in TOEFL. 

I am not aiming for top colleges. But I want to go to a decent, affordable college. I want to know which colleges I can target for?

Right now I'm a cs major and just can't get over my lack of responsibility. 

So before this semester, I was passable. I had decent grades, attended class, and even had time to spare for some other things. But now that I'm taking harder classes, picked up a job, and even had to worry about internships and the future, any shred of responsibility I had disappeared. Instead of working on school work, I spend every waking moment playing games. I started skipping classes with graded attendence just taking the hit. I've even slept through important quizzes and projects. I also still haven't applied for internships which are important since I graduate next year. I have no idea why, but all of sudden I became such a lazy idiot.

What really woke me up to my stupidity was graduation setting in, not even my grades which fell well below a's and b's. I got scared I'd be jobless despite attending college and even graduating early because of my irresponsibility. 
As for what I've done, I started a game detox during the week of an important project which ended up failing. I also tried attending classes which went fine until I started sleeping in again. I've tried separating myself from things like instagram and youtube, but I always give in for some reason even when I know I shouldn't. Even now, while writing this, I'm procrastinating and further ruining my sleep schedule.

Honestly, what makes everything worse is the shame. The shame of knowing that not only is this my fault, but that when I try to change myself, I fail. But on top of all this is can I say I really tried? I feel like I'm just telling myself this just to humor myself. Why can't I even get motivated to change and accept reality? It feels like I don't even understand myself anymore. Why do I do the things I do and why do I think like I do?

Anyways, I'm hoping that by venting about all of this I can accept that I have an issue and can be more resolved to change myself. Thanks for listening."

Would you recommend a first-year student to apply for internships for the 2024 summer or should I focus on other things? I am new to CS, so I don't really have any significant projects to show on a resume, I have only done small projects like menu-based calculators and some with minimal python-SQL connectivity. Classes themselves will start by mid-August. Should I use this time to do a few big projects? Are there any internship opportunities specifically for 1st year students that I could apply to?

I'm stuck in a dilemma!

So basically I applied for CS/ECE master programs in US and CAD, and since the recent disturbance in tech industry and I'm Chinese so it's very hard for me to get PR of US, so I've decided to go to Canada.

And I've been having trouble on which Canadian University to choose from. The two offers I have right now is UBC ECE MENG and UofToronto MScAC. I have listed the basic pros and cons below:

UBC ECE MENG:

pro:

1. BCPNP program, guaranteed PR as long as I graduate (don't need IELTS, don't need job).
2. better weather than Toronto.

con:

1. Not guaranteed COOP position (rumered to be around 40%), which means around 60% of students of this program are not allowed to do internship in the summer in Canada (Some of whom choose to apply suspension in the summer and do internship in China or US).
2. Less job opportunities in Vancouver than Toronto.
3. It will take around two years for BCPNP process to complete, during which I will have to stay in BC province.

&#x200B;

UoT MScAC:

pro:

1. guaranteed 8-month internship (basically this is one of the requirement of graduation so school will also help, and I don't have much work experience so this could be a big pro)
2. CS title is probably better than ECE.

con:

1. No guaranteed PR. And being in Toronto rather than rural areas is a huge disadvantage in the PR nomination system of Ontario Province.
2. It is required that the internship being research based. There were cases where someone got SDE internship offer but was then rejected by department.
3. Most of the courses and internship are heavily related to AI research, which could be a con for me as I'm looking for SDE job (actually I'm not sure about what I'm gonna do in the future, but til now I don't have a strong passion for AI research lol).

I'm at a bit of a crossroads and was hoping to get some advice on choosing between two graduate programs. At the end of this admission cycle, I was fortunate enough to receive admission offers from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) for their MS in Computer Science program, and from Saarland University in Germany for their Language Science and Technology program.

My eventual aim is to pursue a Ph.D. in NLP/Computational Linguistics. While both of these programs seem like a great fit, I'm having a tough time deciding which one to go for.

If anyone has any experience or knowledge of either program, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share your thoughts and insights. What are the pros and cons of each program? How well-respected are they within the field of NLP vis a vis each other? Are there any factors I should consider that might not be immediately obvious?

Here's some information about my profile that might be useful:

* GRE: 332 (168 Quant, 164 Verbal)
* TOEFL: 112
* CGPA: 9.09/10 from a Tier 2 University
* No publications
* 3 major projects
* Internship at Novartis and Samsung
* 2.5 years of experience in the industry as an ML engineer, primarily working on NLP problems.

Any advice or guidance you can offer would be incredibly helpful, and I would be grateful for any input you may have. Thank you in advance for your time and assistance!

So I (23F) am in my last semester of college. I am studying civil engineering which I have really struggled with. My GPA is horrendous and despite that to my absolute shock, last summer I got the internship in the company of my dreams which is a government company.

The main thing I like about it is that the work life balance is really good because it's the government and the pay rates are transparent from the beggining. I also like all the nice government job benefits.

During my internship last summer, I kinda got off on the wrong foot with my supervisor. Basically she was upset that I had asked for work around the office after not being checked on for about about 3 weeks and another Supervisor wanted me to work with him. I didn't know at the time that was a big no no 

I was lucky that they started a new program to extend the internships part time & remotely throughout the school year.

Because I work to pay my bills in college I took as many hours as I can take every week. 

However, working was kinda a struggle mostly because there was such a learning curve at the beggining of each new project and when I asked for help I was mostly told that whatever software issue I was experiencing was ""not possible"" or something along the lines of ""it works for me, idk what to tell you"". 

I was also often burned out and overwhelmed because of how much I worked on top of school and I was having a LOT of anxiety attacks. A few times, my supervisor would get mad at me for things like missing her call so I had a lot of anxiety around the job.I also have SEVERE executive function issues which is obviously worse when coupled with anxiety.

Last Thursday, I met with someone from another department to review the project that I have been working on and there were a LOT of mistakes mostly in details that I missed.

However, that was also the first time that I felt like someone actually EXPLAINED to me what I was doing and why and gave me guidelines that I could actually follow. For the first time in 10 months I was excited to actually work and get back to the project.

The very next day, when I logged in to work, I saw an email that said that it was the last day of my internship. Appearantly, it had been decided months before that all of the interns would end that day but no one bothered to let me know before hand. I was in complete shock for 2 reasons. Firstly, I have bills to pay and 2nd, I have so much unfinished work which would fall on the one employee who was amazing to me.

That employee called me today really upset because I had forgotten something else and now she has so much work. She also mentioned that my supervisor said that I ""worked only to pay the bills, not as a real intern"". 

I don't even know what that means but I think it's clear that I have done terrible at the internship. 

I'm scared that I have ruined my future. I am a first generation immigrant and I come from extreme poverty. I have a parents and siblings to support. I also, really want to be a civil engineer so that I can help my country in the future. I can't even talk to anyone I know about this because it's so shameful and embarrassing. Like, this is the most significant experience I have in my field. 

Not only will they 99% not hire me, but I may not even get a good word for references for other jobs that I will apply to. 

To top it off, I lost the referral paper for my ADHD diagnosis so I might have to start the process all over again. 

I don't even know what to do with myself atp"

Any individual function or plot is fine but my repos just aren't organized like professional ones and my classes tends to have tons of arguments whereas I'll see people using command line arguments or parsers.  

For instance, sometimes papers will have code and I'll check them out and it'll be a very nice, downloadable/executable github page, divided into utils/source/etc.  Granted, most of those are made by either very senior PhD students who have done a ton of internships or people who went into industry before coming to academia, but how can I learn more about writing more professional, maintainable, readable code?  I already know about documentation and PEP8 for Python, but I feel like even though I know things covered in classes there's still a disconnect between how nice my code appears to someone who isn't involved with my projects when compared to real repos made for public use."
12cq66i,1,2023-04-05,Tips for growing in a hostile environment,L0uisc,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12cq66i/tips_for_growing_in_a_hostile_environment/,"I'm looking for perspective, since I'm not seeing any way out any more. The situation is as follows:

I started working as ""software intern"" at a small company (< 5 employees) in late 2019. My responsibilities would be writing software under the supervision of the software developer and helping with production of hardware (it is an electronics company). The software involved both embedded and backend/frontend industrial automation type software.

I did not have a clue what to do, and I did not even have the words to ask the right questions. So I suffered along, finally realizing a bit how microcontrollers work. Then lockdown struck and I had to work from home. This made me even less productive. I should've asked a lot more questions, but again, I didn't even know the words to ask the right questions.

Things started improving a little in 2021, when there were fewer new products and my responsibilities were much more on the production side.

Then my senior left around April 2021 and I became the senior and only developer.

In 2022 had to implement a website for a client. We already made GSM/GPS modules for them, and the previous website contract drew to a close. The website would need to display the location of their devices and monitor some parameters (sent to the server via MQTT).

Once I started to work on the website, I realized I had no idea how to do something like that on that scale. I knew I don't know how to prevent it from becoming a huge mess of brittle spaghetti code. I tried to study the concepts I need, but the deadline drew nearer and I had to stop doing that and start actually implementing.

I told the company owner twice that I don't know how to do it and that I need help. The first time I got a pep talk (""I believe in you"") and nothing more. The second time I said I'm going to leave if I don't get help. That got me help from my previous senior, but since he had another job, he couldn't really help me as much as I needed.

April 2023 and the website is starting to really show cracks, but I don't have mandate to dig in and try to straighten things. There are new projects keeping me busy now. I did convince the company owner that I really need to look at things after 6 months of experience with the live site. I might get some time for that, but I doubt it would be enough.

I'm feeling I'm constantly trying to do things without the knowledge or experience to do it well, digging a hole for myself and causing all kinds of critical issues I have to fix. All while not really gaining experience in industry best practices regarding software deployment, testing, etc. The website has no automated tests, for example, and I had no example projects with tests or a senior who has done it before to refer to.

I also don't know what to put on a CV. I don't have any qualification after high school. I am currently studying BSc Computer Science part time after work. I do have experience with embedded platforms and with the Flask web framework and Bootstrap.

I feel I'm not growing because I don't have any expert guidance. The only available senior is an electronics engineer with hardware design experience. The senior software developer who was previously at the company is also a qualified electronics engineer who played with Linux in high school. He knows a lot about it, but I feel I never got taught a procedure to start working with his code base without messing it up. We didn't use version control when I started. I finally put my foot down and started a company github account. There was no documented test procedure. Of course this resulted in me letting bugs go into production.

I don't know git, testing frameworks, etc. well enough to use them sensibly today still. I don't have the time or energy to try side projects to learn these things due to the stress of the job and the load of my study material.

The hardware engineer does have a lot of experience on how to develop a product, so to an extent his input is useful to help me wrap my head around a problem at a very high level. That's not enough, though. I need more.

I did very well in math and physics in high school, but I feel I'm delivering extremely poor quality work. I just don't have time to understand what I'm supposed to do. I'm already dug in too deep in a hole. I'm frustrated and under a lot of pressure. I don't know how to get out. I feel I'm digging myself deeper with every passing day.

What should I do? How can I get out of this situation?

PS this has been a very long and disorganized rant. Thanks for reading. I just had to get it off my chest."
12cswhe,3,2023-04-05,Why I won't be working in industrial environment ever again,Earwke,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/12cswhe/why_i_wont_be_working_in_industrial_environment/,"This is my personal opinion, and runt about my recent work environment.
I work for a hell of a corporation. I'm on a contract of employment, on an introductory internship to nothing. To all interns who have the opportunity, IF IT'S BAD AND YOU CAN QUIT, BETTER QUIT EARLY.

I would like this post to be a warning to everyone who is starting their career in the profession. In addition, my personal dishwashing/sharing of the inner pain of failing in my profession (which I could love but won't return to, I've written why below).

My former boss declared my career path as a project engineer in a factory as developing soft skills, expanding knowledge about machines and chemical processes taking place on lines. She personally couldn't give exact examples of the skills I would be taught (a big flaming red flag waving).

After taking the position, I noticed that most of the people involved in important process improvement projects/line start-ups no longer work for my current employer. (another red flag)

None of the current employees are satisfied with the rates offered to them and newly hired external candidates who require training by external employees get higher pay (madness).

In a large corporation, it is worth finding out how employees in other factories, with different management, are treated. Having the opportunity to view job offers, I was recruited to a theoretically less prosperous (according to my managerial staff) factory. My job interview was short, concise and to the point. I got a job offer with a salary higher by 2000 dollars, no additional requirements and no stressful process, additionally I found out that this ""inferior"" factory is at the same stage of the business model as my current employer.

Your current employer (manager) believes that his factory model is ""better"" because it is, without any justification for this statement. In addition, during internal audits, the training management team is unable to establish a uniform standard in the company.

The upper management has no idea who deals with the line documentation and at what level there are deficiencies in the technical documentation (concerning legal standards). The managing staff can justify the lack of documentation required by the ""company standard"" (laughs). Your management thinks you're a moron, and they can show it outright and still think that no one else sees it.

People with technical/engineering positions do not have training/studies in the field of knowledge in the subject (the company most often has to employ former rope workers because it cannot afford real specialists/such people get fired faster). This is not a rule, but a significant determinant, especially if a person in a technical position asks you for help in completing technical documentation during the internship (it happened more than once in my case). Nevertheless, a mentoring offer not related to the methodology of people management is needed if problems with the operation of the line are repeated.

The people you work with will consider very low-level positions like a process leader/positions requiring a high school pass (in other companies the only requirement) to be a huge success.

The management methodology is indirect threats ""we are the best, leading company on the market, if you want you can try to quit and look for a better job"".

Hypocrisy after job interviews, after presenting 10 functionalities in a foreign language that I introduced in the company together with the teams, I was informed that I cannot speak this foreign language and I cannot present improvements in a ""colorful"" way. Then I was further asked after this conversation to give a presentation in a foreign language and to help translate the corporate requirements for the audit, because the people in the positions I applied for were not doing their jobs from 2016 to 2023 (sic).

There are no real performance verification systems. Look for people who have been involved in projects and have been in low-level positions for more than 6 years. In my soon-to-be former factory, I found several people who, after 4 years, are still waiting for raises for doing really important functionalities on the site (they don't even have project bonuses or any promotion opportunities).

  My current main tasks based on what the management thinks, are: preparing PowerPoints, counting inventory in Excel. I expected that working in a profession related to production would be hard, but the lack of appreciation of current employees, underestimating employee rates and letting me know that in the eyes of the management I am an idiot provoked me to start intensive training and studies in an industry that quickly verifies and teaches (IT). Tomorrow I have my first IT interview, in a few months I will be resigning from my current job (I will earn more from selling underwear and it would be more satisfying in this case). I know IT is not great, but at least I know where I can go to have something even slightly better.

My additional task is to support the management in assessing the functionality of the systems (because they are not computer literate). Can't wait to quit. 

PS The requirements for my job were: knowledge of AutoCAD, Inventor, knowledge of mechanics, knowledge of management systems."

Hi everyone,

I'm currently a freshman in college with a mechanical engineering internship, and I also had a mechanical internship before this one. However, my passion actually lies in electrical and computer engineering. Unfortunately, the high school I graduated from only had a machining program, which propelled me into the world of mechanical engineering and manufacturing and gave me a solid background in both.

Recently, I have been looking for an internship opportunity to break out of my mechanical background into the electrical/computer engineering industry, and have received an offer from a company in electrical engineering that seems honestly really solid. The only caveat is the pay is $15/hr, while my current internship is $16/hr, going up to $17/hr soon.   I live in South Florida, for reference. I'm aware the knowledge I can gain is invaluable in comparison to money, but I was just wondering if that seems pretty low in general for the field. I believe taking the pay cut for the experience already would be worth it, but I just seek advice from the more seasoned career professionals on this subreddit, so I am sorry in advance if this question comes across as a no brainer. 

 I would greatly appreciate any insights and experiences you all may have. Thank you in advance!"

With nyu being known for being extremely expensive, i wasn’t expecting to attend, but with my financial aid offer I would only be paying around 15k rather than 90k yearly. I’m very excited about this, but my parents want me to go to Oakland University, a college school 20 minutes from me my brother attends. I was given a good scholarship there too that would make me pay 7k yearly to attend.

My major is CS at OU, but after talking to some alumni along with my brother, apparentlyOU’s math and engineering department is quite terrible. they’re under investigation since people often fail calculus and other math courses and etc. as a CS major math is extremely important and I’m fairly new to CS. I was also told by these people an avg 4 year degree takes someone around 6 years to achieve and it’s fairly normal to do this at OU. If I were to attend for 6 years, my scholarship would expire after 4 and I’d have to pay around 30k yearly for the final 2 years. I’m worried this is my future at OU because my very intelligent brother is going down that path. Nothing wrong with a 6 year path, (anything to get that degree) I just don’t want to pay extra money along with be in school for longer than i need to.

At NYU I’d double major in music tech and CS. I’d love to attend nyu for networking reasons and internship reasons in my future career in music and even software engineering. My major can be switched to fully CS and i’d still keep my scholarship just incase i have thoughts of switching. The cons about NYU is It’s a 9 hour drive from my home state and i don’t know anyone at all who lives in New York.

My parents, knowing how good of a school NYU is and how great this opportunity is to attend, still want me to attend OU because they don’t want me to be far. They’re gonna miss me too much and fear that if I go to NYU i’m “never going to come back.” Though ai understand their thought process, I think they’re being selfish to stop me from pursuing this amazing opportunity. i believe overall NYU is the greater choice for me in terms of future possibilities and I feel like if I have the ability to go to a great school after all the hard work I put into HS, I should take that chance. I’d love to go somewhere with a little prestige though it doesn’t matter truly in the end. I feel so frustrated because as parents you’d think they would be encouraging me to go since it’s my dream since I was a freshman. They keep telling me for my undergrad i should stay instate but after that I can go wherever I want. But i don’t want to go to grad school. I also don’t want to transfer 2 years into attending OU because i’m not sure the scholarship would stick.

Idk. I don’t know how to convince them to let me go. Their concerns are valid however but I feel like i’d be missing an opportunity of a lifetime.

TLDR:parents want me to go to state school rather than my dream school. Money isn’t an issue, they just want me to stay in michigan.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for all the advice and replies. Ive decided on it and i’m 100% deciding on NYU. I’m setting up a presentation and a sit down conversation with my parents because so truly don’t want to ruin my relationship with them. It’s still a possibility for me to just pack up and leave just in case the convo goes left. If all else fails it won’t be too bad to move back to Michigan but I’d love to atleast try!

EDIT 2: Also to clarify, it’s 15k total, including housing tuition extra expenses, etc."

I could not get a one person dorm room even as a senior. I have to share a room with someone, netting me absolutely no privacy and / or peace of mind while applying to jobs and other things.

Furthermore, I am entirely unable to find myself an internship in the summer, which would make my future job hunt (for which I have zero incentive left to begin with) even more difficult. I am also suffering academically this semester, and I just cannot pinpoint why since I have not made considerable changes to my studying habits from previous semesters.

These situations are making me more and more mentally fatigued by the day. I am currently thinking of taking a leave of absence for a year and trying with the housing + job hunt again. I doubt I want to endure this pain for another year straight. Maybe, just maybe a year off at home would make things better.

Are there any alternatives and / or remedies to these issues? What would you do in this situation? (external housing and therapy are out of reach to me). I just cannot get ahead of these issues and have been feeling that my year up ahead has been ""spoilt""."

I also have a bachelor’s degree in mathematics. The common career path for this kind of degree is in quantitative finance, but the deeper I get the more uncertain I am. For the past month and a half, I’ve been considering taking a gap year before I finish my final semester to serve with AmeriCorps. There are several reasons I’m considering this. My mental health is suffering in this program and I couldn’t find an internship for this summer. Additionally, I’ve always been passionate about education & service and have wanted to do AmeriCorps for a very long time. However, there are objective reasons I feel this might be a bad idea. I do only have one semester left. I have about 100k in student loans from my masters degree that I need to start paying off soon. Quant finance is an extremely quickly-moving field: a year from now, the job market might be even more competitive.
I am absolutely suffering in this degree and feel a gap year would give me the time to figure my life out. I’m still young, so I have my entire life to build a career. If I don’t serve with AmeriCorps now, when will I?
But thinking realistically: why wait an entire year for just one more semester? I need to take care of my student loans, and a career in public service won’t necessarily do that (I know about PSLF). What if the job market gets even worse, and I can’t find a job in two years?

Background Verification for unpaid internship

Hello everyone, I recently got placed as a fresher in a company. Initially I submitted a cv/resume in which I had mentioned an unpaid internship. In that cv/resume I had mentioned "" I am doing the above internship currently"" , but due to some reasons I couldn't complete it.  And I got selected by submitting this cv/resume. Later I reapplied to that internship and completed it. After a few months of selection the company asked me for my updated resume saying ""please submit your updated cv/resume for further process"".  For this I submitted my cv/resume with correct details with correct dates. I wrote that I am doing an internship in September in the old one, in the updated one it is December(a 2 months internship). So now will this affect in background verification? If it affects, can I leave without writing about this internship in the background verification form? Will the background verification be done on updated resume or old resume?

I am a data analysis major attending a university in the United States. I have an in-person internship line up for my summer break; then, I will be back at school until I graduated with my data analytics degree. I heard that more experience and a degree would help. Considering all of that, how hard would it be to get a fully online remote position as a data analyst or a well paid job abroad in Thailand? What are some of the steps I could take achieve this in the next few years?

I mess living in Thailand and looking for ways to move back (only a citizen of USA). I heard an online digital nomad position seems like a good way to start achieving that goal; however, I am open to other ideas as well.

Thank you all and look forward the responses."

I also want to be successful once I get it, so I'd like to learn whatever skills can help. For my career, I think I'd like to work in a swe position, but not at a tech company. Something like a bank, insurance company, medical field, etc.

I currently have an internship for this summer, and it is *technically* a tech related internship, but not at all what I actually want to do in the field. I'm taking it mostly to put on a resume and because the pay is better than fast food/retail.

So far, basically all I know is java, c, calculus (1 and 2), and that's pretty much it.

I keep seeing all these words and things that I just don't understand. Api, sql, framework, full stack, git, ui, react, ruby, rust, typescript, etc. I can look them up one by one, but i feel that wouldnt be a good use of time. What of this is relevant, and what should I learn to get swe interviews?

Then, I just feel like there are major gaps in my knowledge. Like, how do I go from writing java to having it in an app, website, etc? Like, no one's ever going to use windows command prompt to use something I write. Or, how do you get information online into the code to use it? Also, when someone has android or linux on their resume, what does that mean? Like developing for them?

So really, I guess what I'm asking is what of that stuff should I learn? What should I prioritize now? No one's going to hire me with just java and a kinda, not really related internship. Is leetcode worth my time right now, or should I wait for after taking the data structures and algorithms courses?

I'm just feeling kinda lost and overwhelmed because there's so much that I'm seeing online that I haven't heard or seen in my classes yet, so I'd appreciate if anyone could help!"

Seeking advice on which internship to choose and how to discuss potential change in educational plans with internship employers. 

Hey r/FinancialCareers! I find myself in a bit of an unusual situation and could really use your input. A bit about me: I'm a senior undergraduate student at a large non-target public university, double majoring in Business Honors and Finance, with a minor in Economics. I was inspired to pursue a career in investment banking after taking a financial modeling class last semester.

To extend my education and allow for a summer internship, I got accepted into a Masters of Science in Computational Finance (or Quantitative Finance) program at another large non-target public university. Although I enjoy math, I haven't taken a math class since calculus BC in high school. I'm learning computer programming and have picked up the basics of R and Python, but it's something I struggle with and need to invest a lot of time into.

I currently have 3 offers for summer internships:

1. Investment Banking Summer Analyst in Washington DC at a boutique bank. This internship is paid, but with a high cost of living and expenses, I think I would spend more than I make.
2. Private Equity Analyst Internship that is remote for a very small private equity firm. I could live at home, and it's only 40 hours a week, but unpaid.
3. Financial Analyst Intern at an F100 company.

I'm now unsure whether or not I want to go through with the Masters of Science in Computational Finance or Quantitative Finance. It's a very intensive one-year program, requiring 10-15 hours of homework per week over the summer. This program also has an intense boot camp starting August 1st, where I'll finish 6 hours of classes in 2 weeks, leading straight into the normal school semester. The program has a great advisory board and is partnered with the Masters of Science in Finance program at the school, which routinely places students at UMM, and sometimes BB and EB investment banks. However, the Masters of Science in Computational Finance or Quantitative Finance won't be relevant at all to the work I'd be doing in investment banking. I am interested in this study, but I'm unsure if I want to pursue a career in this field.

 Additionally, I could use some guidance on how to discuss the possibility of not pursuing the Masters program with the companies that offered me internships. I applied to all of these positions with my resume listing me as a candidate for the Masters program, so they might have certain expectations about my educational background. How should I approach talking to these companies about my situation, should I decide not to enroll in the program? I want to be transparent and professional while addressing any concerns they may have about my qualifications and commitment to the internship. 

I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights you might have on which summer internship to choose and whether pursuing the Masters program is the right decision for me. Thanks in advance!"

&#x200B;

It had been three weeks since I started as an intern at \[REDACTED\] hospital in the emergency department. Finding myself with nothing to do at three in the morning, I jumped at the chance to examine the new patient I saw enter the triage room.

I grabbed his papers from the triage desk but the nurse manager Liz almost slammed her hand in a clenched fist against the clipboard, yet somehow forced a sweet smile as she said, “I’m going to get someone else to take this patient.”

There were only two other doctors in the ED at this point in time, another intern, Doctor Patricia Weinstein, who was busy dealing with a man who decided to lick a frozen can, and Doctor Moore, who was busy with a more serious drug overdose patient. I was a bit more than annoyed with the nurse.

“The other doctors are busy. I’ll take care of this.”

Liz let the papers go. “I just think you should let someone else take care of this, doctor.”

I had a look at the triage papers.

Name: Daniel. Age: 34. Presenting symptoms: Oral thrush.

Oral thrush? To an ED? To say I was confused was an understatement. Since I started, I always had the hunch that nurse Liz had an incredibly low opinion of me, she was always staring at me, giving me terse one-word responses, and seemed to go out of her way to help me as little as possible. But this is absurd.

He shouldn’t be presenting to an ED with oral thrush at three in the morning. And what the hell was that about someone else taking this case? As if I couldn’t deal with thrush of all things.

“Concern noted.”

When I entered the room, the patient was alone, sitting on the edge of the patient bed, hunched over almost into a ball. He’d been in better shape.

“Hi I’m Doctor Narrator. How can I help this evening.”

The patient didn’t even sit up. He was hunched over his shoulders, almost in a sitting foetal position. I had a better look at the triage sheet.

“Hello,” checked my notes again, “Daniel. What seems to be the problem?”

“Are you…a doctor?” Said Daniel hunched over and with heavy breaths. This was when I started to think this was a bit more than oral thrush, possible allergic bronchopulmonary mycoses. What the hell was Nurse Liz thinking with such an incorrect initial diagnosis?

“Yes, I’m Doctor Narrator. Could I get you to sit up please Daniel?”

I couldn’t rule out anything without making a proper visual inspection. Not to mention this would be a simple function test.

“Sure thing…doc.”

Daniel slowly, and with what seemed like strenuous physical effort, placed his right hand on his knee. He then took a small breather by taking large gulps of air. Then he did the same with his left hand and with what seemed like the intensity of an Olympic weightlifter, he pushed himself off his knees and slumped back against the wall.

There were one, two, three, four white fingernail-sized toadstools growing on the left side of his face. His eyes were darting back and forth, his eyelids sunk half way down, and he had little if any muscle tone on his face.

Yeah, not thrush.

I was still in the middle of the room at this point. I hadn’t even begun a proper examination but I could already tell I was going to have to wheel him off and give him intravenous antifungal medication.

But I was a professional. I had to do at least a rudimentary investigation before sending him off. To be honest, at that point, I was also more angry at Nurse Liz for her half-assed attempt at triage.

And to assume I wasn’t competent enough to take this case.

More out of curiosity than anything, I asked Daniel, “Are you here by yourself?”

“Yes.”

Strange, considering he could barely lift himself up. There wasn’t a wheelchair or anything in here. It was too difficult to believe he could walk in here unaided.

“Daniel, did the nurses use a wheelchair to move you here?”

“No. Doc…it’s getting harder…to…breathe.”

The chart said he’d only been here for five minutes. There was no way he had deteriorated that quickly. Nurse Liz had to be really bad at her job.

“Daniel, I’m just going to have to ask you to open wide just to see inside. Then we’ll get you into ICU. Okay?”

Daniel struggled to nod. If he felt pain, he didn’t have the ability to show it on his face. It looked like he had a permanent sad clown fish face look. And his breathing looked heavier and more strained. It started to get faster and deeper. As if he was driven to the point of exhaustion. It was wearing me out just looking at him.

I quickly put on some gloves and grabbed a fresh tongue depressor (I’ll be honest, it’s an over-glorified popsicle stick) and told Daniel to open his mouth. His jaw dropped and mine did too.

I think I stressed the point that this wasn’t oral thrush before but in a normal case you’ll just see a white coat over the tongue. Daniel didn’t have a white coat over the tongue. It looked like a full-blown mushroom farm in there. Most of his mouth was bright green, and there were, and I will stake my medical reputation on what I saw, there were fluorescent, pulsating, mushrooms on his mouth’s roof.

This was a mycosis for the ages. 

Before I could even turn around and call for an emergency transport, I watched as one of the purple mushrooms swelled…then popped.

Bright purple spores sprayed on me. I fell back on the floor, coughing, flailing, spluttering, crying out for help in between my gasps for air.

Then another pop. Then another. And another.

I couldn’t see. The entire room was covered in fluorescent purple light. Smothered in tiny spores.

I was choking. Struggling, I grasped at my throat, as if that would help. Couldn’t cough, couldn’t breathe, vision blurring. I tried to stand up, couldn’t stay up, staggered until I hit a wall. Clawing, grasping, reaching for the door handle.

It was funny in a way. A doctor dying in a hospital trying to help a patient. Ironic. The thoughts that float through your head as you struggle to survive.

A miracle. I found the doorknob and heard a voice on the other side.

“I hope I’m not too late. This one might be a doozy.”

I turned the knob and simply fell out of the room and collapsed on the floor. Gasping for fresh air, I barely noticed as someone started spraying me with a squirt bottle.

I heard a woman’s voice over me.

“Sorry doc. But it’s only mostly water! It’ll wash out.”

In between the coughing and spluttering I managed to groggily turn my head and look at the woman above me. She was wearing green surgeon’s scrubs, a surgeon’s hair-net and an N95 face mask. Her only distinguishing feature was her green eyes and a single strand of black hair down the right side of her face.

She looked into the patient room and audibly sighed.

“One of these days I’ll be on time.”

I didn’t even have time to say anything before she went into the patient room and closed the door. Next thing you know there was a small BANG noise. A few seconds later, a light-yellow mist seeped out from under the door. She came back out and stood at the doorway. I couldn’t see any of those purple spores in the room behind her.

“Really sorry doc. This is all my fault. Really. I just need to be on time for once.”

She reached underneath her coat and pulled out a small vial of yellow liquid and poured into a plastic cup from one of her pockets and handed it to me. She was a real walking apothecary.

“Drink up. It’s uh…Nystatin.”

Maybe it’s because I nearly died from oxygen deprivation that I took that medicine without question from somebody I’ve never met before. I swallowed and only stared at the ground for a moment before I looked up and she was gone.

&#x200B;

Daniel survived. I found him asleep on the bed and after I woke him up, he didn’t even remember walking into the hospital. No signs of infection. Sent him home. There were no possible reasons to hold him back for observation, he didn’t want to be there and there was nothing wrong with him. I’d never seen anything like it before.

That only left me the problem of finding out who that woman was. Doctors don’t fumigate entire rooms with explosions. My attending physician Dr. Rutkowski hadn’t heard of her. I asked him about the case and if he’d ever seen a systemic infection of purple mushrooms before but he just thought I was dumb intern playing a prank on him by the other senior doctors in the hospital. He wouldn’t even check security footage, saying patients don’t miraculously recover from systemic infections in minutes. “My diagnosis,” he said, “get more sleep.”

And what about Nurse Liz? She was the one telling me not to see the patient. She was the one who wrote down that absurdly wrong diagnosis of oral thrush. I asked her straight away if she saw the woman in the surgeon’s scrubs walk through but she said, “I must’ve been busy and didn’t see her.”

I'm currently a freshman at a well-regarded CS school and was lucky enough to join a small seed stage company in the midwest as their only software engineer a few months ago. This is a full-fledged part time SWE position with the high likelihood to become CTO in the future (title on pitch decks is literally ""aspiring CTO""). The startup has gotten some OK pre-seed funding and has generated between 200-500k in revenue over the past 2-3 years with a decent likelihood for growth.

So far, I've built an internal data processing tool for the company and am currently working on rebuilding their online storefront. I've also been involved with raising capital and have been presented as part of the executive team. Over this summer, I'll be building out an MVP for a completely new branch that they are launching.

I understand how fortunate I am to have this opportunity and am still completely in shock, but I can't help but be worried at the amount of risk I'm taking on by working with this company. If I commit to this fully now and land CTO, I likely will be at this company throughout college and won't have any opportunities to take on summer internships.

Even though I'm only a freshman, I'm very ambitious and want to strategically hedge my decisions as much as possible. If the company goes belly-up, I want to still be well-positioned for a SWE/PM job at a FAANG+/unicorn out of college.

In the ideal scenario, I'd become CTO for this company with a decent amount of equity and cash out during an exit a few years down the line. However, the likelihood of this happening is slim at best.

Assuming the worst, will sticking with a small, unsuccessful startup as a part time SWE/CTO throughout college reduce my likelihood of getting these jobs as opposed to taking a few big name internships instead?

For added context, I have some research involving ML/robotics through school and a decent hackathon project on my resume as well. Additionally, I'm not sure how much equity I'll get in the current startup, if any at all.

Thanks in advance!"
12d6yrv,1,2023-04-05,Should I graduate early?,kiripeiju,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12d6yrv/should_i_graduate_early/,"Okay, here's the deal:

I'm on my way to graduate in two years from an European 3 year degree from a pretty great university. This is my first year, and I'm going to have an internship at a big company during the summer (Top five in the region, well known globally) (refer to as BC, for big company). I'd be able to do a masters degree at my local university in some 4 years easily, natural pace would be 3.5 even.

I didn't plan to graduate early. The reason for my situation is that I just wanted to learn more and more about cs, stats and mathematics, and have spent my time doing so through my uni. I don't care about networking and money either *that* much, but seem to be at a situation where I could really start working hard toward maybe setting up my own company, getting a doctorate or head abroad to work for a my current employer or a big multinational just to chase CS.

My plan is as follows:

1. Work for BC in the summer, earn a pretty nice salary and see what it's like to work with a serious R&D firm.
2. Get my bachelors while working part time for BC during my second year, while doing some masters courses too.
3. Apply to a summer internship program to Canada, work my second summer there maybe, just to see what it's like outside Europe, or work at BC.
4. Masters graduation a year or 1.5 early from my home university, or a nearby tech school. Either in Data Science or CS.

I'm going to do the courses anyway at this pace, so I'm pretty set for this direction, though maybe could be swayed; then, however, I have multiple choices:

1. Do a doctorate abroad. Just sounds like a really cool experience and I could really become an expert at something. Connecting this to the stuff I'm going to work with BC would be really great, but other topics interest me too.
2. Do a second masters degree abroad. This could be interesting because it could be an excuse to jump ship from europe to get to work for some NA firms that seem to be trailblazing in tech.
3. Work for a company, maybe BC or some other firm.
4. Set up a business. I've always been intrinsically interested in running a business, but of course I'd need to know more people for this, and networking where I am at right now is soorta *meh*. I have some ideas thought that I'd love to try executing.

How do you think my roadmap sounds? I did originally want to do my bachelors in three years, maybe go out and do an exchange year into NA, but my professor discouraged it a little bit, saying that graduating early is gonna be a big asset in research or in industry. Since then I've been thinking that there's no point doing like 60ECTS extra courses on stuff when I can learn it on my own too later on.

Is it likely I'll be accepted for a second masters / doctorate abroad when my grades are nearing 3.8 and I have graduated early + I have personal projects, industry experience, a can-do attitude and whatnot? I'd really like to try my chances at studying at a big university in NA. Does graduating early impede this?

Also do you have general ideas on what I'm saying here? Can you spot some ideas that don't hold scrutiny? Any input is *greatly* appreciated!

Thanks in advance!"

BUT my biggest tip is to make sure SOMEBODY (preferably your cracked writer friend) edits your essays. i wrote most of mine last-minute but i always made sure that i had at least one person who edited it before submitting. 

feel free to pm me if you have questions about something in particular lol

btw: i’m still deciding between harvard or upenn so lemme know your thoughts if you have any!!"
12d8san,3,2023-04-06,Is my best friend self centered? Or am I a terrible person for thinking that they are?,No_Replacement1049,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/12d8san/is_my_best_friend_self_centered_or_am_i_a/,"Hello. 

I am not sure if this is the right sub but I’ll post it here anyways since I need other opinions Plus I posted in a different sub but no one responded to me so I hope to get some advice here.

I’ve known my best friend since High School (we’re are both in our mid 20’s now) and I just finished college but having trouble finding work which has really had a terrible effect on my mental health, meanwhile my best friend is almost done with her schooling as well and is currently looking to apply for doctor schools. I am genuinely happy for them and excited that they’re working so hard to become a doctor. But my main problem is that I fear my friend has become self-centered throughout the years. They always seem to one up me and tend to question my intelligence (at least that’s how I see it…). 

When I told them that I might be developing depression due to my lack of job and my career going no where, they turn around and start telling me how their BF drop out of school because they were feeling stressed out and decided to be in the military full-time but that he’s already a millionaire because of the stocks he bought, but that they’re worried because they want an educated man in their life and that they’re trying to convince them to go back to school. They suddenly started crying saying that God hates them for giving them such terrible men in their life, completely disregarding my statement on how I might be depressed. I try to be sympathetic toward them because they’ve been through abusive and toxic relationships before and this is their first healthy relationship after a long time, so to a certain degree I understood their worries.

My best friend is very beautiful and has features many find attractive and thus is always being hit on. And like many, sometimes being hit on can be annoying, but I’ve never had the experience of someone hitting on me and every time we talk about this topic they always say the same thing “You’re so lucky no one hits on you , I wish I had your face” or “If I am like you, maybe people will leave me alone.”Basically, small insults that are hinted at my appearance. 

Now, if you’ve every had a close best friend, there will be lots of moments where you two basically share one single brain cell and I enjoy our silly acts that we do when we hang out together because I can be myself, be silly, and just act like an oddball with another oddball. I want to say I am average when it comes to intelligence, I’m no genius but I do consider myself as an intelligent person and someone who enjoys the academics. Of course, I didn’t study medicine, like my friend, who is a very intelligent person. They are proud of how much they’ve come so far and have even participated in small research projects and internships. Like stated before, I’m happy and proud of them for achieving so much, but what I’m not happy is when they start comparing my education with theirs. They’re always telling me how their parents bought them academics books, enrolled them in clubs, and taught them to play the violin. I’ve never had those opportunities, I came from a low income household and my friend is from a middle class household. But they’re always making me feel bad about my education and questioning my career choices because when I tell them about my career, they always tell my how risky it is and that it’s a terrible field to be in (it’s definitely VERY difficult to get in but not terrible, I’ve heard so many good things about it and that’s why I majored it in but now I’m struggling to find work) then they’ll say how they’ll definitely get accepted to doctor school and boasting how their professors already put in a good word for them to get accepted into their dream school. 

​Also, recently, about a week ago, they tried to get me baptized. About a year ago, my best friend has become very religious and has been involved with their church more frequently. When they found out that I wasn’t baptized, they looked at me like I was some kind of alien and then started talking about how they hope one of these days they will take me to their church to get me baptized. I felt uncomfortable at the thought since I am not religious, I’d go to church with them to accompany them when they didn’t want to go alone, but I don’t consider myself a religious person. When I told them I didn’t want to be baptized they said “you have to! I’m baptized. I’ll talk to the father and ask him how we can get you baptized” and “I’m baptized so you should be too, we have to match.”

The last straw was when they kept asking to hang out with me almost daily. I enjoy hanging out with them but they have to understand that we’re adults now with lots of responsibilities. I’m on my laptop for hours looking for open positions and working on my work portfolio to help me find work but since they are still in school, they still get breaks and has afternoon classes. They’re always calling me to spend the night at their place and go out for drinks but I keep declining because I don’t feel like hanging out when I have too much in my plate too worry. I try to tell them that I can’t because I have to work on my personal stuff but they say I can bring my laptop at their place to work on it (I never do because they always find ways to distract me from my work and I can never concentrate.)

​

This kind of irritated me a bit and it was then that I started to feel like they were starting to get self-centered.

I feel terrible for thinking this because they’ve been my best friend for years now and have never done anything to hurt me (until now with the small insults). They are genuinely a good person and is very passionate but I feel like they’ve become so self-centered and have completely ignored my issues while they look at me for help with their issues. 

I feel disgusted about my self for thinking this way about them because we’ve known each other for so long, I don’t know…. I feel like they’ve changed so much and they’re not the same person I befriended.

I’m sorry for the rant but I genuinely need help because I don’t want to loose my best friend and at this rate I fear we are separating apart because they’ve become inconsiderate of me."

as you can see, college admissions is totally random, but, **and i cannot stress this enough,** PLEASE get good grades. everyone pushes ECs on you but that does not mean you can slack on your grades. as someone who has viewed their admissions file at the university they are currently at (and works in there now), the **first** thing AOs do is see if you'll be able to succeed academically

hope that was kinda helpful and if youre like how i was when i was a junior who got their first C and thought they wouldnt get into any college, i literally got 4 by the time i graduated AND STILL gave the commencement speech at graduation"

I am graduating this May from my undergrad and excited to work on validation of SaaS product for healthcare upon graduation. I minored in CS, took decent amount of CS classes (both very low level like computer architecture, networks, and also web apps class) but most importantly have built many different projects for hackathons using modern stack: React, Django, etc. I have built basic CRUD apps from scratch (design, frontend, and backend) with Django. I have also contributed to open source through one of educational programs. However, I have never had internship nor worked for any company.

Before starting working on SaaS product, validating the idea first is something I will do. On technical side, what resources would you recommend I use that will prepare me well for building a product? What books/courses/YT videos/articles/newsletters do you recommend that will help me succeed building a software that is reliable? I am mostly concerned about making system design mistakes which is why I want to know how to build properly before I actually start building. Also, what methodologies and resources do you recommend? Agile? TDD?

For more context, I have a co-founder who codes backend on python and django / django rest. He is a junior dev like me, though.

Appreciate your time and attention!

Unfortunately sometimes we go long periods without hearing from them on the next step and recently it has been 2 weeks of me coming to do nothing at work.

I feel so demotivated to come to work lately as i mostly end up doing nothing all day and just apply for other jobs which i have not received even any callback. I feel like quitting as the 112dollars a month salary is not even worth the hustle for. I could tell my boss but she rarely even comes in as she works from home and also in the field on admin issues, and when i do she ends up handing us her tasks non-project related. I need the experience in project management as this will be vital for my cv. But then again i feel like quitting. What advice can you give to help me manouver around this situation?"

Then, my partner had a super stressful phase where he had a BIG problem and almost wasn't able to finish what he worked for so hard. This somehow first canceled out my depression, and I was able to do household chores for HIM, rather than failing to do them at all beacuse i just *should* do them. And when the big problem occured, it also canceled out my anxiety - I was able to just look into where I could apply. That was enough to kickstart me pushing myself further and further into the topic. 

Went through the whole process, and right now I've finally sent the mail. Don't get me wrong, I was scared the entire time, and I'm scared right now. I am completely on edge, anxious, and terrified of the social interactions and expectations to come.

But the thing is, I STILL did it. I'm scared, and I STILL managed to search for places, write stuff up, and send it, with feeling anxious the entire time. I just trusted my hands to continue doing what they were doing, just... kind of letting it continue? I've had the thought in my head of ""No matter what I feel or think, my hands can still move and they can finish the things without me feeling secure"".

No matter what happens next, things will go on. And even when I'm scared the entire time, I can trust my feet to continue walking. And honestly, even when I get rejected - I will be devastated, but it'll still have been a great success and a learning experience. 

Things will go on."

I'd like to learn more about Applied Math at UC Berkeley from a student perspective. Any responses to the following questions would be much appreciated. Thank you!

&#x200B;

* It seems that access to upper-division CS classes as an L&S Applied Math major with a CS cluster is limited to the [summer quarter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lOLj0gJa7QcA_QL6D3lXmwk_lvF41JcapbcEu_Tduvg/edit#). If CS upper divs are not available, what are common alternatives that Applied Math majors take? 
* Does taking summer courses ever interfere with other activities (internships, jobs, etc.)? 
* What are industry prospects for Applied Math majors? Do Applied Math majors commonly supplement their experiences with CS-specific activities to gain access to software internships and jobs? If so, what do these activities look like?
* Have there been any moments where being an Applied Math major was advantageous, such as in technical upper division CS courses or in the industry (e.g., during a technical job or internship)? Have there been any moments where being an Applied Math major was a hindrance? 
* Has the Berkeley “network” helped you inside or outside the university? How so? 
* Is it common for Applied Math majors to pursue a graduate degree in an adjacent field, such as data science or CS? 
* Why did you choose Berkeley Applied Math over your other options? (Applies to schools where you had a different major as well)  
* What would you say is the single greatest advantage Berkeley has provided that your other options could not?
* Do you have any regrets, recommendations, etc.?"

I was pre-med before, but I wasn't passionate about it (it was really just my dad forcing me), but I love coding and can see myself going down this career path unlike pre med.  At the moment I'm a sophomore and wasn't able to take any computer science classes this semester because they were all full. I was wondering if its a bad thing to take another year to graduate. I can finish all my classes in the next two years if I take summer courses and some over winter break, but I wanted to also try getting an internship for next summer.  So should I take another year so I can possibly do more than one internship or should I just graduate.  And I also wanted to know if there are any activities  I can do over this summer that I can put on my resume and help me strengthen my coding skills.  Any advice is really appreciated all my family members and friends are doctors or pre med, So I only have discord and reddit for advice about this . 

I want to go into Software engineering,  forgot to mention that. 

also wanted to mention the university I go to doesn't have the best computer science program. I don't know it that factors in or not. 

Thank you"

In these 8 months I worked on fair bit of projects, developed a number of trainings, trained three interns in using the software from 0 experience, currently trying to validate a new software, and I am also writing crap for the company's social media.

I am a junior design engineer. I finished university not even one year ago. It honestly feels like I shouldn't have this much crap piled on me so soon. I have colleagues on the same position as me who arrived before me and still do trainings.

Is it normal to pile so much bullshit on a new hire?? I am insanely tired already, especially seeing how in a lot of cases my opinion is next to irrelevant. In the designs I do, my proven opinion is disregarded. In my social media posts my experience as a freelance content writer is disregarded by my manager who barely talks in English while also taking the credit for my content, even if he's the one who wants those written in the first place.


I started to feel incredibly resentful every time I wake up and go to work. I started to be incredibly angry each time my manager or a project engineer calls me to do some other bullshit I 100% do not agree with.

I wrote some pros and cons for both schools, and I would love some input since I am stuck. 

UIUC: 

pros

* Went here for undergrad in Physics/Math, so I am pretty familiar with the campus and environment
* Pretty flexible curriculum, so I can tailor it to what I want to learn
* Good research opportunities. I'm not sure if I want to do research or go into industry after my degree, so opportunities for the former is nice
* Inclusive atmosphere, which I really appreciate given my disability background

cons

* While I am familiar with the environment since I went here for undergrad, I am definitely more of a city person
* Location is pretty bad for getting an internship if I decide to go that route. It's in a cornfield

&#x200B;

Columbia:

pros:

* Located in NYC. I grew up in a city, so I thrive in that atmosphere. Also, there's more things to do
* Location is also great with obtaining internships if I decide to go that route
* Specialization options allow me to choose my own path
* I appreciate the opportunities in the PDL. They have a lot of opportunities for professional/academic growth

cons:

* COL/Cost of Attendance is a bit higher than UIUC's. I'm planning on applying for a bunch of fellowships (got a 12k one, but definitely applying for more), but this is something I need to think about
* Newer environment. While I am open to new experiences, I am definitely less familiar about Columbia and don't know as much about it as UIUC

&#x200B;

If anyone can provide input, I'd greatly appreciate it. Note that I have friends in both locations, so I didn't include that in the pros/cons. Please feel free to share your thoughts as well. Thank you so much!

I’m lost,Wesnye,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/12dp7oe/bs_psychology_potential_career_change_im_lost/,"I'm (26 M) needing help with potential career paths to pursue. I’m currently trying to get a job save up some money to move and potentially pursue a different career, but I have no idea what I like or am interested in. It has been this way since I initially considered my future in Middle School. 

I went to college on a whim and after graduation got a job as a temporary crisis counselor/community resource specialist for the state's Behavioral Health department. I hated this job since it was COVID related and I had to cold call thousands of organizations in conservative Idaho. A largely WFH position.

I’ve developed decent public speaking skills (albeit introverted), I’ve been told by career guidance counselors that I’d be good in sales, I have substantial empathy and can read most people like a book, but I don’t want to be sucked into an office all day getting second hand trauma from clients and I don’t want to work 60-70 hr weeks in sales in order to make 45k+ (my ideal minimum salary - was my salary for temp job and can’t imagine going lower). 

I worked as a Research Assistant and had an internship for the state’s Behavioral Health department, 4.0 gpa, and President of the Psychology Club nearly the whole time I was there. I have used Microsoft Office tools extensively, can type 90 wpm accurately, and am pretty good with computers. It seems computers and people are my specialty.

I was so burnt out after my temp job was over I took nearly two years off and I feel like I might have made a mistake. I was working 3 jobs during school and 2 after graduation. My days were typically 16-18 hrs a day 7 days a week while going to school, then 10 hr days 6 days a week between my temp job/other admin assistant job for a counseling office I maintained during and after college, where I facilitated supervised visitations (hated it), did billing (it was fine), and general office work (fine but boring). I’m so nervous to even interview anywhere because of the gap in work history. 

Im open to a career change, I just need ideas. I’m a very motivated person and go all in on something I’m interested in. I feel as hopeless as I did 14 years ago. I have enough money to last a few more months so I could also get certified in something. I know no one knows me better than myself, but maybe conversation could ignite something in me"
12dp86w,32,2023-04-06,Troubleshooting your resume if your job/internship search is going nowhere,LASCareerServices,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/12dp86w/troubleshooting_your_resume_if_your_jobinternship/,"It's that time of year when students start seeking help from LAS Career Services because they've sent out a lot of internship/job applications and they're not getting any responses.

**I don't know for sure that the advice below will fix everything.** We rarely hear back from students about whether our advice made a difference. And students who have success with the ""make one resume, send it everywhere"" shotgun approach don't come to talk to us.

**What I do know:** we see a lot of students with resumes that don't tell employers what they want to know. Below are some of the things I routinely see in appointments and encourage students to change:

1. **A resume that is heavy on academic accomplishments and accolades, light on things that demonstrate your skills.** The point that you're studying a relevant major at a prestigious institution is pretty easily made: two lines under ""education"" at the top of your resume cover it. So is the point that you may be really good at going to school: include a GPA that either meets an employer's stated threshold OR is high enough to be a selling point. Bad GPA? Leave it off. Plenty of employers don't ask and genuinely don't care. Dean's List, scholarships, prizes, and the like are terrific things to have earned but they don't communicate anything about you that the GPA itself doesn't cover. Moreover, the more space those things occupy on the resume, the more invested you seem to be in your identity as a student, rather than in becoming a working professional.
2. **A resume that names roles/positions but says nothing about what you accomplished or what value you added.** Use bullet points to name the skills relevant to that job that you used in your various experiences. Resist the urge to write a job description or explain what anyone in the role is expected to do. Try to make it about why that organization/company was better off because YOU were in that role. It can be hard to do for menial/service jobs, but [try anyway](http://careerservices.illinois.edu/your-experiences/)\-- and go ahead and include those experiences on your resume if you have them! Employers want people with a strong work ethic who know how to communicate with other people, even if you've demonstrated those skills from behind a cash register or while power-washing garage doors. And if all you did for a club was show up to meetings, your involvement may not be worth the space it takes on your resume.
3. **A summary statement/objective/""About me"" at the top of the page.** These short summaries are vital for mid-career professionals with a lengthy job history. For people pursuing entry-level jobs with the recommended one-page resume, they usually sound like hogwash and take up space that can be better used to spell out your skills.
4. **A resume that buries the lede.** Employers are interested in what you've done that's relevant to the skills they need. Whatever that relevant stuff is should be at the top of your resume, whether it was an unpaid volunteer opportunity, a food service job, a significant leadership role in your RSO, or a project you did. Obviously, it's great to already have had a directly relevant internship or research experience within that specific industry, but most people don't. So think broadly and creatively about what you HAVE done that speaks to that employer's needs. You may need to play with your resume headers in order to place the most relevant experience at the top while maintaining reverse chronological order, but that's okay. If your resume hasn't been getting traction, it's worth at least trying an unconventional approach. Yes, you may end up submitting different resumes for different jobs. That's okay, too. It's a marketing document, not a really big business card.
5. **A resume with an eye-catching template pulled from the internet.** Unless you're applying for jobs that require strong graphic design skills, a simple, boring straightforward resume format is the way to go -- and if you ARE trying to promote your graphic design skills, you should be designing your own. Chances are, the first readers of your resume are going to be an applicant tracking systems, and they have trouble digesting the formatting that goes into a visually elaborate resume. Also, many of those templates sacrifice relevant substance to white space, icons, and elegant design choices.
6. **A resume that passed inspection from a roommate, parent, friend-who-already-got-a-great-internship, landlord, boo, but has NOT been reviewed by either a career services professional on campus OR someone working in the field you're targeting.** By all means, get a lot of eyes on your resume (that's a great way to eliminate mortifying typos!), but make sure at least some of those eyes belong to people who are up-to-date on current resume practices or who are familiar with the norms of the field you want to go into. (Asking for feedback on your resume is a great way to network.)

Currently I have UCLA (70k/yr), UVA (60k/yr), and Fordham Gabelli (25k/yr with full merit tuition Recognition Scholars) as my options.

At UCLA I have been admitted as a pre math/econ major but I can consider switching to business econ as well. At UVA I have been admitted as an econ major looking into the McIntire program for my third/fourth year. At Fordham Gabelli, I have been admitted as an applied accounting and finance major.

I wanted to seek some advice as to which college would be better after graduation, with specific questions such as:

1. Is it worth the price tag to go to a school like UCLA or UVA---does it give any significant competitive advantage? Or should I go to Fordham as a cheaper option instead?
2. In terms of college fit, I greatly like UCLA, but would going to UVA for the McIntire program be better for a career in finance?
3. How much does location matter, since these three schools are in pretty distinctly different locations?
4. How easy/difficult would it be to earn internships in these schools, with all factors considered (name brand, location, etc)?
5. Which school is better if I were to pursue law school?

I would appreciate any and all advice on which college I should choose; I am confident that no matter where I end up I will work hard, maintain a competitive GPA, and network, but with all that aside if it is worth going to a more expensive school to get a headstart in my career, I believe that it is an investment that is potentially worth making.

In mid-2022 I started applying for jobs and was getting an okay responses, landed a few interviews but did not land a job. Then applied for a Shopify internship but got rejected at the last stage, don't know if it was because of layoffs or just the interview (as is it did not go great). In late 2022 I did about 5 rounds if interviews with this company and every interview feedback was great, the last interview was with a top guy of the department and was told that it is more of an introductory call so that he can know me better before hiring but he did not show up and sent the manager who already did one round of interview with me, still it went great. Few days after I got a call and was told I am not selected without any reasoning. It was not even an SWD job, it was for the support department but I was gonna work somewhat closely with developers so they tested my javascript skills and all.  


After that I did not apply or learned anything until now, it is a depressing time. I am afraid that I wasted 2 years. My present job is not well paying and is depressing, I just turned 24 and have no idea what to do.

My conundrum is that the role that I have this summer would not naturally lead towards the area of finance that I am interested in. I'm not super knowledgeable about the space, but would it be safe to assume that no PE or Infra Fund dedicated to the energy transition would hire me right out of undergrad? and would I need a like IB role first?

I recognize that junior year spring might be a bit late to the game, but I would appreciate any advice. 

Thanks!"

Should be good considering in 9th and 10th grade I got to skip grades for Math and did very well in the higher grade math classes as well

Do I have a shot at top CS schools (specifically, MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Caltech, UC Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon)?  
I know how cutthroat the competition is for internationals, thats why I want to know whether I should even bother because schools like MIT (my top choice) have <1% acceptance rates for internationals. So do I have any sort of reasonable chance?"

Right now I'm thinking for next semester cmsc420, cmsc335 and prob a STIC class. My thought process is I wanna take it easier while I apply and prep for internships in the fall.

Remote, Canada, Austin, TX
Coder is looking for a senior software engineer to join our growing team. We are dedicated to keeping developers in flow — removing the obstacles that prevent them from writing code at the speed of thought. We have amazing core technology and are always striving to make it better. Keep reading if you are as passionate about developer workflows and open-source software as we are.

You will work with Golang, Kubernetes, Typescript, React, and many advanced technologies to build the cloud developer workspace of the future.

About you

    You’ve worked as a software engineer for at least five years (including relevant internships)

    You're skilled in languages and technologies for systems-level engineering, e.g. C/C++, Rust, and Golang (especially but not necessarily). You are skilled in front-end technologies such as Typescript or React.

    You care deeply about your craft. We build to last. Our customers deploy our software on-premises, so we want to make sure we get things right the first time. And we’re going to build a SaaS product, so automated testing will be essential for continuous delivery.

    You want to work in a startup where your job isn’t just writing code but helping make the whole company successful

    You want to have a major impact and grow as a professional in an opportunity-rich, supportive environment

While not necessary, we’ll be even more excited if you have:

    Know the Go programming language

    Have worked on enterprise applications, developer tools, or on-premises software

    Like connecting directly with customers

    Have experience with infrastructure technologies like Kubernetes, Nomad, and EC2

Interview Process

We believe that the interview process should be consistent and enjoyable. We prefer the entire process to take no more than two full weeks. During these two weeks, you will be able to meet a mix of individual contributors, managers, and one of our Co-Founders. If you interview for a position requiring a take-home assessment, we will compensate you for your work and time. 

Our Values
Harness Your Inner Geek 🤓

Be who you are, use your unique talents to solve the problems you see, shout out your colleagues’ contributions and abilities, and be transparent and driven about what motivates you to do your best work here at Coder.

Be Bold and Show Your Work 💥

We’re going to fail sometimes, and that’s how we get better. Risks are a path to innovation, so we value bold, informed, fast-paced experimentation. And we also want you to communicate when it works – or when it doesn’t – so that we all can learn from each other.

Take Action with Ownership 🤝

Don’t wait for someone to give you permission to get things done. At Coder, we find leverage quickly and generate outcomes while staying lean. We don’t want you to “stay in your lane” - we want you to get curious, go after problems, and ship smart solutions together with your teammates. If you pick something up, take it to the finish line.

Don’t F$#k Your Team 🏆

We love what we do and work to achieve success together. We all win when we pitch in. We have fun and keep our goal in mind: to build a product that solves our users’ problems better than anything else. That means we jump in to help, make time for our teammates, and share our ideas so everyone can benefit.

Have Empathy for Our Users 🌏

We’re an open-core company, and we value user input, intensive collaboration, and empathy for our customers — from the biggest enterprises to the individual developers using our product to code faster and with less friction.

We are an Equal Opportunity Employer

All qualified applicants will receive consideration without discrimination because of sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, marital status, race, color, age, national origin, military status, religion, or disability or any other legally protected status.

**Additional Information:**

CS is way harder than I thought before this college season, so to those that are applying in the future, keep this in mind. I think one of my biggest issues was my essays (I spent a lot of time on it, but as mentioned above, I just don't feel like my voice was shining through). Another aspect was probably my awards and ecs as they could be better for the reach schools that I was applying for. I am grateful for my results, but I think I set my expectations a bit too high, so I am a little disappointed. Also, I think it's partially because I have been alone throughout the entire process so my hard work didn't really pay off the way I expected it to. However, I don't regret picking CS as I genuinely love programming, but I am just a bit sad about my results."

There's lots of blog posts as well as paywalled websites on the subject of IT internships; I was hoping to get feedback from guys and gals in the trenches. I've been sysadminning for decades but have only been at the director level for a short time.

Looking for feedback on the good and bad of programs others have administered or participated in."

*List all extracurricular involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc.*

1. Leader in my cultural nonprofit for all 4 years basically. Idk if it's my most impressive EC but I wrote my common app on said culture and why this volunteering is so important so felt fitting to place it on top.
2. Published over 80 articles for a growing sports media company. Made video content that garnered thousands of YT views as well for them. I had some credentials (AP Research paper was sports-related) which landed me an internship w them in the summer before my JR year. Boss liked me and kept me around and I still work for him.  
3. Captain of Congress Debate Team, pretty self explanatory, won some awards and talked about recruiting+teaching the younger ones about debate. Was a member all 4 years
4. Captain of Varsity soccer team (12) that was one of the best teams in the state, talked about some of our team bonding that I organized and our accomplishments. Played all 4 years 
5. Research with a sports management professor, was virtual and only started the summer before senior year so I put it at 5
6. NHS President, again pretty self explanatory, organized the volunteering events n stuff
7. Personal TikTok account related to sports, grew to about 5K followers, over 3 million views and 400k likes
8. Work as a math instructor at local franchise, (not kumon...) 11th and 12 grade
9. 2 year member of varsity basketball team, no leadership position or anything but still a hell of a time and effort commitment
10. Cultural club, this was just kinda filler icl

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.* 

Nothing crazy here to look at

1. National Merit Semi-Finalist
2. IHSA State finalist Debater 
3. AP Scholar with distinction 
4. Champions of most elite soccer tournament in our state my senior year
5. Illinois State Scholar (no clue how prestigious this is tbh)

**Letters of Recommendation**

Calc teacher & Soccer coach: Read his and I think it was a 7.5/10, Got a C and a B in his class so was kinda surprised he only said good things abt me as a student. Had a lot of good things to say about me as a leader and player though. 

English Teacher: Did not show me so I'm going to guess an 8/10 because we had a decently close relationship and he's a great writer. Complete guess though

CEO of sports media company: 9/10, I read his and it was pretty in-depth and showed the impact I had at his company. 

**Interviews**

Thought it went well bc we got kicked out of starbs when it closed and our time was up but he called me into the lobby of his apartment building to continue for another 15-20 mins. Felt like a legit convo most of the time so that was good and we bonded over food lol. 

**Essays**

My PS was pretty good I think. I spent all summer crafting it, had about 10 different people I trust look at it and in the end was super consise but emotional. Was about the history of my minority group and thus why i volunteer in cultural org to keep my heritage alive and pass it on.  

My WHY NU was solid, had a little flare/personality, but mainly just very specific about what I wanted to do there academically and extracurricular wise. 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Northwestern University (ED)

&#x200B;

* **Additional Information:**

I've been reading these for years and it just feels really cool to finally post my own. Anyways, knowing I was in an extremely competitive demographic gunning for a popular major, I used sports, and not just playing them, to craft my own unique application that would help me stand out. The spikes in my app were defo leadership and sports. Also goes to show if you have the other components, and show improvement with your grades, one bad grade won't be the end all be all. Good luck to all you future applicants!!"

Going into university, I was set on MechE because I enjoyed high school physics, CAD, cars, etc. I heard about the computer engineering program that offers a dual degree in electrical by only taking a few extra classes. I do find computer hardware and coding interesting, however I have virtually no experience with coding and circuits other than a MATLAB class I have taken this year. With the direction the world is moving technologically (and the salary being a plus), it makes sense to me that getting those two degrees would be a good option, however I don't think I'm ready to give up on MechE entirely. I will be joining my school's FSAE team next semester. In terms of securing an internship while in school or even a job after graduating, would it be helpful to have the mechanical background from FSAE while still majoring in computer and electrical engineering? Is the diverse experience a good thing or will most companies look for someone who is specialized one way or the other? I am certainly not opposed to mechatronics which is a great combination of all three, but I would still like to keep my options open as much as possible without diversifying too much.

**TL;DR** Is the versatility of experience with studying computer and electrical engineering, while getting mechanical experience from FSAE beneficial when searching for a job, or will employers in either field be looking more for someone who is fully committed to one or the other?"

12e6o58,9,2023-04-06,SMU CS vs SUTD CS,RenzenBro,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/12e6o58/smu_cs_vs_sutd_cs/,"Hi guys, so I know this question has been asked on the subreddit before but I am still confused.

I received offers from both these unis and am waiting on the others still. For SUTD, I received the global merit scholarship which covers almost my entire tuition but I still have to pay some of it since I am PR. Meanwhile, in SMU I have to pay full fees for PR which is more than two times as expensive (might receive a scholarship interview in the future but no luck yet). However, my parents can fortunately afford it and said that I should pick the offer which is better for my future. I am very inclined on SMU right now because both of these unis are pretty similar in terms of learning style and both have much smaller class sizes and more groupwork than NUS/NTU. However, I think SMU enjoys the reputation of being one of the big 3 in sg which makes you much more employable for internships and jobs in the future. Like I read somewhere that SUTD CS has only produced a handful of grads in top American tech companies, but SMU has been doing so every year from it's IS course and also from their pioneer CS batch which is graduating this year. I'm still unsure of all these info though. Also, another disadvantage of SUTD is that in the first year I have to do general stuff and can't focus on CS. The only advantages I can think of is a slightly smaller faculty to student ratio and the fact that their might be a hall culture there, but I don't really care about that.

Do any seniors who have studied in these unis or have received offers from them help me make my final decision and whether SMU is worth it?"

I’m currently a CPC intern on the cusp of licensure- waiting in my testing score to return and hours approximately near completion within the year. 

I’ve struggled significantly with documentation from the jump. I fortunately was finally given an ADHD diagnoses and medication, which helped but has been unfortunately sub-therapeutic, allowing for really horrid work habits to develop and take deep root. 
Then let’s just lop on managing Bipolar DX, leaning primarily towards depression, as well as poor physical health due to an autoimmune condition, and we’ve found ourselves the perfect storm. 

I’m completely accountable for my fuckup. I don’t want these to come across as excuses. I should have asked for help, regardless of my absent on-site supervisor. 

My documentation has been spotty since around fall, with episodes of consistency and lack thereof, which has accumulated to missing a large number of progress notes. Tack on having a previous issue with my laptop taking a dump and losing a large amount of documents (which was resolved), and I’m now facing a report to my state board. 

I turned in my resignation prior to learning I would have a complaint filed against me, and have a plan designed to complete all missing documentation prior to my departure in a month. 

Has anyone out there had a similar experience? What kind of disciplinary actions could I be facing? What kind of impact may this have on my ability to remain in this field, nonetheless make a living?"

Recently I recieved and accepted an offer to work as an intern for a year at a well respected high performing games company. Because of this I've lost all motivation in my university degree and want to drop out as I see no point anymore.
For context - The degree is a programming degree in the UK specifically focused on games/graphics programming of which is a 4 year course. And fees here are £9k a year for uni

Currently on my 3rd year, usually I would take a year out to complete the internship then finish my degree but I don't really see the point of the modules or getting the shiny certificate and would rather study what interests me in programming. So I've got a few questions. 


- How weighted are degrees in the hiring process once a candidate has professional experience? 

- Would it be looked down upon that I just dropped out despite having overall decent grades till this semester due to no motivation? 


I think my post is stemming from anxiety of wanting to drop out and the stigma behind it, but any logical insight into it will be really helpful :)"

I have the  priviledge to work from home 4 days a week, but I still live far from  university and spent a lot of time in public transportation to get  there, it's not good so I'm always tired there and can't concentrate to  study in the train or the bus.

Class  finishes very late in the night and I can only get home after midnight,  and I go straight to bed. I hardly find time to study anything and I  see my colleagues at work and university doing so much fun and complex  stuff, building cool projects and I can barely do one of those because I  don't have time.

I study on the weekends but for getting where I want to be I would need to study everyday.

This  feeling is destroying my mental health and there's not one day I don't  feel useless, dumb, lazy or worse. I compare myself all the time with  everyone I know and I don't know how to stop or feel better"

Letters of Recommendation:

I submitted letters from my math teacher, Spanish teacher, and volunteer manager I worked closely with. I was very close to the volunteer manager and less close to my teachers at school but worked closely with my math teacher and showed lots of dedication and passion to the subject in Spanish class so they should be very strong as all my teachers are absolutely wonderful and were rooting for me! I can’t rate them, I’m not sure what I’d give them. I do want to say I gave them each specific, distinct points I wanted highlighted to build my application arc so my letters were a good representation of a variety of my interests, personality, and goals. I made sure to let them know to emphasize my community spirit and intellectual curiosity.

Interviews:

Yale: 7/10. My interviewer went to Yale a long time ago and we didn’t really connect + it was virtual.

Georgetown: 8/10. We had totally different interests but had a good conversation which lasted an hour.

Harvard: 10/10. At the time, I didn’t think I made a particularly good impression on my interviewer, but looking back, it was very strong. We talked for an hour, I talked a lot about my experiences volunteering and how I would pursue my interests at Harvard. 

Duke: 8/10. Strong interview, but also virtual so not super amazing.

I never got a Penn interview and was terrified that was an instant reject since they claim to interview 90% of applicants.

Essays:

Personal Statement: One of my favorite pieces of writing to date, but I am a super procrastinator. I started it in in mid-October, submitted my crappy version to my early schools, then refined it a bit in December. Used u/scholargrade review services and this really helped so highly recommend.

Supplementals: DON’T BE LIKE ME. I started most of my supps a couple days before they were due. My Harvard supp was started 11pm the night it was due. My essays weren’t incredibly unique, but they painted a clear arc of my unique academic interests, my community involvement, and how I would further it. Overall, my application essays were very cohesive and focused on advocacy and my love of Spanish/Latin American studies which played a big role in my results.

Additional Information:

I am so grateful for my acceptances in such a difficult application year and am very much in shock. I’m not sure where I will commit since all the private schools are very expensive. My school never sends kids to top schools so it was difficult finding tips to apply to them. All of my strategies were found on A2C; I think the biggest thing that helps is having a spike and clear goals in my chosen academic field. I love advocacy and helping others and I think that really shined in my application. Definitely highlight your passions in a clear way and allow colleges to imagine your contributions to campus. I received notes from my Harvard and Penn AOs telling me they were impressed by my community contributions/advocacy and unique interests/dedication to them. Feel free to ask any questions!"

Just received my CS degree, and I've been having trouble getting my first job in the industry. As I was unable to find an internship throughout my time in college, pressure is now beginning to build. Despite sending out more than 200 applications, I have had no luck. Most just don't reply or reject the next day, for reference it's been on week.

I'm reaching out in hopes of receiving some guidance, pointers, or even just words of encouragement because I know there are many success stories and smart individuals here. Here is a brief description of my circumstance:   

earned a BA in computer science. I haven't done any internships, but I have completed a few personal projects (a basic web app, socket programming, api project with discord and nodejs) Have experience with Java, Python, JavaScript, and a few popular frameworks Have a GitHub with code samples and well-documented projects Sent out 200+ applications, with tailored cover letters and resumes planning to start my LeetCode grind again, as I did some LeetCode back when applying for internships last year during junior year, but still struggle with some interviews. My questions for you all:  

How important is having an internship when it comes to finding a job as a fresh grad? Is my lack of internship experience a significant barrier? What can I do to improve my chances of getting interviews and ultimately landing a job? Should I focus on improving my skills, building more projects, or networking? How can I stay motivated and keep my spirits up during this challenging job search? Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated! Please share your own experiences, advice, or success stories in the comments below. This community has always been a great resource, and I'm excited to learn from your collective wisdom. Thanks in advance! 

 P.S. If you find my story relatable, consider upvoting this post for visibility. I'm sure there are others in a similar boat who could benefit from the advice shared here."

A little bit of background, I’m an intern on a fundamental fixed income portfolio management team, which deals on a daily basis with rather large data files of statistics of our holdings and our indices’ constituents. To this point, we’re quite traditional and only work out of Excel, which in terms of speed, is reaching its limits when it comes to refreshing our monitoring tools. I’m hoping to branch out and find a better solution to leave my mark (and get a longer term offer?), but there aren’t many resources out there that merge data analysis with portfolio management.

Any advice? Thanks in advance."

I'll be 24 in June, and I live in Toledo, Ohio.

Like many others, I was compelled to matriculate immediately after high school, and without a rock-solid idea of what I wanted to do. I felt myself torn between the medical field for its predictability and relatively high pay, or generally angling for work in foreign policy/national defense, topics which fascinate me. With nothing but encouragement from my family, I packed a Political Science degree with writing capstones and topical classes on national and international policy and current events; tried to take a Washington Center internship as my final semester in Spring 2021 (graduated with a 3.93). This was at the height of COVID, and the experience was downgraded to remote work. While I did have the opportunity to lead a small peer team on a project, my work largely consisted of interest area research and the filming of a few short videos detailing it. I had decent extracurriculars and was involved in the student government and a political party's club board; did some canvassing for a few local political figures during election seasons. 

Since June 2021, I've been working as a (now certified) pharmacy technician, although I did briefly secure gainful employment as a field organizer for an Ohio political party, their demands suddenly changed and soon outstripped my ability to travel and it was essentially a ""gig-job"" with no real stability, to say nothing of my complete dislike and lack of skill at the work. The middle and latter half of 2022 were wracked by family tragedies and difficult financial situations, which when taken together with unsuccessful applications/interviews with places like Epic Systems (A Political Project Management) and Medpace (Entry-level Contracting), have put me into a profound sense of defeatism and lack of any real progress in finding any form of gainful employment. I suppose I'm looking for any advice from anyone who has found themselves in a similar situation, and how they got out of it/into an originally unexpected line of work. My current thoughts are:

\-The obvious immediate answer is to go to school for a Master's degree. The Ford school is right up the road in Ann Arbor, but I have no idea how I'd finance it. The one thing I did right in undergraduate was get a ""full ride"", and while it might be good for networking and specializing research, I fear I'd wind up in the same position I am in now in a few years.

\-Keep trying to shuffle off into Office Space somehow, like I was trying to do with Medpace. Cubicle, a clip-on tie, and 50K forever.

\-Attempt certifications for supply chain work (my international relations/policy studies would mesh well there) or something like marketing or Salesforce (a friend of mine was talking to me about going through HubSpot for the former late last year, and I've foolishly let it drift away).

\-I have a contact who is a DEA agent, who is doing me a favor and trying to put me in touch with someone in DEA intelligence, which sounds like a more stimulating/in-line field for me. 

\-Keep trying for a position with Epic and/or try to learn IT, software, cybersecurity, etc.

TL;DR: Now-useless degree, menial job, seeking a way out. No debt beyond a car payment.

Happy Easter, everyone."

Now here I am in the us in college it’s my first semester, once again I don’t feel im learning new things, I’m taking math class , and the first programming class , and I already know all the programming fundamentals I even know about data structures and algorithms so im really not learning new stuff.

I feel like I’m stuck , and I don’t even really like math , I haven’t get an on campus job yet, I can only work on campus for now because of my visa status , and don’t like studying , I feeel like I’m done with studies I could just use all this time to learn the really useful things by myself , but if I drop out of college I would go back to Honduras , and I have nothing there , there are no opportunities in Honduras , my hope is that after I graduate I can get a job here and get a work visa ,  but I really don’t like studying or at least studying in college , but it’s my only option.

I just want to get a job and be able to work here , I don’t even have friends here , I’m in a Mormon town in Utah , and people is very kind here but they don’t wanna be your friends , there are other Latin Americans here but I feel like people just don’t like me , I have something that pushes people away from me , I’m also very shy so it’s hard to me to talk to people , I know some people would kill to have this opportunity to study here in the US,  but I really don’t have the motivation to do this , I do really enjoy the programming class , even though I know most of the things I enjoy the assignments and I like to challenge myself in those , but I don’t like the other classes. 

Sometimes I think like screw everything im just gonna go work illegally here and try to make a life . I don’t know what to do , maybe I should just kill myself .

Ranking: NEU is 34 on USNews, SBU 43 and NCSU 49  but this is suspicious because for the last few years it was 50 and SBU was 40 and NEU 49. 

Cost: Both NCSU and NEU have high tuition. Both SBU and NEU have single cost of living while NCSU is considerably lower. Basically NCSU ~ SBU < NEU

Career opportunities: All three are in decent locations. NCSU has the research triangle park, NEU is in Boston and SBU is close to NYC. 

Courses: My plan for master's was to focus on distributed computing, parallel architectures and a bit of AI. All three have decent courses in the first two but NCSU's AI class which gates access to other AI classes seems... Bad? I may be wrong here though.

Internships and co-ops: NEU wins here as they allow full time co-ops. NCSU allows you to work on a part-time co-op after your summer interships. Stony Brook is very stingy with part time co-ops and only allows those if you have like 1 course that semester.

Hi everyone!

# Who I am

I am a young computer engineer who is finishing a master's degree in artificial intelligence. I’m currently working on my master’s thesis, which is a machine learning project to be developed during an internship. I took several courses about machine learning during this master’s degree and I fell confident about the theory seen at lesson, but I felt a lack of practice. That’s the first reason why I chose to do an internship for the thesis, to cover the “lack” of practice. The second reason is that I have almost finished my university career and I am undecided on what to specialize in for my working career between software engineering and machine learning, which were my favorite subjects during university. I have already had a few opportunities to get close to software engineering, and I also wanted to ""taste"" something about machine learning as well, in order to make a well thought-out decision.

# What my goal is for this post

My purpose for this post is to share with you the project I am working on, how I approach each phase and what kind of challenges I will encounter. I’d like to discuss with you about my approaches and I’d like to hear your insights, your suggestions and your recommendations about technologies, libraries, good-practices and so on. In particular I would like you to correct me, since my main purpose for this post is to learn as much as possible, as well as to do a valuable work for the company.

# The project

The project’s goal is to make a machine learning model for bot and applications detection. In other words, we want to make a model that can distinguish programmatic traffic from non-programmatic traffic. Our dataset are traffic logs collected by a WAAP (a sort of firewall). I was given a roadmap to guide me during development:

1- Identify sessions from our logs by an algorithm that evaluates things like temporal proximity, ip of the client, user agent, cookie.

2- Evaluate the goodness of the algorithm through graphs and data.

3- create a dataset of surely programmatic sessions (e.g., user-agent curl, java, python etc.)

4- Train and evaluate the goodness of the model.

*Further developments*:

1- Identify possible groups of programmatic sessions (e.g., bots that exfiltrate data, by bots that make attempts at XSS attacks, SQL Injection, by bots that make DDOS attacks, by bots like Googlebot)

2- Grouping programmatic sessions and finding the semantics of the groups found

# State of works

In this section I’m going to update the state of works.

**Step 0 - 1**  
I’m currently between the step 0 of the roadmap (my step 0 is understanding the dataset, analyzing the header and so on) and the step 1.  
I’m trying to understand which kind of data are collected in our logs, what they represent, how i can group them in sessions and which features will be useful for the model.  
At this [link](https://early-pudding-225.notion.site/db53d111d75d428ba62ceaadf5ba012c?v=4f5967f458794d199a255fc5bbf84512) you can find my first analysis, where I’m focusing mainly on two things (besides understanding the data):

1- If this particular data is useful to make a **session**

2- If this particular data is somehow **meaningful** for our model.

Yet at this point I’d like to hear your insights, like if this kind of analysis is in the right direction, or if i should deepen something before I start looking at the data, or if I simply missed something in my analysis.

I can’t share with you a sample of the dataset because the data itself are confidential, but in [my table](https://early-pudding-225.notion.site/db53d111d75d428ba62ceaadf5ba012c?v=4f5967f458794d199a255fc5bbf84512) you can find the header of the dataset in the first column and an example of the value under the “example” column. I edited the values in this column to make them fictitious but keeping the right syntax.

Thanks to anyone who has read this far and to anyone who wants to contribute by helping me with suggestions, insights, and criticism."

I am looking at a course on Bioconductor (R) at the moment, but i wonder if it will still be relevant in a few years.I see courses on bioinformatics and AI, is it a road i should take as well ?

&#x200B;

So if you have any advice on intersting paths for the future, it would help me a lot to know that i am not wasting learning hours on a platform which could become obsolete soon.

A little bit of background, I’m an intern on a fundamental fixed income portfolio management team, which deals on a daily basis with rather large data files of statistics of our holdings and our indices’ constituents. To this point, we’re quite traditional and only work out of Excel, which in terms of speed, is reaching its limits when it comes to refreshing our monitoring tools. I’m hoping to branch out and find a better solution to leave my mark (and get a longer term offer?), but there aren’t many resources out there that merge data analysis with portfolio management.

Any advice? Thanks in advance."

I chose not to apply for any internships during my Master's program so I could concentrate on my studies, but in retrospect, that may have been a mistake. My concern is whether I should include those three internship experiences on my resume, as having a gap of three years in my work experience might not look favorable to potential employers. I wonder if this could be the reason why I have received only a few interview invitations out of 300 job applications."

I’m currently stuck between PACE and ASU and will be majoring in computer science. 


I like both of them equally, PACE a bit more because it’s in New York and I lived there for 6 years and have tons of friends there, and it’s easier to travel back home since JFK airport is not that far. (Also have distant family living in queens and Manhattan) 

ASU, it’s a party school, already made a few friends, one of my closest friends lives there, near California. 

But in the end, it really comes to a few factors. How good is the city of Tempe. How hard is it to get jobs and internships. How good is the computer science program. And safety (school shootings, assault, rape cases, etc) 

I want honest opinions please, (the cost of the university is the least of my concerns at the moment)"

I got rejected by every single college I applied to except my safeties. Mind you, I wrote 9/10 essays (got a lot of feedback so I can say this confidently). After I got rejected, my counselor asked the reason of all those rejections to some colleges she was close with. And they all said it was my grades. My gpa is around 93/100. It’s not bad but my school is insanely competitive and the acceptances dropped a lot schoolwide this year. I’m an international student and that’s also a thing. So I was wondering, should I take a gap year and take another chance? My grades wouldn’t increase so I’m not sure if I should take it. I can also try to transfer but it seems harder as far as I heard (you need to meet the credit requirements and all that)."

And everything was going great, senior engineers were impressed by my background of strong backend and AWS cloud skills as well as some frontend experience. 

But in the last five minutes one of them suddenly asked if I wanted to be a devops(engineer) as it fits my skill better. I was about to zone out due to the stress of the long interview so I was just mindlessly aiming to nail the role I was APPLYING for and didn’t really consider other roles that might work better for me.

So I said something stupid like “I am more interested in react than devops and will lean toward web devs.” They then said something like “so just a regular web dev” but also mentions that there will be devops part in the web dev as well.

But after giving it some thought now I feel like my background indeeds fits devops better. I did many cicd work and automation and created apis during my internship and it’s only my personal projects where I explored some of full stack and my front end skill is really weak compared to my backend knowledge and cloud. 

I fear this is going to be bad. This is my first job so I kinda realized I should have chosen my strong suit as a career instead of betting on learning something new as an intern. Also apparently I really like AWS (passed cloud practioner and going to SAA soon) and appreciate higher salary as well.

Would it be bad if I follow up before the final decision to make sure that I am also considering the devops role? I feel like that would project the image that I don’t have a clear goal.

But all in all, would devops be the correct choice for me considering the possibility to fuck up as a junior? Also how hard would it be to transition from full stack web dev if I really dont like it? (Suppose say in the first few months)"

**Letters of Recommendation**

Economics Teacher & IBDP Coordinator: 9/10. Best in her class, she was like a second mum to me. Spent half of senior year in her office because I just felt that comfortable having her around. We'd talk about anything and everything, and I genuinely believe she wants me to succeed!

English & TOK Teacher: 10/10. Best teacher I've ever had. Spent quite a bit of time with her since she'd come to debates with me sometimes. Also used to talk to her about my issues *(haha)* so she knew me inside-out, including about the bullying & harassment I faced at school.

Math Teacher: 7/10. I was actually not very good at his class, but he was still sort of nice to me. He always seemed kind of disappointed in me for being bad at math. I trust that he'd write good things, though.

School Counsellor: 7.5/10. This one was probably much less personality-focused and more content heavy, since I requested her to add quite a bit of things. Overall, though, she saw me being one of the most active contributors to student life at school, so I'm confident that she'd write good things too.

**Interviews**

Dartmouth: 10/10. The interviewer was a senior, and we spoke for about an hour and a half over Zoom. It was beautiful. We fangirled over Dartmouth and he even shared his personal number with me; he said he would advocate for me the best he could. It was genuinely super cool to connect with someone like that and get a unique perspective on the university.

Yale: 10/10. It was over a phone call because the interviewer's Skype didn't work *(ok boomer)*. But then it lasted for almost three hours?? We talked about literally everything under the sun from geopolitics to xenophobia to wide-ranging commentary about our favourite books (we shared a couple favourites!!!). We talked about Indian literature and courses at Yale that I want to explore related to that, we talked about my struggle in school, we talked about sexuality, the whole shebang. Genuinely felt so so good to share these things with someone and he was an amazing interviewer because he made it feel so conversational. Absolute joy of an interview.

Rice: 4/10. I was at a party. Needn't say more.

Georgetown: 6/10. She went off of a list and seemed generally disinterested in my answers.

Ashoka: 6/10. It got super confrontational for some reason because one of the two interviewers asked me opinion-based questions and then proceeded to disagree with me. Felt a little hostile honestly.

Imperial: 8/10. Super technical.

**Essays**

I'm honestly super proud of my essays, even though I wrote like a billion. My personal essay talked about growth through the lens of my school blazer, a handkerchief with my name on it, and a pair of shiny shoes. It's really cute and touches upon my personality a lot more than most supplemental, even. Plus I started it with a short poem which a few people said was really cool. Didn't get it reviewed by *tooo many* people, mostly because it was way too personal.

**Thoughts:**

*That was close.*

>!I honestly feel like being an aid-seeking international is so risky, and it almost wasn't worth it because I would've needed to take on massive student loan debt if Cornell didn't come through at the last moment. It's just a scary thought, the fact that one single hand in a committee could potentially have wiped off almost $400,000 in debt off of my life. It's stupid. I understand that private institutions are allowed to have their own priorities, but it just feels unfair that a system as discriminatory as this exists in a so called 'meritocracy'. The fact that I got into Berkeley early (because they don't consider need when shortlisting R&C Scholars) but got rejected from Notre Dame really speaks volumes about how much need-aware admissions can impact internationals. I'm not upset about American universities prioritising American students, although I guess it would be nice to be treated the same way as someone who lucked out with a better passport than mine. Anyway, Go Bears!!<"

 my\_qualifications: Accepted into a top #8 university in the worldUniversity College London. Won 4 hackathons along with participation into google kickstart competition, completed 5+ coding projects, completed an internship, as extracurricular: did dropshipping and freelance along with some trading.

 

For U.S it takes a lot of time to build a strong extra-curricular and academic background, especially for Ivy league, i have one of my relatives who had born USA, he got into Columbia university, he told me that 65% percentage of the applicant which are accepted are from America itself, the rest of which is for international students, according to him most of his folks from india had won several prizes like Olympiads etc.., he himself had done many extracurricular activies, he even said that most of the students in colleges like harvard, MIT etc had even started a startup somehow before getting accepted to the most top schools in the world.

Thats why getting into the united states colleges is a cumbersome process. whereas on the other hand UK universities requiring less things are easier to get into even with the competition.

**SATs score : 1560/1600**

**Subjects Taken In High School: AP Calculus , AP physics, AP chemistry, AP computer science, AP English, AP world history. WITH ALL SUBJECTS ABOVE 9 CGPA**

**Awards: Math Olympiad, hackathon Bronze medal, Captain of school's sport team.**

**Extra curricular: Worked as math tutor for 8-9 grades, community services (eg: helping ppl in hospitals, working for grocery or supermarkets etc.), started a NGO during covid times to help people with donations and funds, coded and developed 6 android apps, participated 12 clubs in schools, have done summer camps and programs in 10th grade.**

**Skills: Fluent in English, Hindi, French, can code apps and programs, certified maths tutor.**

**Academic interest: Computer science with AI.**

**Writing part: he wrote 2 essays with advance English, to every uni he applied, along with personal statement**

NOTE: he did all this during his high school from 9-12 grade.

EVEN after after all this he got only Cornell, duke, Princeton and Columbia university after applying to all ivy leagues. it just shows how hard it is to get into one even with a perfect resume and background, according to stanford where he also applied they rejected him because he didn't did much entrepreneurship."

My main concern is that I may have put too much time in school and not enough in valuable skills. I’ve done a bunch of projects and learned on the side, but fear it may not be enough. Also my final class is not looking too hot and I’ll have to retake it in the fall/summer. I’ve done 2 internships already and worked FT as a civil engineer.

My current dilema: I’m in the interview loop with a lot of companies still am knowing my luck, I could slip again on all of them. Some are FT, some are internships. I got an offer from the DOD as an AI intern, but I could still get a FT role soon. The NSA gave me a conditional offer but the start date may not be until mid 2024. And one company could have me intern in the Fall after graduation. My question is how does a guy with little skills manage this spaghetti?"

To be honest, I don't think I'm that good at programming. I used to be very interested and open to trying all kinds of things in programming until a year ago when some traumatic stuff happened and I've lost all interest in life and other things. I know the basic stuff like simple frontend work and some backend but nothing that that I would consider good enough. My lack of motivation and interest hadn't hit me until recently when I had my final year project evaluation and it did not go well. I've scared to even try something new with programming because I'm scared that I won't succeed and I'll never get it. I never used to have this mindset and I know I won't learn until i try at least. 

However, I've gotten to a point where just thinking about my project and fixing it gives me anxiety. I can't help it or control it. I'm scared to apply for IT jobs because I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to carry out the duties of it if I get selected. I had one internship but to be honest I didn't learn much in it. I'm scared of code like people are scared of spiders or snakes. What's worse is that this recently started and it's the worst feeling ever because this is my degree and will be my career at some point.

I would really appreciate some help or motivation. Feel free to let me know if I'm being just lazy."

I recently graduated with a degree in computer science and have been actively applying to several positions, but unfortunately, I have not received any responses yet. I have limited experience apart from my formal education and an internship that I completed several years before graduating.

I'm reaching out to the community for some advice on what I could be doing wrong and how I can improve my job search. I'm eager to learn and willing to put in the effort to gain more experience, but I'm not sure where to start.

If anyone has any pointers, suggestions or experiences to improve my resume, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you in advance for your time and help.

I am burning out of pink collar work, it feels like I'm being paid for my ability to take an emotional beating instead of any skill or competency. I want to have a job where I'm seen as good at my job instead of just ""good with people"". But I only get interview invites for these sorts of jobs so I must just not be applying to the right things, I could use some advice on what I qualify for and what I should go for. Important context is that I have ADHD. Hoping to change jobs in the next one to two years, I'm open to doing some training or schooling if needed but I cannot stress how little free time I have haha

Here's the rundown

Education: a BA in ""interdisciplinary studies in Natural Science"" lol (I went for a biology degree with a sociology minor but ran out of time before finishing either so they were just combined), also I'm currently doing a master's in data science. Not sure if I'll continue that MSDS though since I'm loosing faith that it'll actually help me get a job, or that data science would even be a good fit for someone with adhd. Would love thoughts on that too if anyone has any.

Experience:
My college internship (and in the last two years it became a part time job) was in vector control for a government contractor which I *loved*. I was tracking and controlling disease carrying mosquito populations. Highly independent and mentally demanding work outdoors that was doing serious good. 

Then I moved to a city that doesn't have a mosquito control industry.... I just assumed they would since they sure have a mosquito problem, but I was wrong haha. And I'm not going into private pest control, that industry is rancid. Maybe I could've found something similar but then covid hit so I had to just scramble for whatever work I could find 

Instead I worked as a patient navigator, then as a medical case manager. I loved the ""every day is a new challenge"" aspect, and again it ruled to be able to help and I loved the highly demanding and highly independent work environment, but god I felt like I was just a customer service representative for America's frayed social safety net. Brutal work. Started loosing the ability to empathize with people which is when I knew I had to bail

So I moved on up to being a surgical coordinator. Again, every day is something new and it's a really satisfying challenge, but everyone sees me as ""just"" a secretary and I again am just exhausted of the ignored emotional labor that goes into keeping patients happy and keeping surgeries on track. I'm happy here when the phone is off and I have my headphones one doing paperwork, but that's so hard to get. The phone is just always ringing and I can't handle much more of talking with patients who are asking more than I can give all with a mandated smile on my face. It's a great team and a good project so I'm not on my way out the door, but the hours and commute are brutal with an even worse work load and I can't do this for much longer. 

But... I don't know what else to do... anywhere else I go to is going to be much of the same if not worse. I would really, really benefit from some brain storming on what I could start preparing to do next

Tldr 2.0: Writing this out helped me figure out that I'm looking for a position where I'm not doing customer service, where the challenge changes day to day, and something that is demanding and with a strong impact. Complex systems and fast past environments are a plus. Background in healthcare/biology with some experience in data science/coding (though im not interested in going into tech or doing software engineering/IT). Any thoughts? Thanks!"

**Letters of Recommendation**

(Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)

8.5/10- English teacher- super sweet guy but we’re not close, easy ish class but I think I performed well

6.5/10- precalc teacher- umm so this class was hard. Lol. but i needed a stem rec and this was my only feasible option. I have known this guy for a long time but we’re also not close; he’s known for writing short letters of rec.

9/10- anatomy teacher- added this because I needed a science teacher for my BS/MD programs despite only having had her for about a month before this, she told me that she really enjoyed hearing about my interest in medicine (we have to fill out an LOR info form at my school) so that was a good sign imo- ended up using this instead of the math one for my RD decisions

9/10- counselor- definitely not her favorite student, but I felt like she was proud of the amount of work I put in; she’s very intense/persuasive/passionate- so I think that probably came through

**Interviews**

In the order that they happened, mostly ish

Bryn Mawr- 8/10, my first interview, I was really nervous, but it was with an older alum and she was super nice :)

WashU- 8.5/10, my interviewer (student) was kind of intense but nice- she was obviously very driven, but we bonded about music which was cool and she got me in contact with the music teacher there which was awesome

Case- 7/10- um. AO interviewer, fast, kind of boring

Rice- 8.75/10- I was pretty nervous again so I don’t think it was my best performance, but my interviewer (student) was super great, yet again.

Wesleyan- 10/10- i LOVED this interview :( my interviewer was a senior and we talked a lot ab academics and school culture idk it was cool vibes

Dartmouth- 9/10- solid (alumni), very fast paced

Pomona (7.5/10)- it was a phone call, which made it hard for me as facial expressions are pretty helpful lol- we talked about chinese so that was cool

MIT (8.5/10)- only in person one I had, I had to bring a resume and a show and tell item so I was pretty nervous about the whole thing. Overall I think I did a good job talking about myself but not WHY MIT, ….

Tufts (12/10)- ahhh i really liked this one, she was so down to earth that it brought out the best in me. It was my last interview, but I think it was also my best performance.

**Essays**

8.5/10 personal statement- was abt literature and how it shaped my understanding of the world/issues in my life. I think the writing was good but it wasn’t as punchy as it could’ve been.

8.5/10- PIQs- pretty similar in writing style to my common app PS

Mixed bag- supplementals. My early supplementals were kind of mid, but by RD I had gotten the hang of it (I think my Rice supplemental was my best overall).

**Decisions** (what you’re looking at this for lol)

Rejections:

Brown ED & plme (deferred—> rejected)

MIT (RD)

UC Berkeley

Yale (RD)

Pomona (RD), accepting waitlist

Most if not all job openings require 2+ years of experience, and there are very few internship opportunities that I could find (I live in morocco).

I did 3 internships in software development (using technologies such as PHP, Laravel, PHPunit, javascript, Python, Flask ...)

Any advice on how to land my first entry level job/internship.

Thank you.

My first time ever making a Reddit post after lurking for several years. Currently a high school senior trying to decide on what college to attend, planning on double majoring in Psychology and Statistics and minoring in Chinese language/culture. As to avoid doxing myself, I'm going to try and limit what specific info I provide here. I'm going to post this on each college's subreddit so I can get more or less a balanced view.

I've limited myself to choose between the following three:

&#x200B;

Boston University (Selected as a Trustee Scholar, costs 20K a year for room and board):

**Pros:** Definitely being a Trustee Scholar, by far the best value school offering me the most aid. Boston is a beautiful city with lots of opportunities for internships!

**Cons:** Kinda disliking the core curriculum... Concerned about what it's like to be a Black student at BU and in Boston in general. Haven't been able to visit any campus in person, but from what I can tell BU's campus doesn't really have the ""traditional college experience"" feel. Research is very important to me and social psych is my main interest, but there don't seem to be any research labs or faculty in that field. Doesn't have a specific stats major, only mathematics with a concentration in stats, unsure how this would work if I decide that stats would be my main major down the line.

**Q&A for current BU students:** What's food and housing like? What's your favorite thing about BU and why did you choose this school? How is BU's career advising, specifically for Psychology majors?  How easy is it to double major with the core curriculum? I've seen quite a few negative things about BU (which may not be true) and there's only so much I can learn through research alone so pls convince me to love BU haha

&#x200B;

Brown University (costs \~42K per year wtf, but selected for their Presidential Scholars Program):

**Pros:** Love love the open curriculum, would allow me to explore my interdisciplinary interests. Brown's Data Science Initiative is super interesting! Presidential Scholars Program would also facilitate me to get into research, and there are current faculty with similar research interests as me even though Brown does not have a specific social psych program. Actually has a stats concentration, math seems to be super strong at Brown. Providence, while smaller than Boston seems like a really nice city to be at. Brown also seems to be a pretty collaborative school rather than super competitive which I like.

**Cons:** Cost. With the PSP program research will take up most of my time (which, yay!) but I'm worried that means it'll be difficult to work. I'd need to work to help pay tuition/living expenses. Ugh. Providence a bit small of a city, but ehh that isn't too big of a factor for me? The biggest issue is just cost, really.

&#x200B;

Duke University (Don't have a finaid package yet but anticipate cost 30-40K per year):

**Pros:** Literally my dream school. Has really strong faculty in social psych, though that's the graduate school but I don't think it'll be too hard to volunteer/work in graduate research labs. Food is so so amazing, campus is so so pretty (I did a virtual tour), it isn't TOO cold, dorms seem really nice, Duke gardens ahh and just the overall feel/school spirit. Doesn't seem too unfeasible/difficult to double major. The Chinese program seems pretty strong at Duke. Strong presence/community of Black students on campus, yay.

**Cons:** Even though I don't have a finaid package yet, I anticipate the biggest barrier will be the cost. Durham is an interesting city but might be a bit small, and difficult to get around without a car. Concerned about the potential divide/animosity (?) between the Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and Pratt, though this is very small concern lol. 

&#x200B;

Some others I got into and the estimated cost per year (I subtracted COA from grant aid they gave me, not including loans):

WashU (\~38K), UPenn (40K+), FSU (\~18K), UF (\~25K), UNC Chapel Hill (\~49K???)

&#x200B;

Ultimately for me, my choice will boil down to cost. Sort of depressed because I spent my entire high school career working hard to try and go to an amazing school with very little debt, yet because of factors beyond my control the cost of college will be beyond what my family (and I) can afford. I absolutely refuse to take out more than 20K TOTAL in loans so I am currently working on appealing financial aid but am in a tough spot right now. Still hung up over the thought of having to take out loans at literally any school I go to right now.

Would love to hear your thoughts as current students at BU. Thanks!"

I am looking for research in computer programming/ machine learning and I am looking for business internships. I want to major in finance and minor in computer science.
I am based in the Pacific Northwest of the US
1. For research, where should I look? Should I be professors, colleges themselves etc, can it be done online?
2. Internships: what should my cold emails look like? I heard from somebody that I shouldn’t directly say I want an internship in the first email. Also, where should I look for internships? Are they okay to be done online. 
3. What should the research cold emails look like?
4. Which is more beneficial, research or internships?
If you can answer any of those questions I would be really grateful. Or if you have any resources."

However, everyone in my life is recommending I continue living with my parents for a year or two to save money. 

Some context:
- I lived at home all through university 
- I graduated debt free (thank you mom + dad)
- I had several lucrative internships and part time jobs in university so I have about $50k saved up
- I currently work in-office 2 to 3 days a week and the commute it 1.5 hours
- I have a good relationship with my parents, however they still see me as a little kid. This means no drinking, no dating, no staying out past 10 pm. They’re getting used to the idea of it though
- I would pay my parents approx. $600 each month to cover my living expenses

I felt confident in my decision to try living on my own but after hearing people’s advice I feel naive. My social life suffered a lot through university and I was hoping moving out would help me make friends. 

However, continuing to live at home would be a lot easier than moving out and having to move back home due to lack of funds. Any advice to help this confused 23 year old would be greatly appreciated!"

I’ve even tried applying to apprenticeships. Nothing. I know the IT industry is a tough one to get into, but this honestly is just ridiculous. I’ve even tried internships at my university and still nothing. Im seeing other people my age thriving and getting ahead in life while I’m over here barely keeping my head above the water. I don’t know what else to do anymore. I get the feeling I was scammed by university and I lost a load of time getting a piece of paper that’s worth nothing at the moment. What do I have to do? Kidnap someone or something?

12f5v4o,9,2023-04-07,Questions about pseudo-employer sponsorship,Suspicious-Price-763,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/12f5v4o/questions_about_pseudoemployer_sponsorship/,"**My employer has stated they are interested in me returing to work for them after my MBA. What they have ""offered"" me is a very flexible situation whereby they would give me a ""large bonus"" upon my return to cover the costs of my MBA and incentivize me to return full-time.** 

On my end, I would not be locked into any commitment to return to my current employer. Erego, if my summer internship turned into a full-time offer I could accept it without penalty. 

This situation will require me to front the cost of my MBA with loans and I am growing more and more fearful that my current employer could quite easily state that they cannot or will not follow through with their ""large bonus"" promise two years from now. 

**Is there anything I can or should do to formalize my employer's offer? All I really want is for them to prove to me that what they're ""offering"" me is more than just words.** 

Given the recent posts on here about employment prospects, **I've recently begun to second think attending my M7 program and paying full-price for a new opportunity that may not yield a total comp that is greater than what I currently make** (\~150k USD). 

Many thanks in advance for your thoughts and feedback."

12f6ket,0,2023-04-07,Chances of getting a mortgage or other housing options,frenchynerd,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/12f6ket/chances_of_getting_a_mortgage_or_other_housing/,"My current apartment is too expensive for me, I live check to check, no margin, can't put money aside.

It's hell here, it's incredibly noisy. Landlord is increasing the rent again in July. I can't find anything else. With the current housing situation, there are very few apartments available that are cheaper than my place, and the landlords just collect several applications and take the tenant with the highest credit score.

Now, I'm in Quebec, and there are some choices of condos that are for sale around 120 000$ - 130 000$. Mortgage payment + tax + condo fees would still be cheaper than my rent.

But I have some strikes against me.

-I'm currently a student in I.T. Classes end in July, then it's a paid internship, and then the program is officially over in September. After that, I could get a job in technical support that could pay around 40-42000$ a year. Probably at the same place than where I'm going to do my internship. So, no long stable employment history.

-I filed a bankrupcy 6 years ago following a long illness.

-My credit score is now around 690.

-I have 10 000$ on a line of credit, no other debts, credit cards at 0.

-I have 15000$ aside in a RRSP that could be used as a downpayment.

-I have a car that is worth 12000$, no loan on it. I need it, won't sell it.

-No coborrowers possible.

Do I have any chances of getting a mortgage for one of those small condos either now or when I finish my school program in September? Or how long would I have to stay at the same job to have some chances of getting approved?

Else, am I fucked and stuck to either pay too much for a shitty apartment or having to go back living with roommates? 

I feel that it's just getting so much difficult for single people with lower income and imperfect situations (but income not low enough to be eligible for social housing) just to get a decent roof over your head."

12f7cmt,14,2023-04-07,"I always feel exhausted, I hate myself, I feel neglected by people I'm ""close"" to, and I doubt if I'll ever actually be able to succeed in life",BitchImLilBaby,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/12f7cmt/i_always_feel_exhausted_i_hate_myself_i_feel/,"I (21M) am finishing up my junior year at a pretty well-known university. I have a 3.7 GPA and a lot of my friends see me smiling and making jokes a lot of the time and think I'm doing amazing in life, when the truth is that couldn't be farther from the truth.

I'm taking a full class load, working a part-time job at around 15 hours a week, trying to consistently work out and live a healthy lifestyle, volunteering at my college's radio station so I can potentially get a paid job with them next year, and trying to have somewhat of a social life... I'm just always burned out and can barely make it through a day without at least one power nap and two cups of coffee. It's like every single one of my days is filled up from as early as 7AM to at least 7PM and I beat myself up for not strictly sticking to my schedule.

Because I always feel tired and can barely finish what's presented to me, I haven't had much time to sit down and look at internships for the summer. Everyone always tell me I need an internship if I want to succeed post-grad, but I just don't have enough energy to do it when I have everything else on my plate. It's not like there's anything I can cut out either. I almost feel like it would be better for my mental health and well-being to just not worry about applying for internships and volunteer in other ways close to my desired career. I just compare myself to my friends my age or younger who already have internships lined up, or a job post-graduation ... it just makes me feel like shit, like even though I'm busting my ass it's still bound for me to fail.

I volunteer at the radio station like I said earlier. It's really fun and rewarding, I enjoy it. But I want to get paid next year for hanging around the station. We have various paid spots at the station. I just want to have a staff position of some kind, so I'm shadowing a bunch of different people. However, the hours I work conflict with a lot of their shadow opportunities. It's not my fault I have to work to pay my bills, but I feel like I'm going to be behind everyone else when the application process starts. I'm worried everyone else is gonna be more qualified than me and I'm not going to get any position and it'll make all the volunteering I did basically pointless. I can't just quit my job to do shadowing, and even though it's not my fault I can't shadow, now I'm beating myself up, asking myself why I have such a shitty minimum-wage job that requires me to work bad hours and how my decisions must have led me to be in this position, like it's somehow all inherently my fault of being a bad person.

Furthermore, despite being somewhat close to a lot of these people at the station, I still don't feel like I quite fit in. I have a disability that makes it difficult for me to socialize and ""fit in"", and I just want to be accepted by other people. When they make plans to hang out outside of the station on the weekends or in the evenings, I don't usually hear about it. Then I'll see them post about it on beReal or Snapchat. I want them to have fun, and I don't want to start beef, but I really, really want to be involved. I have like two friends I actually hang out with outside of class and clubs, and I really appreciate the two of them, I just wish I could be included in more things. The fact that I'm not makes me start to hate myself and ask myself what I'm doing wrong. As you can see, these things that come up in my life, even if they're not my fault, somehow I convince myself it is my fault and it just really hurts my self-esteem.

I'm not majoring in STEM or business, I always hear people make fun of my major and how it's not difficult and no one wants to hire people with that degree. I'm just worried that no matter how hard I work, situations out of my control are gonna lead to me not having a very successful life. Part of me thinks I'm gonna be stuck working at my food service job for my entire life, and it just makes me not want to try anymore. I don't feel accepted by people, everyday I'm tired, and I just don't know if it's worth keep trying to fight anymore considering all my fighting has felt futile. I just wish I had my life figured out like my peers do.

TL;DR The job I really want next year requires shadowing, which interferes with the job I currently have right now, and I can't just quit that job because I still need to pay my bills. I have an extremely busy schedule because I'm trying to accomplish so much and as a result I'm always tired. A group of people that I consider my friends make plans to hang out outside of class and often don't include me, which hurts my self-esteem. I like my degree but it's also not one that employers are exactly dying to recruit. All these things in my life make me wonder if maybe I'm just a bad person who made bad decisions and if I somehow deserve this."

I also have a full-time job offer as a SDE in an AI team of a tech company at Bay Area (not FAANG but good reputation). I'm not planning to do a PhD right now, but I don't want to close this door. So I still want to do some light research if doing a Master. My favourite subject is in the intersection of CV, CG and ML. I know I will be doing some CV and deep learning in the full time job, and the team is nice (I had an internship with that team). And I know work experience is important nowadays.

I think Columbia MSCS has an online version (called CVN), so I can probably work and do an online master at the same time. But the online master will be course based, almost impossible to have opportunity doing research. I have thought about deferring the master admission, but employment might not be a sufficient reason for the school to approve the request.

It is very hard for me to decide where to go this Fall. Can you give me some advice? Thanks! :)"

My internship workplace sucks. The place is just so unwelcoming since day 1 and they treat the other interns better than me and there have been too many incidences that have happened to me that just… can’t be ignored anymore. 

I spoke about it with my mom, my professor, my friends, and they all told me to quit. 

The thing is though, I feel like I could ask to work from home since I already do once a week, plus there are other employees who work fully remote. Working from home means I still make money at least. Plus they give me barely any work.

Another thing is though that makes me nervous, is that Ive had about 2-4 incidences now where i had to stay at home or tell them etc etc about things happening due to my poor mental health.

So i’m scared that if i say anything, they’ll just find me even more annoying than they already find me currently… which honestly i’m not, i’ve been very cooperative but i just have a habit to self blame

I hope this post gives hope to any future college applicants who may have lots of family obligations/test-optional/no olympiad or major awards. You just need a compelling story and motivation for the activities that you do and your major/future career. Make sure you show that everywhere in your application--your essays, ECs descriptions, letters of recs, and the interviews.

Also want to add that 4 of my ECs were in my senior year. If you happen to most of your activities during your senior year, make sure you make a quick and good impact during that first semester of senior year. Almost all of my ECs except for my family responsibilities and Coursera were all done in school. Of course, just because I got into some prestigious schools doesn't mean I'm an expert, but I will try my best to tell you what I've learned from this process!"

**Letters of Recommendation**
AP Lang teacher: Semi-close relationship, I slightly regret asking her. It was probably fine, though. 6/10. 
Mock Trial Coach: She was also a previous teacher from a program at my school and I really enjoyed her class, so I think this was a good letter. She also didn’t write many so she could devote more time to it. I have a good relationship with her. She also went to NU which I thought would help. 8/10

**Interviews**
Columbia: It was ok. Since it was my only interview I was super nervous and I think she could tell. I stuttered a lot. 4/10. 

**Essays**

My common app essay was about my relationship with reading/writing throughout my childhood and how I stopped being creative after my mom passed away in 9th grade. Then I talk about how I overcame my loss of inspiration because of a book that she loved that I read a year after she died, and how creativity and writing are manifested in my life now.  I had like 4 people edit it and I was happy with it in the end, but it could’ve still been better because by the time the UNC EA deadline arrived I was pretty much fed up with editing it. 

**Decisions **

•University of Vermont EA: >! Accepted + presidential scholarship !<

•Champlain College: >! Accepted + trustee !<

•University of Pittsburgh: >! Accepted + honors + guaranteed law school !<

•UW Seattle: >! Waitlisted?? Genuinely broke my heart I rly wanted to go here :( !<

•UNC Chapel Hill EA: >! Accepted to global launch in scotland lol !< 

•UMich EA: >! Deferred and then accepted. Very very happy abt this one. !<

•Oberlin College: >! Accepted + john oberlin scholarship !< 

•Barnard College: >! rejected rip !<

•Wesleyan University >! rejected :0 !<

•Middlebury College: >! still rejected !<

•Yale University: >! rejected, not surprised !<

•Columbia University: >! rejected. interview def didn’t help. !<

•Northwestern University ED: >! 
deferred then rejected. I really poured my heart and soul into this application and my LOCI so this hurt, especially bc my mom who passed away went here. !< 

**Additional Information:**
I wish I had applied to more targets, but in the end I’m happy with my choices. I also wish I had maybe spent more time on my common app essay and my extracurricular descriptions bc they were sort of rushed. ALSO I forgot to submit my AP scores 😭 and I literally emailed all my schools a week before decisions to tell them. It probably didn’t make a difference but it made me feel very stupid. Oh well. Also having a mindset of not getting in made this process a lot easier, bc when I expected to get in and didn’t I was shattered. So like she said in that spider-man movie, expect nothing so it doesn’t hurt!

Also I had better descriptions for my ECs on my app I just did not feel like putting them here lol."
12f9373,1,2023-04-07,"MBA, MSIS, workforce, abroad...? Looking for thoughts and advice as a young professional.",passwordhashbrowns,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/12f9373/mba_msis_workforce_abroad_looking_for_thoughts/,"Hello all, 

I am currently set to graduate in a month with a BSc in Cybersecurity from a school in the USA. I still have athletic eligibility remaining due to covid, and I am skilled enough to earn a really good scholarship for graduate school. I also have a girlfriend in Germany, and 

My career goals are set on C level leadership (CISO, CIO, CTO, CSO). I have worked a sysadmin internship, and a cybersecurity GRC internship. This summer, I am doing another GRC internship at a large software company. 

Right now, I am looking at about 4 different options, two in the USA. I'm looking to see what input I can get from the community. 

* Option 1: MBA at unranked program, somewhere in the Midwest- I get to play my sport with full time athletics. 
* Option 2: Masters in Information Systems- This degree is more interesting to me, but I've heard that the MBA is more important for the C level. I still get to play my sport. 

Part of me wants to give up athletics, as I've known nothing else. I want a chance to explore more on my own terms and not be bound to a schedule as required on a team. I've been looking at two programs in Berlin. I plan on living in a shared apartment (not just chasing a girl) , learning the language, working part time, and studying at a program in English. 

* Option 3. Masters in Information Systems. This program is at a top technical University and would be very difficult, however, Germans don't really care about college rank like Americans do. 
* Option 4. Master of Science in Business Intelligence and Process Management. This program would be easier than the other German program, and I would probably have more time for having fun and exploring the city and working part time.

Since school would be free aside from living expenses due to scholarship/socialized education, there's not significant financial pressure. I plan on working part time in some capacity anywhere I go to pay the bills. 

I could also just hope to get hired on after this summer's internship and skip worrying about school altogether. I would start at a GRC analyst position and begin working up the ladder from there. 

Again, my goals are to be in Cybersecurity/IT leadership. My path is bright, and I know that I could succeed with any situation. I want to solicit some feedback and ideas on how these different options may provide more value or be a possible waste of effort for my goals. What would you do if you had these options?

Thank you!"

I want to do a PhD to enhance my skills and am deciding between UMICH and NUS.

1. Singapore and the US: I prefer the US, but the job market is currently not friendly. UMICH's program is not job-oriented either.
2. I am interested in getting a job in the future, but I'm open to doing a PhD if necessary. UMICH's EECS program seems to be better than NUS's QF in terms of job prospects. I am not sure if it's easy to apply for a US PhD program in a quantitative field at NUS.
3. Cost: UMICH's estimated cost for two years is over 110,000 USD, while NUS is much cheaper with a tuition of 44000 sd and an estimated living cost of 4,000 sd for two years. Although I'm not under financial pressure, I still want to save some money.
4. Program: Both programs seem to be similar.
5. Job opportunities: UMICH's job outlook is not very good, while NUS's QF program's reputation for job prospects varies. I have had internships in quantitative finance in China.
6. Personality: I've talked to some coders who work in Silicon Valley and they say they don't like the lifestyle of big-scaled software companies. I prefer a more social lifestyle. However, I'm aware that working as a quant may still be like working as a coder in finance firms. I'm open to working as a SDE or a quant in the future.

If I go to NUS, I dream of landing a good job after graduation or applying for a PhD program (in fintech or CS) in the US. If I choose UMICH, I hope to find a SDE job, although it appears to be unlikely.

Can anyone give me so advice, thank you."

And i stumbled upon this really small company that was hiring for multiple positions. I go ahead and email the CEO as he put his info in the job posting. He answers pretty quick and we set up a 15 min interview. 

I had practiced a bit on what to say. I am a marketing analytics student applying for a marketing analytics position. Although I haven’t had much experience, I want to learn. 

So interview starts, I’m excited to mention projects i’ve worked on, things i am currently doing regarding my studies, etc. But boy, was i not ready for 21 questions to test your personality. This man starts badgering me with questions, barely engaging in conversation about them. 


Mind you, english is not my first language so when he asks about “duty responsibility” i’m a bit taken aback. I’ve never heard that term but I try to answer, he seems to not like any of my answers. he finishes his round of 21 questions and asks me if i have any. i ask one question and he barely answers it, then moves on without letting me ask anything else. 

this is where it turns from 21 questions to the interviewer from hell. This man starts going back on all of my answers right. But he starts specifying why my answer is wrong. You look up to your father or professors for wisdom? what a dumbass, your professors are bought by big corporations and your dad knows nothing. You are not currently reading a book? what an imbecile (i said i was into audiobooks and documentaries currently). you’re on social media? you’re a brainwashed idiot who is turning into a communist, even told me that even if i used social media daily i would never be able to even get 1000 reactions professionally (all my social media is personal and not public). you don’t know about investing? well i will tell you, you are a bad investment. 

I was so taken aback. granted he didn’t tell me i was an idiot or anything like that but he took an hour to explain in longer words that i was an imbecile who is just like the rest of the world. that i am unmotivated and disloyal. That i am what is wrong with this country. Several times he mentioned that he’d have to think about it as i was a bad investment, but he kept explaining why. that and giving me unsolicited advice. “i’ll give you some advice: stop believing your professors and big corporations, they’re brainwashing you etc etc”. 

I’m honestly just shocked and silent. It isn’t until i think i’m going to start insulting him that i say “okay well, thanks for your time” and he lets me go. 

I never even got to know what the position entailed. 

I emailed him an hour later to let him know that i was formally withdrawing my application as I did not believe we were a good fit. 

Two hours later he posts on his social media about the “study” he has conducted, where he studied 100 interviews and everyone said the same boring things. How we are all unmotivated brainwashed communists because of social media. And that American needs to do better.

I am honestly tired, confused, and I feel humiliated by an idiot who doesn’t even have 5 followers on his company’s social media. 

what the fuck is wrong with people. has no one heard of respect in this country?"

I've heard LinkedIn is a good place to start, pero gusto ko rin mag-reach out dito and ask if anyone knows of any companies that are currently accepting interns for the midyear. If may recommendations po kayo or if may alam kayong companies that are accepting applicants/interns, please please plase let me know po. Goal ko lang po talaga ay makakuha po ng experience from real software development.

I appreciate any help you can give po. Thank you so much!"
12ffzvj,2,2023-04-08,I wanna change my major but idk,based_pika,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/12ffzvj/i_wanna_change_my_major_but_idk/,"Ok so I’m a 20 (almost 21) year old American from a small college town in the Mideast. I’ve been a gamer my whole life, I have a collection of manga, anime figures, pink keebs and a pink gamer chair with bunny ears, kawaii plushies, a pink bunny blanket, everything that your typical gamer girl has. I’ve been majoring in 3d animation and game design for the past 2.5 years. My first year i spent in a community college (fully virtual because it was 2020-2021), then transferred to a 4-year college that I never wanted to go to. I was so angry about going there that i ripped up my acceptance letter when i got it in the mail. I never announced my acceptance on social media and told people that I wasn’t attending college at all. A year ago I decided to pursue a minor in Japanese along with my major. but as time went on i started wondering that maybe my major isn’t for me. I don’t understand programming at all and had to drop a class, haven’t really made any progress and I’m not a very good artist. My professors tell me that I’m doing good, that there is progress and that I just have imposter syndrome that isn’t allowing me to progress more, but but no matter what i create, i hate it so much and i know that nobody will hire a someone with my skills. I will admit that I’m not studying ad much as I’m supposed to, but i lost all hope and just don’t want to create another ugly piece that won’t get me anywhere. 

Most importantly, i hate college and I’m not enjoying anything about it. I’ve been in college for 3 years now and it didn’t give me anything. No skills, a desire to continue, growth, friends, a relationship, an internship, excitement about the future, some kind of connections, a portfolio, none of that. I haven’t even spoken to a single person at college. When someone tried to talk to me, i was uninterested and pushed myself away from my classmates. Seeing all my peers so excited for college, making friends, building relationship, doing internships and just having a good time breaks my heart. Instead of enjoying college, being a normal young adult and progressing in my major, I’m just rotting and dreading every single day. At this point I don’t care if i graduate or not, i can see myself getting that diploma and instead of thinking “finally I’m done, I’m so happy”, i\`ll be thinking “i just wasted 4 years of my life that i will never get back, this is useless.“

I spent the past semester studying abroad in japan and didn’t do anything related to my major. I didn’t make any friends there either and it was far from magical like people told me it would be, but i made a lot of progress, scored high on tests, my teacher told me i have good potential. I want to move to japan, and seeing how scarce English speakers are in japan made me want to be an English teacher in japan. My interests also changed, when I went to akihabara I didn’t feel any excitement and didn’t purchase anything, while a year ago I would’ve spent every penny I have on the stuff they had for sale. Instead of buying manga and anime merchandise, i bought vintage clothes and Japanese books. I feel like I completely lost my identity and turned into a different person that never existed before. Im debating on whether I should stick to animation/game design, or transfer to a different university that I actually want to attend and change my major to Japanese. Either i will be studying something i really enjoy, i will attend a college i want to be in and i will be proud of myself for graduating, but a Japanese degree wont get me anywhere. Or i will be studying animation at a school I don’t like, but will have a chance at making good money in the future. I have one life and I want to enjoy my college years, not look back and be sad that i flushed them down the toilet. What should I do?"

Sci. student. I recently applied to a summer internship program and just got a mail saying that I passed the first stage now I have to select an option and take a skill test about it. The paths are: 

1. Software Engineering
2. Business Analytics
3. Network/System/Cybersecurity Engineering

Now, of course, I know some stuff about these and I know for a fact that I won't take the third option. I am interested in Data Analytics and Data Science and I was planning to build a career in that path. I am also planning to learn iOS development, but I haven't started learning yet. Now, I know intermediate Python and intermediate C++. Some basic stuff related to data science/analysis such as Numpy, Pandas, and some basic web-scraping. 

I assumed that if I take Business Analytics, I'll be working with data but it won't be like data science as I'll probably use Excel, SQL something. Which seems kind of related but not so related. If I choose Software Engineering, I will probably use C++ and maybe Python again but in a different way than how I use it for data-related stuff. 

I am more confident and interested in data-related stuff but I am also not doing badly in my classes that are more related to software engineering.  I am also assuming in Business Analytics, there are more people coming from backgrounds like Business Administration, and Economics than Comp. Sci.

So, I am pretty undecided. Which would suit me more or which one I am going to benefit more from?

Thanks in advance."

 I have just made this resume. I am from Mexico and I had some trouble translating things, like the name of the research centers, which I ended up leaving in Spanish. I also added a picture of me, my name and my personal info (phone number, email, linkedin) which is supposed to be on the top.  
Also, I think it looks kinda empty. I did not enroll in a lot of activities during college and now I'm regretting it.  
This is the first resume I have ever made, I just used a template I found online and added some ideas of resumes that I've seen online and in this subreddit.  
 Any criticism is welcome and I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks  
Btw, my English level is from 4 years ago, but I've improved since. Should I take another certification test, or just leave it like that?

TLDR: 10 years of customer facing support, want to move forward into more tech roles, do i self study and try to cert stack or take a shady, but “supposedly” free fast track BS degree program, or something else?

After high school i went straight to college and did a year and a half of CompSci, dropped out cause i was young dumb and wanted to party. In 2010 went back to a community college and got my a+ cert, did a summer paid internship doing IT grunt work for local School District and worked for about a year for them after. then got a job at a well known technology company in 2012 doing customer support troubleshooting computers, tablets and mobile devices over the phone for end users, moved to chat role, did an email rotation and eventually landing a role doing essentially the same thing as our phone support but via Social Media. The benefits are good, pay beats any entry level help desk IT work in my area, get to work from home (super important factor) and ive been there almost 11 years now. Opportunities for movement are fairly rate especially when it comes to tech focused roles that aren’t just customer facing. Im ready to learn more and I want to move up to more technical roles. I honestly would love to stay at my company but would be willing to job seek if that ends up being viable in terms of pay and benefits comparisons.

Anyway back story out of the way, I did a couple of cybersecurity courses on coursera and learning some python on their also while i plan my next move. Cybersecurity is my ultimate desired path but i know thats competitive and could be unrealistic and am open to other technical roles. 

My work offers a free tuition program to get a BS in Information Technology through Umass Global, i was hyped for it but former student reviews are rough, seems that its fast track which is cool but complaints are that its “too easy” and people talk about a lot of shady financial issues and intentional delays of degrees ect. 

I am in debt for the degree i didnt finish still, and i do not want any loans. 

Whats my best path forward here? Self learn, take industry certs? Do the possible shady BS degree? Im 35yr and feel like time isnt on my side anymore, with big tech layoffs, rise of AI, being an older dude with no degree is a bit concerning. I like who i work for, but its basically just slightly more skilled customer service ive been doing, but i have a genuine interest in IT and enjoy learning more and gaining new skills, i just got to comfy and didn’t take advantage of the last decade to gain new skills outside of the workplace. Appreciate if you’ve read this far, all advice comments are welcome and appreciated."
12fhx6t,0,2023-04-08,How do I get a job that is even remotely relevant to my degree?,hellocruelworld-,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12fhx6t/how_do_i_get_a_job_that_is_even_remotely_relevant/,"Fantastic, I've got a degree. But it still seems like it's not enough for a job. I mean, I get it, ""experience"" and being able to show that you can ""produce results"" is what it seems the people who are looking to hire are looking for, but I am speaking from my POV right now.

I have a computer science degree, which while I enjoy the subject matter of, if I want to get a job in IT it looks like I'm going to have to get some certs instead if I want to *maybe* have a chance at getting into those roles since my resume is just coding projects right now. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. Otherwise, if I want to *maybe* get a chance at a job in software, I'm going to need to spend some more time working on some more projects, maybe using tools and languages that employers are actually looking for and/or study up on leetcode (for some reason) or something.

Currently my resume is just:

* my degree
* a bunch of coding projects I did as class assignments
* some managerial experience that's not specific to IT or programming

The logical side of me also knows that there are probably a million (maybe literally) other people out there like me and there are only a small fraction of that number of positions available, so this is maybe more of a vent about how tired I am. I am tired.

Edit:

~~Y'know, I'm not even necessarily asking to get paid. I'll take an unpaid internship at this point but I think that's illegal and the paid ones are basically like applying to a job and so we're back to the slog of grinding to get the chance at an opportunity to get some crumbs of ""experience"".~~

Edit 2:

Apparently there's no good reason to do unpaid work (unless it's maybe for a charity or something) so scratch that."

12foxvz,696,2023-04-08,Advice from a marine researcher: Stay away from dead whales that washed ashore. They might be hiding something terrible.,Luminoustygian,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12foxvz/advice_from_a_marine_researcher_stay_away_from/,"Before I recount the events I witnessed, I must let you know that I have signed a confidentiality agreement, and would not be able to reveal everything in detail.


I shouldn't be saying anything at all— But this has haunted me for months now and I feel like people should know about what happened:


A few months ago, I had the precious opportunity to participate in a marine research programme as an intern. 


You might have seen the news about a worrying spike in dead whales washing ashore during this time. Because of this, one of my assignments was to accompany more senior researchers in collecting samples to research on the cause of the spike.


It was my first time on the field, and as someone who had loved the wonders of the ocean since a young age, I was excited to get started.


Little did I know how wrong everything would go.


The first thing I noticed when I arrived at the beach was the smell. Mixed in with the scent of the ocean, it was a pungent odour of the beginning of decay that burned my nostrils despite the gear I was wearing. Several researchers with me coughed and quipped about feeling nauseous. Even so, we trudged on, inwardly cringing as the smell only became more pronounced as we got closer.


Smell aside, I thought that the sight was sad. To think that what was once such a glorious and majestic creature would end up as a carcass on the shore....


Before we could collect our samples, we had the important task of supervising the support staff in making sure that the whale wouldn't explode. It sounds odd, yes, but there's been records of whale carcasses exploding because of the buildup of gas in the decomposition process. Go prevent this, a puncture had to be made at the side of the whale, to allow the gas to slowly leak out.



As I watched, transfixed, I heard grumbles from one of my fellow interns. I'll call him Bill here.


""God,"" He complained, ""This stinks. I just want to get this over with and go home.""


I held back the urge to scoff. I never liked Bill since he always gave off the impression of being overconfident and arrogant.


The process was longer than expected. Slowly, the support staff cut and drilled through layers of thick skin, blubbler and muscle.


Alerting us all, one of them suddenly screamed. Several others followed suit, falling back in shock with eyes widened like saucers.


Everyone clamoured and quickly moved to see what the commotion was about.


Then, we saw *it*.


*Something was peeking through the punctured hole.*


Familiar, yet so alien at the same time, everyone knew what it was.


There was a moment of silence before someone spoke up, ""Is that a human face?""


Do you know how naked mole-rats look? Examining the structure of their faces, despite being covered by thick skin, you'd be able to vaguely discern where their eyes would've been, if they weren't so degenerated over the course of evolution.


That face, peeking through the hole, looked like that of a mole-rat, except human. You'd be able to identify a human mouth, nose and what was once eyes— covered by skin like a creature that had dwelled in darkness for a long time.


I could tell that everyone had the same thoughts running through their heads—


What was that thing? 


How did it get inside the whale?


*Was it alive?*


Before anyone could make another sound, the face moved, slowly tilting left and right— uncannily like a human would when taking in their surroundings.


I wanted to throw up on the spot.


The face seemed to extend out of the hole next, revealing a long neck and a human torso. But much like its eyes, its arms seemed to be degenerated too— reduced to stubs that flapped around as it slithered out, covered in the whale's decaying body fluid.


The creature's whole body was on display when it flopped to the sand with a sickening squelch. Below its torso a long and thin flap of flesh divided by a faint line, like vestigial pair of legs.


We watched it raised its head, opening its mouth wide as if to take in the air. 


No one paid attention to Bill until he was up in front of the creature. I never understood what he was thinking, to get so close to that monstrous thing. Maybe he wanted to take credit for the discovery of a new creature. Maybe he was just drawn by something.


But within an instant, the creature had released an unearthly high-pitched squeal and launched itself onto Bill's arm. Bill shouted and tried to shake the creature off, but it seemed to latch onto him tightly.


As people moved to help him, the whale shook and the puncture widened. Dozens of the creatures spilled out, falling onto everyone below them.


It was so surreal that I couldn't belive my eyes. A pile of flesh, blood and viscera was formed. There was a cacophony of screams, squeals and the sound of bones being crunched up.


I remember running away from that nightmare as fast as I could. It was cowardly, I know, but my self-preservation instincts took over.


I was found later, shivering and huddling myself up. Although I wasn't injured, I was nonetheless taken to the hospital for an examination and was made to sign a confidentiality agreement there.


No news on the incident ever surfaced, and the research programme was never talked about again. I never received any answers on what I witnessed, and was left to be haunted by visions of that day.


**The only advice I can give to you all after what I had experienced is: Stay away from dead whales that washed ashore. They might be hiding something terrible.**"

**Letters of Recommendation**

Pre Calc teacher (8/10). I wasn’t super close to him, but I participated a decent amount and had interesting discussions with him outside of class. When I informed him of my acceptances, he sent me the rec letter (I was really surprised). The letter was actually pretty sweet and spoke to my character/academic interests. 

Latin teacher (8/10). I had her for two years, and since I excelled in her classes and showed my true interest in Latin language/literature, I think she definitely liked me. She wrote my rec letters for a bunch of summer programs, which I was accepted to, so I’m assuming it was decent. 

Research professor (9/10). I’d been working with him since the end of tenth grade, so he was able to speak to my academic abilities, work ethic, and excitement about research. He told me he wrote that my work and character was comparable to his graduate students — was very touched to hear that.

&#x200B;

**Interviews**

Tbh, I thought all my interviews were just okay, not really that special. Most of them lasted for the allotted time and nothing beyond. I did go in prepared with responses to the typical, as well as questions for the interviewer. 

&#x200B;

**Essays**

I spent so much time on these. I poured my entire heart and soul into making sure they reflected my passions, goals, and overall just who I was as a person. My biggest tip is to START EARLY, especially if you’re applying to so many schools. I knew I was an extremely slow writer, always needing to put lot of thought into my words before I could afford to write them out, so I budgeted accordingly. I began working on my personal statement in July, started my supplements in August, and was working up until the January deadlines. For me, it really helped to read a bunch of examples online (thank you collegeessayguy), so that I knew how to tackle each school’s supplements. That being said, be careful that the examples don’t confine your ideas or limit your voice. Also, please do not overthink your personal statement. I know a bunch of people who started panicking about their personal statement days before the deadline and scrambled to rewrite it in a matter of days, but trust yourself, you’re likely overthinking. 

My personal statement was about my linguistics journey. My supplements varied, but I basically tried to write about my hobbies in a unique way. What’s funny is that I picked a controversial/political topic for the Princeton/Duke/Brown difficult conversation essay, but I got into all three???

&#x200B;

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

**Additional Information:**
In the additional information section, I put in some smaller awards that I didn’t have space for in the honors section. For schools that allowed it, I submitted a music portfolio. I also submitted my research abstract, and I think this was definitely a boost since it provided credibility for my research. Yale and MIT asked for thorough descriptions, so I used that space to convey what exactly the research entailed and why it was important to me. 

**Where I will be attending**: Honestly, I’m incredibly torn. My top choices rn are MIT, Yale, Princeton, and Stanford. I initially thought that without a question I would choose Stanford (I did REA there after all), but I’m also so in love with the others. If you all have any advice, please let me know in the comments — I’d love to hear your thoughts.

I’m just in shock and very grateful. Thank you A2C for all the tips and resources, couldn’t have done it without. 

Good luck to the Class of 2028! If you have any questions about the process, I can try to help."

Hello, guys

Please share your thoughts or opinions on these schools.

&#x200B;

I got admission to these schools:

UC Santa Cruz - MS CSE

Virginia Tech (NCR) - Meng CS

North Carolina State University - MCS

Arizona State University - MCS

Santa Clara University - MS CSE

San José State University - MS CS

&#x200B;

My main focus is to be able to find a job after graduation.

The schools that I am currently mainly considering are VT, UCSC, ASU, and NCSU.

Also, I'm a international student, and I don't have green card.

&#x200B;

\[Comparsion\]

&#x200B;

Virginia Tech (NCR) - MENG CS

 Pros:

* More reputable and higher ranking (although ranking may not mean much)
* Lower tuition cost

&#x200B;
 Cons:

* It’s not the main campus, therefore over half of the classes are remote classes, which is a significant drawback to me
* It may be challenging for me to find a job in Washington D.C. since most jobs there require either a green card or even U.S. citizenship

&#x200B;

UC Santa Cruz - MS CSE

 Pros:

* Has a campus and in-person classes, great environment
* Close to silicon valley

&#x200B;
 Cons:

* Higher cost, and I heard that the housing of UCSC is quite an issue
* After the pandemic, geographic advantage may not play a big role while seeking an internship or job nowadays

&#x200B;

NCSU

 Pros:

* Has a campus and in-person classes
* Based on the school's graduate employment report, it seems that the most students were able to find a job after graduation
* Seems to be a well-known engineering school, and from what I've seen on reddit, some people have said that it is a good school (better than ASU)

&#x200B;
 Cons:

* Living expenses don't seem to be much lower than in California

&#x200B;

ASU - MCS

 Pros:

* The employment situation for ASU graduates seems to be good

&#x200B;
 Cons:

* Larger batch size
* The weather

A family member had connected me with one of their friends, who happened to be part of a team developing an app. We had a really cool discussion about taking CS beyond high school and entering the industry. Eventually he offered to let me do some work on a feature in exchange for 50 bucks and insisted that I should call it a paid internship. It was my first time actually getting paid to code and I learned a bunch about the development process. However, I just realized that I didn't ask for a certificate or any other form of proof.

12fuzvf,3,2023-04-08,What do I do if I'm struggling to live?,kass__kalenn,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/12fuzvf/what_do_i_do_if_im_struggling_to_live/,"I don't know what's going on, but I feel that life is getting heavy, and this is starting to affect me. I don't want to get out of bed, I don't want to do my daily activities, my chores, I don't even have the energy to take a bath.

I don't want to do anything, I want to stop time. Everything makes me ""lazy"".

I have stopped doing things that I liked to do, and even things that are necessary. I'm a student (HS senior) and I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail my advanced exams next week because instead of studying I've been lying in bed all day wishing I wasn't born.

It's getting out of control, and I'm starting to realize it.

I'm thinking of turning down a research showcase I've always wanted to participate in, because I don't have the energy to do. I haven't interviewed for an internship because ""I'm lazy,"" but the reality is that I don't want to do it because I don't want to do anything right now. I haven't done anything I wanted to do because I'm unmotivated.

As I mentioned earlier, I am about to graduate, which means going to college. I was accepted to the college I always wanted to be at, but I'm seriously thinking about even going because I would have to move and I don't feel prepared to survive, since I lack many essential skills because of the way I was raised, and funding is an issue. Or at least that's what I tell myself, maybe I'm just scared to take that step and screw it up because of my lack of interest, just like the opportunities I have now.

I don't want to do anything, I decided I don't even want to go to my graduation, since ""it's not worth paying for it"" or so I tell myself.

I just don't have the energy for anything, and it's not even academic, it goes beyond that. I got sick like two weeks ago and I've been using it as an excuse to sleep more than eleven hours a day. Before I got sick I started having trouble falling asleep because my thoughts wouldn't leave me alone, now I sleep a lot.

My partner has told me that he worries about me, since I don't ""enjoy going out as much as I used to"" or that he ""sees me more tired"", and my acquaintances at school constantly ask me if I sleep well or if I feel well, since they notice me down or crestfallen.

I have isolated myself from my group of friends, we used to eat together but now I choose to go to a corner and stay alone.

I practically only talk to my partner, and I even notice a reduction in the intensity in which we used to do it.

I also noticed that I haven't had a cup of coffee in over three weeks. I used to drink even one cup daily, as I genuinely love the taste of coffee. I don't mind giving it up (one less drug, the better), but I worry that I no longer have the energy to make and pour myself a cup of what used to be one of my favorite beverages.

I don't know what's wrong with me, lately I feel like I've hit rock bottom. I'm just making excuses for everything. I'm lazy. 

I just don't understand why I can't be happy. I have my problems internally and at home, but we all do, I just feel like it's all out of control now and I want to cry. I don't want to face anything, I don't want to deal with my situations. I can't deal with myself.

Why can't I be happy? I have more or less a good life. I have a wonderful partner who loves me, I'm a student who has a good academic future, I was accepted to the university I always wanted and I'm doing well overall.

So why can't I visualize a future for myself? Why is it that every time I think about what comes next I just see lots of nothing?

Big changes are coming, but at this point I don't know if I want to live through them.

Why am I always sad and unmotivated? There is always a tear rolling down my cheek.

I don't know what to do anymore, how do I go on if I'm struggling to live?


This is just a rant, I apologize for the bad english. It's just that I'm starting to feel bad, and I need to get it off my chest one way or another."

12fw33e,2,2023-04-08,Looking for some advice on whether or not a Masters Degree in CS would be a good choice right now,PuppyStalker13,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/12fw33e/looking_for_some_advice_on_whether_or_not_a/," 

So I'm currently a Junior in computer science at an average state school, meaning that after I finish this semester, I'll have two more left before I graduate. I'm also working as an intern at a pretty well known National Laboratory.

At my job, my employer has offered me an opportunity where they will pay for my Master's degree for basically any school I can get into, along with giving me dental, health insurance, living stipend, and a 401k while in school. In return, I would be forced to work for them for two years after I graduated with my Masters.

Although I'm reasonably happy with the work that I'm currently doing, I don't think this is a place that I would want to work in after I graduate, if I had the choice. I've lived in the same town my whole life, and was originally looking to move somewhere else after I graduated. However, given the way that the job market looks right now, I'm seriously considering if this program would be a good option for me.

I've done some research on the value of a Masters degree in CS, and it seems to really only hold value for people working for the government, or international students, which I am not.

For context, I have very good grades, go to an average state school, and will have 4 years on internship experience when I graduate.

Any thoughts/advice?"

12g1no5,0,2023-04-08,I have the opportunity to become a dev but I am also afraid at the same time,Jdoobyy,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/12g1no5/i_have_the_opportunity_to_become_a_dev_but_i_am/,"Ever since my first internship, I’ve always feared coding. At my very first internship, I was tasked with building a peer-to-peer chat application, and all I knew was the basics of programming. My internship was a total disaster. Mentally, I was too stressed out because I couldn’t talk to any of my co-workers, and I couldn’t understand why, everyone seemed intimidating, and I was afraid of looking incompetent. I had a month to learn, and I failed. After a year, I realised I was socially anxious. My next job was a junior-level developer job. I had an excellent manager and good team members, and I was driven to learn. I felt confident enough to code. As a result, I was outgoing, took initiative, and even got a pay rise. I still don't know how I survived this job for 2 years, but it was not stressful for me. I was involved in a lot of things, from coding, fixing production-level issues, releasing, and testing.

I have been trying to learn coding by watching tutorials, but whenever I start with a tutorial, I manage to complete the basics and give up. I procrastinate a lot as well. Sometimes I wonder if I have ADHD. My main problem is that I have to understand every single keyword in order to write a program by myself; most of the tutorials don't go into detail. Throughout my self-study, I never really put much effort into building my own projects, debugging, or designing solutions. Or I just don't know how to begin, maintain interest, and learn. While i really want to learn it, and i have passion for it, it just doesn't seem to click for me because I have not put enough effort or interest.

My confidence has improved ever since I received my master's degree. However, even after getting a master's degree, I have not been brave enough to get a developer job. I have been working as a software test engineer for the past 2 years and have aced this job. I love to break things and find vulnerabilities; I even found vulnerabilities at the OS level. I integrated an automation framework from scratch for E2E integration testing all on my own. With half-done or incomplete test protocols, nothing was tested properly. I took the initiative and cleaned up everything, from re-writing hundreds of test protocols to designing new test cases. As a result, our software has zero crashes and hardly any bugs.

My manager and team lead want me to move into a developer role as they believe I have enough technical knowledge, but in reality, I feel I'm not competent enough to be a developer. Even though I'm still a tester, they told me to develop minor features, fix bugs, etc. The management is incredibly happy with the work I'm doing so far, and I'm afraid of ruining that. I asked my co-worker if she ever wanted to move into a dev role, and she replied that it was not for her. She is content with being a tester. I'm wondering if programming is not for me and If I'm making an empty promise.

I have a couple of months to learn react-native (I have basic knowledge of JavaScript). I don't know if I am able to do this. If I don't face this, I know I will never grow out of my comfort zone and will regret this immensely. I also feel this is something I should do to grow my confidence."
12g216n,27,2023-04-08,Some people keep deleting information about UT's rankings and statistics on wikipedia.,Top_Buddy_2440,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/12g216n/some_people_keep_deleting_information_about_uts/,"There used to be a few sentences in the general UT overview on wikipedia about UT's acceptance rate and competitiveness but some people have deleted them. I put a sentence back including the prestige of its programs in CS and business with links to various rankings and that person deleted them saying ""*we need sources that are much stronger than a single ranking from one year to justify including this in the lede""*  which is total BS because UT has been in the top concerning CS and Business for many years now. There used to be another sentence there saying that ""admission to its programs is selective"" and someone else deleted it saying that ""this sentence should only be on the pages of the top 10 universities"". Now the lede is very short and bland and only talks about LBJ library and olympic medals won by students.

I know some people might say ""who cares"" but it is really infuriating for me when I'm trying to apply to jobs or internships which are overseas as some countries do not know UT very well, they only know the big ivies.

Could we as longhorns help each other by standing up for our institution instead of letting a few people who seem to hold a personal grudge against UT (they probably didn't get in) belittle our reputation?

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

I am a fairly quiet student so my teachers don't know me all that well, but I'm a good student so I doubt they'd say anything bad. I have 2 teachers in mind (biology and world history) for writing recs. None of my CS/math teachers are emotionally available LOL so I don't want to ask them.

**Also ONE BIG THING TO NOTE....** I am a cancer survivor!!! Woohoo!!! only perk of going through cancer is to exploit it on my college apps!!

that's why my research projects revolve around cancer. I had cancer for a majority of my freshman year (which was also covid year). my grades didn't dip thankfully because my teachers were nice to me :) I plan to write my personal statement around how dealing with cancer has made me helped me develop my STEM interests and the morals/values I hold today.

**Schools (not including safeties)** *(all publics are oos)*: Ivies, Stanford, Georgia Tech, Purdue, UMich, UCLA, UC Berkeley, UCSD, Northwestern, JHU, USC

i also know that my ecs (and even my sat/ap scores) are kinda mid so yeah if u guys have any other target schools in mind that you think would be a good fit for me lmk! thanks for reading all of this!"
12g3z7m,2,2023-04-08,Internship worries,danicius,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12g3z7m/internship_worries/,"Internship worries

Hi everyone I am a student in CS and I tried my best to land an internship. The background is that I did attend a job fair for this company and they said they put my resume in review. I did apply to a position that sounded interesting to me which is like app development. I landed the interview and I knew nothing that the manager was talking about. I was honest with my responses and told me I know c++, Java etc. I was scared that I would get a coding question and that they will watch me but all they asked was simple C++ question such as “what is a pointer” etc.  I confidently answer those but no coding questions, I didn’t write any code. Weeks go by and I get an offer letter and of course I gladly accept since my other internship offers rejected me. What did I do right? Has anyone heard of this, is this internship sounding like they would just teach me on the job?"
12g4z37,70,2023-04-08,How I got off the UPenn waitlist (not clickbait) (legit) (not patched) (LOCI inside),thifting,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/12g4z37/how_i_got_off_the_upenn_waitlist_not_clickbait/,"Hello to the waitlisted youths of r/ApplyingToCollege. 

Just last year, I was in your shoes as well. I was waitlisted by Barnard, Colby, Cornell, Northeastern, NYU, UPenn, and Yale, so between those 7 waitlists (and 3 deferrals!) I spent a lot of time working on Letters of Continued Interest.

I **cannot** claim to be an expert at getting off waitlists. I've had a success rate of 1/7. There are almost definitely other factors involved in my getting off the waitlist, most of which were beyond my control. **HOWEVER** I have received a *lot* of messages asking me what I did, so this post exists for just that.

How did *I* get off the waitlist?

# Using readily available resources

Much like the average applicant, I did not have the funds to pay for private counseling or guidance in applying to college, let alone writing LOCIs. That said, I cannot recommend the [**ApplyingToCollege Wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/wiki/loci/) enough when it comes to writing these. I also made use of some online resources like College Essay Guy. 

# Presentation matters

Like many folks here, I did not have insane achievements between RD apps and results. I honestly wasn't someone who had the best awards and extracurricular activities to begin with. So, instead of focusing on updates like that, I gave colleges an update on my life and tied that into my desire to attend so and so school. 

This is my advice for writing essays, EC descriptions, and anything, really, college app wise. You could have an incredible extracurricular, but if you don't frame and present it in a way that truly highlights its importance, that's a missed opportunity. Similarly, if you have extracurriculars that are ""mid"" (as many users here have described mine, when explained very briefly), they can sound substantially better if you highlight what you took away from it, how you've applied your skills and passions through it, and how they've contributed to you and your aspirations. 

So, in a LOCI context, do the same. Don't undersell yourself. Frame your achievements and updates in a way that emphasizes their personal importance to you, and also maybe even how those achievements indicate qualities or skills about you that would benefit so and so college's community.

# Other LOCI-writing advice

If possible, figure out what colleges appreciate from their applicants. This may be easier said than done, and I personally wasn't able to do this myself, but I highly recommend it for anyone else. 

My [UPenn admissions file post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ydb2pb/i_viewed_my_upenn_admissions_file_and/) includes a run down of the metrics UPenn assesses its applicants on, the most relevant being:

* Match and Alignment
* Excellence of Mind (student pursuit of academic interests and achievements within school/community context)
* Impact in your Space (student as a catalyst for impact/involvement within school/community context)

Considering this, I would recommend writing your LOCI in a way that hits as many points as possible to adhere to a given school's priorities when admitting students. Retrospectively, I do believe my LOCI hit these points, especially M/A and I.

# General advice

Fall in love with your options. I honestly was not thinking about Penn, or any of my WL schools, because I fell in love with the school I was committed to at that point. Look into it, do more research, reach out to current students. 

This is because you'll almost definitely get rejected. The strongest LOCI cannot change the fact that WL admissions is super, super unlikely. Again, while I got into Penn, I was rejected from six of my other WL schools. Have realistic expectations.

That said.. this subreddit dooms and glooms about waitlist decisions. Yes, they have a low admissions rate. *But* they're indicative of huge strength in your application. Be proud of that—you're an incredible applicant.

# My LOCI

Ok, now the fun part. Here's a (redacted) version of my LOCI that I submitted to UPenn. Again, **please do not copy and paste it.** I doubt anyone who does would succeed because a lot of these details aren't applicable to most people. But, please do not plagiarize. If another person does your cycle, which is entirely possible, y'all could get into trouble. No good. The structure itself isn't unique, so feel free to take inspiration from that—it's just a bit of a standard letter.

>*I’d first like to thank you for spending the time to examine my application and ultimately deciding to offer me a position on UPenn’s waitlist. Although being waitlisted is bittersweet, I am infinitely grateful for the opportunity. As I prepare to be the first in my family to pursue higher education, having maneuvered through the application process alone, I wear my UPenn waitlist with pride.*  
>  
>*Since being waitlisted, I’ve spent a lot of time dwelling on my interview with recent UPenn alumnus \[my interviewer\]. We’d spent a lovely hour and a half discussing her experiences at UPenn, as a fellow woman of color, and how UPenn allowed her to build up her career and offer her the support needed to become a leader in her industry. Hearing her rave about the unique courses, academic freedom to learn near limitlessly, and warm, passionate community of driven students and thoughtful professors. At UPenn, she traveled the world and received the assistance needed for internships and careers-- all things I yearn to gain from my college experience. Of the many brilliant opportunities UPenn offered her and her peers, one of the things that stood out to me was the robust language department.*  
>  
>*Not only does UPenn facilitate becoming a polyglot, but it offers all three languages I’m dead set on pursuing: Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, and Bangla. I’ve developed an adoration for Latin American literature, history, and culture in my eight years of taking Spanish and have immensely enjoyed exploring Brazilian Portuguese independently, so the multifaceted courses UPenn offers in their romance department, with a specialized Portuguese language track for Spanish speakers, as well as the robust study abroad and internship opportunities in Latin America, making UPenn my top pick. Although I love studying languages, the one language that I’d never had the resources to learn was my mother tongue, Bangla. Since submitting my application, I’ve spent much of my free time caring for my grandparents. The language barrier hurts not just because of its rich history and connection to my Bengali identity, but also because it limits how much I communicate with and learn from my elders. UPenn is the only college with not just a uniquely thorough South Asian studies program, but Bengali courses on every level UPenn’s remarkable attention to cultural studies and course flexibility is a language lover's dream.*

Again, I didn't have any insane accomplishments and just did work for clubs as usual, so I spent most of my letter providing updates on my life and why I really wanted to go to Penn.  

Yes, this is longer than a page by quite a bit (almost 1.5 pages), but I still highly recommend keeping LOCIs to about one page anyway. 

# FAQ about my LOCI/applications in general

**When did you submit it? Is sooner better?**

I submitted mine April 17th, 2022—about 3 weeks after getting waitlisted. Some colleges (including Penn) have deadlines for additional material, but besides that the time you submit isn't going to be the biggest factor in getting off the waitlist.

**When did you hear back?**

May 6th, 2022. I do know some WLers who heard back as late as August, though.

**What major did you apply for?**

Political Science

**Why were you admitted?**

Admissions file post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ydb2pb/i_viewed_my_upenn_admissions_file_and/). tl;dr: I was jus kinda cool like that idk

**Letters of Recommendation**

Calc Teacher (8/10). Really nice and took a good amount of time to write each of her letters for her students. She didn't really like me as much as other students because I didn't volunteer in class as much, but I  did help others a lot in the classroom. 

AP Lang Teacher (2/10). I thought I was a pretty good and memorable student in her class, but she ended up forgetting about me until the weekend the letters were due :( . 

Mathcounts Supervisor (7/10). She was really nice, but I think a lot of the work I did got unnoticed and confused with what others did. I didn't really have the heart to claim everything I did as my own even though it was the case. *I also accidentally confused her tampon bag as a student's pencil case and tried to give it to a student looking for their missing pencil case... oops.* 

**Interviews**

**MIT** (3/10). My interviewer was wack and didn't ask me any questions. I just started blabbing around the most random topics, and it was awkward. 

**Northwestern** (8/10). I thought it was pretty good. We went over the expected time, and he said I was a strong student.

**Princeton** (4/10). Some tech issues plus I couldn't really connect.

**Essays**

Common App (8/10). It wasn't the best piece of writing you would see, but it was genuine and from the heart. I spent several months on this, and I thought it was pretty decent albeit a little generic. 

Supplementals (6/10). I thought they were alright. 

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* *Rhode College RD*
* Purdue EA 
* Notre Dame RD (committed)

*Waitlists:*

* *Georgia Tech RD :(*
* Vanderbilt RD

*Rejections:*

* *Cornell RD*
* Columbia RD
* UPenn RD 
* Yale RD
* Princeton RD
* Northwestern RD
* Northeastern RD (ew)
* CMU RD
* MIT EA defer

**Additional Information:**

I think one of my recs being really generic and having fairly generic essays hurt me a lot. I probably should have interacted with my teachers some more and made sure that they remember me instead of just hoping. Also, my essays could probably be a little better, but I felt like they're already really genuine. It just kinda sucks that being yourself isn't sometimes enough. I'm happy to end up at Notre Dame, but that acceptance wasn't even all that special to me considering I had some connections that basically guaranteed my spot there. 

Slightly disappointed in my results since I know many friends with similar profiles who got into hypsm or other good CS schools like CMU and Cornell, but I'll live. It won't be in any spectacular dream or fairy tale, but that's how it is for most students."

I am trying to decide between the University of Minnesota, Florida State University, and Stony Brook University. All of them are for master's in statistics. 

I am inclined to UMN because it's in a very big city that has many healthcare companies and former graduates have had success in getting internships and jobs in the city. It's also the best ranked in statistics (#13 US News). It also has a 17 cohort size per year which is small and nice. The weather sucks though.


FSU is very sought after for undergrad because it's in a nice weather and being a party school. It also has thesis option. However, It's in a small city, so I fear less internship and job opportunities.


SBU is in new york, but it's statistics ranking is quite low. 


What do y'all think? Any insights and factors I need to consider? Cost doesn't matter for me at all (es
pecially tution cost).

I’m a student currently entering my third year of college. I have just been focused on school work for the longest time. Now that many classes are behind me I’m looking at what I want to do. It seems there are many directions I can take with my degree. Currently I am liking software but I also like building circuits and doing complex circuit analysis. 

I also have a certificate for architectural design I got in high school. Which stemmed from my love for auto-cad. 

Not sure what internships to look into and there doesn’t seem to be much near me. There is a Boeing plant, but the only internship open there is for HBCU. 

If I had to pick now I would be leaning towards the software side. I took a class in C++ and other classes in Java. Learning python for personal reasons. Where do I look for any beneficial internships that will help me land an entry level job?"

12g8x4i,1,2023-04-09,I am having the worst job search ever despite my resume good. Any field to try outside the legal field?,washurhands123,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12g8x4i/i_am_having_the_worst_job_search_ever_despite_my/,"I am IT major in college and graduated 2020 with my Bachelor's. I will not get into details, but I do not care for the IT field. I worked as a legal administrative assistant part time at a small dying law firm during my last two years of college (the firm shut down in 2020 due to the attorneys retiring). Then I moved to the Bay Area to start this project based position setting up data centers, but then that company gave me a contract position doing data center work. I had trouble finding a full time job, so I ended up doing an internship where I operated a robot test radioactivity in phones, then I landed my current and first full time job ever, which is an assistant immigration paralegal job at a large immigration law firm in San Francisco. I love the legal field and it is something I love to do, but this job is toxic and the main thing is the awful commute to San Francisco from the East Bay every day and I am overworked, because me and this one other woman are the only smart and non-lazy people on my team.

I  dream of getting a remote job and moving back to the East Coast where I am from and living somewhere quieter. Everything seems to be saturated. I am desperate to get another job due to how toxic this job. I even looked for jobs locally and everything seems to be more saturate d than the remote jobs. I only had  few interviews back in early 2022 and the last interview I had was October 2022, so this is the worst job search I ever had. I have made so many edits to my resume and had [Rezi.ai](https://Rezi.ai) due some of the resume writing for me and I even paid to get my resume reviewed and got  some advice from my college's career development people. 

However, most of the original young people from the law firm I work at no longer work at the firm and most found jobs in non-toxic places and they are lucky since they live in ""the city"" itself where white collared jobs are plentiful and a commute is not an issue. I keep in touch with few of the former people I originally worked with and one of them told me I am just ""pushing the books"", since I come home from work every day mass applying to jobs (even tailoring my resume to individual legal job postings does not help) and he said I should look outside the legal field. I do not want to quit the job and do ""career suicide"" before my parents find out and plus I am buying a car in June. Any jobs outside the legal field where I can use my legal field experience? I even made a second resume for tailoring my resume to legal recruiting or legal hr job positions."
12g9vpp,36,2023-04-09,"CS major here, feeling a bit regretful",R3e3ee,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/12g9vpp/cs_major_here_feeling_a_bit_regretful/,"Hey guys, so I got a bit of baggage I was hoping someone could clear up. I'm graduating this semester with a CS degree. Which should be a cause of celebration. But I honestly really regret it, I feel like I locked myself out of so many cool job opportunities by majoring in CS.

A little more about me: I've been taking classes with the ECE kids over the last few semesters, which helped me realize my passion for CE. I took an FPGA class, an OS class, and did well in both. I also started learning embedded programming and computer architecture, which really changed my view of how awesome low level stuff is. Not to mention stuff like RF or signal processing (which is way over my head, and is probably way too late for me to chase by now). I would change majors but at my school (UIUC) you only have 3 semesters to switch into engineering, and I missed that deadline. Stupid freshman year me was scared of circuits and physics lol

I do have a job lined up in generic SWE. It's in the bay area, and also with a kinda-hardware company (Cisco), which is hopefully gonna help me to network. But I'm afraid I'll be stuck doing software for the rest of my career. I know software has higher pay and more roles, but I'd rather do something I love and get paid a little less for it.

So my question is, how can someone like me start to work towards my suspected passion for CE? I think ideally I would like to land an FPGA or verification internship somewhere. After lurking this sub for a while, it seems like these fields have the most ""entry-level"" roles. But it sucks because I'm out of school now so I can't get internships. Also, I have a feeling I won't be considered seriously for any hardware related roles because I'm not an ""engineer"". Feels bad man.

In order to be eligible for internships again, I was thinking of going back to school. I thought of doing another bachelors, but people seem to suggest doing a masters. So I thought of doing a masters in CE on my employer's dime, seeing as most hardware companies want masters degrees anyways. But the problem is, most masters programs in ECE want ECE bachelors only. So I feel like I'm out of luck there, unless I'm mistaken. Also my GPA is a little subpar (it might be as low as 3.3) I'll probably still apply but idk if I can get in.

In the meantime, I've been learning some verification stuff like UVM, and also embedded stuff like RTOS. With enough practice, could a CS guy interview his way into those roles? Or will employers just ghost me because of my major?

I guess I'm looking for any advice or personal stories (if there even are any) of people in my situation who have made the switch (which I'm guessing is rare, most CS people go straight to software without any second guessing). Do you guys know of any CS folk who have pivoted to traditionally HW style jobs like verification after graduation? How'd they go about it?

Thanks!

Edit: OK thanks guys 🙏"

**Additional Information:** This application cycle was super nice for me. My rejections (as many as there were) really never hit me hard, but my successes felt amazing. The few, out-of-the-blue acceptances, namely Colby (6% WTF?, Rutgers' Honors College (7% WTF?), and Northeastern (I know they deported me to Oakland for my first year but whatever shut up), as well as some of the random waitlists like UW Seattle and NYU, were welcome and honestly slightly reassuring. My self-esteem never really dipped; my expectations were just validated. I think I knew where I stood as far as applicant potential, which is why this process hasn't really ""humbled"" me necessarily.

I'm super happy about my results. As far as the application process, I wouldn't have changed a thing. I honestly just shotgunned because I didn't know what else to do for fun LOL and I really enjoyed the essay writing process. But between my options, I had been super confused. It's been really hard to decide (particularly Rutgers put up a really hard fight), but I'm finally **committed** >!to UMD!<\*\*!!\*\*

It's been fun! And yes, the ""t20"" in the post title referred to t20 CS hehe (I love UMD) <3"

I'm currently interning with the startup Talentserve and I'm in a dilemma about whether I should continue with them or not. When the company came to our campus, they offered fancy roles, and I was asked to join the finance department. However, when the internship started, we were all asked to do sales work without any leads or proper business data being given. When I asked for financial data, my manager dismissed the idea as being non-sensible. To make matters worse, we were asked to do web scraping of contact data of customers and organizations for cold email purposes and telecalling from websites on the internet. The company doesn't have customer data, and no leads were provided to us.

On top of that, the VP of the company doesn't reply, and even after asking multiple times, we haven't received access to the course they are selling. We are also expected to work overtime even in the first week and have no weekends off. To make matters worse, my manager is very rude and threatening. When I told him I wouldn't be available for a meeting on a Saturday evening due to other commitments, he proceeded to threaten me and even said that he would write to the recruitment cell of my college.

The company also inflates their numbers on their website and has fake/bought followers on YouTube and LinkedIn. I heard that they have been blacklisted in another college, and apparently, they don't give their interns their stipend and certificate when targets are not reached. However, their targets are unrealistic, making it nearly impossible to achieve them. Their reviews are really bad (2.5 stars on glass door) and people are calling them fraudulent.

I'm in a tight spot as I need to complete an internship for college, but I'm not sure if Talentserve is the right place for me. What do you think? Should I continue with this company or look for another internship? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!"

I'm in my first year of my undergraduate degree and I'm now looking (*and stressing*) on ways to get a career in finance. Unfortunately, I've missed the spring weeks and I'm hoping I could get some internships this summer to boost my resume. However when looking at the websites for Bulge Bracket banks for their divisions and jobs they have on offer, the job descriptions are very vague and very similar to each other - the word ""analyst"" appears a lot!

Honestly, I'm still undecided on which finance career I want to pursue - Honestly, I would love to work on the Sales and Trading division where I research and execute trades (I believe this is called prop trading) but I heard that's incredibly hard to get into but it is something I am very interested in. However, even within ""prop trading"", there are so many different careers.

Considering that I am studying Computer Science, I could possibly pursue a Quant position - however my programming skills are very basic and I would have to spend a few months to get my programming knowledge to a sufficient level. However, my Excel skills are pretty good but I don't think that matters that much for a Quant.

I've also considered pursuing an equity research analyst career but from what I understand, the analysts only provide recommendations or market updates and not actual strategies for their clients to implement/follow.

Please can you give me reccomendations on financial careers I could be pursuing?

Regarding internships, there's nothing available from the Bulge Brackets so I'm hoping to get an internship from a smaller IB but what internships should I be pursuing as well  - I've read that an internship from a lesser known bank but which is more relevant is better than an irrelevant internship from a big name company. Obviously, it's not a rule set in stone...  


Thanks for reading."

Even if I can't get an internship for next year (since most of the applications start now), what are the exact steps and courses I should follow to be internship ready by early next year.

Should I do an EDX/Coursera course or FreeCodeCamp programs? Is there a particular course/group of courses you would recommend I do.

TLDR : Tech GT, Telecom GT, CMI or Market Analyst role in order to become a Management/ Digital Transformation Consultant


Hello! I’m a graduating Business Student (with Latin Honors) and i’m having a hard time deciding what I should do for my job offers.

Context :
I have done my fair share of internships (locally and internationally) under Digital Marketing. 
Now that i’ve rotated around most functions in Marketing, i’ve realized that its not for me. I’ve always had an interest in tech (obvious in my internships as well since i mostly worked in tech companies) and data. My overall goal is to work as a business analyst, then a consultant (either Management or Digital Transformation) 

I’ve gotten 4 offers, and they’re all expiring in the same week. 
1. Grad Trainee for Telecom (Intl.)
2. Consumer Insights Executive for MR company
3. Grad Trainee for Tech Dept @ Intl. Investment Bank
3. Market Analyst for MR company. 

In order to pivot towards my consultancy dreams, which would be the best stepping stone?

**Letters of Recommendation**

Didn't get to read them but if I had to estimate:

AP Physics 1 teacher: 9/10 We had such a good relationship in class. I gelled with him well and I always went to him for help after class; I just hope he's doing okay since he disappeared after junior year.

Everyone else was nothing special. I'd probably give like a 6-7/10. I'm generally well-liked by my teachers but didn't have a crazy connection with them or anything.

**Interviews**

Imperial College London: 4/10 I went in somewhat unprepared and had to do a lot of thinking out loud; my interviewer promted me several times for help when I was going to get to that same revelation had he given me time. I did everything set out successfully but came out of it feeling like shit.

**Essays**

US Personal Statement: 9.5/10 I spent the most time working on this essay and I feel like it paid off. I explored my hobbies of chess and singing, and connected them to computer science and my identity by uniting them under the shared banner of ""creating value more than the sum of the inputs"". Popped off on this one.

UK Personal Statement: 8/10 I basically just reused UC 6 for this one and expanded on it lol? I've done a lot of computer science so it was easy to write (read: I infodumped about the chess engine I'm building for Advanced Independent Research Colloquium and about coding competitions)

Supps: overall 7-8/10. Most of it was pretty basic? I'd weigh my early schools closer to 8/10 and my later schools closer to 7/10. I feel pretty good about all of them, but none of them strike me the same way my PSes do.

*Conclusions*

Overall, I was initially disappointed with my results (especially about CMU and Purdue, which my college counselor said I had a really good shot of getting into), but after checking out this sub I now know just how underqualified I am for the schools I was shooting to (especially with my lackluster ECs, how the hell do you do research before senior year?!). Still, the UK surprised me with Imperial and Durham, and I've got a few really good options in the USA that I'll have to consider. I don't know where I'm gonna commit, but I'm very excited about the roads that lie ahead of me.

*Edit: Post-committing*

I’ve officially committed to UMD!! I’m a future Terp now! I would elaborate more on my thought process but it is 2am and I have a research paper due in a week so here are my general thoughts:

- If at all possible, visit the campuses you get into, whether that’s in person or virtually. I had the opportunity to visit all the schools I got into, and I fell in love with UMD’s campus and vibe. Everyone seemed happy on campus, school spirit was high, and I felt that I had found what I wanted to get out of college there.

- Talk to current students!!! This was the big one for me. I chatted with CS students at UMinn, ImperialX and UMD, and really got a view of the school from the people enrolled. I got all my questions answered, and it really helped me make a decision. If you (for some ungodly reason) see this, thank you Nandini, Neil, and Arav!!

I’m excited for my future at UMD. Provided Iribe doesn’t collapse, I’m confident I can make the most of the opportunities UMD provides to bloom into the best self I can be."

Bear with me... I work in IT industry. Back in 2019, due to foolish management decisions our amazing company (with the best people and best workplace and best environment) was forced to sell-off leading to massive global lay-offs (albeit with lots of money to people who were laid off).

I was forced to look for a job as we were in the midst of selling off the old apartment and acquire a new one. Finally after 100s of applications got a new job.   


It was a bit different than the old one but as the set up for the project(s) was totally new, it was a good learning experience, initially.

I was a mid-level employee, one step below the lead. All was going well and then we hit lockdown (Covid). We started working from home with rotational shifts. The work was amazing. The team started increasing as the workload did and I (and a dear friend) used to be right hand for the manager and leads for trainings and handling priority work. 

Then came the micro-management, the horrible politics, undermining the capability of the team members. Not just from the leads, the manager, but the project head too.

We were asked to submit an email with what tasks were performed and how much time it took, at the end of the day. Had to sit to numerous rant meetings and listen to unnecessary escalations. Work started getting boring, useless and non-learning as we were forced to do the same things day-in day-out (btw this kind of work is not exactly what the team should be doing with our skillset).

Meanwhile, as I was due for promotion and was working really hard at whatever I was given, I was promoted to lead with another friend.

And then we got to know the real politics. I never mind doing any kind of work but we were expected to do literally entry level stuff (which an intern can do) just because we were the right and left hand for the manager and we were trusted a bit more than others. 

Leaves (which are a part of contract) were questioned, sick leaves too. Moreover questions were raised if any of team member contracted covid and was hospitalized. 

The work environment became so toxic that many employees were frustrated. We saw 4 back to back resignations.

My husband got to know about this and told me outrightly that if need be, I should feel free to resign without a job in hand if I want to. I had his full support to do whatever was best for my mental health. (I cried once or twice due to the work situation)  


We were made to extend work hours by 2-3, sometimes 4-5, and still somehow the whole team got bad reviews. Our small breaks, lunch breaks were monitored from minute to minute (even when we had enough strength to not hamper work if breaks got extended by 5 minutes)

I made my decision to start looking out and gave a few interviews. Finally got an amazing opportunity and resigned. This came a blow to the team and many had already resigned and I was the most tenured in the project. My friend meanwhile moved on to a different role and we were free from the toxic environment.

&#x200B;

This may not seem as toxic (after I reread my post) by my style of writing, but believe me, I still am in touch with my ex-team members and people who have resigned are really happy.

&#x200B;

**TLDR; I'd like some advice/personal stories about how to expand my network as a SWE.** 

I am a self-taught SWE (graduated last summer with Economics BSc). I think I placed too much weight on preparing for the technical aspect of jobs and interviews that I didn't put enough time into building relationships with Computer Science students at both my/other universities. 

My ultimate goal is to be in a position where I consistently meet ambitious people or those that just love technology. The type of people that I can learn from or that I could start working on that crazy start-up idea with. Also, I want to be able to refer others/be referred for opportunities as I think its important for career security/progression.

Currently, I stay in touch with those that I currently work with as well as those from previous internships, which has been great friendship-wise, but I feel that there is definitely more that can be done on my part to benefit my professional career.

How do I improve my networking as a SWE?

Excited to hear what everyone has to say! :)"

1. Is the program ever hectic since the duration of the program is only a year? I am an international student and would like to do a job after graduation, so will I have enough time to prepare for interviews?
2. What is the job scenario at the program? Does everyone land a job?
3. Since we cannot do internships does it affect us in a negative way during interviews?
4. Is the brand name really worth the cost? Should I consider other options?  


**PS: Please note that my main aim is to get a job after graduation.**"

I did a few internships in college (1 at a big blah) and worked for about 1.5 years after graduating, at another “big blah” company. I got super depressed during covid and just straight up ghosted them. 

I had a ton of savings that I lived off of for over year and a few months ago went back into the job search and got only one interview which was only because the hiring manager read the dates on my resume wrong and thought I was still working there presently. I’ve now been working at an unrelated job that I enjoy making 11$ an hour for the past few months and while it’s been great for my mental health I’m starting to get sick of it.

Any advice on how to approach this situation? Am I just locked out of the industry now? Should I join a shitty contracting company like Revature to get my foot back in the door? (Part time does sound appealing). Thank you!"

Obviously, things like previous SWE internship experience is going to go into the Experience section of the resume, and things like a club leadership position will go into a Leadership/Extracurriculars/Volunteering section. However, if you're a developer/officer for a software development club on campus, where would y'all put that, especially if one did a lot of technical things in that position?

&#x200B;

The second is a bit harder, but what about teaching assistant positions? While not directly an engineering role, I worked with a lot of important CS concepts like OOP, testing, and algorithms, so I wasn't sure if that would go into an Experience or Leadership section.

I have taken coursework focused on ML/Data Science/Cloud. I started applying for summer internships (mainly in Data Engineering/Data Science/ML) from December 2022 (pretty late) but was still lucky enough to be shortlisted for 10+ interviews (made it past the initial OA/HireVue). Out of these, I made it to the final round for 5 roles but was unfortunately rejected in all of them.

I am learning from these experiences and modifying my CV/skillset accordingly, but it seems too late for a Summer 2023 internship now. Keeping that in mind, I have secured a Research Assistantship at a lab at my university for the Summer but will still keep on applying for internships till the end of this semester.

To not make the same mistake I did with summer internship applications, I want to be early in applying for full-time roles after I graduate, but I am confused about when to start applying for them. Is it too early to start applying for new grad roles, or should I get started now?

Note: I have 1 year of full-time work experience as an entry-level Data Engineer at a big IT company, and I'm targeting similar roles. Also, I want to ask whether I should start applying for full-time roles now, along with internships for this summer.

Please feel free to ask about details I might have missed, and I'll edit my post accordingly; or to suggest other subreddits that are more suitable for my query.

I'm new to this field and I'm currently working as an intern. I'm working on an object detection and recognition project where I have a bunch of images with objects and their mapping to their corresponding class. I have implemented the classical Torch pipeline with the Dataset and Dataloader and I have the training and evaluation loop. But I've noticed that it takes some times to load and process the images and if I'm not careful with the batch size I easily completely use the memory of the GPU not leaving much room for the model.

My tutor told me to look into Zarr arrays so here I am. It says on the library's documentation that it loads the arrays chunk by chunk, but since we're feeding these arrays to a model, wouldn't it load the whole array and would be the same as loading a png file?

I have just launched the code to convert all my images to Zarr arrays but the result folder is still quite big. I have still not launched the retraining so I'm not quite suite how it'll work out though.

I hope someone can clarify some of these misunderstandings for me, thank you!"

UW community essay- 7/10, UW AO also reviewed this one and liked it (suggested tweaks were also really small here) but I thought it sounded petty (gave it the 7 because everyone except me thought it was fine) 💀 I wrote about how I thought the kids at my schools deca chapter were gonna be massive douchebags but how being the angel i am I vowed to be kind to them even if they weren't kind to me (again so fucking cringe idk how this essay flew) but then I was surprised to find everyone was hella nice

UC essays- 9/10, wrote about coming to terms with my hearing problems, using chemistry in cooking, learning about food deserts and learning how to work well with introverts as an extrovert- i really liked these essays and my counselor did too

**Additional Information:**

Got some shitty grades (two more Bs than I usually get in a year and a fat C- in AP calc AB 💀) because my mom was hella sick and a relative died, also mildly hard of hearing due to a processing disorder, but it didn't affect my grades too badly

Conclusions: I'm chilling pretty hard 😎 UW was kinda my realistic dream school and is def affordable for my family so I'm happy lol. I'm happy I got to get my essays reviewed (not sure if I would have gotten in otherwise, apparently essays at UW are hella important and this year admissions were pretty brutal), and I'm also glad I had a private counselor to guide me- she helped a lot. 

For UC's I think what ultimately screwed me was my grades- my school is stupidly competitive and everyone applies to UCs, so I probably was just below average compared to other kids at my school. I wasn't too sad tho, because there's no way I could have afforded any UC schools 😭

Anyways go dawgs!!"
12h2ali,2,2023-04-09,Eh... what now?,Disastrous_Trust6563,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/12h2ali/eh_what_now/,"**Some disclaimers before I begin to tell you anything**:

1st, this is a ""champagne problems"" rant. I understand my problems are common, insignificant, and fixable. 

2nd, I am an average (some would even say mediocre) student. My GPA is a regular -A. I went test-optional and had some nice(ish) extracurriculars (no Nobels, Grammys, or Fields medals). I understand that makes me absolutely insignificant in a world filled with amazing people. 

3rd, I am an international student who asked for aid, so pardon any English mistakes I commit on the way. 

4th (edit), I am just looking for some support, and I value every comment. If you decide to, thank you for reading :)

Disclaimers are up! If you feel like going on, thank you for reading/letting me bother you. 

**Storytime! (w/ lots of oversharing)**

I grew up middle-class in Latin America and had parents who always sacrificed everything they had for my education (I am eternally grateful for them and thank them every day). I was a nerdy kid, always had decent grades, suffered some heavy bullying (out of how annoying this text sounds, you can guess why), got over the bullying, etc. Since middle school, I have dreamed of going to university abroad. It was a way I found to have some aspiration in waking up every morning besides being mocked at school. It was my ultimate goal, which drove almost every decision I'd make in the following years. I learned to speak two languages (other than my native and English) and always tried my best to get extracurriculars within reach. During the first years of high school, I was top of my class and interned at two local universities as an assistant and independent researcher. During my time at those universities, I got to publish an article and worked really hard to get some projects done. More than the internships, a friend and I also started an NGO to help unprivileged young adults to study for their GEDs (there were some heartwarming stories and partnerships out of this). I was also a TA for a class at my high school and volunteered at some other organizations and projects around my state. 

Mid-pandemic, I received the opportunity to move to a suburb in the Northeast of the US for my junior year. My parents found a way to make ends meet, and at 16, I moved by myself with a suitcase and a dream (how cliché that is). I was far from a top student during my junior year but finished with an -A GPA. I founded a club, joined debate, and even attended national-level tournaments (I didn't win but had a blast). My visa was about to end (there's a federal law that allows international students to stay only ten months at K-12 public institutions), and I managed to transfer to a private school for my senior year (which was surprisingly hard). I was staying in the US for my senior year, and the dream was ""working."" On the other hand, my mental health deteriorated, and I missed my family, language, Latin American sunshine, warmth, and all that jazz you hear Latino immigrants complain about.  

But I stayed. 

I am working my way through a curriculum that is harder than what I was used to in my homeland and my previous US school. I adapted to a 3rd school in 3 years, founded another club, kept decent grades, and applied to an American college. I am not unique, but I have a story to tell. More than my immigration cliché, I was a social sciences nerd, a bullied kid, and most importantly, a happy (burnt-out) child. 

Results came in, and they were.... tragic. I feel like absolute garbage, or worse. I know I'm not outstanding, but I'm feeling like I should have just partied my way through high school and enjoyed life a little more. I can't afford the two schools I got into, was waitlisted at some schools I was really excited about, and was rejected by all the T20 I had applied to. 

""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger,"" right Kelly? 

I don't know if it actually made me stronger. What I do know is that I have nowhere to go and don't have the energy to finish senior year. I am exhausted. I took off energy from myself that I didn't have. I spent money my parents almost didn't have. And now, here I am, wishing I had never boarded that lonely plane in the first place. I guess people like me aren't truly allowed to have their dreams come true. 

WOW! Thanks for staying all the way until here! Thank you for taking your precious time to get to know me :D

I would very much appreciate some comments, suggestions, \*consolation\*, and similar stories, or even if you want to roast me more than the T20 Schools, feel free to call me a spoiled little failure. Anyways, thanks again, and I hope things work out better for you than they did for me. 

All the best,

I currently work 32 hours a week, take 19 hours of classes, finishing my senior engineering thesis, and am attempting to stay alive. I'd shoot for a 324+ with prep but I've worked my ass off in undergrad to get these internships, a good GPA, and have already gotten my rec letters - I've wanted this for as long as I can remember & it sucks to think the GRE is going to be my downfall.

I pushed my GRE as far back as I could which wasn't smart given how poorly I did with no chance of a retake before the application deadlines. I essentially raw-dogged this exam, only covering basic formulas the night before, so now I'm asking for honest feedback if it would even be mildly worth it to apply. I can potentially push back my graduation by a bit to apply for next year's cycle but I don't know if it would make a drastic difference. I know I can get a higher score by at least 5 points, potentially 10 with dedicated studying. 

**Below are a rough description of my stats:**

* URM, Female
* Low income

**Work Experience:**

* Full-time offer with one of the biggest processor companies (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, etc;)
* Worked at biggest hardware company (kind of FAANG adjacent?) to contribute to internal software efforts to build omniverse graphics
* Worked at large semiconductor company in high-performance computing space to build runtime and processing power test automation for the fastest supercomputer in North America
* Working at series B startup to develop machine learning algorithms and data engineering support
* Worked at national labs to determine if the current file system architecture for machine learning and deep learning information throughput could be accelerated, gained security clearance

**School:**

* Large public state school ranked in the top 10 for Electrical & Computer Engineering
* 3.65/4.0 GPA

**ECs:**

* President of Women in Electrical & Computer Engineering
* Research assistant in robotics lab that worked on HCI
* Kleiner Perkins Engineering Fellow
* Visual Search Engine startup

Hi I am a first (basically second) year computer science student based in Toronto, Canada and I am planning to apply to Software Engineering and just tech co-op/internships in general.

This is the resume I have so far, and yes I am finishing up an internship right now which will be completed before June. I plan to polish up this resume and start using it next year. Any general advice, or specific points I can improve would be highly appreciated! I have been working on this resume for a while now."

Update: had a meeting with my boss. I told them I would accept and internship extension as a part time internship. Now I work four hours for them 5 days a week. The internship is on  flexi time, so I can work whenever I want. I also had a meeting with the CEO and he says he has no doubt this will lead to a paid position. Currently I am applying for other jobs that pay well to keep myself afloat. Not sure what this company will pay me  because they gave me the bullshit excuse that ""doing work you love and are passionate about should not be about the pay"" so I'm searching for better opportunities. I figured I'd just continue the internship for less hours so I can search for better employers, but also keep this in my back pocket in case I don't find something else. I also DONT feel i gained much from this internship so if I find a better job, I have no problem terminating this internship. Thanks for all that gave me guidance. 

I've been doing an unpaid internship for 5 months. It just ended and now I'm being asked for an extension. No other details were given to me except, ""would you consider an internship acceptance?"" My boss has also said that due to the company budget they are not entirely sure if they can bring on another employee but are interested in bringing me on as they are impressed with my work. 

I can't keep working for free and i definitely don't want to waste more time tbh.

What are the chances of a hire in your opinion? 

Is an extension a good or bad sign?

Do you think it's best to find another job/paid internship since I'm not too sure how stable this will be if the company budget is hurting?"
12h6r06,2,2023-04-10,I've probably fucked up my brain/mentality for good. 21[M],KaioBlizz,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/12h6r06/ive_probably_fucked_up_my_brainmentality_for_good/,"21(M) college student here. Studying Comp Sci and I won't lie that I chose it at first because it makes good money, and tech stuff was something everyone around me said I would probably want to study once I grew up out of comments I made.

Thing is, I enjoyed it on my first couple of courses. I loved learning new data types, new commands, using them to create something that does what I asked it to. Whenever I got an error it was like a puzzle, spending my time outside of the computer spinning it around to think what went wrong.

But of course, that wasn't all that it was. There was math. Lots and lots of math courses. I didn't interact in my software classes and to this day I still don't, but it was meant to be required, I guess. It got to the point where I ran out of comp sci courses yet there were far, far more math and science courses before I got to ""unlock"" the prereqs for more comp sci classes. 

It was horrible, I did everything I could and there were times where I fucked up the course. I didn't care about learning anymore, I panicked and I only cared about surviving no matter the cost. It's what 1 or 2 years of college became for me. ""Survive math courses"". I lost all spark and interest for the career I picked because whenever I looked at my schedule I saw nothing of coding, it was all math. I tried coding on my free time but the stress of the math procedures I didn't understand ate me alive. Learn a language during break? No, look more at the math. That mentality kept going and I just kept telling myself ""Just survive until you are back there, to the things you enjoy.""

And this semester I made it. This past semester I had 2 coding classes... and I don't care anymore. I don't care about anything, classes have become survival. Having to listen to classes through a fucking computer doesn't help either. I find no joy on these things anymore and instead I find stress. Not understanding something in coding no longer makes me curious where I went wrong, it makes me panic and rush to every book and website for the answer. Now I don't care about enjoying anything anymore, just surviving. Sometimes I worry it's bleeding into my lifestyle too.

I have to keep going. I see all these people with internships, with success, with drive... I don't have that anymore, I lost it and I don't even have time to look for it because any time I don't use either distracting myself with a hobby or friends or working on projects I panic. Shit, writing this will probably mean no sleeping for me due to the anxiety.

Idk what to do, the only reason I am posting this is because my lack of drive now got to the point I am unable to give it my all on coding group projects. This isn't even for my self worth. It's because I don't want to screw others up. I want someone to pick me up but anyone who could have done that about my career has since left me or just doesn't like talking about it because it stresses them too."

I've come back to school for my MS and would be working on Networking during my Internship and after having explored the area a bit, I am really looking forward to it.

How do you keep yourself curious and happy with things you have to work with? How do you remove the drudgery of things? I'm scared that this is what will happen after I am in Industry long term.

Hey everyone,

I'm excited to share that I just landed my first IT internship! I'm eager to learn as much as I can during my time there.

I wanted to reach out to the Reddit community to see if anyone has any tips or advice for succeeding as an IT intern. Im a 3rd-year student majoring in cybersecurity a question I have is will this help me a lot in the future for my job search after I graduate?

If anyone has any recommendations for resources or best practices, I would greatly appreciate it. I'm eager to make the most of this opportunity and start my career in Cybersecurity on the right foot.

Thank you in advance for your help and advice!"

Im currently 24 and a recent Geography Bsc. Grad in Canada that focused on the geomatics side of geog with an emphasis on GIS and Remote sensing. 

I went in to geography with the idea of one day getting into urban planning, but after interning with government and reading plenty of horror stories from urban planners, I realized the bureaucracy and other aspects may just not be for me.

I consider myself a pretty driven person and quite a hard worker who can accomplish things when I put my mind to it. The problem is I’m having a hard time figuring out where to focus this attention and drive for my future.

Im currently employed at a geomatics firm doing a mix of land surveying, CAD drafting as well as some data processing. Overall it’s a great job that I’m very thankful to have, I just don’t know if it’s for me long term and I can’t shake the “what else is out there feeling”.

I did an internship doing very basic GIS technician work but it didn’t really expose me enough to the idea that I had in my head for what a GIS job was like for me to really want to pursue a strictly GIS job.

I really enjoyed GIS in school but ideally would like to be using it as tool and not my entire role. 

One recent found passion I found is to do with emergency management/ disaster response and resilience. I’m wondering if anyone else has found careers in this realm? Or if anyone has any advice on another approach would be more beneficial to break into this career.

Thank you for readying!! Any advice or input is appreciated"

I’m a current junior/senior expected to graduate from my undergraduate in fall 2023. My first two years in school have been in covid year so the classes were on Zoom and the assignments were easy. Most of my professors did not care about the assignments too much either. I’ve also had a huge mental health crisis and blacked out on most of the stuff that I’ve learned. It’s not an excuse but it’s more of a background to what happened and how I’m feeling. During the first couple of years, I learned the basics of Java and C++. I’ve also taken a data structure class. That class was super quick and I don’t remember much from it. I think the most we did was draw trees. There was no code involved. I’ve had two internships but they didn’t give me the valuable experience that I wanted. I’ve only done some scripting work as well as Excel work. Now I’m relearning data structures and algorithms in Python, plan to finish it in the next couple of weeks, and start practicing soon. I’ve reviewed some basics of Java and over the summer I will be reviewing C++. I also have an internship this time where there’s an opportunity to grow my coding skills. I want to get into AI/ML and I’m not sure if I can learn that concurrently. There’s also just so much technology out there and each day I feel as if I’m not good enough and I’m not learning enough. I have no idea what my plan should look like for the next couple of months. I want to get better at not only learning the language but coding (by that I mean problem-solving skills, analytical skills, and such). I’d also like to state that I can solve coding problems to a certain extent. I don’t think I am absolutely horrible, I think I might describe myself as average or a little below average. But I want to be better.

&#x200B;

I still feel absolutely horrible. I feel like everything around me is moving at such a fast pace. Some people around me are way advanced and I’d like to get there. It starting to feel a little unreachable and I’m worried I’m going to lose any motivation I have. I’m now lowkey having a crisis thinking about my career. I would love some input on what I can look into for studying, getting better at problem-solving, and how I get over this feeling when everything around me moves at a faster pace. Are there any good AI/ML programs I can do concurrently?"

It’s an average profile. I got only 1 admit that is from Northeastern university’s MSDS Align program. Provided the rest of my universities were too ambitious.

I applied to 20 schools and was accepted to 6 but rejected/waitlisted from all of my top choices and i’m feeling pretty lost. I visited some of the schools I got accepted to but they didn’t feel right for me and some didn’t even let me into my desired major (engineering). With the growing popularity of engineering I understand it’s a more selective program to apply to but I had hope anyways. 

I hear a lot of people say go to community college which I think is a good option. Although, I did get into the engineering program at my local college about 30 minutes from my house. 
So would it be better to do a year at my local college maybe take some extra classes at my community college then plan to transfer?
I want to show my dream colleges that I can thrive within an engineering program. My only concern is I haven’t heard many people transferring from a specific college I hear mostly about community colleges. Would it make a difference if I wanted to transfer from the college where I got accepted into the engineering program or just community college?

If anyone has any advice let me know! Also, if anyone is in the same position as I am, rejection is redirection, we’ll make it through!❤️

Naturally, I have always sort of fled workplaces in search for a new one. This has made job hunting kind of easy in terms that I look at job postings and I think ""Oh yeah, I could do that ***submits resume***.""

Now, however, I am faced with a new situation and I'd like input.

I really like my job right now. It's challenging, it's pretty much 50/50 hands on and office, my boss is cool and flexible with home stuff, and I generally like and get along with the people I work with daily. The cons are: boys club, 40 minute commute, and I am not exactly on the career path I want (Product Quality Engineer - still under Operations somehow, would like to just be QE).

Anyway, the biggest driver is actually the commute. My SO and I want to add to our family. But I am currently driving 40min one way, about 1.5hrs daily, which is almost 8hrs by the end of the week. I get up at 6/630 and I come home 530-6. I used to really enjoy the commute, I've been doing this for almost 5 years. But it's starting to really wear on me now. 

There is a job local to my home that I was reached out to about sometime back. It's still up, and I still have the recruiters contact info and all that. It's close, and as long as I get the high end of the pay range (which I don't see why I wouldn't) it would be a lateral move financially, a step in the direction of the career I want, and I would be closer to home. 

But I can't bring myself to apply. It feels...wrong? I can't tell if I'm scared that it won't work out culturally or if I feel guilty...I'm so hesitant.

Have any of you left good jobs before? How did you do it? How did you feel?"

12hj0bt,1,2023-04-10,Need advice on how I can improve myself after a recent fuckup.,V3N0M3,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/12hj0bt/need_advice_on_how_i_can_improve_myself_after_a/,"My story starts last July. I was interning at this organization and a few girls had come from outside the town to intern for a few months. 

I met this girl, lets call her B. Now, B was a drop dead gorgeous girl, quite well spoken, and fairly smart too. We got talking. 3 days later, I asked her out on a date. She said no because she was already dating one of the other girls. She was Bi. I said “no worries” and let it go. After work, we went on a walk, where she asked me why I continued to stay friends with her… usually men tend to ghost her after she says “no”. I explained to her that I have no expectations from her, me being interested in her doesn’t mean that she has to be interested in me. I also explained that once you reject a man, it kinda hurts for them and eventually you’ll date someone else and seeing that hurts even more so most men save themselves the pain and move on. 

I don’t know what flipped but the next day she asked me out on a date, I said “yes of course.” After that I had, what could be described as the best few months of my whole life. Going on walks and watching the sunset together. Hiking up a hill and kissing. Watching a river flow with our feet sunk in water. Singing “shape of you” together while riding a moped. Writing each other love letters. Being intimate. You get the idea. She was the perfect woman. I was the happiest I had ever been in my life. I told her my darkest secrets, my insecurities; i was vulnerable infront of her. 

I told her I loved her and she would hesitate to reply but eventually she would tell me she loves me and that she has been the happiest she has ever been. 

Her internship comes to an end and its time to go back to her place. We both are sad as now there’ll be distance between us. But I get the feeling that she isn’t as sad as I am. She leaves and we talk daily over phone and text. She’d sometimes initiate sexy time over call but I’d always say no to it because I don’t like sexting or sending images saying these things over call or text. 

It was my life’s dream to be rich but I was willing to give up on my masters to get a low paying job in the same city as her. Just to be with her. Unfortunately, i didnt get the job. She told me its alright and that she is here for me. The very next day she broke up with me. Stating that she hates the distance and wants me near her, that she can’t even touch me. 

I told her that its not possible for me yet because I still live with my parents and am a college student so I am not independent as such. (Also in our culture, leaving your parent’s home is looked down upon- as if you were abandoning them). She said we could stay friends and I agreed. The very next day, she started dating another woman. 

Then the texts became fewer, she’d not reply for days. I felt like a creep always texting her asking how she is. It fucks your self-respect. 24 days later she says she is in a serious relationship with someone and wants to cut off ties. I was devastated but I said okay. I couldn’t bare to lose her but I wanted her to be happy. So i let her go. 

Fast forward 6 months, I have my entrance exams. I have been grinding my ass off for it. Before my exams she calls. Asking me about some sort of a timeline on when we started dating and whatnot. Her voice. This was the last thing I needed at that time, I needed a rational mindset. Somehow, i finished the exam and got into the university I wanted. She was at the back of my mind, but i had supressed it, for now.

A month later, I was trying to call a collegue and called her by mistake because both share the same name. 

Her gf got mad at me. I found out that she was incredibly insecure about me and that their entire relationship was revolving around fights with me at the centre of it. 

Her girlfriend told me that I look like an ape and B is incredibly pretty. And she has no idea how B fucked someone as ugly as me. C said in the background that she only said that to ease her gf’s insecurities. She also called me a druggie which caught me off-guard because my struggle with  substance abuse was known only to C (5 years clean btw). Everything I was insecure about, my looks, my substance abuse history, they joked about it. I cried for the first time in 12 years that night. 

2 days later C calls again and blames me for ruining her relationship but i hadn’t even called her in 6 months. She calls me ugly as an ape and all the other mean things her gf said to me, like I was terrible at sex which i know to be untrue because she came thrice and she couldn’t even make me cum once. She also said that she had the best sex ever with me. But yeah, having your sexual prowess questioned hurts. 

Now i feel ugly and dont feel like dating women, have lost all interest in sex. I really want to feel confident like I used to. How do I work towards it?"

Both times my PIP feedback has been the same. I'm just not fast enough. What takes another engineer 3 days takes me 2 weeks. I get all my work done eventually. It just takes me longer than others. My current manager told me 2 months ago that my pace wasn't fast enough. So I started to put in more hours. Instead of 40 hours I put in 50 every week. I have still been pipped. 


Anyone have any advice or tips for me? I genuinely do like programming and software development. I just don't know what to do at this point. I'm pretty good at leetcode and can pass interviews well enough to land another job relatively quickly but then what? Just get pipped again? And eventually all the short stints will have a negative impact on my resume. 


Anyone have an idea of how I can pivot from here? I have family who counts on me to support them and i'm about to be jobless once again and have to face them with the reality that i'm a disappointment."

I hate my life as it is.,jfang00007,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12ht4dc/grad_school_and_recruiting_both_went_to_hell_for/,"I’m really angry and really, really bitter right now. I know that if it was a year or two ago, my career prospects would be a lot better. I am about to graduate in May from UIUC CS. I specialize in ML (Computer Vision + Bioinformatics) and I got my last rejection two days ago for CS PhD. I am angry at myself, angry at the job market, and angry with my situation because I am about to graduate aimless. I have a research paper, lab experience, and many side projects (like anybody else). I had little luck and everything has gone wrong. 

I tried everything to find a job, from LinkedIn job board, coderQuad on Github, to YCombinator job board and by cold emailing the founder of hundreds of companies. I got only a couple interviews, some of them I passed, others cancelled after the position has been filled, and most of the time either ghosted or generic rejection letter. All of this has filled me with discouragement and rage. 

I’ve also talked to a research professor whose CV research meetings I’ve been attending. He says that my profile says I am ready, but, I am still going to be facing stiff competition (aka, get burned and rejected everywhere) just because I am applying in ML / CV, and I can only start working with him or his grad students in the fall, and even if I publish I probably won’t be a first author so that I can increase my chances of applying for ML in later cycles. That made me really discouraged, because I am very results driven and I want something to show for myself and get opportunities.

What do I do now? I am planning to delay graduation by a semester so that I can still be eligible for the +1 year masters program (MCS) and find an internship for the fall. Still, I hate how poor the career prospects are right now, I want to either find a good job and start pursuing my financial goals or be in grad school doing what I want. I worked so hard, yet I got nothing. What should I do next? I really don’t want to be a point in my life where I am setting back on the goals I want to pursue. I’ve applied to bio companies, to non-tech companies like Delta Airlines and still my luck is garbage. What the fucking hell do I do now when all of my friends are all getting better jobs than I do? 

Edit: yes, I’ve done LC as well, and even then, I have yet to have an interview where there was LC question asked on the technical interview."

I have chronic health issues, so I can only work remotely at the moment (possibly forever). I've been trying to get a remote CS internship for a month or so, and I've noticed on LinkedIn that the positions I'm applying for can have sometimes 3000 applicants. Realistically, I will never be considered for those positions. Yet, the remote work positions I've found (not internships) have significantly less applicants typically. 

I'm graduating in less than a year and I was considering looking for a job in my last semester since I'll only have one class. But I'm starting to think I won't get an internship before that time comes. Can I still get hired without an internship or is that super difficult? I've been reading about CS becoming oversaturated and people with CS degrees struggling to find jobs for years, and it's making me anxious.

I'm currently a sophomore majoring in CS, and I have the option of graduating early if I slightly overload my semesters from here on out, but this would mean I wouldn't have an internship during my undergraduate years (I couldn't get one this summer, and if I graduate early I'll be graduating next spring). How much would this hurt me?

\~20k for college isn't exactly negligible, so having a year off would be great, but I've heard that not getting some kind of internship experience during undergrad will make it a lot harder to get a job later on.

What do you all think? Any advice?

12huogl,0,2023-04-10,Here's some tips: How to get into this industry with no degree or prior experience,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12huogl/heres_some_tips_how_to_get_into_this_industry/,"I came from 0 technical background. In October 2022 I graduated a coding bootcamp and, as of today, I have had 8 offers in software development, IT, database administration, and data analytics ranging from 66k to 103k. I am currently a remote backend engineer making 85k and here are some tips.

1. Doing this requires some dishonesty.
   1. You have to be willing to rebrand past non technical experience as technical, include personal projects as positions, and stretch dates. You can hate me for this if you want but you are not competitive with CS grads without experience. You need to make your own.
   2. You cannot be dishonest about your technical abilities. Yeah you can stretch dates to get the interview, but if you cant code than you will fail the interview. Practice what you preach.
2. All the competition is at the bottom.
   1. Everyone and their mother wants an entry level or junior dev position and there is so much competition for them. You will have more luck getting midlevel, senior or sole dev positions.
   2. I know there is going to be that one old school cat that will say ""I would never hire a senior or lead without 5 yrs of experience"" but I have been offered senior roles and I know plenty of ppl I graduated with from the bootcamp that have senior and lead roles.
3. Quantity is more important than quality.
   1. Accept the fact that your resume looks weak and that you will need to apply to A LOT of jobs. All that advice about tailoring a resume to each job and writing cover letters only applies to people with CS degrees and internships. You will never get hired doing that. If you are not applying to 150 jobs a day AT LEAST you will never get hired.
   2. Indeed easy apply is your friend
4. Actually write code.
   1. One advantage we have over a lot of CS grads (in my experience) is we have a lot of hands on skills. I may not be able to tell you the difference between an abstract class and an interface but I damn well can show you.
   2. Coding is a contact sport, your fingers need to contact the keys to learn and that is where our advantage can lie
5. Never turn down an interview
   1. Idc if its for an in person role in Alaska that pays in dog food, take the interview. You need to practice how to interview and get comfortable feeling lost.
   2. Accept that you will probably fail the first 10-20 technical interviews you have. The more interviews you get, the faster you can get over this learning curve. This is why tip #3 is so important. You need to apply to enough jobs to get enough interviews to practice.
6. Get a degree
   1. I am starting school in August for a bachelors in Software Engineering. At the end of the day, nothing will replace college."

I just don’t know what to do but keep sending these applications in which are filling my inbox with rejections.

I’m a current junior/senior expected to graduate from my undergraduate in fall 2023. My first two years in school have been in covid year so the classes were on Zoom and the assignments were easy. Most of my professors did not care about the assignments too much either. I’ve also had a huge mental health crisis and blacked out on most of the stuff that I’ve learned. It’s not an excuse but it’s more of a background to what happened and how I’m feeling. During the first couple of years, I learned the basics of Java and C++. I’ve also taken a data structure class. That class was super quick and I don’t remember much from it. I think the most we did was draw trees. There was no code involved. I’ve had two internships but they didn’t give me the valuable experience that I wanted. I’ve only done some scripting work as well as Excel work. Now I’m relearning data structures and algorithms in Python, and plan to finish it in the next week and start practicing soon. I’ve reviewed some basics of Java and over the summer I will be reviewing C++. I also have an internship this time where there’s an opportunity to grow my coding skills(I've been told I'll be working with Java and node.js).

I want to get into AI/ML and I’m not sure if I can learn that concurrently. There’s also just so much technology out there and each day I feel as if I’m not good enough and I’m not learning enough. I have no idea what my plan should look like for the next couple of months. I want to get better at not only learning the language but coding (by that I mean problem-solving skills, analytical skills, and such). I’d also like to state that I can solve coding problems to a certain extent. I don’t think I am absolutely horrible, I think I might describe myself as average or a little below average. But I want to be better.

I still feel absolutely horrible. I feel like everything around me is moving at such a fast pace. Some people around me are way advanced and I’d like to get there. It starting to feel a little unreachable and I’m worried I’m going to lose any motivation I have. I’m now kind of having a crisis thinking about my career. I would love some input on what I can look into for studying, getting better at problem-solving, and how I get over this feeling when everything around me moves at a faster pace. Are there any good AI/ML programs I can do concurrently so I'm not behind? What would you say is the probability that I miserably fail and don't get a full-time job after graduation lol?"

12hxwrr,36,2023-04-10,FML,Agggravat3d,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/12hxwrr/fml/,"Being a sophomore at Berkeley, it is inevitable to feel the need to compete with your peers, have 20 internships lined up, and balance everything from social life to cramming for finals and sometimes, you simply want to die. I have never in my life faced so much rejection until I came here. My freshman year I fucked around and didn't realize my priorities, so sophomore year really hit me like a truck. After so many club infosessions and gruesomely long applications, my efforts were met with unfortunate emails time after time. Why is it so ridiculously hard for average students to succeed here. All these clubs say that they require no prior experience, but that is just a blatant lie. Or even if you don't have experience but somehow pass the application portion, if you don't have much practice with interviews, you're getting rejected. Now, I have a close friend group here that has been with me since my first day. One of the girls I consider my best friend and have since high school. I know they are in the same boat as me, struggling to make ends meet and succeed as well, but I never thought that they would judge me for capabilities and competence. A big argument came up, I won't go into detail but basically they betrayed our friendship over a group project for a class we were all in because my other friend and I didn't meet their partner criteria. Though they will adamantly deny this and rephrase it to sound better, that is the truth of the matter. This really hurt me and my other friend because of our constant rejections and imposter syndromes. Furthermore I just got rejected from a remote job that my other other friend has, who claimed it was ""really fucking easy to get"". Obviously none of this is making me feel better, plus the weird and uncomfortable dynamic at home, and quite honestly I am on the verge of breaking. I feel extremely stupid, incompetent, and am extremely scared that I will succumb to their perceptions of me. I can't help wondering what is the point of all of this-- working a 9 to 5 job for the rest of my life and having to watch the rest of my family die before me. I'm struggling to hold on, or find any motivation to even finish my homework. Berkeley is truly killing me."

There’s just so much I’ve learned at DOT in my 7yrs post grad from the same school as them. I feel the need to share it all in 4 months time. 

When I interned, it was with 3 other students at a DPW and the Town Engineer had interns for many years before, so it was such a smooth time there. 

I would appreciate if some current students could share what they expect out of an internship.

I'm a bit confused  because after searching in this sub and other ones I'm seeing that there  are also positions like Data Analyst and Engineer, in addition to  Scientist and some aspects of both got my interest. So I'm a bit  confused on how to picture my career path or have my next jump to gain  more experience on the field.

As  for academics, I have a degree in Computer Engineering and I'm planning  more later to take a MS (maybe in CS) to specialize more in the ML/AI  area and some of the areas that got my attention of the implementation  of DS or ML/AI is on the medical, automotive and hardware side.

12i146w,426,2023-04-10,DO NOT Take the Northwestern Mutual Financial Representative Internship,bilz0320,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/12i146w/do_not_take_the_northwestern_mutual_financial/,"Around this time last year I was in the same place as maybe some of you are - a college student still without an internship, and desperate to get a job in the financial field in the summer so I could start building my resume. So lo and behold, when I get an email from a company that is generally considered very reputable, asking me to attend an information session I was thrilled. Northwestern Mutual is a household name, so to be able to get internship experience there would be great, or so I thought. Very quickly it turned out to be a an extremely evident scam.

The first part of the process I found extremely weird was how they were essentially pitching me the job, not the other way around. Usually during job interviews you have to present why you are a good candidate - but the entire time they essentially were telling us how great this internship was and how we were fantastic and deserved to be in it. Despite the unusual nature of this, I decided to schedule an interview. During the interview I felt very weird - they hyped me up after looking at my resume for what was about 3 minutes, and then gave me a worksheet. The lady in the interview essentially goaded me into giving 10 family and friend's names that I could contact for ""cold calling"" and such.

I should have called it quits there, but was pretty desperate and was in a bit of denial, so I moved on to the ""final"" interview. The guy essentially was pressuring me for contact information and telling me how to make it in this field, I would have to leverage my own network and such. He offered the job to me, and I told him I would have to think about it. After, I decided to finally to do some in depth research and came across various posts on reddit and such describing the exact same experience, and how it was just a pyramid scheme.

After that, I basically ghosted them, but the story does not end there. I had a friend who was going through the application process with me, and he decided to take the offer. I warned against it, but he told me he had no other options and really needed some sort of experience. He quickly regretted it, and described to me first hand how he was forced to cold call dozens of his friends and families asking them to buy insurance from NW, and how he was paired with an employee there who basically took his friends and families info as leads and potential clients, while he gained zero experience and skills. He quit after about 3 weeks.

So overall, if Northwestern Mutual contacts you or you are in the process of potentially getting a job there, don't do it. Get some sort of other summer job or maybe take finance courses on your own as a self study, or maybe try to get into a research lab released to your field (I managed to get into some Economics research, which is my major). But avoid this leach of a company at all cost.

Edit: This post kinda got big, so if any mods are reading this honestly I feel like it would be a great idea to have a thread/something pinned at the top of this subreddit of known scam internships. These things prey on desperate people, and need to be called out. "

I was thankfully accepted into both **Georgia Tech's College of Computing for Computer Science** and **UIUC's Grainger College of Engineering for Computer Science**. I'm currently deciding on where to commit, and I thought I'd come to Reddit for some tailored advice.

Alongside the usual points of consideration, here are some personal points I am factoring in for my decision (Not ranked in terms of importance):

\- **Curriculum emphasis on CS theory**

\- **Availability and quality of undergraduate research opportunities (Specifically in AI/ML and/or Computational Biology)**

\- **Internship opportunities**

\- **Strength/rigor of mathematical curriculum content**

I applied as an international student under my country's national scholarship program, which will cover all costs of whichever program I eventually choose to attend; therefore, the cost won't be a factor to consider in my decision.

I'd greatly appreciate it if anyone could share their insight or personal experience regarding UIUC's Computer Science program, and offer some advice on which program would possibly be a better fit for me.

12iakek,0,2023-04-11,Is Industrial Engineering worth it?,CommercialWafer6096,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/12iakek/is_industrial_engineering_worth_it/,"Okay, so let me tell you a bit of my background.

I am currently a graduating Senior High School student, so next school year, I'll be in college na. I had decided that I will pursue Industrial Engineering back when I was still in Grade 10-11ish, so I've been eyeing this course for about 2 years already.

I'm not gonna lie, the primary reason why I got interested with it back then was because I'd heard from my older brother (who was studying Mechanical Engineering at that time) na wala daw board exam. Hence, I got interested in IE because I had this vague notion that I wanted to be an engineer. 

When I searched more about IE, I began to understand that it is all about efficiency and systems/processes. I quite liked the thought of that. It is also a very versatile program kasi pwede kahit anong industry, so I think it's perfect for me kasi it gives me flexibility to transition to another industry if I really wanted to. Aside from that, I found out na parang business + engineering pala siya in one. So, I got more interested in it because I also like the business sector.

My parents and older brothers don't really support me that much regarding this course kasi nga walang board exam, etc. and, we recently got into an argument because of that. They'd rather want me to pursue Civil Engineering kasi sikat daw at magiging mayaman din daw ako in the future. At first, I actually believed them and was about to consider being one; but as it turns out, that was far from the truth. 

Discovering this subreddit, I read that Civil Engineering is actually already saturated and because of that mababa na ang sweldo. So ekis na yan. And after ko pinaalam sa parents ko yung mga findings ko, parang nag give up na sila and they let me choose whatever course nalang daw basta makatapos. I symphathize with my parents kasi ako nalang yung pinapaaral nila sa family namin and they want what's best for me.

My eldest brother made me message his batchmate para maprove yung point niya na hindi daw yan maganda na course at walang masyadong opportunities in the future. And yeah, di rin recommend ng batchmate niya ang IE (kasi mas prefer daw ng employers ang may license) and just Engineering in general. Medyo nakakapanghinayang. Despite that, I was still thankful for the opportunity because I was able to get direct insight from a person who graduated from IE. 

Though, with IE in mind, I have plans to get Lean Six Sigma, to get Certification for IE, learn a bit of coding or compsci (meron nung sa harvard na seminar online), have some internships for experience, etc. just to get a bit of an edge sa other majors.

As of the moment, I'm in the process of applying to AdDU at first choice ko talaga yung IE. But before I submit, I just want to know: 

Is it really worth it to pursue Industrial Engineering?

P.S. I would really appreciate it if people who graduated in IE could tell me their experiences (especially if taga AdDU rin kasi I'm planning to study there).

I have a lot of faith and I'm really passionate about this program, but I do hope I'm not making the wrong decision."

Edit: 
I only planned to learn coding/compsci in case I wanted to branch out to IT (Data Analytics and the like), because if I'm going to be honest, I'm not really interested in the field that much. 

I think I prefer more of a Business Analyst or an Operations Research Analyst type of role. I also quite liked management roles in general.

Anyway, thank you to everyone who took the time to respond to my post! I may not get to reply to them instantly because I didn't think a lot of people would respond, but just know your insights are very, very helpful <3

12iawt0,2,2023-04-11,Applying to SWE internships for postbacc CS student,byd0402,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/12iawt0/applying_to_swe_internships_for_postbacc_cs/,"Hey so I just started a postbacc CS program (getting a BS in CS). I've never taken a university CS class before but I was a mechanical engineering major (just graduated spring of 2022) so we used a bunch of Matlab and Python for scripting purposes, and I also have been learning some Javascript and Python myself with doing stuff like making simple websites (in Python with Django and Flask) and creating some programs like one that texts me some weather information each morning. I also took 2 years of Java including AP Comp Sci A in high school and basically recreated the asteroids game for a final project but that was 7 years ago so I don't remember a whole lot of Java syntax although I could probably brush up on it pretty fast.  

I've been getting emails from like my college's career stuff about internship applications that are starting to open and I'm wondering if I should even start applying yet or if I wouldn't even get through resume screening since I don't really have any major CS/SWE related projects. I do have a job as an engineer right now, kind of a crossover between mechanical and civil, but I'm not doing any programming in it so idk how much that helps."

The only ""professional"" experience that relates to IT that i've had is a 3-month helpdesk internship I had last summer. My plan so far has just been to tough it out in tech support and go from level 1 to level 2, etc. like most people say to do. In between I obviously plan to take necessary certs like the CCNA for example but was just wondering if anyone had any tips or advice. From looking at other's peoples posts i've seen many mention how helpful a homelab is so i've also started my own and have been trying to learn little by little, though it is my first time using Linux.

I've been applying for positions here and there for a couple months now and have barely gotten any replies so any comments whatsoever are appreciated since im really lost and graduation getting closer and closer only makes me more anxious."

PROJECTS
● A Design of Contention Free Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocol with Optimal Bandwidth Utilization for IOT
Final Year Project
Due to avoiding collisions, TDMA based MAC protocols are preferred in WSN based IOT networks. Classic TDMA allocates one fixed duration slot to each node in a session. In IOT applications, nodes have adaptive traffic and transmitting this varying amount of data within their allocated timeslot is not optimal. This results in wastage of communication channel and bandwidth is not properly used. An optimal TDMA based MAC protocol was generated with better GTS utilization and reduced network delay for wireless sensor networks based IOT applications.
Technologies Used: MATLAB, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Word
 
● Automated Controller for Microwave Oven

I also will have 2 YOE from a FAANG company in India by the time I start my masters.

I am concerned by the current macroeconomic conditions. How hard is it to get an internship currently? What about April of next year? When will the situation improve? Should it be safe to assume that the market will recover by the time I graduate in June 2025?"
12ieion,19,2023-04-11,I can't enjoy programming because I know I am incredibly mediocre,Formal_Buyer8007,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/12ieion/i_cant_enjoy_programming_because_i_know_i_am/,"I used to like programming and I can adapt myself pretty well to learning and re-learning.

I applied for a summer internship and I face myself with the idea that I should be brushing up on my coding skills. I need to submit some tasks on Codility and I have 7 days to upload it.

But that's not the problem.

Until now I've done just a bit of C++, Java and MySQL. To say the least, highschool was probably the highest level of programming I encountered because we were taught stuff like bubblesort or divide et impera. Not just coding knowledge, but also learning how to make your code more efficient, in a more intelligent manner.

Yesterday was my first time in a big while since I haven't coded. I decided to start with practice on Codility and I felt like I enjoyed coding. I chose to solve the binary gap problem using Python, so I got to learn the basics of Python too.

My problem is that I can't help but see how much of a simpleton I am.

I keep unfulfilling the task, my only problem is that I have to see how to manage dividing huge numbers in order to determine the binary gap of their binary form.

I spent 5 hours on a task which is marked as ""Easy"" and yet, my highest score is of 55%. Last thing I solved is how to confirm the gap is proper by detecting the 1's in between the 0's, but now I need to figure out how to divide huge numbers by 10, because apparently that just won't cut it: it seems like the last digit from a huge number simply won't disappear (unless I have done the mistake of not declaring the int).

Well, anyway... it's a f***ing highschool level task. Some people are already so ahead of me, already using Github forks, doing Machine Learning algos or whatever and now A.I. is here to wreak havoc on the job market.

And I'm fucked because I have no excellent hard skills. Because I am so, incredibly, mediocre.

I found myself oddly enjoying to solve the task. I don't know why, though, this mentality of self-imposing standards is hindering.

I just wanna know if what I am aware of is worth considering it. If I am aware of myself being mediocre is worth considering giving up coding, despite me liking it.  So I made this post hoping that you guys would share your experiences.



EDIT: Thank you all very much for being supportive. I've finished my Codility binary gap code lol. I'll make another post where I will explain the realization I came to.

EDIT 2: Here's a post I made on r/Life which relates to this post:

12igg5z,135,2023-04-11,6 Offers in 12 Months - My Approach to Job Applications (Entry-Level Corporate),whadayameanmate,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12igg5z/6_offers_in_12_months_my_approach_to_job/,"After reading through some of the recent dispiriting posts on this subreddit, I decided that I'd share my approach to job applications in hopes that it will assist someone out there with any arduous employment challenges that may lay ahead. As a disclaimer, I'm a 23yo bloke who just graduated from University with an Engineering degree with next to no professional experience. The offers that I have received have also all been entry-level positions that are reflective (for the most part) of my experience.

With 2 month-long internships under my belt, I managed to secure **6 separate job offers** from top-tier companies in **two different fields** (quarter-life crisis career switch) over the past 12 months with, for the most part, an approach that I honed and used throughout all of the separate hiring processes. 4 of these offers were from my previous field, and 2 from my current one.

To all active job seekers that stumble upon this post - I implore you to think about which elements of this approach may challenge your current strategies and/or what you can tangibly tweak in your approach **that is applicable to you** in my outline.

**Step 1: Application Tracking (and Accountability)**

Whether you're applying for 8 or 800 jobs, you need a tracker to keep on top of your applications. Job hunting is both a *volume* and *quality* game (**more on this later**), so logging key job posting information is critical to retaining visibility and managing the status of your submitted, currently-completing and prospective applications. ^(I really should get sponsored for the countless times I've plugged them), but I use Notion for this as it allows me to quickly customize filters and time-dependent notifications. I've received first-round/digital interviews for 93% of my applications to date - a stat that Notion allows me to track instantly.

Due dates, job posting priority (obviously, prioritize roles you're most interested in), application links, the status of your application and a notes field (to log extra details like employer information session dates) are examples of preliminary information you will want to log in your tracker.

Once the initial framework for your application tracker is complete, **share a view-only link** with your partner, your best mate, a trusted friend who is also applying for jobs, your dog, John from down the road who always asks how your father is doing - anyone who you know can keep you accountable. If you don't need the gentle nudge, skip this part and march on forward.

**Step 2: Build Your Personal Narrative + Relevant Examples**

Assuming that the roles you're applying for all lie within the same industry, building a personal narrative will allow you to call upon a fundamental story that details how you got to where you are today (i.e. in the position of seeking a new role in the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ field). Think with an *industry* lens when formulating your personal narrative, do not consider specific companies at all here. My personal narrative consists of: my degree, what drove me to pursue that degree including upbringing, a brief rundown of relevant experience to date, what fundamentally excites/motivates me, and hence why this industry would allow me to thrive. Don't just think about it, but put it into words on a page or screen.

Next, have a look at the prior experience that you have (academically and/or professionally), and pinpoint at least 3 examples of situations in which you encountered each of the following (tailor these to your industry):

1. difficulties in a team;
2. showcased leadership;
3. exceeded expectations.

You will want examples that are as multifaceted as possible to be able to use them for a variety of interview questions.

Following the above will do two things for you.

1. Off-the-cuff edits you will be making to your CV and cover letters (see Step 4) will flow far more naturally, and you'll be able to churn out consistent material much quicker with a narrative to ground your applications on. There will be no ambiguity when it comes to writing about how you can positively contribute to a company/team.
2. Subconsciously, you are already gearing up for the interview process. Inevitable questions such as ""Why do you want to work for us?"" and ""Tell me about yourself"" are already answerable with the narrative and examples that you now know back to front.

These two outcomes are particularly pertinent during the peak interview seasons - I personally had to complete 6 interviews last month in a single week whilst managing FT work, which would've overloaded me with mental fatigue had I not noted down my narrative and examples to the point of them being second nature. Now, let's look at the groundwork required to navigate the widely-used Applicant Tracking Systems and complete CVs and cover letters at scale.

**Step 3: Keywords and Phrases**

By now, you would have encountered ChatGPT or some other freemium AI chatbot. We're going to be using these chatbots to sieve through job postings and extract keywords and phrases that we will need for our CVs and cover letters in Step 4. Here's what you're going to do.

**a.** Go to your AI chatbot of choice, and get the URL to the job posting in question. Type the following in as a prompt:  ""*I am applying for a job in the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ field. The job ad is here:* [*insert URL here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)*. I am writing a resume and a cover letter tailored to this job posting and require a list of keywords to use. Provide me a list of 15 to use.*"". Go back to your application tracker and create a new field/column next to the relevant job application and store the keyword list there.

**b.** Then, enter the following prompt: ""*Please list out the requirements of the role in dot point form."".* Repeat the same new field/column step as above.

**c.** Lastly, visit the website of the employer and get the URL. Return to the chatbot and enter the following prompt: ""*This is the company's website:* [*insert URL here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)*. I need to understand a snapshot of what this company is about to tailor my cover letter in a way that shows I can contribute to the company. Please provide me with 10 sentences that highlight what and who this company is. Start with the company's values.*"". Repeat the same new field/column step as above.

Armed with these three new fields, we now turn to the CVs and cover letters themselves.

**Step 4: Build Your CV and Modular Cover Letter**

First and foremost, I'm not here to talk about the futility of cover letters in today's hiring process. You need them if you want to stand out (in my experience), so what we'll be focussing on is the adaptation of these two key documents to the specific job and company that each application is targeting.

CV:

* 1 page, newest (and only relevant) experience first, specific achievement outlines, extra-curricular achievements, and ensure references are on a separate document (state it is available upon request).
* Under your specific achievement outlines, pepper in the keywords that we extracted in Step 3a., ensuring that you tailor your examples to accommodate a natural, unforced tone.

Cover Letter:

* Here, we are going to write modular, with the following inclusions and structure:
   * Intro
      * Immediately commence with your degree and current position + current project if applicable, noting any prominent achievements to begin with. The aim of the intro is to catch the eye of the employer and to express your desire for the advertised role.
   * Paragraph 1
      * This paragraph will be tailored to expressing your personal interest in the company and role itself using the outputs of Step 3c (**in bold below**).
      * Sentence A: Outline the fact/understanding underpinning your interest in the firm/role. e.g. *As Germany's leading construction contractor for over 35 years, XYZ Corp boasts an* ***unparalleled portfolio*** *of projects that have progressed to define the* ***dynamic infrastructure landscape*** *at a national level, with its ability to deliver* ***consistent value*** *through its team of leading experts being second to none.*
      * Sentence B: Outline what this means for you. e.g. *As such, this role presents an opportunity for* ***unprecedented professional growth*** *through the* ***unique complexities*** *presented by the firms’ projects under the guidance of* ***industry-leading mentors***\*, which I am currently seeking in my professional career.\*
      * Sentence C: Outline why the firm's workplace is in alignment with your personal narrative.  e.g. *Furthermore, the* ***vibrant workplace*** *underpinning XYZ Corp's* ***people-focused*** *culture represents a unique environment for me to experience and contribute towards dynamic program rotations across the firm’s* ***preeminent suite of assets***\*.\*
   * Paragraph 2
      * This paragraph will be tailored towards relaying how your experience demonstrates alignment with the requirements divulged in Step 3b (**in bold below**).
      * Sentence A: Thesis statement for this paragraph, detailing why you fit the role. e.g. *With a strong foundational experience in* ***contract management*** *and* ***design delivery*** *in the* ***public infrastructure sector***\*, I believe that I am a suitable candidate for the \_\_\_\_\_\_ position.\*

And you're done! Whilst I would love to go over more interview preparation material, I acknowledge this has turned into quite a chunky post. The above information is a general breakdown of how I went about applying for my roles after being rejected non-stop in the year preceding my graduation year.

**TLDR**

1. Track your applications and share the live list with someone who will keep you accountable (if this helps you).
2. Write our your personal narrative and some key examples that you can flexibly use in interview scenarios.
3. AI chatbots to assist with listing out job requirements, company keywords and phrases for your CV and cover letter.
4. Writing your cover letter with modularity + CV with substitute keywords.
5. Submit. 

Hope it helps - feel free to drop a comment below if you have any questions and I'll do my best to address them.

Best of luck with your applications."

MAJOR- CS. I am an international students and my target school is purdue. I have AP credits sufficient to skip my freshman year. I will start my college with sophomore year and then since I am an intl student I cannot work full time OPT until I stay one year in us. So I will not be applying for internships in my sophomore. I will work on campus part time (less than 20 hours) and in my junior and senior year I am looking to pay the tuition fees with my internship money.

My questions are :-

1. What is the pay for  computer science internships and how long are internships?
2. Will I be able to pay my junior and senior year tuition with my internships and coop money?"

I was accepted both to CMU's MS in Software Engineering and Georgia Tech's MS in Computer Science, and I'm trying to decide which one to choose.

For context, I am a French student with a BS in Engineering. My CS classes were mostly around basic algorithms and data structures but nothing more. 90% of what I have learned was from online tutorials and personal projects.

I am currently doing an internship (6 month) at a FAANG company in software engineering, and had a previous 5 month internship in another company which specialises in static code analysis.

I want to work in code analysis and I feel like, despite my personal projects, I lack fundamental CS knowledge.

GATech’s MSCS seems much more interesting for me as it covers CS fundamentals, whereas CMU’s MSSE does not. Am I missing another key point in my reasoning apart from this? I’m mostly hesistant because CMU has a “better ranking” than GATech and it is in California.

**TL;DR:**

I joined this subreddit a few days ago and saw that internships are quite difficult to come by, and I'm starting to prepare now so I can sorta stand out. I am currently a junior at NCSSM (North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics), which is essentially a nerd boarding school for CS and engineering. I'm currently working in C, Java, Flutter (to develop apps for the school), and I've sprinkled in JS (Svelte + TailwindCSS) for a hackathon, as well as stuff like Python, Lua and Rust for personal projects.

Now for the actual question-- does this stuff matter on internship applications, and will coming from a school like NCSSM help my get internships? What would that look like? In terms of University NCSSM is usually recognized, but would that properly carry over to internship opportunities?

Thanks!"

I didn’t expect my internship to pull my grades down, thus I know I won’t get accepted into NTU, SMU or NUS. I’m graduating with a Diploma in Accountancy, with a GPA of 3.4. I didn’t think of applying for SIT as I was sure that my internship grade would pull up, but guess not…

I’m ready to take a gap year but I’d like some advice first;
1. I know SIT has Accountancy, will I get the opportunity to switch careers to banking and finance in the future? I’m not sure of the steps to take if I do this.
2. I heard that SIT has trimesters, and during internship there are still projects to be done. I would like to know how tough the projects are.
3. Should I just go SIM instead of taking the gap year? 
4. Any advice I should take note of regardless of these questions

I'm currently wrapping up my junior year of college and wanted to see if anyone had advice on what measures I should take to strengthen my undergraduate career prior to applying for MBA programs. My dream is to go to an M7 school (top is Kellogg), and I want to be actively improving upon as much as possible to make myself an ideal applicant for a Marketing MBA.

Currently I:

* attend a T10 public university
* am majoring in Communications and minoring in Digital Studies
* have a 3.723 cumulative GPA (will be 3.764 by the end of the semester)
* have had a Communications internship at a research institute for nearly a year, and will be interning there till the end of my undergraduate career
* am on the executive board of the official marketing club of my university

I am currently working towards:

* a VP position at the marketing club (interview is this week)
* an additional internship for this summer at a tech firm

Things that may negatively impact my future application:

* I will have two pass/fails on my transcript (Econ 101 from my freshman year during COVID, and a management course I am currently taking during my semester abroad — I was too impulsive regarding my decision to pass/fail, and will actually be receiving an A in this course)

I have the option to graduate a semester early, but have decided to continue as a full-time student in the Spring semester either:

* taking marketing & management courses to better prepare me for my post-graduate career and studies

or

* declaring a major (4 classes left) or minor (3 classes left) in Economics
   * important to note that my major used to be economics, and that I had about a 3.45 average in economics related courses, versus about a 3.98 from my communications courses
      * another note: while I found the content of my economics courses to be very interesting, I spent so much time studying that I eventually became ill from the stress and lack of sleep. So, I guess this is just to say that economics is not exactly my passion, or my favorite course to take

I understand that much more goes into consideration than my undergraduate grades and extracurriculars (such as my post-graduate career and GMAT score), but I would absolutely love to hear any and all advice that I can currently take to better myself as a future applicant, but also better prepare me for a future in the business world.

To everyone who made it to the end of my post — thank you so much for taking the time to do so! I appreciate any and all comments you have :)"

So far, I have earned my CWNA (Certified Wireless Network Administrator; not to get confused with CCNA). This cert was part of my school's curriculum. My professor told me that 50% of his students fail the cert exam (thus failing the class) so I'm pretty damn proud I passed because it was a difficult one. Second, I don't have any prior IT work experience BUT I will be starting a 3-month paid internship as an IAM intern in a notable medical facility next month. This is an opportunity of a lifetime for many reasons, but the most important being... I'm finally going to have my foot in the door! I'll be able to work in a real IT environment and even more, a medical one. I can finally put most of my home-labbing to a brief pause haha. This was a brief background. But now I would like some guidance.

My ultimate career goal is to eventually do security in the cloud. Unfortunately, my school only offers one cloud-related class and its AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals). I'm actually taking it right now, and have I completed reading the material for this 8 week course in pretty much half the time I'm so eager to accelerate my education and career path, but after my internship, and AZ-900, I'm not sure where to go next.

In my spare time I study a lot of Linux. I also spend too much time trying to figure out what to do next, rather than just doing it! But the thing is, I already have my career goal in mind: cloud security. So, logically I'd continue learning Azure, right? Do you guys have any other recommendations. Be brutally honest with me!"

Unfortunately, 211 is not offered at Rutgers and only offered at one (1) CC (at least from what I found) this summer. The class starts in May and ends in August. Algo at Rutgers starts in June and ends a day later than 211, so the courses will be overlapping.

In addition to classes, I'll be doing an internship (which I assume will be a 9-5 but not sure yet). Does this seem doable? I'm taking comp arch at Mercer and I can't find any reviews for the prof so I got no clue what to expect.

My alternative is taking an elective along with algo in the same summer session and taking 211 this fall, but I would MUCH rather prefer getting it out of the way in the summer. Thoughts?"

But I feel very uncertain about AD and networking, so I wonder if I have to go straight with OSCP. Could it be better to practice more and go for eJPT AND CCNA first? (I want to do my internship in CSec Companies, and it is always better to have Any Cert you know, heard word from HRs)

I think I have enough money to go for both exams. I still have some years til I graduate, so I'm thinking that I could learn a lot within this period so that I can get OSCP before my graduation!

The degree was a conversion master’s, with my undergrad being in biology and my previous work experience mostly being in hospital and lab settings. I don’t have any internships or professional experience in tech and am currently working on finding some in my home country of the UK, but the only semi-relevant thing I've managed to accomplish so far is completing a Google data analytics certificate to put on my CV. The main skills the MSc taught me are Python, Java, Node.js and SQL, so basically exclusively backend.

The obvious plan seems to be to get some experience in the UK, then try to move, but I’m also concerned that without some connection to the area I want to end up, this may not be that helpful, at least not for several years. I also can’t find much information on doing this for the destinations I’ve specified, as most people for sensible reasons want to move in the opposite direction. I’ve considered enrolling in a research degree abroad or paying to do an internship abroad as a way to get a foot in the door.

Sorry if the locations I’ve specified are too broad, but I thought it would be better to have too many options rather than too few when the countries seem quite difficult to get into. I have also been considering Australia If Asia isn’t feasible, but my main motivation is to go somewhere very different to where I’m from. If anyone can suggest a good option somewhere else in the world that fits that criteria that I haven’t mentioned please do."

**Thoughts/Advice:**

please don't underestimate yourself/compare yourself to others at your school. i know i'm not ""average"" in general standards but compared to other chinese-american kids at my school, i'm def an underachiever. this led me to not even consider some schools because i thought that i had no chance compared to them. i'm still insanely grateful i got into duke, and i'd likely not be able to make it in rd, but my family's paying a pretty penny for me to attend and sometimes i wonder if i should've applied either rea/just rd to schools known for insanely good financial aid (i.e. princeton). BUT at the end of the day, i love duke a lot and i barely thought i'd make it in ED, so who knows if i would've gotten into princeton/stanford/whatever REA (i barely even considered applying to princeton/stanford RD bc i thought i had no chance so i didn't run the npc for it lmfao)?

also: it is true that colleges compare you to other people from your hs applying to them, but they do break applicant cap patterns every once in a while; i.e. duke took 1 extra person from my hs than usual, yale took FIVE (3 extra than our usual), and stanford took 1 extra.

i'd still recommend applying ED if you're in a **very** financially secure position and you genuinely like the school because ED statistically boosts your chances by so much (no way i would've gotten into duke rd), but if you even have slight doubts about it, apply RD instead to compare fin aid packages. i know people who make a shit ton more than my family and also have a lot of assets who are paying like 20-40k less than us because they're going to hypsm; those are undoubtedly the schools with the most generous fin aid ever (but also take this with a grain of salt bc the hard part with hypsm isn't paying, it's getting in).

also please please please grind on your essays. one of my friends got screwed over by her dream schools because of her essays despite the fact that she's one of the most cracked (ec and stats-wise) people i've ever met. BUT admissions are also insanely random; another one of my friends wrote the most cliche essay about a sports injury and got into an hypsm rea despite having ""less prestigious"" stats/ec's than others in our demographic at our school. **do** know how to sell yourself tho; someone who ik got into hypsm exaggerated the hell out of her linkedin ec's and activities and i'm assuming she did the same on her commonapp.

additionally: test-optional is not optional if you're orm and/or financially privileged unless you have national awards/ec's or cured cancer or some shit. everyone ik who's orm and financially secure and had good outcomes in the process had cracked ass test scores.

i have a lot of regrets about the process: shotgunning rd apps in november when i should've been working on scholarship apps (considering i applied ed), giving myself no time over pre-senior yr summer to work on college apps and burning out badly as a result, comparing myself to others and feeling shitty about myself as a result (before and during applying, and even after ivy day), feeling like i was an outlier and like the worst applicant alive even tho i'm literally an average a2cer with decent-above average ec's and stats, not having a 4th activity/passion project to finish out my mental health advocacy spike (i feel like if i had one extra i might've rea'd to hyps or just regularly rd'd), and ed'ing despite knowing my family's efc would put a burden on all of us (def having a buyer's remorse moment w the student debt life wahoo!). but at the end of the day, these are all first-world regrets, considering i'm going to a school that i genuinely love, so i'm going to make the most out of the situation and enjoy every moment of these 4 years (while grinding to pay back my family and debt, in a healthy way ofc). go blue devils! 💙

ok sorry this was a vent essay lowkey but tl;dr everything is a crapshoot so just try to stay sane in the process, take your chances accordingly, and be grateful for all of the outcomes you receive- everything happens for a reason."

Choosing to work sa public hospital especially PGH is great kasi super matratrain ka talaga doon, however, the equipment there won't be advance.

Both are fine to me, but I'm curious, in the eyes of the employers, or para sa inyo, ano kaya ang mas matimbang na experience?


Thank you po!"

Currently a sophomore, interned at Microsoft last summer for Explore and will be returning this summer as a SWE intern. Don’t have anything else I’m studying in college besides CS but after ChatGPT became a big deal, I enrolled in an applied machine learning course this semester. It’s been going ok, pretty tough but interesting 

The applied data science minor at my school is just a cluster of machine learning and stats courses. I have a bad math background, have only taken discrete math but am willing to work on my math skills and build a stronger foundation in stats. 

How useful would this minor be for me as a SWE? Any edge it gives me? Or is it pointless and the major is enough?"

I'm favoring this over the thesis option to be able to do internships during summer and winter breaks.

[From the Waterloo website](https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-academic-calendar/mathematics/david-r-cheriton-school-computer-science/master-mathematics-mmath-computer-science#master's-research-paper):

>Note: it is not possible to be admitted directly to the Master’s Research Paper option but students may be able to transfer to it from the thesis option.

It isn't clear though how one can transfer and what're the criteria of approval for transferring.

Since you have to be admitted through the thesis-based option, should I:

* Mention my intention to transfer to the Research Paper option in SOP and interviews?

Is this option even available? I've seen almost no thread discussing this option.

If anyone has experience with transferring to the paper option, please do share. Thanks for the help!

Relevant thread/comments:

* [Note that we also have a research paper masters in CS. This is like a thesis-lite, and is somewhere in between. I have not met anyone doing this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/fm8u5u/comment/fl3js7i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)"

I graduated high school in 2020. I had straight As in multiple AP classes and I had gotten into a good group of colleges including my dream college in Scotland. Well as you could guess by the year I wasn't able to travel to Scotland and in turn decided to go to a school in the States. The college I ended up going to wasn't in my top 5, but because my family was so excited about this school in particular I decided to commit. This is also a good time to mention, I had no dreams or goals for a career. I kinda just cruised through high school doing whatever classes my peers and my parents told me I should do. I just listened, did what I needed to, and did it the best I could. Now when it came time to choose my major I had no idea what to do, so since my grandfather was an engineer and I studied mostly AP math classes I decided to major in architectural engineering.

I found myself utterly depressed during my first year of college, as I think many did during 2020. All online with groups of up to 400 people on Zoom, barely any contact with professors, and online exams that were all types of messed up, I was also dropping like 40k on a school I never even visited. I also realized I didn't enjoy engineering, don't get me wrong I knew it would be hard, and I've done hard classes before, but I was just spiraling to a point of extreme depression. More history, my entire family has either anxiety or depression and I've been going to therapy since 7th grade. I've definitely had my highs and lows but I really didn't think id make it past 18.

By the end of my first school year, I asked my parents if I could take a gap year to sort everything out and figure out a goal for myself. They said I could and we were all pretty happy to not have to pay for college for a little while. I had been working since I was 16 and I was going to continue into my gap year, so I spent the majority of my time applying and interviewing for jobs, I ended up working for a couple of neighbors house sitting and stuff in the meantime, not a lot of money but it was something. Two months into my summer break I was just walking into my room and I was having a hard time breathing. Now at this point, I had never had covid and there were no other symptoms besides trouble breathing and burning chills throughout my body. I've also had many panic attacks throughout my life, but this was different. My parents ended up calling the ambulance because responding became increasingly difficult. And since that day I have been to countless doctors, and hospital visits, gotten bloodwork, fainted, unable to move my legs on some days, and a whole bunch of other things. My doctor is just finally coming to a diagnosis, but it has been two years of utter hopelessness. Once I was stable, on some medication, and learned ways to cope with my symptoms, I mustered up everything and applied to some schools overseas. I wanted to still have a plan despite everything and travel while I could because I do love to learn and I've always wanted a degree. I had gotten into most of my choices including a school in Europe. I was super excited, and I chose a different major hoping I would enjoy it more. My parents were also super excited, not only was the tuition much cheaper, but I would be one of the first in the family to live abroad.

Welp, I made it to Europe and there are a lot of great things here, and I've done so many things I would never have been able to do at home, and for that, I am extremely grateful, but I've also had some frightening nights with mental health. My family although rough at times has gotten extremely understanding of mental health and I knew if I were home maybe it would be easier to reach out, but since I have almost a 6-hour time difference here I try not to bother them. Which just means I ended up isolating myself. I had to watch my only niece turn one, start to walk, talk, and do other milestones through a screen. Not only am I extremely homesick, but I hate the city I'm in. I also have an emotional support animal at home that I couldn't take with me because I couldn't bring myself to stick them on a plane for 8 hours. Now I don't even like the major I'm in, and the school won't let me just change the major. With many schools in Europe, you have to stick with your course or reapply for a transfer which could take another year, meaning I take another gap year.

This is where I'm conflicted. I am not happy here. But I don't know if I can take the disappointment in everybody that I've left two schools now and have no plans. I have three siblings all of which are now graduated and doing their own things and I can't help but feel like a failure. My parents try to reassure me they don't feel that way, but I can't help but be angry with myself. I don't know. My mom wants me to find an internship and go from there. I just can't shake the feeling that I'm giving up. When I decided on the school in Europe everyone was super excited and proud, and I feel like all of that will break down if I leave, but I'm just unhappy. I'll be turning 21 this year and everyone tells me I have so much time ahead of me, and I understand I do, but I also can't help but look at my friends, some of which are graduating this year and the majority will be graduating next year with a job lined up and I'm still at the first-year level of college. Im not sure if I should stick with the college I'm currently in and suck it up or if I should go back home and start all over again. Both have their pros and cons hence why I'm asking what others think. 

I guess any advice could be helpful, I'm just a little lost. It also just felt good to write this out."

I have about 4 years of experience so luckily my career is already a bit started, but I'm still worried about what's around the corner. Let's be clear about the current functionality:

- writing small functions, utilities, operations scripts
- providing another set of eyes, rubber ducking
- writing analytics queries for an arbitrary db
- writing latex and creating diagrams
- capable soft skills, can translate technical concepts for business stakeholders and vice versa
- add comments/documentation to a codebase

This tool knows more programming languages than me and can write code faster than me. 

To be clear, I'm not scared of the current functionality, but I'm scared about how quick it took us to get there, and about how much better chatgpt4 looks. I think we don't know yet how quickly this technology with advance.

I could see a near future where some kind of Jira to chatGPT to GitHub actions workflow could automatically respond to tickets. The bot could correspond with stakeholders on Jira or slack just like an employee. Perhaps a bot would be better at troubleshooting complex internal systems than a human.

The way i see it, it's a matter of how long it will take until the AI is good enough + how long it will take to fully integrate it into a development environment/workflow.

All the reddit threads with programmers dismiss the concept entirely but i think this is due to egotism of how our profession is different or more difficult that others that get automated. If junior dev roles are already being impacted, idk how you can say we are untouchable."

I'm a junior student at a top 25 university with a good computer science program and am currently pursuing a degree in computer engineering and computer science.

I just feel like coding is not a passion of mine as much as the thought behind the product itself and the planning and research that goes before the actual building. I was told by multiple people that at the beginning of someone's career it is always better to get as technical as possible (SWE > PM) if your goal is to become an entrepreneur and build a startup at some point. However, I know that  APM programs are insanely competitive to get into so I guess the value of the experience must also be incredible because of what's expected to get into them.

I will be graduating with a degree in information systems at the end of this month then I will have 3 months before starting as an IT compliance auditor at a consulting firm.

I don’t need to work during these three months and I’d rather not get some customer service or food service job to stay busy. I’d rather be working on or learning something more interesting to me.

My employer says that some other compliance auditors have CISA, CIA, or CISSP certificates but all of those require years of experience to become certified so I’m not sure about working on those.

I honestly don’t know much about IT  auditing besides some information I got from YouTube and reading online, but I know we will be sufficiently trained for the position.

Basically my question comes down to this: should I spend time learning and preparing for my job as a compliance auditor or should I focus on other skills that interest me?

Here are some subjects I enjoyed during school and as my internship as a data engineer : Data engineering using sql, data visualization with Tableau, penetration testing, web app development using dotnet, machine learning with python, and cloud computing.

I do not have a specific end career in mind as I enjoyed many subjects during school.

I would love to stay busy and use these next 3 months well so I am open to any and all suggestions!

Thanks so much for your time!"

With the insurance sales position, I was going door to door selling Medicare to individuals turning 65 and walking them through the health insurance process and providing guidance on what health care plan to choose. I didn't mind this kind of work, but I wasn't fond of the individuals I was working with. Most of the individuals were very low income and unreliable when planning meetings, and others were very unappreciative. I quit this position because of the opportunity at the advisory firm. 

In the past I had always liked the idea of a financial advisor. In my finance internship, I shadowed successful financial advisors and absolutely loved sitting in meetings and evaluating portfolios. But on the other hand, I hate the idea of calling friends and family members to try and make them clients. I feel that I would be burning bridges with those that I am close with and that's not something that sat right with me. After addressing my concerns with the advisors, they said that is part of the business and is something I will have to overcome, but for me that feeling will never change.

I'm open to exploring corporate finance, but have trouble getting interviews because I don't have any corporate experience on my resume. I also love the idea of helping individuals with personal finance decisions and retirement planning, but don't know if there is anything other than a personal financial advisor with that job description.

I hope this adequately explains my situation and possibly helps with recommendations. Any help or advice would be much appreciated! Thank you guys!"

2. Operating Systems as it pertains to designing or upgrading the operating system software (Not systems administrator).
3. Computer Architecture and Computer Hardware

2. Systems programmer
3. Reverse Engineer
4. Firmware Engineer

12j5mvq,16,2023-04-11,Everything makes sense now,IamSharriy,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/12j5mvq/everything_makes_sense_now/,"I just got recently diagnosed with adhd, and now it all makes sense. I always thought I was stupid because I was bullied in school by my own classmates due to trashy academics scores and even teachers said that you won't do anything in life which stayed with me for a long time even now.
 
It wasn't that I didn't understood anything, i just wasn't able to focus my mind because billions of thoughts simultaneously moving around my brain and it was difficult to maintain that information in my brain so somehow I graduated high school after giving it my all but then I was confuse what to do now but I loved technology and computers whenever I was working with computer i tend to lose the track of time.

I choose CS major it was difficult to learn programming for me cause I wasn't like other i got distracted and again got bad grades , after that I thought I wasn't good enough and left CS , it was awful, depressing i didn't do anything COVID happened and I got even more depressed played video games whole day waste my time.

After COVID i got an internship in a company as software developer i gave the interview and got selected I was excited and thrilled to learn and grow but yes you guessed it right the impulsivity of quitting the internship again made me depressed but then  I started to think why is this happening to me what did I do wrong why am I like this. 

So I decided to see a doctor for this and I told him about everything and he took assessments and told me I have adhd and after that everything changed for me , now I'm currently continuing with the internship I'm on meds now it kinda feels good to be able to focus and actually life has changed alot its really weird that I didn't thought of this before because where I live people would be like it's joke it doesn't exist you're just lazy try harder 

I'm 25 now and I don't really know where will my story go next, but I forgive myself , I've always been pessimistic because of this , hopefully Ill find peace and also my English is kinda trashy sorry about that and it's big giant post."
12j6mdy,1,2023-04-11,When should I list my job start date?,Parpienz,Resume,https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/12j6mdy/when_should_i_list_my_job_start_date/,"I got a depressing call where my recruiter basically said a short job on my resume would really hurt me because in six years I only had one job over 4 years. She said I looked very hoppy and unrealiable but said my story helped. It made me feel awful though.

So, I decided to look over my resume, since she wanted revisions, and I noticed something: my first job's start date was different on my resume and on my linkedin. That was odd.

So, I looked into my emails to find my offer letter and what I found now has me wondering what to do.

Apparently, one year before I graduated college, I did some kind of program with the company where I went to their office for a while. It sounds like an internship, but I literally don't remember this happening. Then, I got a job offer a year before I graduated college. Which must have been pretty lit for me. So, when I did graduate, I did training in San Francisco, which I do remember, and did on again/off again stuff to get setup before my official start date happened. I'm an accountant and this was with the Big 4.

It might be wishful thinking, but would it be deceitful or a bad idea to include an earlier start date since I technically had an offer and did training before the date I list as my start date, as far as I can tell. This was in 2015-2016, if it matters.

I just don't want to end up looking like a liar in a background check."

**Letters of Recommendation**

(8/10) engineering teacher - took one of her classes soph year, but known her throughout hs. she’s the club advisor to the activity i ranked 1st on the common app. was able to speak about my personality n leadership and we’re pretty close.

(7/10) ap chem teacher - he called me “the most diligent student in my ap chem section” behind my back to one of my senior year teachers. he likely wrote about my work ethic in ap chem even tho i wasn’t good at chemistry LOL.

(8/10) counselor - honestly i think she thinks im not mentally stable i cry in her office too much LOL but she’s generally rlly supportive of all of her students (even tho we are an overcrowded public school) and i gave her a bragsheet to write the rec. along w ap the chem teacher’s rec, i trial-runned her letter and got into most of the programs/internships i applied to pre-college app process so it must’ve been good.

**Interviews**

(7/10) duke: super fun, bonded over the boston food scene and basketball. he seemed impressed and we kept in touch afterward.

**Essays**

(4/10) personal statement: i hated mine. wrote three drafts over the summer and then re-wrote it like three weeks before the nov 1st deadlines. literally do not ask to read mine or for advice about writing personal statements bc holy shit it was a flaming disaster. the only other thing i’ll say is that mine was 584 words (wayy under the max) so quality > quantity of words but even then mine wasn’t quality imo.

(7/10) dook supps: i think my “why dook” was pretty unique because i don’t think anybody else could have written it the way i did. i only submitted one of the two max optional duke supplements, specifically the “best academic experience one.” i started the supplementals in may, after ap exams. HOWEVER, here’s why [i think you should write both optional essays, especially if you’re an RD applicant.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/102c0kf/comment/j2tnap6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* (early decision) DUKE! #gobluedevils

*Rejections:*

* NONE (so thankful lol. probs would’ve been rejected from all reaches if i hadn't withdrawn).

**Additional Information/Reflection:**

i did mention my AP Scholar award in the “additional information” section.

my dook hooks: 1) i received a strong LOR from an alum and 2) i sent in an arts supplement to duke for my instrument. i’mm friendly with the dook professor for my instrument and was able to reference her in essays for the music supp. also the said dook prof has been excited for while abt me applying ED and i def got decent ratings at least (on the technical side).

[how to write a “Why X School” essa](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/yfs0dd/comment/iu61u07/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)y? comment i wrote on a now-deleted account that i think sums up my thoughts on that pretty well

&#x200B;

things i regret/don’t regret but want you to know abt the college app process:

&#x200B;

* **IF YOU ARE A GIRL IN STEM who wants to apply for duke cs**, maybe think about applying for duke engineering instead, esp if your application/ecs can go both ways. i think [pratt is trying to fix their gender ratio rn](https://pratt.duke.edu/about) (37% female-identifying student body), and cs is a bloodbath (has been and will be for future application cycles), and it’s fairly easy to transfer from pratt to trinity. anecdotally, i have a few female friends who also EDed duke but w higher stats than me and for cs and didn’t get in, v unforch. this advice doesn’t apply to other schools (like carnegie mellon).
   * in general i think dook ED is a v nice boost (16.5% vs 5% RD bloodbath lol). if you like dook, pls consider EDing.
* PICK AN ED/REA SCHOOL WISELY. try to pick one with a statistical advantage of applying early ([georgetown](https://uadmissions.georgetown.edu/applying/early-action/), i’m looking at you with an REA acceptance rate LOWER than your RD acceptance rate LOL), or one where you have legacy/a special connection to. and honestly one that you’d be content with. people have asked me if i feel like i “settled” for duke, and i’d be lying if i said no, but i genuinely don’t think i could’ve gotten anywhere else (besides my safeties) and i’m honestly still over the moon about duke even if some of my friends are headed to mit or ivies haha.
* revise revise revise personal statement. it’s okay if you still hate it in the end but the college app process is less stressful if you don’t hate ur personal statement and if it’s been thru a lot of edits and been read by people who KNOW the selective colleges’ admissions process/ people who know YOU (teachers, counselors, older friends etc.). i do not recommend having friends in your same grade read ur essays, esp if u know they’re similar to you stats-wise or applying to the same schools.
* start essays early. i missed out on some parties/hangouts over the summer and during senior fall because instead of staying out late i’d be in my room editing/writing. no regrets - starting essays early and working on them consistently rlly helped my sanity, even if i ended up still hating my personal statement.

honestly my mental health was at an all-time low because of my personal statement. i do not recommend. also my sat score was mid af. i will def be looking at my dook admissions file, so might repost (again) in a few months or so once i get to that!!! feel free to ask me qs before then tho!!"
12j7ahz,1,2023-04-11,What should I do?,NatsukiRem,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12j7ahz/what_should_i_do/,"A little bit of background about me: I’m 22, live in Las Vegas, and I recently just graduated college majoring in Hospitality Management. I’ve been working F&B at a local restaurant close to where I live since it was so convenient with school, but now want to branch out.  I applied to a lot of different graduate programs, internships, and jobs, and I was lucky enough to get two offers. 

Here’s the issue:
I initially accepted a job at a very high end resort with a starter position. They’re very high class and even though it’s only been one week I very much enjoy the people I am working with and I believe that there is opportunity for growth available. 

However, right after I accepted that job and started, the other company reached out to me to inform me that I was accepted into their management program.   However, there is a big different between the quality of hotels. While the hotel I’m working at right now is 5 star, meaning that they’re bigger and offer a lot more amenities. For the management program, I would be working at a 3 star hotel, and I would have to relocate out of state . However, the company is also very big. They have a lot of other locations which I could apply and transfer to after the program. 

Do you guys think that the management training opportunity is worth taking? I’ve been going back and forth about what I want to do. While I do love where I work right now, I also feel like it would be a waste to not take the chance for the management program. At the same time, since the hotel I’d be transferring to is a downgrade to where I am now, I’m not sure if it’s worth it. Moreover, I would be leaving before my 90 day probation ends, which I feel like could leave a sour taste."

For the CS kids, is it that easy to find internships and such that aren’t related to the MIC (Military Industrial Complex)? Because I kind of actually have morals. It’s near D.C. so I get there’s a ton of gov’t-related opportunities and companies but if I have to struggle too much purposefully avoiding any of the military-related ones then that’s kind of an issue. IK you send out hundreds of apps at a time but is avoiding the MIC ones feasible in the College Park area? 

B. Are bug and roach issues really that prevalent in the dorms here? Do the STEM kids actually get better dorms or is that an unfounded claim (not my own claim btw)? Saying this as a pretty severe insectophobe. And lack of AC is bad enough but that’s worse 

Go ahead and make fun of me if you feel like it but I’m hopeful for at least some answers lol"

I've completed one internship with a big service-based company working in that field in India. Didn't get the full-time offer. Currently, I'm on my second internship since the last 2 months at a startup that is around 8 years old, and honestly, I don't see getting an offer from here as well because from what I can observe, they don't need data scientists for their clientele. They just build stuff and & deliver it. I don't know why they took me as an intern then. Despite applying to several places, I'm not receiving any responses, and college placements haven't been satisfactory either.

I'll be graduating next month and I'm freaking out because recession is here and hiring is at a halt at most companies but isn't this REALLY bad for 2023 grads? What should I do? Any heads up or beginner advice? Or maybe some additions to my tech stack? Please help!

12jbpjf,1,2023-04-12,Why do I hate myself despite being “successful”/achieving my goals?,himothyjamess,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12jbpjf/why_do_i_hate_myself_despite_being/,"


Hey all, 

I don’t know why, but I find reaching out to strangers very comforting, and feel like I can be open without it changing the perception of me that the close friends/family have of me. 
I also want to state when I say successful, I mean I have reached the goals I set for myself and not in the sense of being an arrogant asshole. 

Just to start with some background, for the past 1-2 years, I have been really struggling with erratic sleep patterns, anxiety/depression, and strong suicide ideation. 
I started talking to a therapist around 4 months ago when the thoughts got very strong and I started meticulously planning the details. My therapist is a great guy, and I really enjoy talking to him/getting his advice. I also got prescribed bipolar/sleep(lexapro) medicine by a psychiatrist as I have a family history of it, but that didn’t seem to help much as my sleep was still ridiculous. In high school, I was always someone who went to bed late(around 12-1), but now in college, I am frequently pulling all nighters or going to bed at 4-6am and not waking up until 3-4pm. It really sucks because I am missing all my classes and the cycle continues as I have to keep up with work. I will say that I do make things worse as I tend to procrastinate all tests/hw, and I am stem major at a top 10 Uni. 
The thing is no one around me notices how miserable I am or I am able to hide it well due to my sarcastic/reserved personality with friends, and the fact I am doing well in school and internship wise.  I just got a big interview, and did well, which made me happy for all of 2 hours before I started to become suicidal again. I feel I am constantly beating up on myself and always so stressed out. It’s been this way for as long as I can remember, even when I got into my Uni(a long term goal of mine), I wasn’t happy about it for long, and started obsessing over the next goal. I have tried to control these thoughts with meditation, medication, talking to people, and planning big lifestyle changes(gym,food, social media), but nothing works. I still hate myself and I just don’t get it. 
Its not like I have troubles in the social scene or family either. I have a loving girlfriend, great friends, and a close family. Yet I still feel so miserable with myself and that I am this big failure, or life isn’t worth living. 

I guess this was just a rant, but if at all possible, I’d just like to hear what everyone thinks about my situation? Does anyone else suffer from self deprecating thoughts? If you got over it, how?

12jcko2,12,2023-04-12,Feeling regret majoring in CS,froggychairluvr,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/12jcko2/feeling_regret_majoring_in_cs/,"
Nearing the end of my junior year and feeling hopeless about this field. I found the early trivial programs fun and like solving puzzles. now I find myself hating the classes i’m taking and doing poorly as a result. I got my first B last semester, now I might have a couple Cs this semester.

my biggest wake up call was the job I recently started. I searched for months for an internship and could only land a research assistant job at my university. I still felt like this would be an awesome learning opportunity and especially good looking on a resume. but wow has it been stressful. i’m essentially “apprenticing” someone only a year ahead of me trying to figure out a super outdated web app framework and do 15 hours of work each week. 

I constantly feel stupid compared to this person only a year ahead of me and almost each week during our meetings I get called out in a “nice” way if I haven’t reached the hours they want me to. which is very difficult when you’re nearing the end of your junior year! this guy is going to leave at some point during the summer and I might be stuck with no help at this job. it’s so stressful and sometimes I miss my old restaurant job where I had cool people to work with. 

I just want to hear that everyone feels this way towards the end of college and that at some point I will feel confident in CS. I’m tired of the stress and disinterest I have."

12jcqac,11,2023-04-12,Tertia Optio [XCOM FanFic] - Chapter 2: PERDITVS - Part 2,Gold_Eagle_RSR,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/12jcqac/tertia_optio_xcom_fanfic_chapter_2_perditvs_part_2/,"  

Like on command, XCOM slammed the entrance door open and shoved it against the concrete wall. Heavy footsteps came closer and closer, while sweat was forming on my forehead. I had to smile at this absurd situation I found myself in, relying on a Viper to survive the attack of humans. Voices and radio chatter mixed with static could be heard right outside our door. We both cowered in our corners as much as possible, and the Viper put her tail around herself as much as she could. The door opened halfway, light flooding onto the empty floor between us, before being slammed shut again.

“*Carajo*, the snake is gone, Lieutenant! It broke the door! Lock is busted!”

Two more sets of footsteps made their way towards us, stopping for a moment, before they went further down the pump house. I saw her hands shaking, her eyes filled with fear. *So much for the vicious predator.* I put a finger on my lips and readied my rifle in slow-motion. My pulse was racing, the arteries in my neck felt like they would rip open from the pressure. I took a step forward, facing the door, waiting for the scarce light shining through the barred window to be disturbed again. There it was. A shadow stepped in front of our hiding spot.

My body tensed up, and the autopilot of muscle memory and adrenaline took over. I completely ignored the creature next to me as I lost myself to the impending carnage.

With a hefty kick, I banged the door against the shadow's owner, which sent him flying against the wall. I roared when I ran out to the right and fired a salvo at the soldier turning around at the commotion. A bullet found their target, hitting him in the head. His absurdly huge machinegun fell down with a clatter as he crumbled to the ground.

The Viper followed suit and used the prison cell door as cover to suppress the last one standing left of the prison cell. Meanwhile, the unlucky guy struck by the door came back together. Like a ninja, he jumped back on his feet, and drew an impressively long machete from his back, the Snake in sight.

Before he could lash out, I kicked at his knee and tried to get a shot at him, only to have my rifle held back by his free arm. He tried to skewer me with his blade, but only sliced across my armour plating with no effect. I punched him with my left and stepped backwards to loosen his grip on my rifle.

While we were brawling, the Viper had obvious problems with the bastard further down the hall. He must have something with a high fire rate by the sound of the bursts that hammered into the door. She attempted two or three pot shots at him, but either missed or only hit his cover.

The Spaniard I was struggling against shouted curses at me in his language while trying to kick one of my legs. He let go of my weapon and swung his blade from above, I countered by grabbing my G3 with both hands, blocking his arms with the rifle.

I pushed him to the side and attempted to shoot him again, but he was quicker. *The perks of being young*. He reached for my rifle's barrel, pointing it towards the Viper who was watching us in terror. Her opponent also stopped shooting, probably because he feared to hit his ally. He now put his other hand against my rifle as well, pushing me against the wall with all his strength.

We were both sweating, grunting and out of breath, trying to overpower the other with raw muscle. Still holding my rifle's barrel, he attempted to decapitate me from the side. I let go of my weapon entirely and grabbed his arm with my left. Before he realised he was exposed, I drew my pistol with my right and hip-fired the entire magazine into his stomach.

He spat out blood before I let go of his arm with the machete. He collapsed on the spot with a puddle of blood forming around him.

“No! Calixto!” the last remaining XCOM member screamed.

Still gasping for air, I picked up my rifle again, and took position behind the Viper. She was making herself as small as possible, with her upper body hovering just above the ground, and most of her tail remaining in the prison cell. I risked a peek at the last man, only to be greeted by a hail of fire zipping past my head.

*Wer so viel schießt hat bald nichts mehr*.

The Viper glanced at me before concentrating on the danger in the room again.

“If we do it together, he won't be able to retaliate, right?” she asked.

I tapped her on the shoulder with my barrel and showed her three of my fingers when she looked up.

*Count to three.*

She understood and readied herself and her shotgun, hands still shaking.

*One*.

I wiped away the sweat running into my eyes.

*Two.*

She put one of hands on the ground to throw herself forward.

*Three.*

With a jump, I left the cover of the heavy door and put a series of shots down the concrete battleground. The snake, still keeping low, pumped her weapon empty.

The XCOM Lieutenant, as this was what the Spaniard called him, was hissing orders to somebody through his headset when we both surprised him. He looked for cover behind some pipes running from the ground up to the ceiling, but got hit before he could hide behind the steel tubing completely. He fell to his knees, returning fire with his strange looking submachine gun. 

The serpent under me hissed and retreated behind the door, holding her bleeding arm. I checked up on the Viper, which was squirming from the wound. Agony flickered in her eyes like flashes of a thunderstorm. The XCOM Lieutenant switched position, and crawled behind some piping in the corner of the hallway.

Hearing a clicking noise, I knew the Lieutenant was reloading. It was now or never. I switched my gun to fully automatic while I left my cover again. The bullets shredded through the pipes, hitting the target and spread splinters around the area. He fell to his side and gave a rattling sound, before all the tension left his body.

*His toy gun couldn’t penetrate the steel door while my battle rifle went through the pipes like butter. This fight could have ended completely different if he had a better weapon.*

“Like I said, when your gun is empty you either won the battle or you’re dead.” I joked and pointed at the shotgun she dropped.

“Ugh. I’m bleeding to death and you are making jokes.” She hissed. Yellow blood poured out between her fingers, which ran down her arm and dripped from her elbow. I shouldered my G3 and slung her empty gun around my back as well. I had to remind myself to not trust the alien. 

*She might have shown some courage and even caught a bullet for me, doesn’t mean I have to go easy on her.* 

“Don’t be so dramatic, I've seen worse wounds from kids falling down a tree. I think we are done here; we should get out of here.” Slowly, the Viper raised her head, still breathing heavily: “Yes, that sounds like a – WATCH OUT!”

Following the aliens' eyes, I swirled around while grabbing my pistol, which was still empty. A shot knocked me off my feet and pressed the air out of my lungs. I felt a punch into my ribs as I fell down. *I forgot about the fourth man. And to reload my pistol. Am I this stupid or simply getting old?*

I grabbed my rifle regardless of the pain, the shoulder strap getting stuck on something at my back. Semi-automatic fire cracked through the pump house as I watched the Viper shooting out her tongue, grabbing something and letting go again, all within the blink of an eye. Finally, I got my rifle unstuck and fired aimlessly towards the entrance. Then, silence.

I slowly sat up, gazing into the sun that was shining through the entrance door, my attacker lying flat on the ground. My strange sister-in-arms towered over me and was giving me a disturbed look.

“Are you hurt? You don’t bleed, so that’s good, right? Can you get up? Where are you hit?”

With a puff I stood up, careful not to breathe too quickly in order to keep the pain in my lungs at a moderate level, ignoring the bombardment of questions. *Maybe I can trust her. She could have easily killed me after I emptied my magazine.*

“You are hurt when you get hit by a car. This here is getting wounded.” I clarified. “Really lucky I hit him with that spray.” I said while checked myself for wounds. *Everything in order, just some bruised ribs. My plate stopped the bullet.*

“Actually, he was already unconscious when you tried to shoot him…” she said.

She pointed an index at a metal valve sticking out where the last XCOM member was standing prior. “I grabbed him and pulled his head against the pipe.”

*Now I look like even more like an idiot. This snake is quite the clever girl.*

I hobbled my way towards the unconscious man. He had markings on his collar and shoulders showing some low rank I couldn’t place. XCOM had its own kind of rank structure, far more simplistic than the Army or Navy. I finally reloaded my sidearm and aimed at his head.

“Wait, what are you doing?”

“Finishing it.” I answered. The snake wanted to object, but then closed her eyes and looked away.

*Bang.*

I made my way outside, still aiming frantically around while I stumbled away from the pump house. Everything was empty, no one to be seen, and the helicopter was gone. The Sun has begun to set behind the mountains, sending the last rays of warmth towards the reservoir. I heard the Viper approach me from behind. I was still wary of her, although she convinced me about her lack of training.

*I could have sworn she closed her eyes while shooting her shotgun, and her aim was terrible.*

“Remember our deal. Farewell.” I said to her, making my way up to the road again. I didn’t care about Phoenix anymore… or XCOM…. or anything else. I simply wanted to get out of here.

I had trouble to stand from the aching in my body, the adrenaline was wearing off fast and the pain become numbing and overwhelmingly intense. There was no chance for me to get back to the safehouse without resting beforehand. *But where?*

“Wait!” She exclaimed and slithered after me, to which I turned around and pointed my Glock at her. “I told you! Back off!”

She raised her arms up again, and I got a good look at her in the last bit of sunlight. Her colouration was vastly different to all the Vipers I’ve seen so far; completely black scales ran from her face to the tip of her long tail, with her underside and belly part being in a contrasting shade of white. Small stripes of the same white-ish colour covered her long arms in a tiger-like pattern, ending on her broad shoulders

Parts around her hip and stomach had black scales as well, painting her to a point below waistline in a strange pattern. Like all Vipers she had a very toned body, muscles on her arms and abs clearly visible on her wide frame. And she was huge; her height was definitely over eight feet. It was likely the tallest one I’ve seen yet, putting her in a good margin above the average snake alien.

“I do not know where I am, or how to get back to City 11. I’m bleeding, I’m cold and haven’t eaten or drank anything for three days.” She paused and blinked a couple times.

She had long fingers, with razor-sharp claws where the fingernail on a human hand would be. There was an impressive wide hood, which span from her cranium to the base of her neck. Each time she spoke, rows of angled white teeth flashed from her mouth, while her fangs stayed hidden somewhere in the maw.

Then I noticed her clothes were missing. Only an oversized bra was covering as much as it could with the little fabric it had*.* The breasts hanging from this alien snake's chest must have been the size of my head and a half, neatly tucked away by the black piece of underwear. I stopped myself from ogling her any further and concentrated on her face.

She lowered her arms, despite the gun still being trained on her, and pressed on her wound again. “At least I think it was three days. You saved my life more than once today, and I will forever be in your debt, but please help me get back home.”

Her face was full of emotion, unlike the constant frowning, flat grimace of the standard Viper. The colouration of black and white was clearly divided between the upper- and lower jaw. She had a bit of a snout, and the corners of her mouth quivered from the pain. Her eyelids had dropped slightly as she was clearly tired, and the scaled “eyebrows” twitched from time to time. Her ruby eyes were still pleading with me and tried to outshine the glowing orange sun behind her.

I was stuck up here, at least for this night. Not even morphine would help against the tightness in my chest that slowly crept up my neck and down to my stomach, the bruising getting more noticeable by the seconds passing. *I rather have her around me instead of not knowing where she might ambush me. Do I even have a choice? And if she really does not have any ill intentions, do I want to leave her behind like this?* 

Grinding my teeth, I answered: “Fine. New deal: neither of us would make it back today anyways. We rest somewhere, head back to the city in the morning, part ways and never see each other again.” Another rush of pain made me whine into myself. “Deal?”

She quickly nodded and took my deal as a sign to approach me. “Nu-uh”- I waved with my gun “I want distance between us.”

She backed off with a sad expression, and together, we shambled and slithered towards the dam. I checked behind me for the distance and her pacing every couple seconds. The Viper was still bleeding, her life essence already covering her right arm from the shoulder to the tip of her claws.

*What kind of situation have I brought myself into again?* *Am I out of my mind? What am I doing with her, and why does it bother me what happens to the damn snake?*

***Meanwhile, In City 11;*** 

Detective Harris let his hand slide over the wall covered in black ash. The eggheads from the laboratory and their drones have confirmed that everything was scanned and documented, and that there was no need to preserve any more of the burned down hotel room. He inspected the thin layer of grey powder in his hands before smearing it on his trousers, leaving a dark hand mark on his thigh.

*What a mess* – he thought.

The adjacent Gene Clinic was a smoking ruin, half a dozen people got wounded, an ADVENT prisoner with crucial information was dead, and a hotel worker was missing… and all he had to work with was a pile of ash.

“Hey Andrew. Couldn’t wait for the case to land on your desk either?”

Harris' partner, the wiry detective Wilson, greeted him with a bored tone. ADVENT officials called them both on the scene once the work overwhelmed them. It was very unusual for the officials to get the city's regular police detectives involved in a case of terrorism, which showed Harris and Wilson just how desperate the leadership was already. There was a lot of pressure from above.

With a handshake Harris spread the ashes into his partner’s hand. “Not every day we get assigned to something like… this.”  Wilson went through his dark, curly hair with a sigh. “Found anything useful in the room at all? Considering everything is burned to a crisp?”

“The only thing that survived the fire was the rifle,” Harris pointed at the partially melted weapon. ”I mean, more or less… the remaining bullets inside cooked off, and the chassis got badly damaged. I doubt we will find fingerprints or DNA. It's an old military model, a fifty Cal...”

“I don’t see why the administration ordered us to look into this case. It’s clear this wasn’t a murder for some personal grudge, simply a terrorist attack.” Wilson noted as he inspected the gun laying on the floor, surrounded by parts of a burned table. “And they won't tell us what information they hoped to gain from the prisoner that was shot. What are they expecting us to find?”

“They got us into this mess because a person is still missing, so they expect us to find the boy. Also, this does not look like a normal terrorist attack for me. Why would they bother with burning down the evidence.?”

“He was the intern, so why is he missing? Makes little sense to abduct someone like him. Also, do you think of an inside job? Someone covering his tracks?” Wilson asked.

Harris shook his head and went back to taking notes in his little red book he always had with him. Both of the detectives speculated in silence as a deputy came into the room. “Sirs, the hotel manager has the recordings of the lobby ready for you.”

With a nod, they followed their younger colleague into the security office on the ground floor, exchanged handshakes and spoke about the time gap in which the terrorists would have come through the entrance. The manager was a rather large man wearing a suit, his bald head reflecting the blue screens of the security cameras like a mirror.

“I am very grateful for you to look into this, detectives. Simon, our Intern, was not seen since the attack happened.” He snorted.

Harris wrote word for word into his notes. “What was he doing when the attack happened?”

“Our guests had a noise complaint, so he went to see if everything was alright. It was on the eighth floor too, I think.” His face turned red and worrying as he recalled which floor the burned room was. “I hope he’s alright... what do I tell his parents, if…”

Wilson and Harris both looked at each other and gave their standard answer: “We shouldn’t make assumption just yet. We would like to see all the security footage you got from yesterday, everything from seven to nine p.m.”

The fat man gave his security chief a small nod, who typed in the period. In a rapid time-lapse, people went in and out of the camera's point of view, but nobody entered or left the building. At the timestamp reading *19:38***,** a man came into the lobby, carrying a large suitcase.

“Stop there. That’s our man.” Wilson ordered. Harris pulled out his little book again, taking rapid notes from what he saw on the screen: *Heavy built, around six foot four. The suit was odd. Definitely in his late forties. Long, dark blonde hair covering his ears. Wearing reflecting shades. He was alone, nobody else followed or left when he entered.* The unknown man looked around quickly before marching to the front desk, chatting with the receptionist.

“Why is there no audio?” Wilson inquired.

The manager gave him an apologetic look. “We weren’t allowed to install cameras outside or microphones in our security system because of the Gene Clinic next to us. The City’s administration has strict rules about that.”

“What about cams on the hallways?” Wilson followed up, to which the big man only shook his head.

“I want to speak to the receptionist. And we will need your system's check ins- and outs of the entire week.” Harris ordered without looking up from his notes. The security footage reeled again at normal speed. *Large scar going from the left eyebrow to his cheek. The shades hid his eye colour. We won’t be able to scan the iris* – he wrote. The manager printed out the address and contact info of his employee, handing it to the shorter detective.

“What’s that?” Wilson pointed at something in the suspect's face. A small needle was sticking out from his mouth, and it looked like he chewed on it.

“Toothpick. A habit to get away from smoking.” Harris filled another page with information before he closed his book. They fast forwarded the footage on four times the speed until *20:22.* A vibration distorted the camera, and people ran outside the building. Red light flooded from the street where the Gene Clinic was standing. Harris noted the time of the explosion, and who ran out the building. The only one he couldn’t spot with the panicked guests and hotel workers was the missing intern and the suspect. A small reel forward to *20:26* showed ADVENT troopers rushing through the entrance and securing the surrounding area.

“Our colleague will take a copy of this.” Harris said.

The detectives said their goodbyes and went outside the hotel to lean against their car. Mutons patrolled alongside Troopers around the remaining fragments of the Clinic, the yellow *do-not-cross* band danced in the evening's wind around the still smoking pile of concrete.

“What do you think, Wilson?” Harris asked his best friend.

“It's strange. Why would anyone bomb and eliminate-“

“I was talking about the missing intern and our suspect.” Both men stared at the smouldering ruins in front of them. With a sigh, Wilson corrected himself.

“Nobody saw the intern or the culprit leave the building, and we have searched all the areas they could have gone from the eighth floor. The man probably has military background, the way he moved and checked around his area… seen that before with veterans.

Harris went through his partner's input and thought about all potential scenarios. The Sun disappeared and the streetlights lit up one by one. High above them the flickering red and yellow neon lights of the *Advent Burger* sign died out, probably damaged by the explosion.

“What about the areas they could *not* have gone to?” Harris said.

“Well, the air vents got checked and would also be too small for that man. There are no fire escape stairs or ladders on that side of the building. The gate of the car deck was last used around afternoon, so they didn’t use a vehicle. The only option left would be…”

Wilson stopped leaning against the car. “… maintenance floors.” Wilson stopped his sentence before finishing his thought: “But he couldn’t have a key for that and the boy… unless he got it from somewhere.” Harris gave him a smug grin.

“Come on, let’s check it out.” Together, they got the key for the elevator and moved down several floors before the doors opened. They both had their mag-pistols out, since nobody searched the area yet. From all they knew, the suspect could still be in the building. They checked every room until they stopped at the open doors of the laundry. Scattered tools were dispersed across the white tiles. They nodded to each other and entered the room, checking the corners before slowly approaching towards where the tools came from.

The stench of foul water filled their noses, and a person tied up to a chair came into view. A puddle of blood was spread evenly across the floor, already in a dark brown colour.

“Jesus.” Wilson exclaimed, putting away his weapon and checking on the figure. “It's the intern. Dead for hours. That asshole fled through the sewers like a rat.”

Harris closed his eyes. “Nothing we could have done. He disposed of him once he wasn’t useful anymore.”

After taking a deep breath, and regretting it because of the stench coming from the open sewer-gate, Harris used his radio to notify his colleagues of what they found. Wilson already put on gloves and took pictures as Harris pulled out his red book once again.

*Like an execution. Shot in the back of the head. Two bullet casings, nine millimetres. Tied up on the chair, no sign of a fight. No visible defensive wounds or scratches. The metal cabins are all bashed in with a hammer or something similar.* After a closer look at the damaged lockers, he crossed out his last sentence and told Wilson to make close-up pictures. *The metal cabins got bashed in by someone. Blood on the dents and the surrounding area of impact.*

Wilson could barely contain his disgust and anger and vented under his breath as he took pictures of the young corpse.

“What kind of sick fuck does this?”

UT would be the most affordable, followed by Georgia Tech and then Cornell. I will be getting some financial aid from Cornell. I also got into Rice so any opinions on that are welcome too.

Even though I like the prestige factor, I also want to be in an environment that is supportive. Hoping the CS or other majors at UT can help answer some of my questions:

1. How large are the class sizes for incoming freshman? I would be able to skip the intro CS and math classes. How is the overall teaching and experience with professors? Is it consistently good ?
2. How is the recruiting scene at UT? Is most of the work to find internships and jobs needs to be done on your own or the career services is helpful?
3. How is the student community? Is everyone collaborative or more cut-throat?
4. What are the options for other majors or minors while pursuing CS? Is getting a second degree in engineering or business possible? I will be coming in with a lot of AP credits.
5. Has there been an impact of recession on the recruiting scene? Do the college rankings matter as UT has slipped a bit?
6. Do you wish the UT program was more structured after the core CS classes are completed or do you like the freedom to take any electives?
7. How important is GPA for jobs etc.?

What should my next move be to feel competent for getting a job/What area should I focus on?

A little background about me:

I'm currently 30, decided to go back to school when the pandemic took my job. I recently (December 2022) graduated with a BS in computer science with a 4.0. While I had good grades my school's program was actually **very** weak. We mostly just did simple stuff in Java, no actual major projects, no source control. The most involved thing we did was a hacky copy and paste JavaFX lab. Everything else was basically just data structure example labs/leetcode easy questions, never did anything involving the internet.  For my project class I took a web app dev class that was supposed to use React and we ended up just doing a single page application in HTML/CSS. The professor actually ended up not getting his contract renewed because of how bad this class was. Thankfully, I did do an independent study and taught myself ML/AI in python because it seemed interesting. This actually taught me a lot about how to actually code. I did get an internship with the title of software developer but it was really more of a data science type of job as it was more ML in python. 

So I graduated in December and don't feel really prepared for any jobs, combine that with the job market and I think my best bet right now is basically just to self study and get some legit projects for my resume that aren't focused around ML/AI. But I have already wasted so much time that I want to make sure I am maximizing the value of what I do next (While also avoiding falling into tutorial hell)

I think I have 2 options right now:

1 - Web dev (React, Node, CSS/HTML): There's a ton of resources out there for this, plus a friend from my college who is going through the same thing is also going this route which would give me someone to work with. Lends itself well to making something ""tangible"". But I really don't know much about this stuff at all.

2  - Java development: While we didn't do anything really modern with Java I at least know the language and have messed around with spring boot (had to use it for a coding interview). I don't really know what to make with this though. 

In the time since graduation I have been messing around with Android development because I have a good idea for a project but I don't think this is the best use of my time as Android dev seems to have a very steep learning curve, so I am thinking Android should just be a hobby.

I'd appreciate if anyone could provide some insight on what they think the best next move for me is, whether that be web dev, Java, or something else entirely. If you made it this far thanks for reading my wall o' text."

I started applying for summer internships (mainly in Data Engineering/Data Science/ML) from November (pretty late) and was shortlisted for 10+ interviews (made it past the initial OA/HireVue). Out of these, I made it to the final round for 5 roles but was unfortunately rejected in all of them.

I am learning from these experiences and modifying my CV/skillset accordingly, but it seems too late for a Summer 2023 internship now. Keeping that in mind, I have secured a Research Assistantship at a lab at my university for the Summer but will keep on applying for internships till the end of this semester.

Not wanting to repeat the internship application timeline, I want to apply early for full-time roles after I graduate, but I am confused about when to start applying for them. Is it too early to start applying for new grad roles, or should I get started now?

Note: I have 1 year of full-time work experience as an entry-level Data Engineer at a big IT company, and I'm targeting similar roles. Also, I want to ask whether I should start applying for full-time roles now, along with internships for this summer parallelly.

I managed to clear the first 2 rounds and the last round (HR round) went well, so I’m expecting the acceptance letter.

However I’m not sure if I should join. The reasons being -

1. I’ll have to spend the entire 7th semester at Bangalore whereas my college is in Jaipur. For my midsems, endsems and other exams, I’ll have to travel to Jaipur which could end up being very hectic and tiring and money consuming. The stipend is ₹45000pm, is that enough to live comfortably in Bangalore ? The salary for full time roles is around 15LPA.

2. There’s no guarantee of a full time offer. The full time offer will only be given based on performance and if the company has any open positions at the end of the internship.

3. I’ll be banned from campus placements most probably. I wont be able to sit for any other companies that come on campus.
This is my biggest concern. If dont end up getting the full time offer, I’ll be stuck in a situation where I can’t rely on on-campus placements.


Please let me know what your thoughts are. Thank you."

I quit my finance job in March 2022 to work part time as a data analyst while recruiting for a full time DS role, which I landed June 2022. I was there for 10 months before being laid off a few weeks ago. I transitioned from an intern to full time there but I was one of two junior DS because my manager that hired us quit 6 weeks into my time there. Because of that, even as interns we had many responsibilities managing and updating the existing machine learning models.

Specific feedback I'd love to get is:

* Will I get dinged by ATS for using a two column style resume?
* Do my achievements reflect my job responsibilities I noted above? 
   * Is it worth having the first few bullet points to talk about my responsibilities - the two machine learning models I managed - before jumping into my broader achievements?
* Are there any bullet points that might raise an eyebrow? Everything in the ""Achievements"" section is accurate but I did *embellish* a bit. Nothing that might be beyond my capabilities or that I can't speak to though.

I got this job thinking I was only going to stay for a few months before I found a job in my field.

But after many many applications, and my internships falling through I ended up staying here.

I grew up in domestic abuse and was made to be the third parent of all of my younger siblings. I lived at home and did online school and worked to suppprt my family. I was turning 26 and had to find a full time job for benefits. So I didn't get the opportunity to focus on art and Animation a lot. On top with depression and anxiety from growing up with abuse.

I thought once I had my own place to live I'll be able to focus on an art career again, updating my portfolio. Well now I'm finally on my own and I feel like all my energy goes to work and house work.

I have a degree but it's being wasted on retail. And I can't seem to just break into an art career no matter what.

Help me think through some possible paths?,inquisitiveLankyApe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12jsora/im_5_years_into_a_career_as_a_semiconductor/,"Hi everyone, I’ve seen some really helpful advice on here and thought I might describe my current situation. If there is anyone that could give me some input that would be greatly appreciated. As it stands, I have three different STEM degrees but none of them are in computer science.

B.S. physics

B.S. mathematics

M.S. mechanical engineering

I’ve gotten some enjoyment out of studying programming in my free time over the past few years (almost entirely with Python). But over the past few months I’ve been getting more serious about it. I'm now at a point where I could picture myself enjoying a career as a software engineer more than my current position in the semiconductor industry. After frequenting this forum, I’m thinking there are a few possible paths if I were to seriously attempt to change careers.

**1. Fully go back to school for an M.S. or M.C.S.** I like the idea of earning another degree, but the drawback of this plan is that there are  5 or 6 undergrad deficiency courses I would need to take before applying to graduate programs at the nearby university. My current employer might be willing to pay for it! Buuut if I’m working as a full time engineer that will probably leave me stuck taking one class per semester over the next 2 to 3 years before officially entering a master's program (plus I have a feeling that time spent studying for classes like digital design and assembly code is time spent not learning meaningful dev skills). This might also allow me to do an internship further down the line, but is leaving a decent quality engineering job for a temporary internship in your 30’s at all advisable? (Currently 31 years old.)

**2. Do a coding bootcamp.** I have my eye on one of these and it seems most of them are geared towards front end web development? Which has some appeal to me! But the one I'm looking at costs $13k (yikes!) and there’s no guarantee I’ll be able to get a job once I graduate from that. Plus the C.S. job market is incredibly hectic right now. I would be competing with people that have actual university degrees and from this forum I can see a lot of entry level people are STRUGGLING to find jobs. 

**3. Be entirely self-educated.** With this option I would have to hold out hope that an employer will eventually be willing to take a chance on me. I have seen a couple comments from people in here to the effect of “*if you already have a STEM background just post your own projects to GitHub and be able to speak about them in interviews*”. But with this option how would I make my resume key-word searchable? Would I make a “relevant projects” section and still list my unrelated engineering experience? And on top of that, would I need to have an array of multiple projects across multiple programming languages? Or should I just pick one programming language and run with it? (Maybe javascript if there's one particular language for the best chance of getting a job?)

Thank you if there’s anyone that read my entire post. If there is anyone here that found themselves in a similar situation and would be willing to share their story I’d be happy to hear it!"

I graduated from a good school last year and have been trying to find a job but it's so hard right now to find anything.

Then I had tried going for an unpaid internship after I graduated and it was looking promising but my parents up and decided to move out of state, which meant I couldn't rely on them to help cover room and board. I decided to stay in California rather than move to Idaho with them, and I don't regret that decision, but now I'm still struggling just to find a decent job, because I lack experience. I'm questioning if it's my degree or if it's just the market. I've probably applied to a lot of places that are looking for entry-level positions and I've barely heard back from any. It's just so disappointing to not get the opportunity to just do something with my life right now. I had wanted to work in computational linguistics, as I have the background for it, but with all the mass tech layoffs there's nothing I can really apply for. I had to think a bit more outside the box, with positions that I had the skills for, even if I didn't necessarily have all the experience. Still, nothing has come of it. There was this product manager apprenticeship position that I was plenty qualifed for and really exicted about and I got rejected, without much explanation. Now, I'm trying to work for the IRS, which I think would be a good fit, even if it's not how I originally saw myself working. I have a bit of faith I might get in since I have a few connections, but my background is spotty so I'm holding my breath.

It feels like I keep getting shafted. I'm a fairly introverted guy to begin with, and the pandemic made it so hard to network while in school, I feel like my degree is basically useless for all I did well in it. I'm still working a deadend job as barista and am just so tired of the same old same old that's become my life. I just wish some employer could give me the chance to prove to them I would be a strong worker. I had thought about going back to school for a master's, but I dont want to fall in the trap of needing validation from scholastic achievement. I want a career, not another degree, so if I went back I'd have to think about what I'd be studying long and hard in order to get that career."

What if I need to work 2 jobs? Can they really check if I do have two jobs? I don’t wanna risk it bc the way KPMG’s internship is setup it’s so unless I do something stupid I have a return offer at the end of the internship. Is it worth the risk to still work both

12jwsnn,21,2023-04-12,Is CMU SCS worth 150k debt for quant or should I graduate debt free from Georgia Tech,Unused_Username1,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/12jwsnn/is_cmu_scs_worth_150k_debt_for_quant_or_should_i/,"If I want to go into quant (which is already a hard field to enter), would it be worth it to go 150k in debt so that I can attend Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science (which has the classes, network, and resources to help me succeed in quant)? Or is it wiser to graduate debt free from Georgia Tech?

I'm a high school senior that is currently choosing between colleges. Carnegie Mellon and Georgia Tech are my two main options (I will be getting a degree in computer science). My parents say that they can cover the entire cost of a GT education, meaning I would leave college completely debt free. If I wanted a basic software engineering job, I would have already chosen GT, as I know GT grads go to  great places and the 83k per year that CMU costs is not really worth it just to work at a FAANG company. 

However, I am very interested in quant because I love mathematical modeling and want to do work that would challenge me rather than simply working as a software engineer. This is the only thing making me reconsider choosing GT over CMU. CMU has an extensive network for quant, not to mention phenomenal resources and classes that would definitely give me an edge. On the other hand, I have heard that GT is quite new to quant and does not have as good of a network or classes that would help me (e.g. GT's functional programming class is offered infrequently while CMU's is required for their curriculum). Additionally, I know finance can be somewhat prestige based. I'm worried that by choosing GT, I will lose everything CMU has to offer, including the name brand, and that my chances of going into quant will decrease significantly. 

BUT, CMU is just too expensive. They didn't give me any aid at all, meaning it is completely unaffordable and I would have to take up 150k+ in debt to even attend. CMU has very good return of investment; many current CMU CS students tell me I can probably pay off 150k within a few years of graduating, especially if I am able to land a quant internship in university. However, this is all still a huge risk. There is a possibility that I may not be able to break into quant or even get a FAANG tech internship (given the recession), meaning I would be in a horrible financial situation. On the other hand, going to GT may ruin my chances of entering quant. I was hoping you all would be able to offer some good advice as to which school I should go to."

*May 28th, 1967*

Dear Beth,

This is going to be a better opportunity than I had hoped. 

The other graduate students and I finally had our orientation today, which felt long overdue. After my acceptance of the internship, I felt all I was doing was filling out stack after stack of paperwork, signing clauses and agreements and undergoing identity checks. All deeply boring, as I’m sure you’re aware, but I understand the necessity. The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History has some of the rarest, most incredible artefacts and specimens in their collection, and I’m sure they don’t want some thief swooping in to sell it to wealthy buyers. Or some schlub to waltz in and break something. 

Anyway, today was amazing. Our orientation began with a tour. I have to say, walking into the rotunda and seeing the elephant, preserved as if in a pose of triumph, took my breath away. I felt like I was in Africa, standing before a living, moving animal. The rest of the museum remained just as stunning. Taxidermized big cats seemed to stalk museum-goers, landscapes painted by the best artists of our time lined the halls, and there were endless displays of precious gems, fossils, anthropological artefacts, and other treasures of scientific study. Truly, Beth, it was once-in-a-lifetime, and when you come to visit me here in Washington, I will make sure you can see it all, too. 

At the end of the tour, we were paired off with our mentors. Several students left with biologists and anthropologists, but I was left by myself until a disheveled-looking fellow came rushing in. He was a great deal younger than many of the other mentors, and seemed a bit frazzled, but I didn’t mind. Great minds tend to be a bit strange. 

“Arthur Reed?” He asked, and without waiting for my reply, he continued. “I’m Dr. Calvin Washburne. I’m the lead ornithologist here and I’ll be serving as your mentor for the next few months. Come with me.” 

Bemused, I followed him down a long, dark marble staircase into a back wing of the museum that was closed to the public. He walked at a brisk pace down a hallway crowded with crates and half-articulated skeletons. Finally, he used a key to open a set of steel doors, and with little fanfare, said “This is where we will be working for the next three months.”

It was huge. There were endless rows of creamy beige filing cabinets, tall enough to nearly brush the ceiling. The cabinets were arranged in a mazelike configuration, so close together that they formed rooms and passageways, so thickly packed I could not see where this space ended. I knew, logically, that the museum had much more room than what guests were permitted to view, but I was not prepared for the vast claustrophobia of the collection storage. 

“You’re going to help me catalogue the birds,” Dr. Washburne said. 

“The birds?”

“Look,” he said. Each filing cabinet had thin, long drawers, and Dr. Washburne took the opportunity to open one. Inside were a dozen beautiful, delicate, taxidermized birds-of-paradise. Each specie scarcely seen in their native jungle, let alone a museum on the other side of the world. They were lined up, posed straight, wings at their sides, feathers still so vibrantly green and orange and red that they looked to be merely asleep. 

Dr. Washburne gestured to the rest of the basement, “They’re all filled. With birds. The ornithology intern’s job is to help us make sure each specimen is accurately tagged and catalogued. Some of them haven’t even been formally discovered. Are you up for it, Mr. Reed?”

And Beth, I’ll tell you what I told him. I’ve never been more up for anything in my entire life.

With love,

Artie

*June 4th, 1967*

Dear Beth,

I hope you are well. I find myself thinking of you more and more these days, as the weather gets warmer and the days get sunnier. Each cheery day reminds me of your smile. Not to sound ingrateful, but I’ve been wishing that my internship allowed me the opportunity to go out into the field. It feels like a waste to be inside when the weather is so pleasant. It gets stuffy down there, in that place with dull cabinets and dull walls and dull carpets. I don’t even see Dr. Washburne, much, outside of inquiry on certain species. Someone else could be down here with us and I’d never know.

He likes me anyway, I think. Hopefully he’ll be a good reference when I apply to research institutes after the completion of my doctorate. It impressed him when I was able to correct a few mislabeled passerines. Dr. Washburne is not as interested in songbirds as I am, though- he considers himself to be more of a raptor man. 

Yesterday, we were busy sorting the wet specimens. These aren’t like the dry, taxidermy animals that are posed, like the kind whose head may hang in a hunter’s lodge. Wet specimens are kept in glass jars filled with a clearish liquid called formalin. Remember the kitten in your grandmother’s cabinet, the one that always frightened you? They’re like that. None of the ones here have cats inside, obviously. Most of them have small birds, or nestlings too delicate to skin for dry preservation. I found one that was strange, though. Inside the jar were a pair of talons, claws large enough to wrap around a skull. The label was too faded to be legible, so I brought it over to the doctor. 

“Where did these come from?” I asked him. “A dinosaur?”

He laughed, then replied, “Just about. These are the feet of *Harpia harpjya.* The harpy eagle. One of the largest species of birds on earth.

Are you familiar with the Taung child? Miners in Africa discovered a skull that archaeologists determined belonged to one of our distant ancestors. It was probably only around six years old when it died, and its face and eye sockets are crisscrossed with wounds that lay deep in the bone. Researchers believe it was a bird, an eagle, that killed it. Babies are quiet when they see something overhead, on instinct. Protection from ancient predators that would circle overhead looking for an easy meal. If they were silent, and still, maybe they would stay safe. Unfortunately for the Taung child that doesn't always work.” Dr. Washburne was quite animated as he relayed this to me.

It’s easy to imagine something like the talons of this eagle being more than capable of tearing someone apart. I was more than unsettled. The imagery stuck with me as I continued my sorting, parsing through musty wings and tiny bodies, lights buzzing dimly overhead. 

Once in a while, the specimens aren’t worth keeping. They get too moth-eaten, or rotted, or broken in some way. I found a little bird the other day that looked as if it had been soaked in brownish water. This was supposed to be a *dry* specimen, so I haven’t got a clue about how it happened. I just know that it smelled *rank.* I transported it to its final resting place (the trash can) with a twinge of sadness. It was just a white-throated sparrow, so no great loss for science, but it didn’t feel good throwing it away. It had once been alive, and man had captured it and killed it for its use in study. What a waste.  

Then I thought about the harpy eagle, and what Dr. Washburne had said about babies. I felt less guilty after that. Sure, the sparrow was no predator, but perhaps this was just a little karma. The clade of mammals versus the clade of birds.  No doubt as to who won the evolutionary arms race. 

Keep an eye out for Ronald and Alex- tell them I say hi if you see them. I haven’t got their address. 

With love,

Artie

*June 21st, 1967*

Dear Beth,

Unfortunately, I’ve yet to find a new species. I did find something nearly as exciting however, as I was working. A species that is now extinct.

Like the sparrow, it is a little sad, in ways. I recognized the rusty plumage before I even read the tag. *Ectopistes migratorius,* the passenger pigeon. There were two, side by side, dark wings drawn tight against the body. Billions used to migrate across North America every year, darkening the sky, and this is all that was left. I never thought I’d see one. I know, logically, that the museum taking these individuals specifically didn’t cause the extinction of the entire species, but it still brought me down a bit. Someone collected these birds just to bring them here to rest among uncounted others. Someone took them just to *take*. 

It may just be this place, though, bringing me down. There aren’t any windows, and I feel like the hours crawl by without any frame of reference other than opening more cabinets and entering deeper into the collection. Sometimes I close my eyes and all I see is that damned beige. 

The further into the basement my work takes me, the worse off the specimens seem to be. More of them are damaged, crushed, unsalvageable. Wet. 

“They’re just old,” Dr. Washburne said, when I brought it up. “Who knows what could’ve happened?”

Some of these birds are dripping wet when I pull them out of storage. The rest of the drawer is always fine, but the one ruined one will be practically melting in my hands with rot. And it’s not water. It’s something else. No matter how many I show him, the doctor doesn’t seem to care. 

The silence is playing tricks on me, too. Without any stimuli the brain works very hard to fill in the gaps. I hear rustling, where there isn’t any, or a drawer closing behind me when I know Dr. Washburne is giving a tour on the ground floor. I get jumpy, anticipating something happening. I don’t like thinking about who might be here with me when I’m supposed to be alone. 

I know, I’m being silly, but it just, gets under my skin. All of it together. Earlier today, I was working on a table next to Dr. Washburne while we were pinning some feather displays, and I heard something, loud. A flurry of beating wings a few rows behind us. 

“Did you hear that?” I asked.

“Hmm?” Dr. Washburne was barely paying attention, focusing instead on using a needle to stick a flight feather onto a framed corkboard.

“That sound, just now. There’s no way you missed it.”

Dr. Washburne flipped his glasses to the top of his head and pinched the bridge of his nose. “I didn’t hear anything,” he replied, not even turning to look at me as he spoke. 

“Guess I imagined it.”

“Guess so.”

I don’t want to push things. I need this if I ever want to work professionally as an ornithologist. I can’t imagine a more prestigious institution to work for. It’s just- the more I’m here, the more something feels wrong. These endless rows of perfect little mummies seem less like they’re at peace, and more like they’re holding their breath. Like they know something I don’t. 

It eats at me, Beth. 

With love, 

Artie

*July 16th, 1967*

Dear Beth,

There’s no-one else here and I can’t shake the feeling of eyes on me. I think Dr. Washburne knows something is going on, because whatever is happening is getting bolder and there is no way he can believe any of this is normal. 

When we arrived, yesterday morning, there were a set of wet footprints soaked into the carpet that smelled so strongly of rubbing alcohol my eyes began to water. Security came and looked around, much to the protest of the doctor, but didn’t find anything out of place. ‘Old pipes,’ was their explanation. Old pipes! 

I’m so tired of this terrible in-between space, but I’m cursed with a mind that wants answers. I can’t even bring myself to walk away because it would mean I would *never know* what’s happening here. 

Today the smell of alcohol remained, although the carpet was dry. Cabinets rattled, lights flickered, birdsong seemed to churn out from behind blind corners. No song that I could identify, mind you, just a tuneless, joyless cacophony that faded into the buzz of fluorescence the minute I paused to listen. I was anxious, yes, but more than that I was beginning to get angry. This was the opportunity that was supposed to make or break my career, and it’s being twisted into some ugly, frightening thing. 

It bothered me all day, actually. Dr. Washburne has been trusting me less and less on my own, so he was working near me when it happened. A drawer slammed shut on a filing cabinet in the next room over, hard enough I felt it with my legs. I didn’t even bother to say anything, this time. I just scowled at him. 

The man sighed, “Arthur, it’s an old building, there’s drafts. These things happen.”

Instead of bothering to acknowledge such a lazy explanation, I tore away from the specimens I was sorting and hurried to the source of the noise. My lungs felt like they were hitching and the closer I got the more hairs on my body prickled as if to raise an unconscious alarm. 

Broken glass littered the ground. Wet specimens and dry specimens were scattered everywhere, and several drawers hung open and empty. Some cabinets even had rake marks deep in the paint. My eyes burned; my mouth was slick with bile. Each breath I took was faster and deeper and then I heard someone very far away whistling a tune and-

A hand on my shoulder, centering me. Dr. Washburne was here, too. 

“Look,” I told him, “Look. Someone did this.”

Dr. Washburne drew close, and the man put a hand on my other shoulder. He was facing me, and his eyes were piercing and filled with something dark. “There’s nothing there. Just something leftover from our research. Hardly anything.” 

“But-“

“Arthur,” he said, emphasizing each syllable. “I didn’t hear anything. You didn’t hear anything. Do you understand? There. Is. Nothing. There.”

“I don’t-… don’t you want to find out?”

Dr. Washburne took a step back, eyes still searching mine. “Just clean it up,” he said, before returning to his work. 

The rest of the day was uncomfortable. Footsteps followed mine, as I walked the halls. A shuffle that I only caught because it was a half-second too late. 

When I turn I see nothing. There isn’t anywhere to hide so quickly. There isn’t a place for an unseen man to sit and mimic bird calls or throw my belongings on the ground the minute I step away. I miss you. 

I don’t understand how he can act like everything is fine. The jar that held the harpy eagle’s talons sits empty.  The eyes on me are not happy ones. I’m certain he feels them too.

See you soon,

Arthur

*August 29, 1967*

Beth,

I dreamt of it. The thing down here with me and Dr. Washburne. All flight and song and feather, a miasma of wings that pursued me in that unending basement. I ran, and it chased, falcons and doves, mothers and chicks, thousands and thousands of minds kept angry and dark and alone. 

Sometimes I feel like it barely tries to hide anymore. Squealing and singing and gibbering day in and day out. I catch glimpses of it, while I’m awake, a flash out of the corner of my eye, maybe the end of a tail or the hook of a claw. Maybe it wants me to see, to take each clue and put the impossible amalgamation together and create in my mind the very predator stalking me. It’s patient enough to wait long enough for me to figure it out. 

I think Dr. Washburne’s been sleeping here. He hasn’t changed clothes in a couple of days, and I keep arriving at the steel double doors to find him already awake and at work. I’m not even certain he’s even bothering to catalogue the specimens anymore. 

Sometimes he just stands with his eyes shut, swaying slightly, whispering to himself. Sometimes he’s weeping so hard tears spill from his face and puddle on the floor. Once, I caught him pushing pins through his finger, wiping the blood off on the silver handles of the cabinets. 

Dr. Washburne is afraid of it. Too afraid to look, to ask questions. Whatever it is, it wants us to be afraid. Well, I’ll ask questions, and then this thing will just be a skin out to dry with the rest of them.

Dear Beth,

It hates us. It hates us. Every one of us. It isn’t a person, or an animal. It’s not a thing at all, really. I was thinking about it all wrong. It doesn’t understand why we’ve put them here in this place, this mausoleum to dominion. I dreamt of it again and I dreamt the song into the museum and it let me see its face it just wanted to speak to me. it’s all of them together in agony.

I wept for them and they saw and they spoke to me and now I *know.* Today they told me it was time for Dr. Washburne to know how much it hurt when he pretended he couldn’t hear us crying. He didn’t want to look but it was his turn and his veins ran downy with feathers all up and down

all up and down our sweet wings. 

Now they stretch and shake off the dust and methylpentan and I gave myself to them and t hey took now i

Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:

500-700USD

Are you open to refurbs/used?

Preferably a used or refurbished device.

How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?

Build quality is important, not fully plastic but some metal would be preferred. No 2 in 1, never use the touch screen. Battery life is very important, coming from a MacBook Air m1, I understand that I won’t find battery life like that anywhere else but 9-11 hours of basic tasks and some multitasking is a must. CPU performance and overall performance should not be worse than the m1 MacBook I have previously owned.

How important is weight and thinness to you?

Important, will be carrying it around a lot of the time so it can’t be too bulky.

Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.

Around 14 inches. 13 inch seemed too low for me but 15.6 seemed a little too big. 14 or so inches seems like the sweet spot for me.

Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.

Maybe some light gaming but I have a PC for that.

Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?

Reliability and good/average build quality is preferred. Upgradeability is preferred as well

Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.

Need a laptop for internships and finishing up school. Definitely prefer a refurbished or used laptops as I can can get much better value for my money. Need something with acceptable battery life (9-11) hours and good performance that is on par or better than my old m1 MacBook. Used to own an HP omen with a ryzen chip and I was thoroughly impressed with the battery life so I think I would like an AMD chip. Been eyeing some thinkpad t14s gen 2 on eBay and those seem to fit my preferences. Definitely need y’all’s help as I am very indecisive and am prone to buyers regret so hopefully this was enough information for y’all to point me in the best direction. I appreciate it"

i know that i still have time but truth is, i want to finish earning my degrees (i also plan to major in philosophy) as soon as possible to save my parents money. 

i've also just had no real motivation or passion for any of my classes, and it's getting to the point where i've lost interest in the things i used to care about, whether that be academic subjects or hobbies. everything just feels like a task to complete, and even though i still put my full effort into trying to do well in all my classes and on all my assignments it just never pays off. 

finally, my self-esteem and sense of self-worth has tanked ever since coming here. to begin with i've never had any self-worth, but coming here just confirmed that maybe i was born to always fail in life. i hear about other freshmen who are taking many more credits, already have internships, doing research, triple even quintuple majoring, or could well earn their degree by next semester. here i am still struggling to complete a *prerequisite* for a *single* major. if that's not pathetic i don't know what is. in comparison to other first-years, i just feel like the biggest loser ever.

i'm sorry if it sounds like i'm fishing for pity, i just really need to let this all out. i don't really have any close friends here and never hang out with anyone, so i don't have anyone to tell this to in person. 

yeah so i'm torn over what to do at this point. whether i should just suck it up since the semester is almost over or what."

I have an interest in both the finance and tech industries but would preferably choose the finance sector if it set me up with the knowledge to hopefully start a business in the field. However as I am inexperienced I am unsure as to what I should be aiming for.

Any advice would be great"

It's an accelerated course of six weeks. 

Even if I don't take the summer class, I'm still on track to graduate in 4 years, so the only advantage would be that I will remove a class from my fall 2024 course load.

However, two things: 

1. I'm in my second year and it's much easier than the first year and apparently, it keeps being  more manageable in the third and fourth years (industrial engineering). 
2. I feel like I have no energy left to give as I was close to burnout recently and now taking antidepressants so I can regain some mental energy. I was actually looking forward to not having to think of school this summer and just relax outside of work. 

Should I keep pushing myself this summer or let myself breath and focus on my internship?

I’m still in my mid 20s and I’ve been working for this organization right out of college, so I’ve been finding my way. In the past year, I’ve really expressed a lot of interest in scripting. I’ve created some scripts for the team as a learning exercise, I’ve built a Slackbot for various tasks, and I’ve spent a good amount of time quick learning Python to create these. My manager, however, hasn’t liked all the time I’ve spent (because work/life balance, not because of pay since I’m salaried) even though I’ve expressed I’m fine with it. I think she just knows I was trying to grow my skills and maybe leave, since they don’t have a developer or engineer on the team or a budget for one. It’s become very clear that they’re not keen on adding anything to my job description, my title, or increasing my pay, but they seem open to more scripts otherwise (or so they say).

Im not really sure what to do. I understand I shouldn’t give this away for free, but I also see it as a good opportunity to build my skills so I can leave. Should I instead seek out an internship part time where I can grow my skills and get real guidance? Am I in over my head considering where the tech markets at? Should I play a long game and work my skills up on my own? I’m just not sure where to even start but I feel that staying here would be major stagnation, more so than it has already been. I’m eager to learn and grow and I just don’t see that here. Any advice would be helpful, thanks!"

There wasn’t a single other student in my class that didn’t also have an alarming experience. I worked in an adjacent field for over a decade before returning to school, so I'm no stranger to a tough work environment, but what I faced was something else entirely.

My internship was at a small group practice in South Carolina. The supervisor and owner, “Mark”, has over 15 associate-level licensees, a ridiculously low retention rate, and an endless supply of interns. At first, I was concerned based on the sessions of his I shadowed in. He is highly, highly confrontational with his clients but I chose to be flexible and learn with an open mind--after all, not every therapist is for everyone. It quickly became apparent that he was crossing ethical boundaries—he would even disparage his clients to us after their sessions and say things that were downright offensive. There were dual relationships and confidentiality issues too. 

To make matters worse, we interns were a group of young women and were all terrified of him. He frequently spoke over us, belittled us, made misogynistic remarks, and make us feel uncomfortable on so many occasions. My intuition was screaming at me to run any time I was around him. 

We felt powerless and held hostage; if we were to say anything, he could effectively financially ruin us by firing us and forcing us to re-do an entire internship experience.  I discussed my concerns with my university supervisors, but short of having me quit and start all over again, their hands were tied. We just had to endure it. 

Last Monday, I had a final supervision session with Mark, where he scolded me for choosing to not stay with the practice for employment after graduation. I left in tears. To be fair, none of us had explicitly told him we wouldn't be staying out of fear of retaliation, but we also never received any employment paperwork or an offer. He simply assumed we would, and we were too terrified to advocate for ourselves.

Knowing I’m only a drop in the bucket of exploited, abused interns raises important questions about the management of internships in our field. This is not how it has to be and frankly, the structure of internships taking place outside the university invites abusive, exploitative practice owners to take advantage of students with little power. I know not all supervisors are like this and have heard of amazing internship experiences, but they seem to be far fewer than ones like my own. At this point, I’m considering hiring my own clinical supervisor and opening a private practice just to avoid working with an owner like him again. 

I want to be excited about my future, but I am only terrified."
12k57x1,180,2023-04-12,Finished my 10th class. My trip through oMSCS,herpblerpsmerp,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/12k57x1/finished_my_10th_class_my_trip_through_omscs/,"I finished turning everything in and I'm guaranteed a passing grade, so instead of waiting until the final grades are out, thought I'd conclude with a post now.


**Background & Motivations:**

I graduated in 2004 with a bachelor degree (majors: computer science, philosophy, minor: mathematics) but spent most of the following decade pursuing a different career (audio engineer).  The 2008 economic downturn killed my business and I took the first job that I could (aviation).  I pursued that for a while until I hit a glass ceiling.  I then decided maybe it was best to dust off that BA degree and use it.  I found that I couldn't get an entry-level job without prior experience and I couldn't get an internship without being enrolled in a program.  OMSCS filled the need due to cost and accessibility.  Side note: I got a job about a year into OMSCS (OMSCS had no bearing on that) but I decided to continue due to why not.

**Fall 2017 - Graduate Intro to OS (A), Machine Learning for Trading (W)** 

I didn't know what specialization I wanted to do, so I thought I'd take one class from each and then decide what interested me the most.  The majority of ML and AI classes just didn't exist when I did my undergrad.  I signed up for GIOS and ML4T since this sub said they were both good first classes.

Two classes was too much.  I dropped ML4T since I was further along in GIOS.  I had no C experience, so it was somewhat time-consuming.  This class was far more rigorous than the OS class I took in undergrad.

**Spring 2018 - Artificial Intelligence (B)**

AI was the hardest class I took in OMSCS.  I enjoyed it and once again, far more rigorous than the AI class I took in undergrad.  If I was a different person in my early 20s, maybe I would have pursued going to a school like GT.  This class was like another full-time job, but fortunately, I made it through.

**Fall 2018 - Machine Learning for Trading (A)**

I enjoyed this class but found it to be incredibly easy after AI.  There was quite a bit of overlap in terms of content.  I also decided that I'll just stick with index funds as far as investing goes for now.

**Spring 2019 - Data Visualization & Analytics (A)**

I enjoyed the visual part of it.  I really disliked how they tried to cram as much tech in as possible.  Like doing a ""hello world"" app for each assignment.  I would have preferred that they stuck to 1 stack and focused on the application of those concepts instead.  Our group project was OK.... the class combined both OMSA and OMSCS sections and my OMSA teammates didn't know how to code.  I ended up doing DevOps and infrastructure since I knew how to do that from the day job and they only knew how to do modeling with scikit-learn.  In hindsight, should have just been adamant about working on the things I wanted to learn but c'iest la vie.

**Fall 2019 - Machine Learning (W)**

After ML4T, I had planned on specializing in ML.  Unfortunately, I had some health issues this semester (ended up in the ER).  I'm totally fine, but dropped to focus on health.  Moral of the story: life happens, it is ok to take the W.

**Spring 2020 - Intro to Analytics Modeling (W)**

I signed up for IAM since I thought it would be an easy way to become familiar with ML concepts before tackling that again.  I really hated R.  The TAs were not helpful either.  At this point in my FT career, I'm 100% remote, I can work from anywhere in the world.  I was taking time off from work to study (I'm hourly, so lost $$$).  I was unsure if I wanted to continue with OMSCS or drop out.  There were just other things in life that I was interested in and I wasn't sure if trying to pursue another career (in ML) was something I really wanted to devote all that time to.

**Fall 2020 - Software Architecture & Design (A)**

Covid happened.  At the time, I lived about 2 miles from where George Floyd was murdered.  I feel like I experienced a lot of history in a short time.  I have a tough time with sunk cost (even if only 4 classes), but I figured I could at least get an elective out of the way and put off the decision of whether to drop out of OMSCS or not for a while longer.

I took SAD since I figured I could brush up and solidify some dev knowledge.  This class is an easy A, but far too much UML, and the lectures are like watching paint dry.  If I can learn all of the design stuff from a book, not much point in taking the class.  The class is so easy that I was able to complete it while having an active covid infection and dealing with long covid symptoms (shortness of breath, chest pain, brain fog, etc).

**Spring 2021 - Software Development Process (B)**

I decided to switch to Interactive Intelligence since then I could skip GA and still finish the program.  I was still suffering from long covid, the brain fog was brutal.  I wouldn't take this class, even if you have no development experience.  You'll learn all of those topics during the first few months on the job.  The professor was active in the forums but had the expectation that you read every thread (back when it was piazza).  All in all, not a class I would recommend.

**Fall 2021 - AI Ethics & Society (A)**

Not a lot in terms of II electives... I have no interest in IHI and EdTech would be fun if I had a project in mind, but didn't.  It is interesting to think about bias, but this class was largely forgettable.  I had all the work done around mid-October.

**Spring 2022 - Game AI (A)**

This was one of my favorite classes in the program and the only class where I feel I got the bang for my buck in terms of projects.  I was a gamer when I was young and still play from time to time when I'm free (rare these days).  I very much enjoyed the Prison Dodgeball and Self Driving Truck assignments.  This class covered similar topics in AI, but something about having visual results made those concepts click like they haven't before.  I appreciate Professor Wilson but the lectures really need someone with video editing skills to edit them in order to make them watchable.

**Summer 2022 - Digital Marketing (W)**

I signed up thinking that I would keep my momentum going in order to finish in the fall. Life got busy and I found myself not enjoying the class at all.  I was just kind of done with taking classes to check off a requirement when I had no real interest in them.  So I dropped.

**Fall 2022 - Video Game Design (A)**

Similar to Game AI, I enjoyed this class.  Largely it was due to my teammates.  Many had unity experience and had worked on indie games before.  I don't know if I can say this is a good class since the lectures need a lot of help and everything I learned was from working on the group project.  If my group was poor, I'm sure I'd have a different opinion.

 **Spring 2023 - Knowledge-Based AI (A)**

The semester isn't done, but I've turned everything in and I should have a B regardless of what grades I get on the remaining items.  I debated between this and ML.  ML has more interest but would be a bit of a slog.  KBAI has all of the previous assignments online.  I had quite a bit of life stuff this spring and wanted to get a jump on all of the work.  I started in December and had a good start by the time the semester actually began.  I've posted my thoughts previously regarding this class. I know some people absolutely love this class.... it just wasn't my cup of tea.  I wish there was more in terms of connecting the lectures to the projects and to tech in the real world.

**Final thoughts**

Was it worth it? Who knows.  I've learned a lot and I know I've gained numerous skills along the way.  I'll probably never work in AI or ML.  I'm in my early 40s and I just don't have it in me to chase another career when the job I have now has the best work/life balance I've ever experienced.  Maybe that fancy degree will come in handy if I ever need to find another employer.

My recommendation to GT.... invest in video content.  I've found it to be rather lacking, as far as production goes.  There is a lot that goes into learning by video in terms of visuals that just isn't happening here.  Personally, I only learn by doing.  Any topics that do not tie to some kind of coursework are almost immediately forgotten once the test is over.

There also needs to be some kind of reconciliation in terms of credit hours and course difficulty.  It just doesn't make sense that some classes are like a full-time job and you have classes like DM, SAD, AIES that are a breeze; all of these classes are 3 credits.  I don't think classes need to be artificially hard, but the ""drinking from a firehose"" that I've encountered leaves much to be desired.  Imagine if you go on a trip to Italy and try to see the entire country in a week.  It'll be a whirlwind.  While you might enjoy some things, you'll gloss over everything and may not learn or remember that much.  I think there has to be a better way in terms of pedagogy that would enable better outcomes instead of trying to cram everything in.

**Lastly**

I have nothing but thanks for Dr. Isbell, Dr. Joyner, et al for OMSCS.  I think it is incredible what they have done in terms of making education accessible for nearly all.

Best of luck to all of you, regardless of where you are on your journey.

EDIT:

Thanks everyone.

I’ve been feeling extremely lost on what I actually want to do with my degree, I picked mechanical engineering just to pick it without knowing what they even do if I’m being honest. I’ve learned to take interest in it but compared to other students I tend to lack knowledge in it. I do pretty well in my courses I currently have a 3.5+ gpa in my engineering courses, 3.1+ gpa cumulative (lower because I didn’t take general Ed courses seriously). I also have my CSWA for solidworks and plan on getting my CSWP this summer. I feel like I haven’t really learned anything besides knowing how to solve problems. Is it normal to feel this way? Like how can I apply what I learn in my courses to real life? Is it something they teach you later on? Idk I just feel extremely overwhelmed and lost in what I wanna do with my future. Im currently sitting in a parking lot writing this because I just left a career fair and as I was talking to a recruiter (aerospace industry btw) I realized I didn’t know anything. I graduate this December and I have no clue what to do with my life with this degree. I’ve applied to internships for basically any position that looks for mechanical engineers (no luck yet, any tips welcomed). I just feel lost and overwhelmed and unsure what to do."

The work lays somewhere within the data engineering sphere.  I'm told I am going to be building out data pipelines to automate the collection of experimental data.  It will involve a lot of SQL and Python work, as well as some data visualization tools.

After meeting a lot of people and starting to dig into the work, I am getting somewhat anxious.  The underlying data is generated by chemists, biologists, and biochemists.  My academic background is in computer science and data science.  This is also my first professional experience (I am finishing up a masters in data science currently.)

So, I am a bit overwhelmed right now and I feel like a fish out of water dealing with data of which I have no understanding of the underlying meaning.  It is a lot of chromatographic data dealing with human proteins.  I just have no academic background for it.

Has anyone been in a situation like this?  When working in a new data domain, how long does it take to become productive?  The internship was designed for a data science student, and that was my background.  I'm not sure how the senior employees will react when I have to ask the most basic fundamental questions about the science."
12k969z,1,2023-04-12,How to function after something humiliating happens,Chubby_Kitty29,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/12k969z/how_to_function_after_something_humiliating/,"So a bit of a backstory:

I applied for this summer research internship at my school and when I attended the informational meeting a few months ago we were told that a decision letter would be sent to us by mail (like a physical letter) on the first week of April (which was spring break for me). I waited the entire week and received nothing in the mail. 

It wasn’t until I went to my professor’s office yesterday (I’ll call her professor A) to ask about an assignment that she told me that an email had been sent over spring break with a hyperlink to accept the offer. She also said that I was selected to work on a collaboration project between her and another professor (professor B). Unfortunately I have taken a couple of classes with professor B and she can be kind of scary sometimes, almost bipolar. A lot of other students say this about her too. I was given until 4/12 to make my decision. 

Due to my past experience with professor B, I was planning on declining my offer today anyway because I feel like I would be walking on eggshells around her for the entire internship. In my ornithology class this morning, professor B stormed into my class and basically snapped at me in front of everyone for not checking my email. Rather then explaining my confusion with how I receive my letter, my anxiety got the best of me and I said something else like “I just forgot to check my email over spring break”. She finished by telling me to check my email, apologized to my ornithology professor, then stormed out. 

The whole situation left me unable to finish working, so I left class early in tears and went straight to professor A’s office (I was gonna go see her after class anyway). I declined my offer and explained the whole situation to her. She completely understood my situation, and due to her being one of the program directors, she would try her best to find another group to put me in. 

I guess all this is to say that whenever embarrassing situations like that happen, I tend to shut down. Sometimes I try to mask my feelings then I feel worse later. I fully understand that I should’ve checked my email during spring break, but I was just confused as to how we would receive our acceptance letters. Is there a better way to handle situations like these?"

I’m super passionate about Quantitative Finance and would like to pursue a career in this field. I have a couple of options in front of me but I’m rather confused about what to do ab my future.

First, I’ll graduate in about 2 years instead of 4 because of my credit load so I was thinking getting the degree in CS then going for masters in that field. The problem is the masters programs all require or prefer some type of experience in the industry and I’ve had 0 luck getting an internship at a financial institution. Granted I’m only a freshman that makes sense but I’m still scared to pursue this path.

Another option is to graduate in 3 years with a double major in CS and Quantitive Finance or CFRM. This would work better as it would give me more time to land internships in the industry. If I do do this, though, I won’t be too keen to get a masters.

So - you know my situation and you know my options. My goal is to eventually land a quant job and further my career in this industry. Any advice would be appreciated."

Hello everyone, I had a hard time deciding between Cornell Tech MEng ECE and Northwestern MS EE. Which one is more suitable for me? Welcome to share your point of view!

Here’s my brief background: 
1. I am a domestic student but study all my education in a non-English country
2. Wanna be a Computer Vision Engineer or a Deep Learning Engineer in the US after graduation 
3. Have no internship experience in the US.
4. Do not have the plan to pursue a Ph.D. rn


Northwestern MSEE

Pros:
1. The course flexibility is great
2. Research opportunities with different area Profs 
3. Small class, the environment is good for studying 
4. Have more time to get into life in the US and find a summer internship 
5. 2-year program but only need 4 quarters to graduate if I study harder

Cons:
1. Not sure if is it hard to find an Internship in Chicago
2. May have storms and get super cold in winter
3. Affordable but still quite expensive and I am not sure if there is any chance to earn some money on campus
4. Engineering ranking lower


Cornell Tech

Pros: 
1. Can have more connections with the NYC industry in studio courses
2. Small size and can have more resources 
3. Courses are more work-oriented and applicable and may be helpful for work (but have to improve technical skills by myself)
4. Also offer some management and communication courses
5. Ivy League

Cons: 
1. This program is only for 1 year and has no extensions for the timeline so the courses gonna be super challenging 
2. Have no much time to find an internship 
3. Not sure about the quality of the course (cuz this campus is pretty new and not stable) 
4. Not many people know about Cornell Tech Campus (Do not have many alumni to ask about this program)
5. Also expensive too lol

12klbqi,8,2023-04-13,Worth rejecting a T20 offer I've already accepted for a T4 offer?,Cockadoodleydoo,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/12klbqi/worth_rejecting_a_t20_offer_ive_already_accepted/,"I accepted an offer from a T20 school for a PhD in CS over a month ago.  Just yesterday I unexpectedly received an offer for a PhD from a T4 uni (one of MIT, CMU, Stanford, Berkeley).  This was very unexpected as I'd previously been told that, while the PI liked me, they didn't have any funding for me.


It would seem obvious to now reject my previous offer and accept this new one, however there are some mitigating factors.

* The two labs are very close geographically, in terms of research and on a personal level (the two PIs went to grad school together).  Whichever lab I go to I will see a lot of the other lab as they often meet up.
* The T20 PI is a much bigger name and has strong industrial connections.  I'm worried about annoying him and blacklisting myself from the companies he's associated with, which are the ones I'd likely want to work at post PhD.  This might sound stupid but it's a fairly niche research field and he has a lot of sway in it.
* I did a 1 year research internship at the T20 lab and the PI was my supervisor for the majority of it, so I know him and the rest of the lab personally, which would make reneging on my acceptance quite awkward.  I've also attended a couple of in-person lab socials since I accepted my offer, where it was celebrated that I'd be joining as a new PhD student.
* I know that if I renege on my acceptance, it will be too late for the T20 PI to fill my space as I've had personal conversations with them about this.
* I do actually slightly prefer the T20 lab (the PI's style of mentorship, the quality of the other PhD students, the industrial connections...).  I would essentially be switching for the prestige of getting my PhD from a T4 lab.  This sounds shallow but everyone I've spoken to says that it will be a huge bonus for post doctoral career.  I should mention I got my undergrad in CS from a (different) T4 university.

Wat do?  I realise I will be fine going to either but I don't want to feel like I was too scared to pick the right choice.  In particular, I'm quite non-confrontational and am worried that I'm going to pick the T20 just to avoid the awkwardness rather than because I actually think it's better.  I'm leaning towards honoring my decision and going to the T20.

Would massively appreciate some impartial views on this."

Hey guys, I'm at the final year of my bcom (SRCC) and I've gotten admission offer at XLRI - J's BM program. I also have been placed at a MBB's back end research analyst sort of role. I am confused whether should I go for the work exp or go ahead with the MBA right away.  


There's a few reasons why I would prefer work exp:  
1. Better profile for me when I sit for summer internships at MBA (if after work exp).  
2. More time to explore my interests (+ the learning at work) to make a solid decision for my masters, which I won't regret later on.  
3. I believe IIM A/B/C should be my goal in order to move to front end MBB.  


Apart from those points, after minoring in economics and self-studying introductory econometrics, I have realised that I have liked economics and statistics more than any other subject in my undergrad, and I kinda developed this wish to do a master's in economics (DSE, ISI or abroad) - since I can study economics more formally and comprehensively, and also possibly transition to economist/data analyst/data science job roles (or even go for PhD after masters). But then again, if someone thinks purely from placement stats point of view, MBA from T1 schools always wins.  


I know my thoughts are all over the place here, but I wanted to get some opinions on what I should do (or how do I make the decision such that I won't regret it later) in this case. Thanks for your time!"

I find biology absolutely fascinating and have been exploring various genres from molecular to ecology. — this is what i added to emphasize my interest

[prior experience if any] I have some prior experience with labwork participating in a job shadow with a postdoctoral scientist at the University of Sheffield studying embryonic chick development and immunohybridization. I was also a part of the Rutgers Student Scholar Program in high school studying bioremediation of Landoltia Punctata, and published protein sequences on NCBI. 

[current works if any] Currently, I am working on a research project in my class studying how methylation varies in plants that undergo various kinds of stress. And, in the spring I will be working with [professor] in researching bacterial genetics and bacterial conjugation. 
 
 
[a mini ‘why us’] Your work in inflammatory mediators fascinates me and I'd love to be able to study under you during the summer. I’m leaning toward developmental biology and your research in immunomodulatory roles of platelets would definitely help me narrow down my interests. 

[conclusion: give them a reason to reach back out] As an undergraduate, this kind of experience is incredibly valuable to my learning experience. Please let me know if you’re available to meet via Zoom I’d love to be able to speak with you!"

To help with the budget shortfall, my supervisor has been exploring ways to cut costs, especially with regard to my part-time internship. I’m just about done with grad school, just about done with my internship contract, and I just need things stable until I finish school, SO THAT I CAN FINISH SCHOOL.

This week my supervisor proposed pausing my work and my pay for two months to help with the budget shortfall. I freak out, given that this is my only source of income right now and this is very sudden and awful timing. I’m in the thick of finishing my thesis and need to focus, I have no money, etc.

So… I have expended a lot of time and emotional labor explaining, to an adult, why I can’t just… not have income for two months. Cue surprised Pikachu face on the part of my supervisor.

They “did not realize it would put me in a tough position.”

At least they’re reconsidering?"

I made a post a few weeks ago about my current situation.  To summarize I'm in my late 20s, I just graduated with a CS degree in December amidst this terrible market.  I'm a returning student and most of my degree was spend trying to pass the classes required rather than focusing on projects.  I feel like I can pick up a language fairly well but I'm weak with project creation. I'm working on a few things now and have mentorship, it's just a little overwhelming at the moment. 

My dad will be retiring at the end of the year and my mom will have major back surgery in June. I have a medical condition and I'm still on my dad's insurance. Given this situation I can't stay unemployed for long and figured I need to find a temp IT job for 6 or so months while brushing up on my skills. I'm just worried that I'm screwing up my career prospects if I do this, and I probably sound pretty selfish. 

I have one solid project on my resume that I was the lead developer and manager for and I'm working on another currently. I'm just focusing on learning the MERN stack atm. Once I have 3 good projects I'll make the portfolio site. My plan is to complete 3 mern projects that are fairly complex by then end of the year and transition into my first dev role. I'm afraid that my focus on just passes classes might of hurt my chances of ever getting a dev job, I didn't get an internship. 

Thanks!"

I recently got laid off from my EE job after a year (mostly hardware focused, but did some python scripting, data analysis, debugging, used git). It was my first job after graduating with a BSEE, I wanted to career change to software engineering, so 6 months into the job, I started an online masters program (UIUC MCS) and my company was paying for it. I kind of regret doing the online masters now, as I feel I could have just gotten a software job from self study and leetcode grind. I tried applying to internships, but most places seem to want an undergrad student only, or I get an OA and get ghosted even after doing well on it.

The fastest I can graduate is by spring 2024, so I'm kind of stuck doing this online program, as I can't get an internship and can't get a full-time software engineering job because of my student status. So, will I look bad to employers for doing this online program full-time after getting laid off? Is it worth applying to full-time places while still in this program?"

Specifically which school would offer the most opportunities for internships as well as reliable placement in the industry? I should also note that I'm located on the west coast and am open to working in any city for investment banking, not just NYC.  I would greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations you may have on this topic.   


My thoughts  
\- Penn State has the highest placement according to WSO and Linked In.  
\- UIUC seems to be more respected and considered more rigorous.  
\- UWash Seattle is the best-ranked of the three, especially in terms of the global ranking.,  


I am an econ major, hoping to minor in either in CS or Finance."

&#x200B;

Career goal:

The short-term goal:  SDE/quant > security > Ph.D. (AI/Crypto).

N years later I might want to start a business (not necessarily stay in the US/tech)

Background:

CS major, kind of good at Leetcode, have multiple internships and a paper(local conference)

Considering factors:

Career development >> Reputation (after all, it is most likely a terminal degree) > Living quality > Cost 

&#x200B;

Other Options:

Purdue MSCS in Cybersecurity (admitted)

Columbia MSCS (admitted)

UT MSECE (SES/DICE Track) (no result yet)

&#x200B;

MSCS@GT

Pros:

1. MSCS title

2. Seems to be the most selective of all options (\~300 intakes per year)

3. More freedom in course selection

4. Cost efficient (4 semesters 71k, 0 if have TA/RA-ship), friendly for transferring to PhD

Cons:

1. Missing out CMU, GT may be less known outside US or Tech, can be a little bit less conducive to entrepreneurship

2. CS won't always be the best major

3. RA-ship can be hard to find

4. Atlanta living quality (security, humid easy to allergic, mosquitoes)

&#x200B;

MSECE@CMU

Pros:

1. It's CMU

2. Pitts > Atlanta IMO

Cons:

1. Tuition is expensive (3 semesters 78k)

2. I have a planned course schedule I am satisfied with, but not flexible if I want to change

3. ECE title, may be harder to get a job or considered less selective than GT CS (450 intakes per year)

Hey Terps - I’m currently a senior who got accepted into Letters & Sciences for com sci for Spring 2023 (and I suppose Freshmen Connection during fall 2023). Ultimately, I think I’m gonna attend this school for computer science, but I’m probably gonna have to defer until 2024 because I am planning on enlisting in the USMC reserves (not ROTC), meaning I’d have to delay attending college for about a year in order to get all of the training out of the way. I was just wondering if there’s any reservists out there who are currently at or had gone to UMD - if so, what are your experiences? Can y’all tell me anything about anything when it comes to what life was like for you guys like dealing with drill, balancing your military and college life, getting internships and jobs, etc? I suppose the best answer I could get for someone in my situation is from a reservist Marine who is also studying computer science, but I more than welcome anybody regardless of service, branch, age, field, etc to talk. I’m glad to answer any questions you guys might have for me - thanks for reading!"

Now I’ve entered as a freshman with a mindset that I wouldn’t focus too much on my major rather just be in the average range of marks and concentrate more with my self study’s, projects, internships involving DS.



However it didn’t go so well as in the first semester I began feeling some sort of an imposter syndrome seeing everyone so focused on their own major and spending an absurd amount of time studying for it, so it sort of disrupted and shifted my mindset to “No what am I doing, I must focus on university I can’t be an underachiever in my own major infront of my peers and professors” and thus I nearly completely abandoned anything involving DS, AI, ML and focused entirely on my courses although I still had them in mind as the field I’m going to end up in. It’s my 3rd and I have no internships, projects, useful knowledge under my belt involving data science whatsoever, all I’ve got are overly-high marks in courses that I don’t want anything to do with.

I have pretty extensive PC and Windows knowledge, I have used a computer every single day since I could reach the mouse. More recently I started reading Mike Myers most recent edition of his A+ exam guide and finished reading that two weeks ago. I've since been re-reading the chapters I felt were my weakest points, such as the specific port numbers for TCP, UDP (I think 22&25?!) and some CLI commands. Everything else in the book seemed very... basic. And not very deep. I was honestly expecting more depth from the exam due to the size of the book. 

Any help I can get with this interview will be greatly appreciated as I have never had a job in IT before, and my only other interview was at the restaurant I have worked at for seven years now, which was a super casual interview to say the least.

I talked about my experience with cancer and the highlighted the treatment and affects on my family. I made sure to push the reality that I could have died and how that motivated me to get therapy dogs within my district. Every person who read was said it was pure perfection. I knew this essay would get me into any college >! (and it kind of did) !<

**Supplemental**

UMICH: I focused a lot on the faculty within the department I wanted to get into. Faculty is one of the most unique aspect a university can have and often university like to show off the professor they do have. Bc I am an URM I specially talked about URM professor I wanted to meet do to my interest within tech and gaining their experience on how to handle barriers.  

UIUC: They were so short. And for what limited word space I did have I talked about how competing at a local hackathon inspired me to be interested within UX and UI. 

UW Seattle: This was a cultural essay and honestly, It was just as good as my common app. It had the right amount of setback but made sure to make it about what I don’t to overcome them. Really proud of this one and re-used it a lot in other applications.

**Reflection:**

CANCER FOR THE WIN BABY

In all serious, I could have applied to more school and shotgunned into more top school. However with most OOS wanting 50k additional compared to my instate school (which is still amazing school) It made no sense. I think applying to only 6 colleges helped me focus much more on the supplemental and actually research what the university offered. Im really happy how my admission turned out and how lucky I got with my dream school! I would have loved to attend UMICH it was another dream school of mine but going into debt was not a goal of mine."
12lcsio,2,2023-04-13,help choosing an offer,r0ck3tst4r,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/12lcsio/help_choosing_an_offer/,"Hello! I've been fortunate enough to receive two internship offers (both swe) and I'm having some trouble deciding which to go with. I would appreciate any feedback on my situation, thank you!!

cyber security startup
- around $9500/month + $10k lump sum for housing/relocation
- bay area
- pros: supportive people & FT return offers are top priority (from what i've heard so far), work seems more exciting
- cons: must find housing on my own, fear of company being less stable?

software company
- around $8k/month
- bay area
- offers corporate housing + transportation from current city to job location
- pros: well-known company, no housing stress, more stable/established? (it is around 40 years old), possible scholarship award at end of program ($10k)
- cons: lower comp, might not receive scholarship payout (I think it's performance-based but not sure)

I sort of want to get experience working for a startup as I haven't been in that environment before but my main concern is picking a stable company where my offer (likely) won't be rescinded and where I can work as a FT new grad next year (this is my last internship before graduation)."

Hypothetically, if I'm lucky enough to get a return offer, I'd like to interview for a SWE position. Does anyone have any experience or know what the internal transfer process is like at Microsoft?

So, after getting so many rejection I got a job as B2B sales company. I did door to door business sales for Veriozn.That was the only job that I could get so I could keep my visa. I met my husband there and I got married. Yesterday, I received my green card. I would love to get a job in finance. My dream was working for an investment baking and I would like to try to apply for investment banking internships.
Im trying to build a resume now but I’m afraid that door to door sales for Verizon would not be appealing and would not get picked by the HR especially for a job in investment banking. 
What do you guys think? Any advice?"

12lfqbd,3,2023-04-13,[MA] Need help requesting more assistance.,ARealPotatoWhisper,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/12lfqbd/ma_need_help_requesting_more_assistance/,"Dear AskHR,

I left my previous job seeking a better work life balance. The industry I work in is very deadline oriented, and there are penalties for not meeting these deadlines.

The position I applied for had been empty for several months, so when I started, I came in with the understanding that they had a backlog of work that needed to be completed. I didn’t mind the initial amounts of overtime required to complete these deadline oriented tasks. However, I hoped that after I got through the backlog, I would have time to get ahead of all these tasks. Most importantly, achieve some work-life balance.

After these past couple years, it did not improve for many reasons. (1) One of my colleagues left so I ended up having to fill for 2 roles essentially. (2) I feel that my work is not prioritized and is left pending for many months in review. (3) I’m given tasks that are not aligned with my job description without the option to decline or reassign.

Prior to my arrival, there were two dedicated individuals doing my current work. They had the capacity to take up other non-related projects. However, I have now inherited those projects.

They promise to get me help in the form of an intern or cross-training another employee. However, my work is so specific that it would take (and has taken) me significant amounts of time to train someone on something that they would rarely touch again. They’d really only be helping me when I’m too busy… which varies from busy to VERY busy.

I wish I had more support. I feel like I’m sinking into quicksand. I’ve started experiencing the various symptoms that stress typically has on me: headaches, nightmares, cycle changes, and more. No migraines… yet.

My supervisor/upper-management isn’t helping with the work and acts as a severe bottleneck in the workflow. Almost all my work is completed months in advance and is sitting, pending review. They are not knowledgeable in my type of work, so they point out inconsequential things and ask (what I consider to be) silly questions. Nothing of actual weight changes in the final product other than cosmetic changes. I have to write essays explaining why things are a certain way, teaching them how to review my work. To the point that I wish I could just stamp my own review so I can move it along.

Everyone seems to recognize that I'm overworked, but they keep giving me small menial tasks that other staff (or they themselves) can complete. I’m not sure if it’s a power play, but they could have completed the task in the amount of time it took to assign/explain/email the task to me. On the other hand, they keep telling me they have a lot of staff “available” to help me, yet they still keep giving me everything.

How can I convince my upper management to stop giving me tasks unrelated to my expertise? How can I convince them to hire another person as experienced as me to help with all these tasks? There used to be two dedicated individuals doing my work, but now it’s just me.

Best,

ARealPotatoWhisper"
12lfto2,0,2023-04-13,"Wrongful termination, breach of implied contract, age discrimination",DisastrousClerk8082,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/12lfto2/wrongful_termination_breach_of_implied_contract/,"I was offered an internship position through my college and applied for a position with the county IT department. I was blown away it is what I have been working towards for a long time. It took them 4 months from application to hire, and I felt like my chances were good so I waited to find work and blew through my savings. Finally got the job and attended orientation last week and me and the other 2 new hires (also interns) were told when we asked about the duration of the employment that there are 1000 hours available. Awesome I thought. I worked the first week, showed up early and stayed late. Did everything that was asked of me and even helped to deobfuscate some malware they found on their network and reveal it's source code which is something they were unable to do. I demonstrated everything one would want in an entry level employee, especially an intern. 

I worked this Monday and shadowed a different person, as the guy I had been following before went on vacation. He was my superior for the day and he asked me how old I am. I didn't think much about the snicker on his face, because I am 38 years old.  I got a call on Tuesday the following day (it was agreed that I had that day off to attend class) to let me know that my services were no longer needed. I just can't shake the nagging feeling that I was fired because of my age. I am devastated both emotionally and financially. There surely seems to be at least a breach of implied contract when the manager from the hiring committee told us there were X hours in the budget and that we could reapply after those were over. 

Am way out in left field here?"
12lg6t3,54,2023-04-13,My Asian parents get mad if I'm not studying all the time,tonobodysdelight,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/12lg6t3/my_asian_parents_get_mad_if_im_not_studying_all/,"So background (not to brag). I have a 3.8 GPA and I'm in my junior year of college studying CS. I do research, am a teaching assistant, and am going to intern at a well known tech company that my mom has always wanted me to work for. I think I am doing pretty well, but this is not close to enough for my parents. They want me to get a MS in CS, a MBA and also potentially a phd! I do not want to do that. This semester, I've been having a slightly harder time with classes but I should be fine. I commute to college but from next semester I will be living on campus because my parents have gotten to be too much. 

My parents always are extremely intense about my grades, always yell at me if I am taking a break. I've been going to a therapist at my school because of what they've been saying to me. My mom accuses me of abusing her because I am not studying and listening to her, and she thinks that I should not have any friends because my job is only to study. My mom is a stay at home mom who never got a job and the only source  of fulfillment in her life is me. Next semester, since I am going to live alone they told me I will fail my classes and that they hope I don't get a return offer from my internship.

Idk if this just normal AP stuff...but yeah it's hard to deal with. I have one more month til I move out to my internship but since next month is finals they have been more and more overbearing on me."

2. Scientific Apprenticeship: at the same place above, but it started with this apprenticeship program, highly selective

# Letters of Recommendation

1. Sophomore history teacher: 9/10, I already asked her to write my QuestBridge College Prep Scholars rec letter and she interviewed me and went super in depth. I worker super closely with her for my NHD project, so she saw me when I was in the trenches
2. Advisor/AP Chem teacher: 7/10, he's my advisor and also will be my AP chem teacher, he knows me pretty well as a person and he's had me before in middle school, but he knows me more as a person than a student.

# Essays

1. i've always been super competitive because my family would play a ton of board/video games and how that competitive nature seeped into every part of my life; it destroyed my self-confidence, made me depressed, etc etc, then I'm unlearning that unhealthy behavior and learning a new skill called selective competitiveness that allows me to strive for the best version of myself while still realizing that I have value as a person even if I'm not 'the best'

# Weaknesses!!!

1. slight downward grade trend, only in math and science because my physics teacher is hell reincarnated and yeah of course I'm gonna end with a lower grade in AP Calc then in freshmen Honors Geometry
2. THE BIG ONE: I'm gonna end the year with like an 83 in Physics Honors because I got a C last quarter. I got super depressed when my chronic illness started to flare up again, and my chronic fatigue, as a result of my illness, kicked in, so I spent most of my time sleeping, I barely ate, and I felt HEAVILY suicidal. feeling better now, but yeah.

# Personal Preferences

**Location:** in/near a city, urban environment, a warmer place (i get seasonal depression lol)

**Curriculum**: flexible/open curriculum, thrive in collaborative and project and discussion based systems

**Schools that I like**: not asking for a chance me for these schools, but just so yk the type

12lglpq,0,2023-04-13,Advice on Finding Remote/On-Site Position for Android Development as a Freshman Graduate,Yepsone,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/12lglpq/advice_on_finding_remoteonsite_position_for/,"Hi everyone,

I recently graduated as a software engineer after 5 years of studying (it takes that long here...) and I am looking for a remote/on-site position for Android development, but I am having a difficult time finding one. Most of the job postings I see require a minimum of 3-5 years of experience, which is frustrating since I am just starting out.

I would really appreciate it if you could share any advice or tips on how to find entry-level positions in Android development. How did you get your first job as a freshman graduate? Are there any websites or job boards that specialize in entry-level positions?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help!  


Note: I recently completed a six-month internship where I built an Android app from scratch with another intern who was working on the iOS version. Although I was paid a nominal wage for my services, I was more interested in gaining experience than earning money. The app is now in production, but unfortunately, the company is not willing to continue working on it until they decide to add new features. As a result, my contract was not renewed, and my stint with the company came to an end. I had hoped to continue working with them for at least another six months to gain more experience, but unfortunately, that did not happen."
12lhk7f,7,2023-04-13,Grad school or industry? At a crossroads and im really not ready for this decision,FatrickPeng,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/12lhk7f/grad_school_or_industry_at_a_crossroads_and_im/,"I've been at NYU undergrad for almost 3 years now. I always thought I would go to grad school and get a masters or PHD in CS. That was until last semester, when I got covid, lost all my motivation, failed a humanities class, and tanked my GPA to a 3.1. I've been told my chances at grad school are basically over. Now that my options are limited to industry, I decided to just graduate a year early and call it. But I've been looking for jobs now in this fucked up tech industry, and I realize that I have no industry experience at all. All my internships were at labs, and although I have quite a lot of machine learning experience, no one in industry needs a ML specialist who only has a BS. All the jobs that look like a good fit to me require at minimum a masters. I know for sure that I would be able to handle a masters course, because I've taken most of a masters course at NYU. I just don't think I'll be able to get in anymore because of that GPA. I have attached my resume, which is probably a bad idea, but it should help with understanding my predicament. Should I just apply to less rigorous MS programs? Or should I give up and go industry? 

TLDR: Idiot tanks his GPA, unsure of whether to apply to less rigorous schools or to go industry in a tech recession"

American Airlines — Software Developer Intern
$34/hr, $2000 relocation

Pros:
- cheaper housing
- seems to be more accomodating, program manager responds within the hour and seems eager to help. Could possibly negotiate pay — asking tomorrow on call

Cons:
- I want to work in Quant, so maybe not the best?

Wells Fargo - Software Engineer Intern
$40/hr, $2500 relocation

Pros:

- new york city could be more fun
- could be a better look? Higher on f500 list? Finance for quant?

Cons:

- housing much more expensive, wouldn’t be able to live in a private room

- not as accomodating, haven’t had the greatest experience trying to get my dates adjusted

I don’t know which to take, and am wondering if the title makes a difference. How should I make my decision here? Targetting FAANG/Quant next year (sophomore currently)."

12li1se,96,2023-04-13,Being a disappointment,Aromatic_Cat963,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/12li1se/being_a_disappointment/,"Y3 CS student here. Spent the last 3 months searching desperately for internships and at the end of it, I manage to barely get 1 offer, with a time period that I really don't like (May to Dec, for total 8 months) but I might have no choice but to accept it. I'm in the process with one other company who may offer me 3 months, however I'm not too keen on working there either since they are entirely remote, and communication with their HR has been horrible. The first company has given me 2 more days to accept the offer, which I don't think is enough time to get the offer from the second company, so I'm not sure what to do. Both companies are startups with <10 people. My previous and only other internship was also with a startup of this size.

In the end, I am grateful that I do at least have some offers so I can graduate. But I just feel very stressed, lost, and ultimately like a disappointment. If I'm having so much trouble finding internships, how am I ever going to find a fulltime job? All my friends and family can't seem to relate because apparently, tech industry is always looking for people, should be very easy to find job/internship. If it's so easy, then what does that say about me? What about me, who took a degree that should be an easy path to financial stability, and was a few weeks ago at risk of not being able to graduate?

I also can't help but compare myself to other people. Why can other people get internships at bigger companies, but not me? Why can their salary be so much higher than mine? It's come to the point where I resent some of my friends that I know are doing better. I know deep down that I'm probably not working hard enough. My CAP is pretty mid. I have barely any personal projects. I don't leetcode grind as much as I should.  I haven't done (or at least, done well in) Hackathons, coding competitions etc. But most of the time, school already makes me feel like I'm barely hanging on. How am I supoosed to squeeze all of this in? Maybe I just don't have the mental fortitude or skill for CS in general. Everyday I just feel like I'm failing everyones expectations. I actually just got off the phone with my parents, and that just made everything worse, cuz startups are ""not worth your time"".

Anyway sorry for the mental breakdown rant. If anyone else had the same work experience as me (2 internships at small startups) and found a job after graduation, could I ask how the job search was like, was it hard? What kind of job did you land? What's the jobscope, salary, work culture? At this point, I'm worried that I may not find a job at all, let alone a job with stable salary"

Is it possible for me to get into a masters program for CS in Usa?

With my limited work experience, certifications, projects and research paper. Is it possible for me to convince the university to accept me into a CS program or take extra classes/courses to build the relevant requirements for a CS program? And mention my strong interest in CS during SoP?

I can get an LoR from my current company and 2-3 from my college professors. 

I can pay upto 30000-50000 usd for two years tuition fees.

12ljnbk,25,2023-04-14,Graduate School Journey: for those feeling uninspired after a rejection,Busy_Brilliant1995,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/12ljnbk/graduate_school_journey_for_those_feeling/,"Hi everyone!  


I told myself I'd make a post about this once I received an offer for graduate school, and fortunately the day has finally come. I want to congratulate everyone on their acceptances this year, and if you didn't get an admit, well, I have a story just for you; a true success story from the bottom all of the way to the top. Perhaps you've seen many success and failure stories on reddit-as I certainly have-yet none of them truly resonated with my experience, and perhaps you might be in the same boat. This is going to be an extremely long post, but I hope it helps someone out there, and inspires to continue pursuing the dream of getting into graduate school. Without further inanities, here's my story:  


I graduated top of my class from high school with multiple offers from different universities, ultimately settling for a private liberal arts college I'm certain many of you have heard of (for identity purposes and what not, I will keep this anonymous). I had always been a straight-A student, but entering college, I realized I was unprepared. Long story short, I started to get Bs and a few Cs, which was enough to send me into a spiraling depression because I knew this would be the end of my goal towards medical school (at the time, I really wanted to go to medical school). I didn't do so well, and I ultimately left with a 2.9 gpa. I attended a larger, public institution where I did even worse; I had no friends, I was battling depression from the reality of never, ever going to medical school, and all well over that, I had a relative who was very ill, which required me to work full time and have a secondary job overnight. It was HELL. I barely had any time to sleep, and my grades suffered, and ultimately I decided to leave that institution with a 1.7 gpa. I decided to take a few years off from school and ventured out working multiple jobs, from food service, to dental offices, to sales, and even call centers and retail. I was disappointed in myself, and realized I was no longer that smart person I was once if I couldn't even get all As in college; in essence, I was extremely brutal on myself. Meanwhile, I started to think about trying school again and gave it a go at my local community college, taking two classes per semester and acing them; this was the beginning of my turning point. I started to reevaluate my situation, and although I knew medical school was definitely impossible at that point, I realized my passion for it was gone, now replaced rather by a peculiar desire to learn about research and the unknown workings of our world. This was the beginning of my desire to get into graduate school. I decided to get back into school, acing every class I took, and attempting to bring my gpa back up as much as possible. Meanwhile, I was working two jobs and had responsiblities but at the end of the day, I realized if I wanted to get out of that situation, I needed to work towards it. And that I certainly did:  


\-I finished community college coursework with a 4.0 and transferred all of my work to another public R-1 institution.   
\-At the university, I made a goal for myself to get as many As as possible and only had wiggle room for one B; failure to follow this rule meant I would be a year or two behind making that up so that wasn't an option. In other words, I said goodbye to part of my social and romantic life and decided what my priorities were.   
\-While doing all of this and working a part time job, I began emailing professors around the USA, following up on their research from conferences, attending conferences with my own money, sending out CVs, getting involved in multiple labs at once for research (there was at one point in time where I was working in three labs just to stand out from my competition). I began networking like there was no tomorrow, developed an extremely close relationship with many professors to the point I now call them my friends and can comfortably talk to them about anything unrelated to academics (they were all my rec letter writers and I know for a fact they knew me like the back of my hand so that helped ALOT when the time came to apply: they knew my strengths and weaknesses as an academic and as a human being). I also emailed other nearby institutions' professors seeking internship opportunities and many gladly offered me a position!  
\-I took the time out of my day to research how to write effective personal statements, statement of purposes, diversity statements, and received guidance and mentorship from many professors on how to develop and execute the writing; I now take the time to review many graduate application materials from my friends and professors who send me their students to have their materials reviewed due to the amount of years I focused on developing these skills. Graduate school admissions isn't difficult; you just have to give them what they are looking for, and from my experience evaluating applicant materials, sometimes a strong candidate is indeed strong, but fails to deliver what the school ""wants."" I also received personal mentorship with a professor on how to take tests in addition to communication, interview techniques, portfolio developments, and CV critique.  


Along with a few things mentioned, I'm proud to say that after so much failing and moments where I felt lost and unable to continue, I received my fifth and final offer from a PhD program and I couldn't be happier! Although a first-generation in my immediate family to apply to a graduate program (extended family have doctorates and immediate family graduated college) and of Hispanic descent, this makes me incredibly proud! However, I will be declining all 5 offers due to not being the right fit for me. I know, I know-many of you are saying ""WHAT IN THE WORLD??? ANYONE WOULD KILL FOR AT LEAST ONE OFFER!!!"" I totally get that. However, this is a 5-7 year commitment, and if my heart is not fully set on a program, it is logically not feasible for me to pursue something and be miserable just to get it out of the way. I've decided to take a gap year, and help others pursue their dream to graduate school in any shape or form that I can. I will apply again next year, but I'm proud to have received admits and that's good enough for me.   


I write this story in hopes that others may be inspired by it. I was also a low gpa success story; I also had circumstances that kept me away from my studies many times, yet I found a way to pursue that goal. If anyone is saddened by the news of a rejection, don't be. The best student can also be rejected, but its due to bad timing. There's always next year. With that being said, I hope this story helps someone out there. If anyone needs assistance in reviewing graduate material and would like an unbiased pair of eyes who is willing to provide brutal, yet absolute constructive criticism to help you on your journey, please feel free to message! I wish I would have had someone to guide me through the application process, but much of it I had to learn myself. If I can help someone feel more confident in their application for next year, then I'm all for it! Congratulations to those accepted, and for those who received a rejection, let's get you back into the application pool next year! :D 

  
PS: for those wondering, I'm 26! It's possible!"

It was super stressful putting in apps everyday, working on personal projects, and trying to attend every recruiting event. I'm really grateful that I came out of this season with a few offers, but since I got those offers in early March I feel like I've just been floating through life and have lost my fire. I keep wondering what life after college will look like, and I'm scared that I'm doomed to being a code monkey for the rest of my life. 

Is life after college just about working? Is it normal to feel unusually blue after a big accomplishment? How can I get out of this mindset?"

Hey, I got an internship offer over the phone after the interview and I accepted cause the search has been hard and this just seemed great (they provided housing). I onboarded and everything set up and stopped my search. However, it’s been over a month I onboarded/accepted the offer and the company is so unserious. I’ve had to pester them to keep the tracks moving, up until now I still don’t know my location posting or my team setup and this annoys someone like me that likes having a plan and early on. I’ve wanted to know the location to at least know if I need to book a flight or not and do it early on. School ends first week of May and I still don’t know. 
Anyways so I started the search again and I’ve gotten three interviews in the span of a week (this is mind blowing, previously I used to get three in the span of a month or more). And there’s this other company that will provide housing AND transportation in the area (my current company doesn’t provide transportation) and I had the interview with them yesterday over zoom. I know it’s not set in stone that I’ll get it but I’m really praying on it, the hiring manager wanted me to have an on-site interview towards the ending of the meeting/meet with others in the company and I want to take that as a good sign. 
The only kind of down turn is that this new company starts a bit after the semester ends so I’ll have to house myself for like two weeks (I think I can do that) before I can get in the company housing and it also ends a bit early (early July) so I’ll have to house myself again. And also that kind of shorter term may mean less money but this current company is kind of like pay based on jobs completed but the other is standard per hour so the peace of mind might be better.
So anyways I’m basically asking for two things, advice on how to deal with this current company (like getting them moving) and if I can reject the current company if this new one gives me an offer even though I’ve already onboarded?

Note: this has also been posted elsewhere, I really want advice from every corner"

Hey yall, I am curious how some of you ended up choosing the field that you did. I am finishing up my last semester of my sophomore year and want to try and choose a direction for me to go. I have one friend who wants to be an android dev and another friend who wants to go into web development. Other than becoming a software engineer I don't really know what specifically I want to do, and that seems important because I feel like making a decision on that now would help tailor future projects and internship prospects to that one goal.

Any advice for choosing a specialty like that? It would be helpful if there was just a huge wiki going through all those various jobs and types of developers lol."

I have lost track of how many applications I have submitted, and the only real feedback I have received was two interviews from one company that later declined me. 

I see people discuss how difficult it can be to find a job without experience, but I do have experience. I've worked two separate internships during the past two summers, and currently am still working part-time with my latest one from this past summer. 

I honestly don't understand what I am doing wrong, especially because I have other friends who graduated last spring who found a job in CS less than a month after graduating. 

I've revised my resume at least a dozen times over the past few months, and done my best to make connections with recruiters for the positions I'm applying for. 

Is the job market just really rough right now or am I really unlucky?"

12lycfi,2,2023-04-14,Advice for Recent Graduate Resumes,cjl1023,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/12lycfi/advice_for_recent_graduate_resumes/,"Hello! As of late, I have seen quite a few posts for recent graduates or folks asking for feedback on entry level resumes. I have worked in HR for 6 years, and wanted to share some general tips to help with this. My resume from when I first graduated was absolutely TERRIBLE in hindsight, and the reason being is that I had no idea what to do. This was a resume with the career services advice as well. 

From insider knowledge, recent graduates are viewed differently than a career professional. There is more understanding when it comes to transferable skills and your career not 100% lining up with the role you are applying too.

**How to think about an entry level resume**

When it comes to building out your entry level resume, I personally recommend structuring it differently than a professional, experienced resume. Below is the format I would recommend in a specific order as well. There are 4 main buckets to focus on when building this out.

**Education**

This should be at the top of your resume under your name/contact info/city. Why? Your resume will be read from the top down, so the first thing the audience will see is that you are a recent or expecting graduate. This is good! It sets the stage on how they will interpret the rest of your resume. Again, recent graduate resumes are reviewed differently.

Include your college name, degree type, GPA, and graduation date but keep it simple.

**Work Experience**

When creating this portion, I would really reflect on past jobs and how they can translate to the role you are applying for. Every business has customers, and in most roles you are working you still need to interact with customers.

Here is an example of what I mean. When I was applying for roles out of college, my most recent role was working on a dock at a marina. Not really a pound for pound match, but the posting called out skills being needed in customer service, relationship building, communication etc. Looking back, I could have highlighted all the customer service I provided to customers on the dock, relationships I managed with recurring customers, how I created positive customer experiences, etc.

Maybe your experience is more transferable. For instance, maybe you have internships in your field. Awesome! Internships are great experience and when crafting what to highlight in your experience really reflect on what is relevant to the role you are applying for then highlight that.

**Additional Experience**

This is a great section for recent graduates and you can really incorporate two main areas under this. Projects you did that are relevant to the role you are applying to or any philanthropic, community, or leadership experience you have to highlight some soft-skills as well.

Projects can be great in highlighting work you did outside of direct work experience. Let's say you have a degree in computer science. Did you create anything using programing languages or tools through school or on your own? Great to include that technical experience to highlight your ability. Did you graduate with a degree in marketing? Highlight any work you have done on your own in marketing or school projects. Did you create any media accounts leading to more traffic? You could even demonstrate accounts you ran and marketed on your own.

Leadership, philanthropic and/or community experience can be leveraged too. Were you in any social groups? What did you contribute? Maybe it was organizing events. This can be translated into leadership, time management, collaboration, working with vendors, time management, project management etc. How did you manage all of the tasks to run the event? How big was the event? What was the positive impact? Even just listing additional activities show you were able to manage your school work and additional responsibilities.

**Additional Skills**

This is a great section to add any high level bullets of tools, systems or experience you have here. This can help with ATS filtering and to catch attention. Focus on additional skills that are relevant to the career you are targeting and the job. Example could be if you are targeting Data Science roles, you could list programming languages here in addition to having it listed in your work experience section. Sales roles you could add Customer Service or Relationship Building. Marketing could list Google Ads, Google Keywords, SEO, etc.

These are the main areas I would focus on when crafting an entry level resume. I would keep in mind that the theme of all these buckets are relevancy so you do want to tailor it intentionally. While it is tough to land that first role, entry level roles really do pay more mind to transferable skills and you probably have a lot, you just need to highlight them! This also can be a system to build out your LinkedIn profile as well.

I hope this helps and am happy to answer any questions as well!"

3 and a half years ago I founded a consulting business with a couple of friends. The business at the time was the 3 cofounders; CRO, CEO, & the CTO (me).  


We eventually get an idea, no one's passion but more a need in an industry that is under-serviced. We build a POC and get funding, and scale the company and the product.  


Both the other co-founders have left due to a lack of fulfillment in their positions, and their relations with the investors. Those investors through strategic moves now hold 80% of the company and I hold 15%. We are funded with 3M+ and have 13 employees. And I am more the CEO than the CTO.

&#x200B;

My big question is should I leave, and work for a bit then maybe try this all again later?   


The issue is, I feel I am no longer doing what I was supposed to do there, build products and lead an engineering team. I am literally called upon to do absolutely everything a CEO would and my skills in technology/leadership/product vision are atrophying. The investors are hoarding the 80% and rather put stress on us than open the pool to other investors. As well they are all 70+ years old and have literally no knowledge of technology. An actual quote from one of the meetings was 'I don't know what an app is, and I've never used one before' from the controller of every decision we make at the business. And I would say 50% of my time is spent teaching them about fundamental concepts that I have to revisit constantly, sometimes so much so that we miss deadlines because they can't grasp concepts, and I am a higher-level communicator (despite the disjointedness of this post). I do not believe my time is capitalized when I align myself with these investors, and though I am the 'CEO/CTO' I don't have the company and cant make any decisions.

As well we are struggling with customers and the market size isn't so large that it can even be a billion-dollar company with liberal projections.  


I think a path for me might be to return to an individual contributor role at a different company learn more then try again maybe in the future. Though I worry that I'm giving up too soon, or that I 'have it good' and I can't see that?

I'm CS and shotgunned and was fortunate to have choices, which I'm very appreciate of. Based on my results, I'm considering switching to EE, but still not sure.

I'm considering going to community college for a couple of years, then going to a state school (which would still come out to over $120k), but I'd love to get any feedback or thoughts about the following four options. I added in the total cost I'd be on the hook for after all financial aid packages are in, as well as an inflation-adjusted total 4 year cost (I assumed an annual 8% increase in tuition and 4% inflation on books/housing/food...).

* **University of Alabama** \- $23k per year (**$97k** over 4 years) - Engineering CS
* **Virginia Tech** \- $37K per year (**$161k** over 4 years) - Engineering CS
* **William & Mary** \- $41k per year (**$180k** for 4 years)

* **Purdue** \- $47k per year (**$209k** over 4 years) - Science CS

My parents can help somewhat, but the majority of these amounts would have to be in the form of loans. Does anything stand out here to anybody? Is there something that looks like a terrible or great choice? Any feedback would definitely be appreciated.

Astronomical date 13.73B

\*Source: Recorded from the personal log of a student from Shutans School of Excellence after a \[27-day\] disappearance following the end of their internship.\*

I'm not sure how I'm still alive. By all accounts, I should either be a burnt shadow on the floor, drifting in the void of space, or just...

\*Sigh\*

Okay, let's just follow protocol. The captain said that the council is going to want everyone's explanation for this disaster.

My name is Lu-ash, and I am or was the 13th ship maintenance worker for the 1588th exploration ship. Due to a number of unfortunate incidents during the initial incident, I was given the rank of fourth maintenance engineer.

I was assigned to this ship as an intern crew member from the Shutan School of Excellence for its ""Expertise Development Program.""

At the end of our work study, our ship was attacked and pursued for ten days by a number of GAC ships.

For context, before this situation happened, I and a number of my classmates had the chance to go on a deep space research ship and watch the methods and day-to-day activities of our respective fields while working.

Near the end of our time aboard the ship, we had to stop at a nearby station that's believed to be frequented by pirates and smugglers.

After spending some time searching for spare funds and selling off junk materials to cover higher fuel costs, we were stopped and questioned by a patrolling GAC security force.

And while annoying, it was a pretty simple situation. They just wanted us to prove who we were and that we were in the places we said.

So we sent them our manifest, the crew logs, my class's work-study documentation, and we even sent them our travel records and fuel purchases.

Everything was in order and was going well.

Then they shot at us.

Okay, they did hit us. They really just grazed us, and that was probably on purpose.

Considering what weapons were on one of the larger ships, I think they were trying to knock the shields offline and then hit us with an electromagnetic disruptor.

I was talking to the chief engineer, Tu-An, about apprenticeships or other job opportunities after I graduated when the ship was hit.

Both of us and anything else that wasn't welded down in the office were knocked to the ground by the impact.

Before we could stand, the former captain Joh-An announced over the speakers shortly after that we were about to make an emergency exit from the system and head to a secure location.

After a 10-second countdown, we were flying in a random direction through space.

When everything settled down, Tu-An stormed onto the bridge, demanding an explanation.

Captain Joh failed to send over the ship's identification codes, which would have clarified that we were a government-sponsored research vessel and avoided this situation in the first place.

He also adamantly refused to allow either a physical inspection or a ship scan to prove that we weren't harboring anything illicit, reasoning that they could affect sensitive experiments.

Saying that Tu-an was mad would be an understatement, and he wasn't the only one. Everyone with any semblance of authority was upset, even if they didn't immediately express it.

And to make things worse, he made the ship's damage even worse.

After taking that first hit, the damage wasn't too bad. Just some minor structural damage, and the pulse slightly melted some of the metal of the hull.

Activating the FTL engines while the shields were weakened caused the heat and momentum from the engines to bend the frame and melt nearly entire sections off the hull.

And because of the new breaches, we lost a lot of the supplies we had.

With the time we had, we did a head count, made repairs, blocked off damaged areas of the ship, and collected whatever remaining water we had.

Then the navigators detected a few ships coming from where we left. They didn't even bother to listen when we tried to connect with them by sending them every signal we could think of.

And so began our ten-day expedition of survival.

The first and second days were our introduction and acclimation to the new schedule we had for life on the go.

The GAC ships show up, shoot at us, someone gets hurt or dies, we flee, repair what we need to live, and then do it again. We started a more strict rotation of sleeping schedules and rationed the little supplies that we had.

Actually, the third day wasn't that bad. or, at the very least, it was not horrible enough to recall clearly. Everyone was hungry from being on quarter rations, irritable from the stress of being in this mess, and miserable.

Day four was the most strenuous for most of the crew. Security spent most of the day breaking up fights and glaring at anyone who looked like they were about to start one. Maintenance workers had to start cannibalizing parts from all around the ship to keep critical functions online.

All the while, the crew was looking through every packet and folder to find the ship's identification codes.

On the fifth day, captain Joh-An managed to get back in contact with the GAC Minh-Oh captain, though that obviously didn't change much.

That day, we had the most casualties, so it was the busiest for the medical bay... and the morgue.

Oh, and it was also the day the crew ""mutinied"".

Due to how poorly he handled the initial conversation with the other captain, Joh-An had gotten a good number of threatening messages, which basically doubled after the second botched attempt.

So after that second attempt failed, it felt a bit strange that he couldn't succinctly explain the situation.

With a bit of poking around the ship and a few ""discussions"" with Joh-An and some members of communication, we found out the reason we stopped off at the station in the first place.

He and a few others from navigation and storage had apparently been offloading contraband the entire time we were traveling. It was also revealed that the \[**REDACTED**\] was embezzling funds.

We did manage to get back in contact with the GAC ships, but because we fled from them earlier, we would **all** be treated as smugglers.

What's more, we were told that the ship could be destroyed without any issue.

So.. that's why Chou-sen was promoted to the captain's position.

I think we stopped losing so many people on the seventh day, and while that was a relief, I didn't really keep track of the number of casualties.

And more good news that day: the ship's identification codes were found.

It turns out that one of the software techs working with the ex-captain accidentally added it to a field study while altering financial reports.

He just couldn't open the files again due to the anti-falsification tools in the data collection program.

The software team spent hours searching for the identification codes in the expedition results, and it took the software lead, Co-Din, a few minutes to get the codes from the files, which was helpful when we got back home and weren't harassed.

The ninth day was the most difficult when one of the water purifiers broke down. So until it was repaired, the water fluctuated between being fairly usable, oversaturated with chemicals, or actual sewage when coming out of the tap.

Then we arrived just outside the \[Sol system\].

Our ship's navigators located three systems that could've provided what we needed to make hasty repairs and refuel.

One system was transmitting several radio waves, which scans revealed to be swarms of satellites operating at frequencies typical of pre-FTL civilizations. Just with way more satellites than usual.

There were so many satellites that we assumed it wouldn't surprise them if a few of them went offline. It's not out of the question for random debris to take a few offline.

...

Look, we all promised that we'd pay them back later, but survival comes first, you know?

There were still GAC ships following us, but we assumed the signals would help us with that as well.

**In most cases**, neither GAC's military nor political personnel are permitted to enter or interact with any pre-FTL civilization.

I emphasize ""in most cases"" due to one exception we found:

Unless they're searching for suspects trying to hide in those locations,

So we set up and sent out a couple of dummy buoys to be sent out during FTL travel to simulate our ship's energy and radio frequencies, hopped over to this system, and put the engine on silent for a while to collect supplies and ""debris.""

We were caught by both of the groups we were hiding from and didn't even get enough time to make repairs or refuel. So we just gave up.

A message was sent to all the ships in the vicinity, informing them that they were ""in Terran United Front-controlled space"" and ordering them to turn off all relativistic weapons and transportation.

Considering that we either didn't have or couldn't do any of those things, we just waited, hoping that the GAC ships wouldn't blow us up in front of the locals.

During that time, everyone on the ship began to either speculate about the locals' intentions or prepare their wills.

After a while, the sensors picked up on three smaller spacecraft coming from...

Just... the **ugliest** ship I've ever seen.

The thing had strange shapes; some of it was blocky, some of it was smooth, and some looked like they didn't have **anything** covering sensitive components.

And I think those were the parts the GAC ships were warming up and aiming their weapons at as they turned to the Terran ships.

As we were typing a warning about psychos, we realized that the GAC ships were firing missiles used to destroy large asteroids.

So we just decided to pray for the people on the ships.

Then we all had this... feeling. It was more like one of those intrusive thoughts that appear out of nowhere, prompting us to put up our shields. The strange thing, though, was that we all had those thoughts or ideas at the same time.

So that's what we did. The shields were raised, and we watched as the missiles flew through the void.

Then two things happened.

First, a few bright lights came from the small ships slicing through the missiles, blowing them up a safe distance away.

Second, the smaller ships had a strange shimmer sweeping  over them.

We would have wondered if the GAC ship missed them if we weren't watching it all happen.

Then we had another intrusive thought tell us to ""max out the shields.""

Everyone I spoke to afterwards had that thought, and they all said it wasn't in any of our voices.

So once again, we listened to whoever gave us the thought, and this time we watched as one of the smaller ships fired a capsule from a missile port.

Then everything just went white. Our equipment had about a half second to record some information before cutting out or displaying, to say the very least, **concerning** readings.

Everyone was a bit... staggered after that happened, then terrified when the three large ships that were following us turned into a number of molten heaps of slag.

After waiting a few minutes for things to figuratively and somehow literally cool down, we received another text-based transmission from the Terrans.

They apologized for the inconvenience, asked if we needed any repairs, and politely confirmed that:

Yes, we were still being arrested.

So... that's how we began our trip to ""Terran"" space becoming their first ambassadors and second prisoners."

I have recently been learning how to program a STM32 blue pill using the arm-gnu tools with openocd and the libopencm3 library and template project files. I am considering skipping the template and creating my own makefiles and linker scripts next, but that feels a little daunting. I have not touched RTOS or embedded linux yet.

I’ve done plenty of research about people’s experiences in the field and have read various opinions, many of people being discontent and urging others not to pursue with IT. I’ve considered alternative careers and have decided that many are to competitive, insecure, or don’t draw any interest from me. So I’ve practically made up my mind on this.

First I was a pharmacy intern and then when I passed my boards I was hired on as a pharmacist in January 2022. The atmosphere is much less stressful than a traditional retail pharmacy and I have enjoyed my time there. When accepting my pharmacist role my owner informed me she would have a second store ready in October 2022 and I would be the pharmacy manager if I would like, and I accepted. My initial rate upon hire in January was $58/hr, compared to the $60/hr of my coworkers. My owner claimed this was because I was a new pharmacist and needed time to grow (fair). Fast forward to October when the second store opened and my pay has been increased to $60/hr along with my other coworkers, even though I have the title of manager.

When informed of the pay I asked to discuss pay increase with my owner. She told me that after 6 mo. to a year we could reevaluate and eventually I could make $65/hr as manager. Also, she was stressing that I should be working ""towards a bonus"" and not for a pay raise, which is where my initial doubts set in. Then at the end of the year all my coworkers (technicians, interns, and pharmacists) all received a bonus check. I would like to note that the previous end of year (December 2021) we all received a bonus check as well and mine was $2000 and I was still an intern. This year everyone seemed to have received a smaller bonus, mine being $1000, and at the end of the review with my owner she told me (as she did with others) not to discuss the bonus with other workers (illegal?). She claimed to have allocated more money towards the techs and interns this year because of their hard work, but after discussing with the techs and interns (myself), that did not seem to match what she said (more lies). 

Around the end of January I guess my other coworkers had been discussing our bonuses and were rightfully upset which prompted my owner to send us a message in the company group chat saying she did not appreciate us discussing these bonuses. Following her text I replied that it is within their rights to discuss wages and sent in the Massachusetts's law (where I work) that prohibits employers from stopping employees from discussing wages. This made her very upset with me and prompted a phone call where she did not understand why, ""I am working against her"" and saying these things (maybe because I am also an employee and have the right to?). Sadly I apologized and said I would not talk about the bonus anymore. It should be said in our discussion I asked her why we got less this year and she said the pharmacy did not do as well without the extra sales of covid supplies and testing (which isn't entirely true because we still had good profits from it). Either way, I knew the pharmacy was making good money and thought we all deserved better bonuses if we are not going to receive raises.

Fast forward to today. Ironically it was one of my days off in the week. I did not have much to do today and my coworker said they needed help setting up a blister pack for a patient because she had never done one before, so I offered to come in. I go to the pharmacy around 2 pm and start helping (there is an application/service names Dispill which is what we use for our blister packages) and get the patients profile set up to do so. I had called my owner to help me as to make sure everything was entered correctly. The gentleman who was coming to pick up the blister pack got there around 2:15 (I have helped him in the past) and asked about it. He works for a group home with mentally handicapped patients (excuse me if this is not the PC terminology), and was excited to use the service with us as they have about 5 patients who could use it. So to be clear he was picking up for one of his patients. I let the gentleman know it was not ready yet and that it MAY take about 30 minutes (something I never should have said apparently). I also informed him that it is a $20 service fee which made him iffy, but I then offered to attempt billing it to Mass Health. He leaves, and I continue working on the blister packs. I get everything setup, including fixing our printer, and teach my other coworker (different than the one mentioned before who left at 2 pm) how to prepare the blister packs. Essentially all she had to do was print the labels, place the meds into their corresponding blister, seal them, and bill mass health for the service. Boom, good to go. It was time for me to leave and run errands I already had planned (day off) so I passed it off to her AND told my owner to please contact my coworker to help her finish.

About an hour later I get a phone call from my owner pissed off at me because the customer came back and was screaming at my coworker in the pharmacy because the blister pack was not ready yet. I tried to explain myself but my owner just kept calling me out saying, ""A, when you promise a patient something will get done you must stay to make sure that thing is done! Now B is getting yelled at because of your mistake!"" I tried explaining that I told the gentleman it MAY take about 30 minutes but that we would also have to bill Mass Health for the claim which would also take time. She ended the conversation with me saying she thinks it is not good for me to work for her anymore and gave me my 2 weeks notice. I said ok and hung up the phone. At first I was really heated right after, but after cooling off I am somewhat relieved.

There is a chance she calls me back at some point and apologizes and says she would like me to stay. In that case I would send her my resignation because working there is not good for my mental health. My question for you all is, if she does not rescind her statement then how do I ask for it in writing? Call her and say, ""Hi X, I need a formal statement from you about my termination, please send to my email when you can,"" ? I have never been fired before so I want to do this correctly. Also, does anyone know if I will then become eligible for unemployment if I am unable to get a new job in the time span? I already started updated my CV. Thank you for any advice in advance. 

TL;DR: Boss has been doing some sketchy BS for some time now and I have had enough. Made a minor mistake today and she has given me my 2 week notice. She only gave it verbally over the phone so should I ask for a written statement? Also, will I become eligible for unemployment?"

I was fortunate enough to be accepted into a few great schools (most importantly JHU, Cornell, and CMU, as well as GT and UC Berkeley) but I'm really struggling to make a decision. I was accepted into BME at JHU and the publics, and College of Engineering at Cornell and CMU. I think I'll do a BME + EE/CS/ChemE/physics double major or 3+1 BS/MS at JHU, or EE + something else at CMU/Cornell.

I know what the rankings are for all of these majors, but I'm not super concerned with them, since I'll get a similar quality of education at any of these (correct me if I'm wrong). However, I know from a close relative involved in hiring for a major tech company that internships/projects/experience matter much more than the name of the school.

This leads me to my question: which of these schools will give me the best opportunities for experiential learning and resume-building (research, internships, co-ops, project/design teams, makerspaces/design labs, etc.)? Also, which one will give me the most academic freedom to explore and choose whichever major I want to pursue? Finally, where will I receive the best academic advising, and from where can I expect the best outcomes, in terms of salary and employability?

Any advice at all would be very appreciated. Thank you!"

To note, I’ll graduate high school with an AA, so I want to only spend 2 years at university, and at the quickest I can graduate at UF in 2.5 years compared to 2 years at UCF (which will require cramming credits at both). 

Moreover, I won’t be able to get fall or spring internships at UF since it’s in Gainesville, which has limited opportunities compared to Orlando.

Lastly, I am interested in a BS/MS program that both UF and UCF offer, but I’m afraid it’ll be significantly more competitive to get accepted at in UF.

So, would it still be worthwhile to commit to UF despite these drawbacks?

We've been poor all our lives. However, I made a promise to myself in high school that I'd break the cycle and make something of myself. I know I'm really early on in my career, but it seems like interning for a great tech company will be the catalyst for escaping poverty.

Ok, so the thing is, I've devoted a lot of time the past few years to studying and academics. 

So normally people land a great internship and they spend more time relaxing with friends, their partner, etc. But the issue is, I don't really have any of those. I'm from the ""hood"" so there aren't many positive influences around me. I'm like the one ""standout nerd"" I guess. 

I go to a 100% online school because it was cheaper and my dad was vehemently against me dorming. This has had some major social implications. I've spent the past few years just in my room without ever making friends or ever dating. 

I told myself all the loneliness and sufferring I'm going through is worth it since if I land a great internship I'll be able to leave my toxic environment. 

I'm super grateful for my internship, I really am; but I also just feel really empty on the inside. I mean, I'm 21 and haven't really made any friends after graduating high school, nor have I ever dated before. I spent a lot of time grinding and neglected my mental and emotional well-being. 

I really want to make friends and meet someone wonderful, but my college is totally online so meeting people is practically impossible. Not just that, but being recluse the past few years has left me with really bad social anxiety.

I guess this post is asking how exactly do I touch grass when there's seemingly none around me? I look at other people having fun in college, or with friends, or dating and think ""man, I wish I had that"". 

I think I sacrificed too much for this internship/CS grind. I know for many CS majors, a FANG internship is ""making it"" or the end-goal, but truthfully, it feels so meaningless when you don't have anyone to share it with."

12mls6s,2,2023-04-14,NYU Courant MS CS vs ASU MCS,varun1352,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/12mls6s/nyu_courant_ms_cs_vs_asu_mcs/,"This is a more detailed version of the original post I uploaded 2days back. 

I am from a tier 2-ish University from India studying B.Tech in CSE with a 
GPA of 3.45/4(After 7 sems)  
GRE of 321(169 + 152) 
and am currently in my senior year of UnderGrad completing my Engineering Project. I have 2 internship experiences, one in Computer Vision and the other one in Machine Learning from local companies, nothing too fancy. I do not have any publications and but I have contributed in 2 research projects in which I worked for 4-5 months for each. I applied to 8 universities and have gotten acceptances from ASU MCS and NYU Courant MS CS, and am waiting for status update from 2 other prospective but difficult to get into universities. 

I am majorly confused with the 2 acceptances. 

ASU
Pros: 
Cheaper than NYU, in terms of living as well as tuition. 
Being an Indian, I would have a lot of known people there and a stronger referral alumni. 
Job search would be easier as ASU supports students in that area. 
Have family friends who recently passed out from the same program who can help me out loads. 

Cons: 
Not really a con. But ASU is just ASU, everyone can get into it and secondly the location isnt that great for networking as it's not New York(just for primary comparison). Still it's a great school and have a lot of respect for it. 


NYU: 
Pros: 
Great uni with a big ass value on its name. 
Living in New York(the lifestyle). 
Good course. 
The level, competition, thinking or people would be on another level. 
Just overall, way better than ASU in terms of acads and living style. 
Might be able to live the American dream 
Networking would be way better. 

Cons:
Way costlier, almost will cost me another $35k than ASU, might be even more. 
Won't be able to save much coz New York ain't gonna be cheap. 
The level of people in my class is going to be different as most of them who I have interacted with, fellow Indians, are from Tier 1 Universities with on an average 1-2 years of Work Ex. 
So I will have to put in more while managing living on my own and with the pace of New York. 
I am not afraid of the competition, rather afraid of the mental stress.
Secondly, I will have to take 12 courses in total, which is 3,4,4,1 in order of the semesters which would make the job search and interview prep more difficult than what I would have to go through at ASU. 
I would come out of Grad School with a bigger debt than someone who studied from ASU. So getting any job would be the priority while for ASU, getting the better job would be the priority. 


I genuinely just want different perspectives on this and I might be wrong with some of my points as well so please feel free to correct me.

12mmyzo,37,2023-04-14,SUTD CSD vs NTU CS vs NUS CEG,Legitimate_Ad6718,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/12mmyzo/sutd_csd_vs_ntu_cs_vs_nus_ceg/,"Hi everyone! This will be a relatively long post but I hope you will answer it. I have received offers from SUTD (with Global Merit Scholarship - covers the 4 years of tuition fees + 9k for overseas), NTU CS and NUS CEG, all of which are my first choice. I would like some advice on which uni and course to pick.

&#x200B;

I am from a computing background and I do know that I like software. However, I recently have a dilemma that instead of going through a pure CS path, taking CEG would be better since one can learn both hardware and software, hence being more adaptable to more industry problems (and if one feels bored doing one aspects, they can divert their attention to something else). However, I am assuming (pls correct me if I'm wrong) that a pure software job may be harder to get for a CEG student since one may not have as in-depth CS knowledge as a pure CS student. At the same time, I do know that employers don't differentiate between CS and CEG and in the sphere of computing, personal projects matter more. (Btw I applied for CS in NTU because I heard that it already has quite a bit of hardware modules, and if I like hardware, I can always swap over to CEG. I also applied for CEG in NUS rather than CS because I do not meet the cut-off for CS in NUS.)

&#x200B;

Secondly, the question about prestige comes in. Does having a scholarship in SUTD make me able to get high in demand opportunities much more easily (Eg: overseas exchange programmes, internships etc.) than a non-scholar or does the scholarship just provide me with financial aid? 

&#x200B;

Moreover, looking at the Global Employment Survey (GES), the salary differences between SUTD and NTU are very little, hence begging the question as to why, given NTU's extremely higher ranking than SUTD. However, when I look at the GES from NUS, the salary is approximately 1k higher than NTU and SUTD. Hence, comparing SUTD with NUS and NTU, I am obtaining very different conclusions, where NUS students can perform much better than SUTD as compared to NTU students despite NUS and NTU having similar, high rankings. Thus, is it the prestige of the uni that is making students earn more, or is it that very motivated students would naturally enter NUS and continue to do their best?

&#x200B;

I have also heard about NTU's CS curriculum being outdated (not sure if it is true) and would like to know more about this.

&#x200B;

Another factor is the learning style and curriculum, which I am inclined to SUTDs. This is given its classroom-based, more hands-on approach. I do not like group work but I understand the importance of it and hence want more of such opportunities.

&#x200B;

Hence, with all these factors in mind, I would like to know whether I should pursue CS or CEG and in which uni. Please also provide any other advice and clarifications for my train of thoughts and assumptions that I have made.

&#x200B;

I deeply appreciate all of you for reading my long post and I am looking forward to your advice. Thank you!"

I am an 18 y/o senior graduating early next month with plans to attend my local University for Computer Science. I currently attend classes for IT (Cisco Networking, Cloud, Linux etc).

Recently, I've acquired an internship for an IT Technician role at a local MSP. This role involves tech support, installation, repair, ""Add, Move, Change"" work, as well as cabling, telephone triage support, site support and troubleshooting. I would also be working with phone systems and more. Pay is $15/hr with wage negotiation after HS graduation + gas mileage compensation, vacation time, and offer for a company phone + laptop. I believe I would also have my own desk.

Given this description, just how valuable can this internship be? Is it unreasonable? I was told it would be a sharp vertical learning curve at the beginning, then it gets easier. I know there are a lot of internships for 'Help Desk', and, thankfully, this certainly doesn't seem to be one of those types.

Also, since I am doing all of this already, would pursuing a CS degree be wise? My thought process is that a CS degree would offer me greater flexibility.

Thoughts?

Edit: To clarify, CS degree vs something like IT or CIS."

I wanted to share my experience with questioning my Master's program. Coming from a finance background with excellent grades in undergrad, I thought I would enjoy pursuing financial engineering. However, the reality was much different than what I had expected. The program was really tough, with math-only classes that I found incredibly challenging. Despite my best efforts, I ended up getting a couple of C+ grades in the first semester, which was a big shock for me. It made me realize that I was struggling and that this wasn't the right path for me.

I knew that I had to make a change, so I requested a transfer to a finance Master's program. Unfortunately, my request was denied, which left me feeling lost and unsure of what to do next. I couldn't see myself continuing down the financial engineering path for another year and a half. I knew it would be detrimental to my well-being.

Right now, I'm feeling really lost and scared about my future. I thought I had a clear plan for myself, but now I'm not sure what my options are. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you navigate through it? Do you have any advice for someone who is feeling lost and unsure about their future? Note that I already have an internship secured for the summer so it's a little reassuring.

12n6sgs,6,2023-04-15,Rate my offers,beonor,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/12n6sgs/rate_my_offers/,"Hi all. I have got two offers and I am in need of opinions about them.

**Background**: I am finishing my PhD in Computer Science in Europe. I will defend in August and I am trying to get into industry, but within my field. I am non-EU, hence I need a work permit. My partner is with me, also non-EU. The country where I am living right now unfortunately has little opening for me, apart from academic positions (postdoc). I have approximately 1 year experience outside of academia (including a 3-month internship).

Both offers are to work as a **Data Scientist** (official title).

**Offer 1 (UK)**: large UK-based tech company with around 20 years of existence. They offer services to other countries as well. Job sounds interesting and even ""chill"" to some extent. This is not based in London, but around London. Say 40 min by public transport from the center of London.

* Salary: base is 57,000 pounds/year. There are no bonuses, or shares at first. This is the TC for now.
* This translates to a net of about 3,500 pounds/month or 3,900 euros/month.  They give some shares throughout your career, but nothing significant from what I could tell.
* Benefits: not that many exciting benefits. They have private health insurance, 25 days-off, and a policy where I can work from any country for 30 days. Work is hybrid with 2 days in the office.
* They offer some relocation assistance, including moving my stuff and 3k pounds for our first month (i.e., accommodations).
* *Major drawback*: we will have to pay the visa costs ourselves and the whole procedure is on our own. This means paying 4,000 pounds for health insurance (in total for me and my partner), plus 500 pounds for English test, plus 500 pounds of visa charges. In total about 5,000 pounds in visa-related fees, all to be paid within the next few months. We have this money, but it is a lot.

**Offer 2 (NL):** large and old NL-based company (not tech). Jobs is slightly less interesting than the UK. There is on-call on a rotational basis, which I was told pays extra (not sure how much). The job is located in Amsterdam, so we would have to live there or nearby.

* Salary: base is 55,200 euros/year. They have two 8% bonuses throughout the year, plus an end-of-year bonus between 0-20% based on company profit. Based on my calculations, TC would be around 64k considering a 0% profit bonus.
* I am eligible for the 30% ruling, so my base net per month would be 3,800 according to online simulations.
* Benefits: I have some discounts on extra health insurance for example. Not much more exciting as well. 25 days vacation.
* They offer minimal relocation assistance. They don't pay for moving our stuff, but they do assist with visa and applying for 30% ruling.
* There is not real major drawback. Downsides are that the job is not 100% what I was looking for even though it still seems interesting. Additionally, there is this on-call involved which I am not entirely sure how it works because I was only informed about the on-cal after they extended the offer. There was no mention of it during the interviews (and silly me never asked, but I wasn't expecting on call for a Data Science position to be honest). As far as I am aware, there are no visa costs involved.

&#x200B;

In both places, my partner would have the right to work, so she will likely be helping with the bills and all. However, this may no happen straight away. We are both fluent in English, and my partner knows Dutch to B1 level (I have some basic knowledge, maybe A2).

The NL offer is currently our preferred one, but the housing situation in the NL is a bit scary for us.

So what do you guys think? Are these offers low, average, or good? Should I try others (the market is difficult though).


EDIT: one thing that annoys me slightly is that I could get a postdoc at my current lab making 62k gross per year. This essentially means I would be making more or less the same thing as in industry in academia. The only reason I do not take that is because I want to move out of academia, but still is a bit demoralizing. Either this postdoc pays very well or my industry offers are pretty bad."
12n7ql0,10,2023-04-15,What has working or finding work with a medical condition or disability been like for you?,WhitePinoy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12n7ql0/what_has_working_or_finding_work_with_a_medical/,"I'm a 25 year old junior architectural draftsman who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer the previous year and learned just this year I also have an autoimmune disease (sjorgens with spinal arthritis). 

I chose architecture as my major, because I am a creative and I've always loved math, but also because I wanted to have a financially comfortable life. I wanted to be an animator and producer, but I guess I've shelved that now.

During my first year of college, I had immediate second thoughts about the profession. Doing all-nighter almost every single day, my body eventually gave out by my 3rd year and I barely scraped by any classes afterwards but still graduated somehow, while unknowingly having cancer.

Graduating was not easy either. I graduated into 2020 and I couldn't find a job. I was released from a brief internship with another company from a toxic boss and struggled to find work. I freelanced as an artist throughout 2020 and most of 2021, but that wasn't as fruitful as having a job. 

In late 2021, I worked for an engineering firm, and I was having issues which pissed off my boss. My boss was a micromanager who wanted things done right the ""first time"", when I am generally new into this profession  and need more time to grow. I was also having concentration issues, depression, anxiety and I didn't know why. 

When I told my boss I might have a medical condition and I was being tested, he let me go a few weeks later and told me that it was because I didn't have enough experience. They also let go another coworker that was experiencing issues at work as well months prior. To tell you the truth the firm had nice people, but unrealistic standards on some workers in my opinion. I stayed there for a total of 8 months.

I jumped around quite a bit. As soon as I was diagnosed I was told I have growth, which was later confirmed to be cancer. I was struggling to find more work and got recruited into this company near where I live that needed a CAD draftsman. I told them that I was going to have surgery by the end of the month and asked if that was a deal-breaker for them. They still hired me on. Near my surgery date I told them I needed a week to recover. My recruiter company then contacted me on the weekend to tell me that I'm being let go because a ""former employee who was on vacation is coming back full time and my services would no longer be needed"". They still had a new job opening for my position months later online.

I then quickly found another job where my boss had an issue with me leaving work early for a short doctor's visit. He told me that as a business for profit that my attendance was vital to the company and asked me if I had anything going on, to which I declined to prevent potential discrimination. 

I worked my ass off for an entire month and was forced to work OT. All my coworkers appreciated my help, and told me that I was nice and a great addition to the team. By the end of the month, my employer told me that I wasn't a good fit, because I'm not able to work independently or without a lot of assistance from other coworkers. After I left the company, my coworkers were shocked and confused and told me that I was very helpful. 

Months later, I'm working with their competitor and the environment is much more healthier with less OT and less drama. The problem now is it's 1.5 hours away to the office. I help architects make drafts for schools in California. I also have a second contract job where I'm helping a construction manager remodel and renovate homes. 

I have two jobs because I cannot afford to pay for medical bills without it. Now every weekend I feel pretty exhausted, but at least I don't have to worry about debt. 

I'm very grateful for my new jobs because I can afford things I previously could have never did. I'm also experiencing less issues with my employer badgering me about my performance or issues with my health. I am going to be undergoing radiation therapy soon, and my employer is doing all they can to accomodste for me. 

How has your work life journey been like living with a medical condition?"

Just wanted a little guidance on my career transition into cybersecurity.  My overall goal is to land a position at a Federal Agency through the Go Gov Cybersecurity initiative. I'm a veteran using my benefits to the max.  I have zero experience in IT other than dealing with some network configuration and digital radio communications as an Army Artilleryman. 

I'm currently two semesters into the University of San Diego's Cyber Security Operation's and Leadership master's program.  I'm doing very well in the program and the coursework is geared for you to build a portfolio showcasing your labs and other work in its capstone.  This should cover my home lab experience pretty well.

As a Reservist, I have access to quite a bit of money for professional certifications.  So far, I have put funding requests in for CompTIA Sec+, CySA+, and Project +.  CySA+ is part of my curriculum and the rest are self study.  I also have a request in for AWS Cloud Practitioner.  I think this is a pretty well rounded set of certifications.  They're paid for so I might as well.

Experience is my weakpoint.  I have my eye on a few helpdesk positions. The search for internships has been relatively fruitless, unfortunately. 

Do you think I am on the right track? Thanks!"
12n9qva,4,2023-04-15,"I cut off potential friendship, because I felt inadequate",CottonMatter,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/12n9qva/i_cut_off_potential_friendship_because_i_felt/,"I graduated highschool in 2020. Other than my cousin (whom I'll call A) and someone else (B) I met online, who turned out to be in the same school, I had one friend back then (C). Me and C hung out fairly often, but we slowly drifted apart during the last 2 years of school. I am not sure why, but probably it was a combination of me becoming increasingly shut-in (I know the reason for that, but this post isn't about it), realized we didn't have common interests and in general I was turned off by how he let everyone walk over him and how slowly he seemed to learn whenever I convinced him to play a new video game together. I deleted my contacts with C by 2020 and haven't tried to find him since.

A moved to a diffirent country with his dad (way back in 2019) and B moved back to his home city after graduation and entered college. We still kept in touch online for a long time. I too enrolled in college and dropped out after one semester. I knew it would happen, because at that point I had no idea what to do with my life and I still don't. It was either study *anything at all* right after school when I still had learning discipline or wait indefinitely long until I become somewhat certain, but then it would be much more difficult to study anything. I did drop out, and it was a major blow to my self-esteem, which was never high in the first place, and an embarrassing thing to mention in front of A and B who still keep going with their education. That semester had also wasted my parents' money. I still live with my parents and I should be grateful they haven't kicked me out. I haven't returned to education since then.

During the last year of highschool I became anxious for not having any lasting friendships. I was seen as a weirdo by my classmates and I admit it was my fault - for 4 years I turned down any invitation to go out anywhere and didn't initiate any conversations except with C. I worked with D, a student from another class, on an extra-cirricular project. E is a student from a third class, who took part in another team on the same project, and was going to re-open the school's book club, which I asked to join (I hadn't read anything in a long time, but thought I have enough to share for one visit a week) - however, then the Covid pandemic started and we switched to online lessons. Both D and E enrolled in college and E seems to have gotten an internship recently. I contacted them later and mentioned how I dropped out. I know they almost definitely didn't look down on me for that, any conversation with them brought me shame for lagging behind so much. A and B I had known for a while so even if it was hard to talk to them, I didn't cut off ties. The same day I first messaged E, she asked me if I wanted to come to a nearby local game store for a one-shot of D&D. I agreed, but I couldn't enjoy roleplaying with people I've never met before, especially if everyone there seemed to know each other. Me and A have roleplayed before, but we've known each other all our lives and know what's okay. In a group of strangers, I don't what's acceptable so I took a backseat. E and a few others went out after the store closed; I was with them for a while but realized there's nothing for me to do there and told them I'm going home.

It's been more than two years since then. I don't have any usable skills, so I applied for just about any minimum wage job, and went to several dozen job interviews. A bit over an year ago I found a job, which I left in two weeks because I couldn't handle it. Went to several more interviews and lied I hadn't worked before - I figured leaving a job after two weeks would make me look more unreliable than having not worked at all. Soon I found my current job. I have become competent at it (not that it means much) and I have saved up. I still don't know where I'm going after this. I believe online courses are the way to go, because they are less of a commitment than college, but I lack the discipline even for that. I do feel lonely. A and B have their own issues and I don't want to bother them unnecessarily. It's too late to contact D or E again. I don't want to try to find C. Practically friendless and without ambitions isn't a place where anyone wants to hang out with you."
12nd9b4,3,2023-04-15,How do I get into Data Engineering as a FRESHER?,Psg303,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/12nd9b4/how_do_i_get_into_data_engineering_as_a_fresher/,"***Background:***

Hi! I'm a 3rd-year undergrad currently doing my BTech in AI at a tier 3 college and a remote degree in Data Science & Applications at IIT Madras. Last year I worked as a Google Summer of Code candidate for an open-source Music Database organization, where, as a data engineer I was responsible for cleaning some 600GBs of time-series data, giving me some experience in Python, SQL, Data Visualization/Dashboarding, Analytics, etc.

***Current Situation:***

I would really love to continue in this field, but it has been rather hard finding opportunities in this domain as a fresher🥲. There are little to no internship postings on Linkedin, and jobs generally require at least 2 years of experience... I have seen a few folks getting into companies like Razorpay and Flipkart right after graduation, but I believe most of them were on-campus placements, and I don't think my college would be able to provide such opportunities AT ALL.

Plus, all the job postings, even for freshers seem to be posting requirements for a really wide variety of technologies, and that just adds insult to injury, because even though I have been able to get some basics and some experience going, there still seems a lot to be done in a short period of time. 🥲🥲

Any advice would be really appreciated!"

What I mean by that is most of the time it’s 90% men and 10% women in the average IT department, at least from my experience (currently a User Support Analyst in the oil and gas industry) as well as what I see and read online from others.

I find this notion very frustrating and discouraging as I have a girlfriend who’s been trying to find an entry level role in IT but has been having a hard time. We feel like a part of it could be because of her gender?

She has a bachelors degree, an IT internship, and is currently in grad school for cyber security. I believe that should be more than enough to land an entry level role in IT. 

It is also discouraging when a lot of these helpdesk job descriptions list “must be able to lift 40+ pounds” and other criteria’s that points toward their desirable candidate being a male. 

Maybe we’re reading too deep into it, but are there anyone women in here that could give some tips/advice or chime in some thoughts about this or how to navigate through IT as a women in a male dominated profession?

Everyone is welcomed to respond.

TDLR: My girlfriend has been having a hard time finding an entry level role in IT despite having sufficient credentials and believe a part of it could be or is due to IT being a male dominated profession. Looking for advice."

I thought junior year was the year that all these companies give you a shot but that wasn’t the case. 

Companies like apple, google, tesla ,hft, etc  never contacted me(some even with referrals). 

I know there were the layoffs and hiring freezes but I see a good amount of people on this sub getting offers from those same companies which didn’t even email me back. 

I go to a T5 school and had two internships prior(none high tier but I did meaningful work). I’ve had my resume looked at by a lot of people at those companies as well so I don’t think that’s the issue. 

I ended up getting a good internship(in my eyes at least) so I am not pissed about it but I was just curious what it takes to even get into the door with these places. 

Especially since next year I recruit for new grad, I want to see if there’s something I’m missing because I always wanted to see if I could pass those interviews. 

Will this summers internship change my chances or do I need to do something else."

Hello [r/gradadmissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions)

I am an international student and I was really worried about the current job market in tech, and I think I may not get a full time job offer after I complete my summer internship. So now I am looking to apply to grad schools for the Spring 2024 semester (I will graduate in Fall 2023). I am interested in doing a MS CS (with a Machine Learning specialisation).

I have picked the following schools to apply to and was wondering if I had a good chance of getting into them or am I just being too ambitious and I should apply to other schools instead. (I'm also applying to my current university as safety)

&#x200B;

1. Columbia University
2. University of Southern California
3. University of Massachusetts Amherst
4. Purdue University

Stats/Profile

Undergrad GPA: 3.50/4.00 (Computer Science GPA: 3.77). This is my GPA so far, I still have to finish my current semester and another one after this but my GPA is not likely to drop from here. Currently I am studying at an average State school in the U.S (Ranked in Top 100 US news)

Work Experience: 2x FAANG Internships (including the one I will do in summer), and some experience with student programming jobs at my University

Research Experience: None

LORs: I will try to get some good LORs from my previous managers and also from one professor at my university that I know well.

GRE: Haven't taken it. (I'm only picking schools which don't state GRE as a requirement)

IELTS: 8.0/9.0 (when I took it for my undergrad, but I'm guessing I will get a waiver as I studied in the U.S)

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

1. Rice (5/10): there isn't a reason for this low ranking other than I didn't connect with my senior interviewer as much as I should have, and it was very short if I remember correctly.
2. Middlebury (8/10): I love my interviewer for Middlebury! He was so chill and down to earth. The interview only lasted about 15 minutes, and he asked simple questions and looked very engaged in what I was saying. 
3. Princeton (3/10): This in-person interview lasted 3 hours. I felt she spoke longer than I did, and we weren't interested in the same subjects. I wanted to leave during this entire interview!
4. Yale (8/10): I loved my interviewer! He was a native of Florida that explained the transition from the South to the North and told me his story about choosing a college to attend (why he picked Yale). He was someone I would like to work with in the future. 
5. Stanford (9/10): This was my last and best interview. We bonded by our connection of being black in the South, and he sent me a link to apply to an internship he did as an undergrad. 
6. Claremont McKenna (6/10): My interviewer was a current student that scheduled the meeting very early on a weekday. The low ranking was due to my nerves and stuttering throughout the interview. I made up a few words and went with it. 
7. Bowdoin (10/10): I felt this in-person interview went extremely well. My interviewer made sure there were no judgments or awkward moments between us. She was intrigued by my academic interests and said Bowdoin would be the best place for me to pursue them. 
8. Harvey Mudd (7/10): My interviewer seemed pretty cool and reassured me that the academics are hard but doable. He was impressed with my personal story and felt I was a perfect fit for Mudd. 
9. Smith (N/A): signed up for the interview but overslept and missed it

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

* Personal essay (7/10): My personal essay is very intimate, so I'll broadly explain the topic. I spoke about my weight loss journey during high school, which caused many mental blocks and setbacks. I overcame these setbacks and am currently advocating for health and wellness education in my community. 
* Supplements (5/10 - 9/10): I wrote each of my supplements in less than 3 hours, which I do not recommend! It was the most I have written in my entire life, and I went many nights without sleep. At the end of college app season, I started to reuse essay topics because I started feeling burnt out. I do not regret any supplements I wrote or the number of schools I applied to. 
* Video Supplements (WashU, UChicago, Bowdoin, Claremont McKenna): Each school listed had an optional video supplement or component to their application. For WashU, I spoke about my love for jigsaw puzzles and how each puzzle in my collection correlates to a part of my personality. I did a night routine video for UChicago to review a few important parts of my night routine. For Bowdoin, I explained how my grandma is someone I would love to have dinner with again one more time. For Claremont McKenna, I talked about a local health-based program where I teach appropriate health and fitness to students.

12nnuxw,1,2023-04-15,Graduating with no internship,thegreatMTG,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12nnuxw/graduating_with_no_internship/,"Hello, As a freshman in college, I am concerned about the prospect of graduating without having completed an internship, so I am looking to prepare for this possibility in advance. Currently, my resume only includes a research job that I will be undertaking this summer, membership in a computer science club, and a few class projects. While I intend to work on additional projects over the summer and apply for internships, I am aware that there are no guarantees. It's important to note that my GPA is around 3.1, which is not particularly high.

Basically my question is in the event that my GPA stays the same and I graduate without an internship, am I screwed? How long would it normally take for a new grad to get a job with no prior experience (but assuming that they have projects)"

In the context on my internship in cartography, I must to collect data field in order to complete a project on QGIS. However, I have just a windows 10 tablet (HP pro Tablet 408).

And Qfield is only on android. I try the windows version but my tablet doesn't open this. I tried also Input but it doesn't open too.

So, I wanted to try Intramaps Roam but I don't know how to import my QGIS project data (from my PC in my tablet). So, if you have a solution, I would like to hear this.

Therefore, I ran out of idea. Have a software for data field collection which use QGIS and could be used on my (maybe bad) windows tablet?

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: I tried to run QGIS on my tablet and it's not possible (no required config)"

I know the college application process begins when you're a senior, and they look at your junior year the most out of all grades, but I am very stressed.

So far in my high school career, I haven't really done anything, and it is bugging me. None of the ECs my school provides interest me, especially ones like debate since I am bad at public speaking, and clubs like anime or robotics really do not spark my interest. Also, I am not sporty at all, so I don't partake in any sports teams.

I am more interested in art-type extracurriculars, but my school, unfortunately, does not provide any art ECs, and I think it is too late in the year to try and start one.

I know t20s + ivies or whatever look at dedication rather than the number of clubs you're in, and that is what really stressed me out because I feel like I am not doing anything to try and impress these colleges, or even then, I feel like my high school life is pretty dull.

I am thinking of doing a summer job or an internship, but I feel like it will not contribute or be as important to the admission officers, especially since it seems like I pursued my interests over the summer.

The only thing I have done is start a video editing account with 1k+ followers, which unfortunately is left in the dust because I used to edit things I am not interested in (and I don't think this will matter anyway), I am constantly drawing and trying to improve my art, I am in a psychology elective, something I want to pursue in life, and that is overall it.

I have a pretty boring life, so I feel like I will not matter to them. What do you guys think I should try and do to make my high school life more fun and to try and impress college admissions officers?"

I'm a graduating high school senior who recently got accepted into the computer science B.S. programs at both Purdue University Fort Wayne and Southern Methodist University (SMU). I'm having a tough time deciding which school to attend, and I'm hoping to get some insights from the Purdue community to help me make an informed decision.

My dilemma revolves around the possibility of transferring from Purdue Fort Wayne to Purdue's main campus in West Lafayette, which has a highly-ranked computer science program. On the other hand, SMU is also a reputable institution with a good computer science program, but I'm leaning more towards Purdue's main campus due to its strong reputation in the field.

I have a few questions for current students, alumni, or anyone familiar with Purdue's computer science program and the transfer process:

How difficult is it to transfer from Purdue Fort Wayne to the main campus in West Lafayette for a computer science major? What are the typical GPA and course requirements?
How has your experience been with the computer science program at Purdue's main campus? Are there ample research and internship opportunities available to students?
How would you describe the overall campus life and environment at Purdue's main campus? What do you like the most and the least about the university?
Are there any unique aspects of Purdue's main campus computer science program that you believe would make it a better choice over SMU?
Any advice, insights, or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated. I'm really trying to weigh the pros and cons of each option, and your input will be invaluable in helping me make this important decision.

Thank you in advance!

TL;DR: Accepted into Purdue Fort Wayne & SMU CS programs. Seeking advice on transfer to Purdue main campus and comparisons of CS programs/campus life."

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

Computer Science Teacher: (10/10) Very close, let me explore my own interests and work on projects during class. Helped me get my first internship since one of founding members were one of his college friends. One of the best teachers I've ever had fr

IB Theory of Knowledge Teacher: (8/10) One of my favorite classes throughout high school (kinda like philosophy). Was relatively close to him, talked about AI, stocks, but a lot of other people also asked for recommendation from him.

Principal - (9/10) First met with her to arrange venue situation at school gym for one of my WCA competitions. Also liked my teachers app enough to purchase for entire staff.

Piano teacher - (10/10) Providing training since early childhood, showed incredible patience and helped me win multiple awards in international and state level piano competitions. Was like a second parent to me and always supported me in pursuing my passion for music.

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

MIT (8/10) - was 3 hours long 💀. Interviewer was pretty nice but a bit shy. Was interested in my coding projects especially some of the stuff I was working on during winter break post-college apps.

Princeton (10/10) - Interviewer was a former dean of education (not Princeton) so he was especially invested in my app aiding teachers bc of his background. Wanted to keep in touch regarding development of the app helped connect me to his former collegues. Also helped promote the app among his friends who currently serve at multiple other universities

Harvard (9/10) - Really enjoyed this one, was very insightful, split into 3 sessions. Bro told stories about his time serving in Berlin during the Cold War 😭. We were both interested in music and he asked me to play during my interview. Since he was a Harvard MBA, I asked questions about business tips for my company regarding marketing and financial management.

**Essays**

**UC PIQs:** First essays I worked on other than a summer Common App Personal Statement I later scrapped. These were the essays I spent the most time on. Really tried to write about uncommon connections like I used coding as a tool to overcome psycological barriers in speedcubing. Went through weeks of editing and revising, everyone who I showed thought UCLA and Berkeley were in the bag

**Common App Personal Statement (PS):** Talked about my childhood love for lego and immersing myself into fantastical worlds. And how I continued that love for lego through programming, creating and sharing new ""worlds"" and experiences through my projects. My old summer PS was really unpersonal so I scrapped it 1 week before Stanford was due.

**Stanford:** Realized I had 1 week after UCs were due to turn in Stanford cuz I wanted to do the music portfolio. Shaved at least 5 years off my lifespan 😭. During those 7 days, I spent a lot of time thinking about what to write about. I tried to be as bold as possible in my short responses (50 words) and *slathered* the intellectual vitality in my short essays. Like my roommate essay was written around my love for learning about the One Piece world.

**Princeton:** Spent a lot of time on this one. Most of the prompts made it so I couldn't reuse and I think wrote a really holistic set of essays that highlighted different parts of me. Some of the short responses I wrote here were my favorite throughout the entirety of my application journey.

**MIT:** Reused a lot of my essays on this one, with most of the short essays being about food (i was really hungry when i was working on it 💀). Not my best work, and literally forgot to turn in Makers Portfolio bruh

**Others:** Recycled essays with small edits

&#x200B;

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

All RD bc bro loves procrasinating

* UCR:>!Accepted with Regents 40k (10k per year)!<
* UCI: >!Accepted with Regents 10k (2.5k per year)!<
* UCSD: >!Accepted but undeclared (rejected from CS and CE)!<
* UCLA: >!Waitlisted. This got me kinda scared cuz a lot of the upperclassemen from my school got into CS!<
* MIT:>! Rejected - Expected didn't even turn in the makers portfolio!<
* Carnegie Mellon (SCS): >!Rejected. This one hurt, I really thought CMU would was my best bet at the privates, but not even a waitlist!<
* Cal UC Berkeley (MET/EECS): >!Deferred (Rejected from MET) -> Waitlisted. Going into college apps I was expecting rejections from all privates and finally committing at Berkeley EECS or UCLA. This one really hurt, especially with all of my Cal and UCLA friends hyping me up about my essays!<
* Harvard: >!Rejected - rip!<
* Princeton: >!Rejected. All hope was lost, all the effort I put into my Pton essays, I was really hoping for at least a waitlist in this bloodbath. Ready to commit to UCI, Go Anteaters!!!<
* Stanford: >!ACCEPTED AND COMMITTED - WTF i gave up on Stanford after no interview, even though most of my friends in the area got one, and getting email GHOSTED, zero emails from November to April. !<

&#x200B;

**Additional Information:**

I've never done anything *for college* and I really think any high school students reading this try to find their own passions and hobbies instead of the ones that'll ""get them into a good school"". While I agree that you need a spike in your application to succeed, the best way to achieve that is to follow your interests and dedicate yourself to them, even after you get into your dream school. So go out there and find what makes you come alive - the rest will follow!

(It's a long one),circlingsquares20,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/12nx4a5/shit_that_happened_to_me_in_the_last_year_of_my/,"I do not know where to put all this stuff so I'm putting it on display to an online community. Here we go. So I have a best friend we are friends from 8th standard, our lives were so tangled, we do not do anything without telling each other and we always share everything and anything. In out relationship, I am the mentally depressed/anxious or let's say mentally ill one. Cuz when I got into degree I have had two realizations 1. I am into girls 2. I have ADHD. These two things made me more depressed, lonely, confused, frustrated. I think these words doesn't do justice to the shit that I went through. Anyways, so I am figuring stuff out and seeking online help (lets face it south Asian especially Indian household or society never really helped with being queer and mentally ill). She has always supported in my depressive episodes, when I was down which happened frequently. So our relationship has become like some sort of giver-taker thing, where she's always the giving and problem fixing one and I was always the taker and problem causing one. After some time, I have found some queer people online and to my surprise ADHD'ers too but all this while I never really thought about how my friend felt of me seeking online friendships and getting close to them. I thought I have finally found my kind of people, I thought she's happy for me but I think that made her feel like not enough for me. Which is true because we're becoming more different and different and it's okay, I've searched for people who are a lot like me and wanted to just not feel alone. All this while, I would have this fixation like I have to live up to her or something cuz she always tried to fix me and pushed me up to do things and now I think of it, I didn't really like the fixing part and pushing part. I would always think of what she would think me if I do this or do that like I have to impress or score some good points from her which made me feel like I am not living for myself and that became such a weight on me. All these repressed feelings didn't help our relationship. In the last year I thought I fell for her boyfriend who used to be my close friend that brought a wedge in our friendship. She wanted to care for me at those times too cuz she didn't want to lose me and I for those exact reasons didn't communicate properly and got close to my online friends. I was still trying to figure out my feelings but she wanted me to tell about my feelings to him cuz I was acting all weird and pushing my friend away. She talked about how she felt bad of me pushing her away and how this secret is weighing on her so she pursued me into confessing to him and I didn't want to make her feel bad for carrying the secret. Thus, me confessing my feelings to him brought a cyclone in the our lives (his, her and mine). Things became more complicated and dire. We were all waling on egg shells. We were adjusting and all but suddenly my friend's father died, I was with her from morning till evening but I had to go to another city (it's a college trip) which made me miserable and it's even miserable for her. I left her like that I am still not over that guilt. More than my departure she was mad about the phone call that I made before going to the trip. I asked her should I go or should I stay. She didn't really said much about it at that time but a few days back we were talking about what went down between us so she said I wouldn't do that if I were you. Anyways, we were apart for 4 days and those are the saddest four days of my life. After returning I can feel something's changed between us like something big has changed. It was a hostile environment. She didn't really cut me off but she also didn't really talked to me about any of that. After we went to our internships, our whole friend group went to one institution and I was doing internship elsewhere. For three months I visited them out of sheer friendship feeling but there was always this hostile environment, she was passive aggressive, this whole environment made me much distanced from the whole group and they became really good friends. I became really lonely because these are really some big changes in my life. In those three months I got to know myself a little better, I also learnt why did I leave my best friend like that.  It's rooted in my childhood (when is it not). Anyways, I ran from her cuz I couldn't handle all those emotions,  When I went to talk to her about us she talked down on me, in a condescending manner(now that I think of it she talked to me like for a long time) and she made some point like I was so low on the graph or something which made me feel like am I still living for her points!!!  She also accused me of me just giving up on people and said that I leave people. Which made me question a lot of things but later I realized I didn't leave a single person. People have left me. I am okay with people leaving me cuz you do not have to be with the people that do not want you or doesn't add value to your life or simply make your life more complicated or takes away your peace. Then I learned something about myself is that I draw boundaries, I didn't know when it has began but I keep people that are misogynistic/homophobic/racist/uses trauma against me/uses trauma as excuse away even when I was close to them at some point in my life (think the more gay I become the more I learn about how to create a safe environment for me). Anyways, I left her when she needed me the most so she created a hostile environment which made me miserable. We both have hurt each other in more than one way. Today I have the grandest realization that my friend and I were in a codependent relationship, which made our relationship all the more toxic and didn't give much individual space cuz our lives are so tangled. We didn't have any boundaries. She always tried to fix me (which I didn't like) and I always felt like a loser.  After this I started losing friends too which are not my fault I have cried over them but they made their judgement and I have seen people for who they really are.

After all this, I learnt about relationships, I learnt how to draw healthy boundaries, I learnt what kind of people I want in my life, I am not entitled to the un-comfortability they feel of my boundaries because their behavior made me set a boundary in the first place . I learnt about gaslighting, I've learned to listen to my emotions, and I do not always have to talk to people because they need the urge to fix the situation or something. I am also trying to be less of a people-pleaser and yes, saying no when I absolutely need to. I am giving myself time, space, exploring my skills (loneliness does this don't worry).

Would like some suggestions to make the decision soon for others in need to join the school they desire.

My profile: International Student, Mechanical Engineering undergrad at top 4 university, GPA 2.92, 1 internship, no publication or paper, multiple competition (including mechanical and software)

I have listed some pros and cons from my perspective below.

**ASU**

pros

1. I like the location because it is closer to Cali which offers more jobs and internship opportunities. (from what I known, let me know if I am wrong plz)
2. The program is more related to Artificial Intelligence field which I have interest in. (been doing a lot of related work lately)

cons

1. This program is located at Polytechnic school, an hour away from the main Tempe campus.
2. More expensive for living and tuition. (however, not the main concern here as it doesn't differ much)
3. Lower overall ranking  (according to US news)

&#x200B;

**UF**

pros

1. Better overall ranking (according to US news)
2. ME is one of the biggest department in UF
3. Cheaper living expense (however, not the main concern here as it doesn't differ much)

cons

1. Located almost middle of no where (lower internship and career possibility?)
2. Not so much related to Artificial Intelligence (been doing a lot of related work lately)

I was admitted as an intl student for undeclared eng at LA and mechanical at Gatech and am really struggling to decide which would be best for me. Some things about me:

\- I want to work in predominantly startups in the energy/clean tech space for internships during college/jobs in early career, and go deep into the entrepreneurship opportunities at the school I attend because starting a company is what I ultimately want to do. 

\- I want an engineering curriculum that has a lot of applications embedded in it, but regardless I'll be heavily involved with a design team and internships in the summer to make sure I have the practical skills I need

\- Cost is not really a factor for me—I'm privileged to have parents who have saved up to be able to pay full costs for either school and in fact dont want me to think of that as a limiting factor. 

\-  Aside from the impact of being either in LA or Atlanta on my career and extracurricular opportunities, location isn't a factor. Obviously westwood/ucla campus is probably way better, but I don't want to make a decision based on that. 

\- I definitely want to have a healthy social life, but I don't need to be going to parties every week

Do you guys have any opinions on which I should attend in the fall? 

P.s im putting this on the Gtech subreddit to get both sides"

In that old system, there is an AuthenticationController class which has this responsibilities:

1. Map the URL path to the correct handler method
2. Checking all input fields in the request are correctly filled
3. Checking the username is available
4. Returning error messages in case the request contains error

The one point that stands out to me here is about checking if the username is available, this sounds as business logic to me, so I think it should be in the UserService class (Domain Service layer) instead. So I ask this question so I can read how can I know which responsibilities should live in which of both layers."

For context, I have skills, a GitHub profile, a double Bachelor’s in CS and Bioinformatics from UCSC as well as a Master’s in Bioinformatics from Boston University but also a failed previous analyst position I got into soon after my Master’s during the start of COVID - they wanted someone who could work independently and completely remotely, which I couldn’t at the time - followed by a successful temporary/ internship one where I have people that could recommend me. I also have long periods of unemployment because of that, which is what I’m really worried about. I haven’t had much luck finding work this year, despite regular interviews, when my co-graduates are successfully employed and have been for a while and people who I see from profiles posted on graduate school websites already have successful publication records from their undergraduate and Master’s degrees, whereas while I contributed to some work while at my temporary position those papers have not been published yet.

What does a typical student in a mid tier PhD program look like? Do I have any chance of getting into a decent one despite my unemployment?"

12o6w4v,2,2023-04-16,Is this a toxic work environment?,Gaming_Undertaker,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/12o6w4v/is_this_a_toxic_work_environment/,"Hello! I’ve been in the funeral business now for 10 years. I’ve been burnt out for at least the last 3 years, and was about to leave the business when this particular job opportunity presented itself. 

This was a last ditch effort to stay in the business, because the position offered a lower call volume, which would seemingly offer less stress. Everyone at the funeral home has young kids, so I thought they would understand the need to get work done and get home. They don’t.

But, more to the meat and potatoes of my question. 

When I started, I was told that we do not up-sell people, they tell us how they want in order to celebrate the life of their loved one and then we fit them in to one of 10 packages that we offer. 

I was also told that the other director and I would share the family load equally. 

I was told that they have their way of doing things, but would welcome new ideas and perspectives (because literally no one else had worked in any other funeral home). They most certainly do not.

These last two months have been hell at work. Of the 11 families we served in March, I met with 10 of them. Of the 20 evening visitations we’ve had since January, I have worked 18 of them. My sleep quality has plummeted and my anxiety has flown through the roof.

My manager has turned from being super supportive to being a super micromanager who does not pass along any positive comments. Like zero. Only small inconsequential critiques. Nothing is good or perfect, unless he does it.

For example, we have a policy that everyone reads every thank you note and survey that is sent in to the funeral home. We had two thank you notes that came in this last week both of which were directed to me and did not let any of us look at them. Instead he came to me and said “you notice anything wrong with this note? It’s missing our logo on the back. You need to print these with our logo.” 

Never mind the fact that I actually didn’t print them, it was one of our interns.

I asked “oh, who’s it from?” He told me the family name. “What did the note say?”, I asked, “just a thank you note to the staff.”

I have a high family satisfaction rate. In my 10 year career, I have only received 4 bad reviews (all situations out of my control). I’m very good at what I do. It has just become too much as of late.

Fast forward to Friday, I was called into the office and said that I was selling families the wrong package. We needed the more expensive packages to be selected. Mind you, he was talking about a discount package that we offer that does not include a lot of whistles and bells…because the families I put into that package did NOT want the other items. So he wants me to sell families the package that ends up costing families about $5000 more for stuff they don’t want. Ethically, this doesn’t sit well with me. Up selling funerals never has.

He’s recently taken over operations, and from what I gathered has placed the business in a very bad financial pickle. To the point that the last two pay periods were met with comments like “Oh thank goodness, we’ll make payroll.” Or “oh, we can eat this week!” After handing over a check from a family.

I’ve been keeping my ear open for opportunities outside the funeral home for awhile now, but these last two months have sealed the deal. The problem is that I relocated to take this position, and of course I have an obligation to provide for my own family. 

I just need to know if I’m being overly dramatic or if this is truly a bad environment to be in."
12o899f,2,2023-04-16,Looking for a change but where/how? What would YOU do?,some_french_guy2112,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/12o899f/looking_for_a_change_but_wherehow_what_would_you/,"TLDR: I am a 30 years old dude with almost half a BA in French and History from like 10 or so years back. I am looking to change jobs from being a letter carrier for Canada Post but I have no idea where or what to do? Do I go back to school and set my finances back many years? Are there any professional certifications that I could obtain without having to stop working? Most importantly I would like any advice. What would YOU do in this situation?

I have been working at Canada Post for almost 7 years now and I am 2 years away from the top wage for a letter carrier (around 30$/ hour) but I really need a change of career for many reasons:

I am sweaty and frozen pretty much every single day. I have tried pretty much everything and I have consulted many doctors and unfortunately, nothing really helps. I guess I'm simply a sweaty guy lol. Plus we are about to undergo a “restructure” which means my route will get longer. I am already having a tough enough time getting through my route as it is, and I’m not sure how I would be able to manage having a longer route with this sweating issue. Mind you, in the summer the sweating is not an issue but the other 8 or so months out of the year it makes my job harder than it has to be. Also I’ve asked around and no other letter carrier in my office has this issue. Finally, I could potentially go on short term disability for like half the year but taking a third off of my already “meh” pay is just not feasible. Side note, but after the restructure, I might have to option of doing some overtime, which would help with making more money to buy a house but I don’t think I have it in me to work longer hours while in sweaty and cold. It’s just waaaay too taxing.

Like I stated above, the job does not, and will not pay me enough to afford a house. Unless house prices drop like 40% and if my union is finally able to negotiate an actual pay raise (Entitled millennial again lol)

The future outlook for Canada Post does not seem positive at all and I really don’t want to stick around.  

So where do I go from here? I have a bad feeling that recruiters or anybody in charge of hiring will not necessarily look positively upon having Canada Post on a resume. ( or at least any non-management position). Worst part is that I really feel like I have gained zero skills and zero useful experience working for Canada Post. Really feels like the last seven years were a waste but my best option is to just stay because a I really don’t want to go though another “fresh start” and start at zero again. At the same time, I really think a change would be the best option in the long term and probably even in the short term because jeeeeesus I am sick of Canada Post lol!

As far as what interests me I don’t know! In the last few months I’ve looked at many jobs, whether in the trades or IT or anything/anywhere else but right now nothing is really catching my eye. More so, I’m hesitant to jump into anything because I do not want to end up in a similar situation that I am in now. I'm pretty much ready to consider anything at this point lol!

My main “headspace” now though is: I know I’m not going to be someone who is in love with their job, but I’d like something that pays me enough to not care that I’m not loving my job. Or at the very least something that nets me some sort of satisfaction along with enough money to afford a house. This might still be the entitled millennial talking though lol! Not once have I felt pride or any real sort of satisfaction in my current job. I really just feel like I’m just carrying more crap so my bosses can make more money off of my labour ( Jeeeze this guy is entitled! lol)

Some possible scenarios I’ve though up:

Whilst working, obtain some COMPTIA certifications and work my way towards a systems admin (or related position). Start off doing some kind of entry level support and hopefully work up towards “real” job. I don’t really think I have the brain to actually learn coding well enough to make a career out of it but the few tutorials I have done I actually enjoyed doing. Another option would be a distance/online degree in computer science or something related. Athabasca U seems to have a good program plus it is self paced so I could blow through it as fast as I can.  

Accept hurting my finances for a bit, move down south in Ontario and get some pre apprenticeship training and hope that I can get an apprenticeship. Considering the electrical trades. You get to use your brain a bit, its physical and you could get to work in a variety of locations. Plus, with some overtime you can make some really nice money. Also, I think playing a part in the building or maintenance of things would be something I would enjoy.

Power engineering / Stationary engineering. What I like about this idea is the progression from 4th to 1st class. At the start it seems like you are more “in the thick of it” with the maintenance and operation of the equipment but as you progress to the higher tickets, you get payed more and you take on more of a managerial role. For this one, I would need to go to college as far as I know. I’ve looked into taking an online class from Alberta but I don’t think that would help me here in Ontario. The plan was to pass the course, hopefully pass the certification exam and then try to convince an employer to either give me a job or let me do the boiler time as an internship and hopefully use that to get an actual job. Once hired, study for the 3rd class and so on!

Try to get some kind of job in a mine/forestry as a labourer and just go from there? Maybe once my foot is in the door/ I’m actually employed, work hard and “prove myself” and a better position might find its way to me? Or at least I would be exposed to other jobs and that might lead me somewhere? Like an apprenticeship might also be a possibility from this scenario.

I was looking at certifications from the Canadian Securities institute. So the plan here would be to study after work, and eventually obtain certifications and then work for a bank or somewhere in finance. Although this might be worthless without first having a BA or an MBA in a related field first. Also, I’m not sure I would enjoy working for a bank or a financial firm but it’s still something I’ve been looking into.

Non Destructive Testing is another random thing I came across but if I recall correctly, most jobs want a BA on top of certifications so I don’t know here.

Train Conducting to eventually Train engineer. Apparently, CP and CN and all the rail companies are always hiring so getting in might be “easy” but my god, the job sounds difficult. BUT the potential 100k+ per year sounds nice once you get to be the engineer. I don’t have a wife or kids or family really so being away from home is no big deal for now. Down the line being away from home might be an issue. For example, I just missed out on a VIA RAIL program that would train you from zero experience to an engineer in 2 years. I was really interested in that one but alas I was a bit late.

Another possibility is to finish my sort of half of a BA and go into teaching as that was my initial plan out of high school. Another possibility would be to us that half of a degree as electives and major in something else but uggghhhhhh I’d rather not get back into student loan debt and make zero money for the next few years.

Really random this one but I saw postings for import/export brokers but after spending some time in the subreddit, I really don’t think this would be for me. Sounds like a ton of stressful work with minimal pay for a long time until you start your own shop and poach clients from your former workplace. And sounds like clients are always a pain to deal with.  

Currently, I have an application with Purolator and I am awaiting a response. The idea here is that it would be a relatively easy transition and working potentially longer hours would be easier when I get to be in the truck between deliveries instead of on foot. Also, I’m pretty sure the wages at purolator are higher than Canada Post. I was able to find the collective agreement that expired in 2016 and the top wage for a courier back then is a few cents less than the current top wage at Canada Post for a letter carrier! Also with purolator being a profitable company, long term this might be a safer bet than Canada Post.

A final option I was considering is trying to get some kind of management promotion/ transfer with Canada Post. This could also be a possibility with purolator. The problem with that, at least with Canada Post, is that I first have to transfer unions and sacrifice my seniority and take a huge pay cut. Like 22$ / Hour to manage a post office and the top wage, from what I can find is only like 2$ more than the letter carrier rate so maybe not really worth the extra work. Also, this type of job would necessitate a relocation, so would the potential higher wage be wiped out by the higher cost of housing?  Also, taking on that kind of position is necessary to move up to the higher paying management roles but at that point, an MBA or whatever really helps. From what I saw, the wages with purolator are once again higher, but I do not know if the process is as complicated as it is with Canada Post. Finally, I’m not really sure I would enjoy such a position but it’s a possibility at least!

So anyways, any advice whether general or specific is appreciated! If you want to share your life story, or rag on me for being an entitled millennial or whatever, then go ahead! Lol!  

Thanks for the responses!"

I'm about to finish my software engineering degree, but networking has been tough. I meet some engineers who I think are friends, but when I want to talk more about the field or grab coffee, they say they're busy. They don't seem too interested in talking to a junior like me.

The age group is in my age group (under 32) in Indianapolis.

I've applied for 150 jobs and every internship in my city, but haven't had any interviews for an SE position in the past 7 months. Some senior devs have checked my resume and said it's good, plus I have freelance experience. I can code in multiple languages and work with various back-end and front-end frameworks, primarily C# and Java. I also studied UI/UX and love designing websites. I currently work 80-90 hours a week doing DoorDash, making only $13 an hour. I was hoping to get a $20/hr software engineering job to give my wife and son a better life.

I have spent 11 years working as an Aircraft Mechanic and I've always been interested in pursuing a IT/Cyber career. I have no work experience when it comes to the IT/Cyber field, but I have a Bachelor's in IT with Cybersecurity focus. I am also studying to get my Sec+ cert so that I can at least put something cyber-related into my resume. I have a lot of management skills from my current job, but nothing cyber-related. I feel like my path to this career field is jumbled because I have no idea where to start. I enjoyed messing with Kali Linux for vulnerability detection and more, and I also enjoyed setting up Windows Server 2022 and messing with Cisco Packet Tracer to configure my network. The PM side of the house was also something that I enjoyed doing in school, creating a project proposal, messing with MS Project, assessing risks, making/creating policies, etc. My current plan is to get my Sec+ within 60 days, then possibly get PMP if I want to pursue a PM position, before starting my internship in the IT/Cyber career field.

I guess my main concern is should I be pursuing A+ or Net+ first before my Sec+? Should I wait to get those certs until I have some strong foundations based on work experience I'll get through internships?

This is uncharted territory for me that I have no idea which way I'm supposed to or want to go. If any of you can provide me some guidance or suggestion, I would greatly appreciate it.

EDIT: I am currently self-studying using The Official CompTIA Sec+ Study Guide (Exam SY0-601) and going through Mike Chapple's LinkedIn Learning for Security+ Exam Prep."

If you are currently studying in 12th standard If you are a 12th pass out, You or your parents might have heard of this program, and might have searched for some questions like; Is HCL Techbee a scam ? Is HCL Techbee good for the future ? HCL Techbee or Btech ? Should I join HCL Techbee after 12th ?.

Well, for your own good, PLEASE DO NOT JOIN THIS PROGRAM. I'm telling this from my own experience and from my bottom of my heart, DO NOT RUIN YOUR LIFE BY JOINING THIS GODFORSAKEN PROGRAM.

This is going to be a long post(Please fully read it). And I will convey how this program works with every single detail that you need to know and I will convince you not to join. (PERSONAL STORY AT THE END)

These GREEDY Corporations don't care about you or your life. They just want to make money by using you. This program is the prime example of that, made by some middle aged fools with midlife crisis, who wants to take out their frustrations on you by dragging you through this hell, and making a profit out of it on the way. These cunning rascals will promise you many big things, but you will only realize that they were too good to be true once they make you sign twisted agreements with many strings attached. If you join this program there is no backing out without losing all your money, and the agreements and bonds will make sure that you stay with this company for 7yrs. If any medical issues arise or if you want to drop out of this program, your money along with the years you spent will be gone. They will not give you any certifications or anything if you back out, and they surely will not give you any leave for any medical issues. Broke your leg and can't come to office? Well, too bad, they will make sure that you exit from this program, by making it your fault.

If you have money to spare and years to waste, go for it.

Then comes Stipend that they promised, NO they will not give you STIPEND in the training period, They will only give it to you after you complete the most challenging exam that the tutors who teach don't even know the answers for. They deliberately do this to make sure you lose the exams to scam you out of your money. Again, by making it your fault. So the only way to pass is to cheat by using the questions from senior batches that circulate around the WhatsApp groups. Its even worse if you have nobody to send you these questions. Lets say you pass this exam, they will give you 9000 per month(sometimes 6000) (never will they pay you 10k) and ""this so-called stipend is your money that you pay when you join the program as fee"" (Rs. 1,18,000) and will give it to you each month after tax. ( How's that, Pretty Big Brain move right?)

They will also make you do slave labor for cheap so they can earn profit without recruiting graduates, as they have to be paid more. So they use you to do the midnight shifts and shifts at inconvenient timings with the promise of giving you a guaranteed job. You will work for them from Monday to Friday from 9AM to 6PM and in the weekend for 9 hours for your degree course, in which you are left with no time for yourself. Most of the Managers will act as if they own you and act superior, and the ones who acts like this doesn't even have basic communication skills or literacy. Now you might be thinking that why nobody else who joined this program is complaining about these things, Well, let me tell you why, Its because they are scared of losing their ""job"", They are supposed to suck it up and not voice their concerns. These corporations always wins no matter what, you are just a disposable paper cup for them that they can throw away after their use. So its best to just avoid them especially when they make you sign bonds which can be broken if you can pay 2 lacks. (again making money by ripping you off)

PERSONAL STORY

I heard of this program as I was searching for colleges to join, my parents found their advertisement on the newspaper ( they are the easier targets) and told me to take a look into it and said to me that it looks like a great program as I will be guaranteed to get a job after the completion of the program. So I searched on Quora, Reddit, and YouTube. At the time when I was searching, there were not many reviews about it, mostly the reviews were the ones featured on some educational websites (that HCL paid to show their ads for their program, obviously!!!). BUT then I saw some reviews that were some huge RED FLAGS written by the ones who joined the program, and I chose to ignore them and thought to myself that it wouldn't be that bad, as my parents told me that it sounded good. MY. BIG. MISTAKE. I should've listened to those reviews found on Quora and those Comments on YouTube.

So I registered for the program and passed the Entrance Test and the Interview, Which was relatively super easy compared to what was coming next, It was easy because they wanted more people to join, so the questions were simple and the guy who conducted interview didn't care if the answer given by us is right or wrong (As I gave mostly wrong answers). In short, if you register for their program you are basically in. (I don't know if this is applicable nowadays). Then they told me to wait as they were completing my profile. They will ask for a bank account, pan card , Aadhaar card, passport, and many more. They will also make you take pictures of your house and your neighborhood for their Background verification process which is shady AF in my opinion.( I know some companies do it, But it didn't sit well with me.)

For the Next 2 months I was sitting at home doing nothing while my friends joined college.

The classes start online and they made me pay Rs 1,18,000 as fee. They will also give you an option to take a loan for this program through Axis bank. That is also another hidden scamming tactic. They tie up with the bank to give you the loan on exorbitant interest rates. And these so-called sessions starts at 9AM and goes till 6PM (sometimes to 7PM). You will get depression guaranteed. You will have no social life and you will lose out on the college-life (which you will only get once, even if you are an introvert).

(The training program is 1 year. The first 3 months is just classes for basic computer knowledge and the next 3 or 6 months is the ""specialized"" training that depends on what you get. There are some types or branches for the 1st year of training. INFRA, APPS, Linux? and windows are the ones I know. Infra is networking based, they will give you training for 3 months on some CCNA stuff and the internship if for like 6 months. APPS is for 6 months, I think they teach you like many different coding languages and internship is only for 3 months. You don't even get to choose the type that you like. They just choose it for you, depending on the supply they need for the slave labor. Every week there is a stupid quiz to show your parents that they are teaching you well. The ""tutor"" just reads the PowerPoint slides and byhearts the lab exercises, and just shows it to you. The teaching is also very mediocre, The tutor is just there for the money and don't care if you understand the stuff. Basically forcing you cheat for the exams to pass, As the exams are super tough compared to the exam at the time of joining the program, and if you don't pass, your money is poof, gone.

This is where they are successful in scamming you, They want want you to lose on exams after you pay the fee.)

For the next 3 months the training continues.

The Training comes to an end and the exam that determines if your money is gone is here. As always, everyone cheats (no other way around) and pass. Then for the next 3 months we were just sitting at home doing nothing because the said internship was supposed to happen. But nothing happened because there were many students who qualified and they were overwhelmed by that.

After 3 months we were all slowly allocated to a project for training.

If you completed their training period of 1 yr and passed the exam. They will refer you to make you say good words about their program to the unsuspecting candidates who are thinking of joining the program. They will give two options for a degree for you to join. BCA and BSc. And at the time of joining the recruiter may give many false promises about higher studies also. But only after you join this program you will know the truth that YOU have to PAY for the degree courses from YOUR OWN POCKET on top of the fee. I think They will give you some some waiver. But you will have to pay 25k each semester, that too for a distance degree online.

And after 1yr of training they will give you an employee position as a customer support helper and would make you work at inconvenient hours to make the most out of you. Oh and they will pay you 16k or something based on your location, Which are Peanuts compared to the work they make you to do and keep in mind that you have to pay rent if you are from another state and also for the food and all utilities. If you think that 16k is a good amount for an 18yr old, then you are very very wrong, its just not worth it for what you are sacrificing.(read the post again to understand)

In my case I had to ask for some time off because I was diagnosed with a severe infection in my leg, and the doctors advised me to rest and explicitly told me not to travel anywhere and to take a good rest otherwise it would be bad. And you know what these f\*ckers at HCL told me, I'm of no use if I can't come to the office and told me to exit. (YES a manager told me that through a WhatsApp call). I mean, he could've been more professional and less of a bitch. I knew at that moment that I lost 2 years of my life and my money. I asked him a lot to give me some more time to heal, But he didn't. Then another guy from HR told me if I wanted to continue here I need go through the training and pay the fee again.(Basically forcing me to exit on my own, so that they could say that I exited on my own will, and don't have to give my money back. Hence, making it my fault.) Mind you, I completed the training once.

So, Basically, my 2 years of life is down the drain and I don't even have any certification and qualifications. All thanks to this fu\*king program.

So think about it twice and ask yourself again before joining this ripoff program. I would strongly advice you not to join and save yourself and join a college instead, because that's where you will make memories, not here. Here you will only lose your braincells interacting with these posers.

This is my genuine request NOT to join this program. They are ruining the future generations just for their profits.

So please, Share this post to group chats, or to anybody who is planning to join this program.

Comment or DM anything that you want to know and I would be happy to help.

Also please UPVOTE this post so that everyone can be aware of their scummy tactics and so that nobody in the future gets trapped by them"

Personally, I want to be able to have some sort of project to showcase on my resume, but I don't even know what I want to do with a cs degree. Almost all my friends are SDE's, however, I don't think that is something that I want to do. Even if I were to start a project, what is a good project to place on your resume? I am technically expected to land a full-time by next year. So even if I don't get an internship this summer, what would you do if you were in my position where you're expected to find a fulltime by summer 2024, with no prior experience in any jobs related to my major, also no projects to showcase. If possible a timeline would be great."

at what point in your education did you start to understand what programmers do for a job, and how did you decide what career to go into using that information? i want to start looking at internships, but i don't know what i don't know, so it's difficult to know what to learn. please let me know if this doesn't make sense but i'm really hoping some experienced people can share their advice here :)"

I received a job offer than has a decent salary and benefits for an entry level position, with a well-defined role. The only issue is that I know this job isn’t one that I aspire to do long term.

At my current internship, I have concerns over my professional development because the company is smaller and spread across the US, so learning from people may be more difficult than in an office setting. My position would be less defined, but part of the job is what I ultimately want to do with my career. I will talk to my boss about salary and benefits tomorrow but he told me they would pay more than the other offer. I don’t know what to do.

TL;DR:
Job 1: Well defined role, defined plan for my development, decent salary, automatic 10% retirement contribution, 100% tuition assistance, not what I want to do long term

Job 2: Less defined role, less certainty over my professional development, higher salary, has work that I want to do long term

Which job has the better opportunities?"

12oo46l,0,2023-04-16,Starting as a DE intern in a week. Id appreciate some ”what to expect” and tips if have some.,BoSt0nov,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/12oo46l/starting_as_a_de_intern_in_a_week_id_appreciate/,"Hey boys and girls, I was lucky enough to land an intern position as a DE that will be starting in a week or so. As I have limited experience Id like to ask for some basic tips on things I should know and what I could be expecting. 

As I was interviewed I made it clear Ive started my transition (I come from retail) into IT just last October. I have  basic knowledge of Python and I do ok with SQL (which the intern could be quite heavy of. that and Azure). Ive studied almost enough to be able to take on AZ-900, but thats it really as far as cloud goes. Ive uploades couple of programs for assignments I was given for interviwes. Ive used Docker, Github, Jira. Ive played around with Snowflake and Airflow, but am far from experienced.

As far as the intern goes (approx. 6months)I will be under a ”technical consultant” title and will be placed in a team to struggle with smaller tickets. The catch is that the goal of the intern is to prep me and learn enough to be able to get hired in the same company as a junior DE. 

Ive started reading ”Fundamentals of Data engineering” as it appears to be mostly accepted as a good read. I am trying to decide wether I should start the IBM data engineer cert on Coursera or something else. The course seems to cover a lot of interesting topics and thought Id grind through it in a week and go as far as I can get.  One thing im a little anxious about is my Python isnt very strong.

Any tips or suggestions/comments are most welcome! Thank you."
12oos1s,9436,2023-04-16,TIFU by speaking Finnish at work,CavalierRigg,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/12oos1s/tifu_by_speaking_finnish_at_work/,"I work part time as a Security Officer here in the United States while I am getting all my flight school training done. Earlier today in the morning, I was walking around and started chatting with a friend in another department and the conversation drifted from us being Russian speakers, to me having lived in Riga, Latvia for a few months while on an internship abroad, and to having visited Helsinki, Finland for a week during said internship. I was telling her, and her three coworkers who sat around and were joining the conversation, all about how awesome the Finnish people were (shout out to any Finns here! 🇫🇮). I told them about where I stayed in the Leppäsilta area near Helsinki and about how nice many of the people were. I also talked about how different their language sounded, especially for myself and my friend as Russian speakers. While I was there, a local taught me, “Hey, how are you?” Which in Finnish is “Hei, mitä kuuluu!” (Hey, meet-au koo-loo)

This is where I messed up. Apparently, this sounds *incredibly* close to a slur/profanity/despicable word/words in Spanish. One of my friend’s coworkers, let’s call her ‘Maria,’ doesn’t speak English well, Spanish being her primary language. Maria became incredibly offended. Another of her coworkers who was bilingual said I shouldn’t be saying things like that, especially at work, and that I had offended Maria. I stated that I had been speaking Finnish, and I tried to smooth things over, but they all stopped talking to me, now that everything was super awkward. They wouldn’t even explain what I had supposedly said in “Spanish.” Fast forward to 20 minutes ago and I get a text from my boss that I apparently have an HR meeting with him, this other department’s manager, and HR itself because “unknown people” reported me for saying Spanish slurs to other employees. My manager said I could explain everything Monday.

I am upset. I don’t speak Spanish, and I don’t claim to. In the context of the conversation, I was speaking Finnish and I wasn’t even talking to the individual who got offended and now I am in trouble. My friend texted me back and said she will corroborate my story, I am just scared it won’t be enough for my boss/HR.

TL;DR- A phrase in Finnish sounds like a bad word in Spanish, which got me reported to HR.

Edit: Apparently “Kuuluu” in the Finnish greeting here may sound like a vulgar (or not so vulgar, simple curse) of “culo” which means “Ass”. Apparently for some, it means a literal “Asshole” as in, a hole in a bum. Spanish speakers permeate our world, and since the Spanish world is so vast, in some places it is really not something that is considered profane at all, and in other places it appears that it is more “oh, don’t use that at work” BUT still not HR worthy.

Edit 2: There seems to be some confusion about ME, personally, that I want to clear up as I sit here in my shared Security office at work. There are some concerns that I am being discriminated against, but I wanted to put those fears to rest. I am *not* a Finn, and I am not a Russian. I am an American of Danish, French, and German descent. I speak Russian from having lived in Russia for two years and then studying it in University. My internship that my friend and I were talking about was through that schooling, and it involved me working in Riga, Latvia as a translator of a book from Russian to English. During my tenure there of about 3 months, I was able to visit the other Baltic nations (Finland included), Poland, Germany, Italy, and Sweden.

I appreciate you all, I am going to get some water and then I will go to the conference room. Wish me luck!

Edit 3 - The meeting: I just got home from my meeting and started typing this and it took me about an hour. I work weekend days, so to answer a question I got, yes, I had to go to this meeting on my day off. After I got some water earlier, I saw my boss and he made sure that I had clocked in (as we are always paid for company meetings). I told him I had and I went into the conference room in my office and my Manager followed me in and shut the door behind us. I found that there were two women from HR there, the Manager for ‘Maria’ (this is important for the story, but the other Manager is Hispanic), my Manager who is my boss, and my direct Supervisor (who is an ass, I wish he wasn’t there). 

When I sat down, the HR reps introduced themselves and told me that the reason they were there is because they had some ‘troubling concerns about me using inappropriate and *sexually charged* language at work.’ I was then immediately confused, and I asked them to explain the reason for the meeting. They told me that I had been reported by “multiple people” on Sunday for, “Having sexually harassed individuals in Spanish.” I really, really shouldn’t have, but I laughed out loud… this is utter bullshit, I have no idea why anyone would even remotely think that. I asked them to explain what they meant by that, considering that *I DO NOT SPEAK SPANISH*. In another display of malarkey, they deflected my question and asked me about “the incident” which occurred yesterday (on Sunday). I told her I was on patrol as normal, and I went over to this department to make sure everyone was doing well. I stated that I ran into my friend, and we were talking about some international experience I had had while on an internship. I explained that I had lived in Eastern Europe on this internship for 6 months, and that I am a fluent Russian speaker, and that this should be on record. Saying this, I motioned to my Manager, who nodded almost a, “Yep, that’s true,” kinda nod. I explained that I had enjoyed my time there, and that I had learned some phrases, one of which was, “Hi, how are you?” I took someone’s advice here, and I wrote it down on an index card I had at home, to show them what I said. I informed them that they could use Google translate, that they could ask anyone from Finland or anyone who spoke the language that what I was saying was true. I finished by saying that I fail to understand how anyone could take anything that I had been saying as sexual harassment. I also underscored the fact that the only two people I had spoken to in that department that morning was my friend, and ‘Sylvia’ (the bilingual Spanish/English speaker who told me I had offended ‘Maria’ in the story above).

The HR reps looked at eachother, and then to Maria’s Manager, who looked over at me and said, “Well the story that we heard is you said…” and she proceeded to speak in Spanish. I just kinda stared at her, and I asked, “Is that supposed to mean something to me? I already told you that I don’t speak Spanish. How could I have said any of that?” One of the HR reps turned to me saying, “So you do not speak Spanish?”… Reddit, at this point I gotta be honest, I about lost my patience, and I am SUPER glad my Manager spoke up because he just kinda looked at them and said, “Does he need to reiterate? He doesn’t speak Spanish. My Officer doesn’t speak Spanish, nor has it ever come up that he does. I have Officers who speak Spanish, documented on their files. U/CavalierRigg is not one of them. Whatever he is being accused of, are your claims that he spoke fluent Spanish with someone? Because that isn’t feasible.”

One of the HR reps stated that, a complaint they received on Sunday, stated that I had made “sexually explicit remarks in Spanish,” to an employee during that time, and that it was witnessed by “three other people” and they stated that WHILE MY FRIEND WAS PRESENT DURING THAT CONVERSATION, they refused to say who had made these claims. I found out that they had contacted my friend earlier, who according to what HR was saying, kinda sounds like she said the same thing that I said.

The HR rep that hadn’t spoken yet looked over at me and she said, “Hey u/CavalierRigg, would you mind stepping out for a moment? We just need to confirm some information, I will come get you in a few minutes, okay?” I said okay, I got up, and I walked out of the room. About… 20 minutes later? I was invited back into the meeting room and, I am gonna say it, Maria’s Manager did NOT look happy to see me. I was told that it, “appeared that there was a miscommunication in what was reported to management.” I took the time to express that I was, as a person, very hurt by the proceedings and that I, frankly, felt targeted because I speak Russian and, in this instance, Finnish (which I learned on Reddit isn’t the official name of the language, TIL). The HR rep that had asked me to step about apologized for that and made it clear that my company was devoted to diversity and that I was free to speak any language I liked. I thanked her, but I told her that I was now, frankly, afraid of speaking anything but English for fear that I will be purposefully misquoted or misrepresented. I asked them if I was going to be punished, and if so, what it was going to entail. My Manager looked over at me and he said no, but for the foreseeable future, I was authorized to not complete my patrol over there in that department. I asked if I should stop texting my friend privately, and they said that, “whatever [I] did not on company time was my own business, she has not, to our knowledge, asked you to *not* talk to her, right?” I said no, and I said that she was actually the one who helped me calm down last night as I was anxious about this meeting.

Then it got quiet. My Manager kinda tapped his hands on the desk and said, “Welp, we are done here, Cav, you can go now.” I said, “Thank you, Sir, I hope you all have a good day.” And I got up, punched out, and left.

In all it took about an hour and some change for the meeting to be done for me, there was more cross-talking but I just… I feel really uncomfortable. I am glad my Manager said I was able to steer clear of that area (barring an Emergency, of course) but now I just kinda… yeah. This whole experience has sucked, and to be honest with you all, I think I am done talking to my friend over there just to be safe. I think it sucks ass, but I don’t know who accused me of what or why. Reddit, there are some serious scumbags out there, but I promise this situation is as I laid it out, and I swear I did no such thing that I was accused of. It sucks, but until I am ready to transition to being a pilot as a job and I get insurance and benefits for my wife and I, this is what I have to do to survive. I’m going to talk to my wife when she gets home and tell her what I told you all. We were actually supposed to go to lunch on Thursday with my work friend and her boyfriend but… I think it’s best my wife and I cut ties with them, at least for now.

This whole thing has been rather heart breaking, but I was able to get out of it relatively unscathed. I just gotta treat my job as a job, not say more than I need to, and just kinda… keep moving until one day I am free of there.

Thanks again."

4. **Small internship (not computer science related):** some college preparation startup held a internship program (think collegevine but smaller and not known at all) . it was pretty easy to get selected but i thought something would be better than nothing. it didn't involve anything coding related, i was just testing the website basically.
5. **Cofounder and president of indian cultural club:** the club was pretty popular cuz it reached like 100 students but thats also probably cuz theres a ton of indians at our school. my friends and I literally created the club in like may of our junior year so we had barely done anything with it 💀. we held like one bake sale and we're planning an assembly in may but not much else.
6. **Volunteer tutor at kumon:** 💀
7. **Student at some local summer stem program:** it wasn't selective at all, pretty much everyone got in. it was held across consecutive summers from middle school to 10th by a community college. i just included it cuz I was running out of options and I finished my final year in the summer before 10th grade so it technically counted.
8. **Summer camp group counselor:** i decided to take this job in the summer before senior year cuz I wanted to have a nice teenage experience. it was pretty fun but I probably would have been better off grinding some coding projects.
9. **Self took only python course:** this is my only ec related to computer science but I don't really count it because anyone can put it down and it doesn't mean much. i just didn't have anything else to put down at this point but i really wanted to get to 10.
10. **Weightlifting:** i had run out of anything I could potentially write and i was so close to 10 so I decided to add this cuz why not. i just wrote about my progress in the gym, my bulk and weight numbers. i honestly thought this would make me seem more interesting.

**Awards/Honors**

My awards are so trash but I thankfully was able to get to 5.

1. Spanish honor society
2. AP scholar with distinction
3. National honor society
4. AP Seminar and research certificate
5. Letter of Commendation from National Merit Scholarship Program (as you can see, it got pretty desperate)

**Letters of Recommendation**

(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*

AP world history teacher: (5/10) I have a pretty friendly relationship with him but we weren't close at all. he literally wrote the recc letter in front of me in like 15 minutes so I already know he just restated my extracurriculars and didn't say anything profound about me. i definitely wasn't confident about this one

Algebra 2 teacher: (8/10) I had a bad relationship with my pre calc teacher and I'm taking ap calc senior year so my algebra 2 teacher was my only option cuz I wanted a math teacher recommendation. thankfully we had a pretty good relationship even though we rarely talked. he hosted our sat club and we were always on good terms. I assume he wrote something decent because he was always so kind to me and I feel like he's the type of person to write a good recommendation.

Guidance (5/10): I barely know my guidance and she doesn't know me either. all she knew about me was whatever was written on my resume. she had to write the recommendation for a ton of students so mine definitely wasn't anything special.

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

Upenn (9/10) - 1 hour long, pretty standard interview. the interviewer liked the questions I asked and he said he was going to write a few positive details about me. he said id be a good fit for the school. i took off one point cuz I forgot to send a thank you email until 3 days later, and I never got a response.

Princeton (10/10) - 1 hour long again, the interview got me really happy bc he said he was looking forward to seeing my name in the class of 2027 admitted list. he said he was gonna write me an amazing recc and he thought I would be a really great fit for the school. he had me thinking I had a shot at princeton for a second.

**Essays**

**Common App Personal Statement (PS):** I thought it was decent at first but its pretty average and common looking back on it. i wrote about overcoming my fear of public speaking but I tied it in with my extracurriculars and passion for computer science. i thought i wrote uniquely but oh well. My first draft that I submitted to all my EA colleges was pretty bad according to my ap lit teacher. i revised it and I sent my final and better version to all my rd schools. (sad i didn't get to send it to EA)

**Georgia Tech Supp:** Georgia tech was basically my dream college. I liked my essay which i thought was really specific and showed exactly why I wanted to go to ga tech.

**Michigan supp:** Spent most time on this and I actually really liked it. but once i saw the oos cost for michigan I didn't really care too much about it.

**Others:** I literally completed most of my EA essays on the day before. i revised my personal draft on the day my EA were due. My rd essays were decent imo and I liked them.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

&#x200B;

* Rutgers EA (safety): ACCEPTED into sas honors program, no merit aid :(
* UMD EA : ACCEPTED with presidents scholarship 5k per year
* Purdue EA: REJECTED :(
* Umass Amherst EA: WAITLISTED (never heard back)
* Georgia Tech EA: Deferred --> REJECTED. it sucked that i couldn't get in my dream school
* Northeastern: ACCEPTED - global scholars program - I was surprised about this
* Cornell: REJECTED. not surprised bc I didn't even sign up for the alumni interview
* Upenn: REJECTED - this sucked bc it was my finance bro dream.
* Princeton: REJECTED - i guess my interview didn't save my application :(
* University of Michigan: WAITLISTED. honestly i didn't think id even get waitlisted so W imo
* UIUC: ACCEPTED AND MOST LIKELY ATTENDING - got in for cs + education. i sort of rushed the essays and didn't take this school too seriously during the application so i was SURPRISED.

**Final thoughts:**

As you can see, my application is no where near the level of the other people's applications on this subreddit. My ecs were pretty tame in my opinion and my awards didn't stand out. the entire time, I was nervous that I wouldn't even get into Rutgers, my safety. I really had no confidence going into it. I wasn't aware about the entire college admission process until junior year. I really just focused on grades and always put off thinking about colleges because I didn't realize it was this competitive. my parents are immigrants too so they have no knowledge about the college system.

I was really hoping for Georgia tech throughout the entire process but honestly, I took my other college options forgranted. I do wish I spent more time in highschool working on my ecs because I feel like that would have helped me a lot. However, i definitely don't regret my time in highschool because I had a ton of fun with friends. I think a balance is important and we shouldn't dedicate our entire highschool lives to colleges because its truly such a random process.

Even though I got into cs+education (not pure cs) at uiuc, I've talked to a lot of current students (in the cs+x program) and Ive decided that it is my best option compared to the others. I wish i got more aid but thats another story. if you have any questions, lmk.

I am open to any position in the field and even an internship, but I am having a hard time getting to the interview stages with this as well.

12outlm,0,2023-04-16,Returning to a top tech company as a former intern amid layoffs,szerlok,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12outlm/returning_to_a_top_tech_company_as_a_former/,"I graduated with a Master's degree in CS about six months ago. For the last year and a half or so I've been working at a small fintech startup. Before that, I did a six-month internship at a FAANG company and finished it with great feedback from my mentor - I even was offered to extend the internship by another three months and pick up a different project, which I refused because I wanted to focus on finishing my Master's (bad decision in hindsight). I didn't land an internship the following year, and started working at my current company to keep myself busy before eventual graduation and reapplying. Fast-forward to today. I'm convinced that this is the moment where I want to pursue a job at another company. My current job is pretty okay in terms of pay and projects one can take, but I feel like I won't grow much professionally if I decide to stay for another year or two. Since currently most major tech companies are in the middle of lay-offs, this makes me worried that even with my resume I won't be able to land a nice position, e.g. an SWE (backend) at a FAANG company, which I'm positive I'm very much qualified for. What are your thoughts on this? Any tips for pushing my career forward without getting stuck at a mediocre position until layoffs subside? I'm based in Poland and I probably don't want to relocate abroad, but I'd love to hear from different perspectives. My main ""area of interest"" is what some companies call ""Engineering Productivity"" - tools for enhancing developer experience in the form of CLI tools, IDE plugins, everything related to static code analysis, code generation etc."

I have lots of work to do but I know what needs to be done.

However, I want to learn more about the actual software engineering industry. I have an internship soon and would like to prep some basic knowledge. What is the best stuff to look into?

I use Git for all my projects and I've built and am building a variety of stuff such as full stack, GUI, and database related projects. What else is worth learning?

I've heard of stuff like Jenkins, Docker, CI/CD but I don't know what it all really is and how to learn about it. Are there any good online courses or guides for learning about industry standards?"

I have a 4.0 so far my first year and I have a cybersecurity internship this summer. I’m sure this will help me with my sophomore internship but what can I be looking to do? Like is a FAANG ish company plausible next summer? I know Amazon and Microsoft recruit heavily from my school and kind of Facebook and Google. Or is it probably not too realistic to land those? If I did land one next summer, does that make me competitive for a quant internship my junior or senior summer or does prestige still play too big of a factor. Just wondering how my potential recruitment might look going forward. I know it depends on my actual ability as well."

I am currently in the final interviewing process for a FinTech company, and I see there are a lot of openings based on the team for the same SWE internship position. These 

These positions seem to have similar or identical requirements and preferences and the work that the teams are doing seems to be very similar, but only different in the process (e.g. Credit card vs Debit card, etc.)

Given I am in the final rounds of interviews with team A at this company, is it wiser to apply for all other open teams that match my experience or will it 'hinder' my application in some way?

I was unable to get a referral for the current team, but I may be able to get a referral for other teams if I choose to apply. 

tldr: is it better to apply to all open positions (different teams) at one company, or stick with one team's hiring process?"

I got an opportunity to work as an FPGA Design intern at cisco. My mentor told me that I would be working on the control path and I wouldn't be touching the data path.

I wasn’t ready, in terms of skill, to feel comfortable after my first two semesters, so I got rejected from many companies. This past fall, I felt much more comfortable with my ability and applied to probably one hundred companies. I got three interviews- the final round of one- and I was denied from all. Next spring, I’ll be graduating. 

My question is what to do if I can’t get a summer internship by the time I graduate. Is the natural pivot getting a Master’s to give me more time to get an internship position? Am I still able to land a job as a SWE?

Obviously, I know 1+ internships are optimal. I know I’m ‘behind’. Just looking for some guidance as the comparisons to others & external pressures have been depriving me of any joy and I’m getting incredibly worried.

(Freshman year was mostly due to the pandemic)

When I tried to apply to an internship, one of the questions was about ECs and it just dawned on me that my ECs are.. really underwhelming. (I earn some money online by doing commissions (art, graphic & UI design), babysit two children, crochet, do piano and that’s pretty much it.)

The only thing I have going on for me is my GPA (4.4 weighted). My SAT is just a mere 1270 which is no where enough for the college I want to go to but I plan on raising it.

I know I really messed up my chances. I need advice please."
12p3vvu,5,2023-04-17,Help me pick! Virginia Tech vs. Catholic University of America,bobarkin,collegeresults,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/12p3vvu/help_me_pick_virginia_tech_vs_catholic_university/,"Hi guys! I am a high school senior trying to decide between Virginia Tech (VT) and The Catholic University of America (CUA)! 

For context, I am majoring in psychology and hope to eventually go on to grad school so that I can become a clinical psychologist. 

I am going to list my pros and cons of both schools below and any support / help with my decision would be extremely helpful! May 1st is coming up quickly and I need to choose soon! 

Virginia Tech:

PROS
1. Amazing school spirit and student body
2. Everyone that goes there loves it. I’ve seriously never heard anyone say they didn’t enjoy their time there. 
3. In the top 50 in the country for my major (psychology) 
4. VT has a better funded psychology department, meaning there’s higher potential for opportunities related to my major (psychology) 
5. You can always apply for different scholarships each year so there’s potential for my tuition to decrease 
6. Amazing alumni network (pretty sure it’s like #7 in the nation) which can help when I’m trying to find a job / internship 
7. Greek life! I would join a sorority here
8. Food is ranked #3 in the country 

CONS
1. A more expensive option: freshman year tuition is $41k. Though there’s opportunities for it to decrease throughout the years, it will still be more expensive, especially at the start
2. There’s no guaranteed housing sophomore year meaning I’d have to start searching for an apartment off campus as a freshman which could be stressful (though living off campus will deduct the room & board fee from my tuition)
3. Further from home (5 hours) 
4. Introductory courses are HUGE (some can be as many as 600+ people) which means I might have a more difficult time connecting with my professors 
5. Location: the location (Blacksburg, VA) might make getting internships difficult, especially because I will not have a car on campus


The Catholic University of America:
PROS

1. CHEAP! Would only be about $21k to attend and they’re not even done giving me aid
2. AMAZING LOCATION! I love dc so much + amazing nightlife 
3. location is also amazing for internships (DC is the internship hub).  
4. more intimate class sizes meaning I’d likely be closer w my professors. This could be helpful if I need help finding internships or start falling behind in their class
5. Only an hour away from home so if there’s ever an emergency or I wanted to go home it would be really easy to
6. Great accommodations for people who need them like me for my adhd + I would be able to pick my classes a month before everyone else because of my accommodations 
7. From what I’ve heard, the classes are easier (especially for my major), so I’d have a good gpa 

CONS
1. some say that the college of arts and sciences is underfunded and that I won’t have access to everything that school promises those majors 
2. school is rly small, hardly 3k students and I don’t want everything to be a rerun of high school. Each year is only about 800-900 people meaning everyone kinda knows everyone 
3. CUA is more of a hit or miss, some people love it some people hate it. CUA has a lower retention rate than VT 
4. Absolutely no sports presence or school spirit. The school is D3 and nobody goes to sports games or gets excited abt stuff like that which I might miss.
5. Since the school is so small, about a 1/4 of the grade is composed of student athletes (for example; if a grade is 800 people, around 200+ of them would be athletes), meaning that there is a large division between the athletes and non-athletes. 
6. Going off of that, I’ve also heard that it’s kinda hard to fit in if you’re not an athlete or if you’re not friends w the athletes. Since there’s no Greek life (another con), the athletes throw the parties, so if you’re not one (which I won’t be), or not friends with them, it’ll be hard to meet people and get invited to stuff.

I am a recent graduate from a reputed university and have been working as a full stack developer for a startup for the past 1 year and 3 months. My internship was in Power BI and SQL, and I have been working with .NET MVC stack in my current job. While I really enjoy working with my supportive colleagues and managers, I want to explore other career opportunities in the future.

To be honest, I didn't perform well during my final placements due to personal issues, and missed out on some high-paying job offers. Thats all in the past. I wann look forward now. Currently, I earn a salary of 4.5LPA and have a lot of free time after work. I want to make the most of this time and work hard to enhance my skills, so that I can aim for a job with a salary of at least 12LPA in the next year or so.(hope this is not unrealistic to jump from 4.5 to >12lpa in one year)

I know that I need to focus on improving my DSA skills, but I'm not sure where to start. I would really appreciate any advice or tips from experienced developers on how to boost my skills and prepare for higher-paying job opportunities in the future.

Since i have time i am ready to grind until i get a good paying job. So please it would be great help if you guys can guide me.

Thank you in advance for your help!

TL;DR: I am a full stack developer with 1 year experience, currently earning 4.5LPA. I missed out on high-paying job offers during my final placements and want to work hard to enhance my skills and aim for a job with a salary of at least 12LPA in the next year. I need advice from experienced developers on how to improve my DSA skills and prepare for higher-paying job opportunities."

I am currently a Junior and planning to attend graduate school for a Master's in Computer Science (Fall 2023 Cycle). That being said, I would love if I could receive some insight into the schools I have a chance of getting into based on my stats. Thanks, and I appreciate any feedback.

**Demographics**: Asian Male

**GPA**: 4.0/4.0

**Undergraduate Institution**: Decent state school known for its CS Program, B.S. in Computer Science.

**GRE**: 170 Quant, 163 Verbal, 5.0 AWA

**Research Experience**: Unfortunately not much here (caught up with Putnam preparation and other goals...), but I've been working for about a year with a CS Professor to advance progress on a major open CS conjecture. Programmed numerous experiments in C++ to create models of performance.

**Work Experience:**

* 3x SWE Internships @ FAANG (Google-esque), 1x SWE Internship @ Top Unicorn

**Letters of Recommendation:**

* The CS Professor I've been doing research with. He is famous (also somewhat notorious) at my university for his prowess in algorithms, and we have a great student-professor relationship. Have also taken numerous of his classes.
* A CS Professor who leads the competitive programming club at my university, and I've been an active member of this club for 3 years. He refers to me as a ""rockstar"" programmer, so I believe he knows my abilities well enough to write me a great LoR.
* A Math professor who I've taken numerous abstract classes with and whom I have a great connection with.

**Other (Awards, Organizations, etc...):**

* An officer/leader of my University's ICPC Competitive Programming Team for 3 years.
* Represented the United States in an international collegiate-based programming contest (100,000+ participants), and finished in the top 10.
* Other programming contest awards related to ICPC and Google Code Jam.
* A score well above the median on the 2022 Putnam Competition, but I suspect this shouldn't be included since it is tangentially related to a master's in CS...

**Schools I'm Applying to**: CMU, Columbia, Cornell, Georgia Tech, Northeastern, Princeton, Purdue,  Rice, SJSU, Stanford, UMD, UIUC, UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCD, UCI, UCSC, UCSB, UPenn, USC, UT Austin, University of Washington.

I am a bit bummed about my lack of research experience, but fortunately, I will be spending quite a bit of time doing research in the final year of my bachelor's degree. I appreciate any feedback :)"

So far, I've been a few months in this company. 

Most of the projects didn't work out and I highly doubt they brought any money to the company. They took way longer than we expected them to take, they were buggy, and they were mostly stuff that even if we launched, they'd not generate instant revenue. 
The company is not going as well as the directors expected, but it doesn't seem doomed. 

So I didn't mind all that since everything seemed to be okay until recently our PM was fired and they mentioned he wouldn't be replaced. The motives were minors, not something I see worth firing someone who had business knowledge and a good curriculum, better than most PMs, but as I said, I'm an intern, so it's not like I know anything... 

Should I be looking for a new job?"

I am 25F Software Developer with a degree in Computer Science and I have nearly 4 years’ experience working as a Software Dev. I am mainly just looking for more information / people’s experience with getting US E3 visa. My BF is a US citizen living in Boston and so I would be looking to get a job in the Boston area, I know getting married seems like the easiest option but I would like to exhaust all other options before going to that stage.

From what I have researched it looks like it can be challenging to get a job offer, most job applications always seem to say “not accepting visa sponsorship.” If you successfully got an E3 visa, how did you go about getting employed and how long did it take? I have worked in USA before for 1 year on J1 visa working as Tech Intern during university, so I am not sure if that will make a difference in terms of employers being more interested?

Also, even though I have an Australian passport I am currently living in Northern Ireland (mother is Australian and father is from NI), does this still make me eligible or do I have to apply from within Australia?

just some additional bg + considerations i have: 

distance is something that definitely makes NTU less favourable for me. i live in central so NUS and SMU are definitely better for me distance-wise. i understand that on campus accoms are avail but i'm tryna save on uni costs cuz idw to burden my parents. i also have extreme PTSD of commuting to jurong and beyond after NS so yea lol. if i do end up in hall tho i'm defo gna try to join ihg for the vibes 😁

i'm definitely quite a newbie to coding/computing too. during my NS time i did a few python beginner courses so i know basics. i've done 1 or 2 short courses and online videos on python but definitely i'm relatively a noob to this compared to people who have been coding since their ass finished PSLE. i understand that each uni is supposed to tailor their course such that it's beginner friendly too so i hope that's the case. as for the math and theory part of CS, i believe that's something i should be able to enjoy and cope with too. 

i intend to pick up a double major in sustainability as well! this is an area which i feel quite passionately for and have done some projects to contribute here too. hence, if i can cope with it, i'll definitely intend to take up susඞtainability. in fact currently, the NTU spot i have is CS + sustainability so yeh

let me know your opinions on everything i mentioned and pls sway my opinion towards/away from your school. tell me anything and everything - internships, profs, the people, job opportunities. thank u :D"

Since i aspire to pursue cs/it i think people here can help me.
Plz take a look at my situation and advice as i need to make a decision quick.



Hey everyone!
So i am in this dilemma regarding which college should i go to.







I got 94.8 percentile in mains only because maths saved it for me (99.8). But this isn't a good score as i want a computer based program only. Now i am from haryana and there isn't any good state based college that i could go to.





During my research i came across srm,vit,manipal, etc. but i don't want to burden my family with that much amount of fees and like return on investment from these colleges isn't worth it imo.





I also came to know about cic du and i am fascinated by its curriculum and 4 internships and also minimal fees. I think i can ace the cuet test as i am only good with numbers and only maths is in the domain subject. Also its programme it and mathematical innovation sounds perfect for me. I live really close to delhi so can also stay home and pursue my other hobbies.





The only main con of cic i came across is the lack of a placement cell but i guess college placements are kinda overrated and if i have the skills i can crack a good job anywhere applying offcampus too. Also they ask you to take up 4 internships and i might be lucky to get a ppo.





But this all what i collected about cic and i am sure that it isn't as rosy as it sounds. Would you all recommend cic to a junior or i should take a drop and focus on a top nit?





Also placements isn't my only goal for college i might consider an opportunity to do masters too.  So should i start focusing on maths and give my all towards cuet or should i consider taking a drop a start preparing for a top nit?
Any input would be appreciated. Thanks for reading."

I am a CS student in the UK approaching the end of my penultimate year. I have an offer with a very big tech company (extremely happy with it) for a 3-month summer internship, but I am able to do a 12-month placement year with them as well, where I would delay my graduation by a year and work there for 12 months, before returning to finish my final year of university and then graduate. 

some pros of 12mo

is 3mo enough time to shine? 12mo allows me more time to show that I deserve the return offer, as well as network and meet people

if I don't get the return offer, I'm in a better position for other jobs and have achieved good pay that other places may not give me.

Having 1yoe means offers I get after graduation may be a higher salary.

Get to be a student for an extra year? around friends, societies, etc (it's in the same city I live in and go to University in so not a big difference)

cons

I graduate later, so that's 1 year I could've worked on a grad salary earning more (assuming return offer). Also, I'm very young so delaying start to the work force isn't terrible.

The ""extra experience"" will be gained after I graduate anyway, so it's not really much of a benefit.

most interns do 3 months and a lot of them get return offers, shouldn't matter, as the chances of a return are the same so either path ends the same.

3 months at this company in a fast-paced environment already provides lots of experience.

the CV boost will be the same either way, passing resume screenings will improve by the same amount.

I don't think either is a bad decision, I'm just unsure as to which is a better one, and I'm completely torn right now and was wondering if there was any guidance available.

12pjlya,2,2023-04-17,[HELP] Review for termination letter,Pacifestra,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/12pjlya/help_review_for_termination_letter/,"Hi, 

I'm on a review for termination and they want me to write a explaination letter before that. I'm okay with everything they said, except some explanations/accusations. And I don't want to be terminated also. I know I'm in the process of working on myself. 

I have repeated mistakes over the course of my 4 months in work but I have corrected a lot of them. But it seems that my supervisor (US Citizen) is always adding new issues to the table. 

In the first month, it was my work ethic and my communication. I am an introvert, and I admit that sometimes I do lack communication and I have tried to correct them and be honest about what I feel towards the workpace. I have also been called out about my use of words in the workplace. I'm used to not having to use words na ""nagpapaalam"" like ""can"" ""if you mind"" ""would you be able to"" in the workplace, especially because of my former boss who was much bagets than my former bosses. I have adjusted this and corrected them in the second months.

The second month, it was my communication still but it's also the quality of my work and also my skills. 

In my resume, I said that I know In-design. I also said that I know how to write press releases during my internship and my last job. My last job was in January 2022, I worked at an ad agency. The time before that, I was freelancing. 

My internship was in 2020, I worked at a PR agency. I've also had mishaps where I forget some work that should be done weeks before, and it persisted in the third month. 

However, In have corrected them already. 

The first month, it was hard for me to think during nightshift, because changing sleeping schedules is hard.

I work nightshift, first time ever. So at times my brain gets so foggy at night. I don't also drink coffee, because I tend to get super anxious and I don't get work done. 

Third month until now (April), it's now my dishonesty daw towards work. I sometimes work at a local cafe which is 24 hours. On Mondays and Fridays, they change schedule. They are also accusing me of lying about my internet despite me sending them screenshots of my data from Ookla's speedtest. This is the sole reason why I work outside at times.

Additionally, the change of schedule in the US for daylight savings has also made me adjust my sleeping time—which in turn would be hard for me too.

They are also accusing me of working undertime. I work 10 - 7 AM. At times 11 - 8 AM. They don't have a record of my time. They just let me send a DTR for my daily time record. I asked them for one during my early days at the company but they didn't give me one and said I just proceed with my usual routine of sending them myself (sending in an email with all the records).

Now, they want me to provide a legal counsel (or maybe I misunderstood this. I asked them what this is. The only word in the document is ""counsel"") based on the documents I have seen.

They have not sent me the documents, so these accusations are yet to be finalized.

On another note, when I was interviewed they promised me that I will be able to practice creative freedom and photography in the company. I have not experienced that since. 

My questions are:

1. Will this be a violation outside the company policies?
2. Will I be charged with fees from Philippine Law? 
3. Wala na ba akong laban dito for my case?
4. Is this normal in companies?
5. I know I have self problems during my 1st months but parang nada-dagdagan. 
6. What if I have no proof for the DTR and the cafes that I  went to? 

I am only 23 years old, and this is the first time I encounterered this. I am super anxious."

If you add recession+ layoffs to that, I didn't have much of a choice since I need to start supporting my family and also for my own sake I needed to start earning Asap

This company has a 2 year bond in which breaks down into 4 months internship + 4 months traineeship and if you clear all the interview rounds after this you join as a full time. The stipend in the first 2 phases if (10k,15k).

I'm really scared now. I'm starting a field which I never really wanted to but will have to. The initial plan was to grind leetcode and make projects for WebD in these 2 years on the side and then apply to companies after that. But looking at the current scenario and how AI is changing things I'm really concerned whether the skills I learn on the side will even remain relevant or not. 

Maybe I'm overthinking but I really need a different perspective on this since I'll be starting courses from tomorrow (that's what the internship period is for) for learning BigData and if I don't perform well during this training period they won't take me as an FTE and I'll be left jobless.

I recently applied for an internship position at a company and was required to do a second take home assessment. The task was to convert a Figma file into a deployed React app (just a static page) and the duration was 3 days.

I finished the assessment in 3 days and submitted it. However, now the recruiter wants me to make the app responsive and viewable on both phones and tablets with a deadline of 2 days. 

I'm pretty bad at responsive designs and the given Figma file design doesn't work with smaller screens at all... Should I even attempt to do it? It's going to take me hours and I already spent a lot of time to recreate the Figma file (which was complex to me as a beginner - it had 20 frames with several groups).

This take home assessment is the final step of the selection process and honestly, I'm a bit burnt out. The first take home assessment was to create a functioning app within 5 days and that also took me days. The job posting just specified knowledge in a programming language (Java/C++) which I had, but all the take home assessments are webdev related and I'm just a beginner in that. 

Is it worth attempting to do what the recruiter wants? I really want the internship position for my resume, but this company's take home assessments are really time consuming for me and I have other things to do.

Also, are the take home assessments a red flag for the internship work I will be doing at this company? Time consuming on my part for little pay?

I have always wanted to start a company of my own but have not yet found an idea worth pursuing. I am incredibly passionate about this project and want to devote as much time as possible.

&#x200B;

Here is my problem.

I have been offered a summer internship, precisely what I've wanted for a long time. They are offering me meaningful work and the opportunity to learn many new things, and I would gain valuable experience and make money to fund my project. I originally planned to work on my project, creating the first working prototype and start growing it into a business this summer. It would be my full-time gig, and I would give it my 200% effort. Other people are working to create a similar product to me, and I want to outwork them to make mine better and sooner. 

I am all over the place with this. I want the job but I want to do my own thing this summer and enjoy my project. If my project fails to become a company/product, I have nothing to lose because it's still a successful school project. But I lost the opportunity of taking on this internship which would benefit my future career. I also wonder if I will have more free time than expected, and I regret not taking the summer internship. If I do both and they are both demanding, I'll work a 9-5 and then work on the project after work. What if I can't manage both? What if there is not enough time?

On the other hand, this position could also help me start a company as it would allow me to network, grow my skills and learn more about how a business operates (btw this is not my first internship).

  
Do I put all my eggs in one basket and go for my dream of starting a company and building a project I love? Or should I take less risk, spend less time on my project and take the internship to have a safety net? I am aware that my project might not even make it a business, but I want to try as it has potential.


Edit:

I would like to thank everyone who offered advice as it really helped. In conclusion I decided to take the internship and will be working on my project/company on the side. I determined that I should take a slower approach to creating the business side of my project. Having an internship this summer will help fund my project as well as I’ll be able to learn more about how a business works."

I'm looking for a label/job title I should be looking at. I'm hoping you guys can help me figure out what kind of internship I should be looking for!

I'm a CS junior. I think in general I'm a back-end dev. I full time run Linux and I maintained Gentoo for a bit, looking at getting my own server for funsies, that kind of thing.

I can write a few languages. Lately I've been enjoying Rust (how can you not!!).

Over the summer I plan on doing some certs. I'm pretty confident I can get the GCP Associate cert fairly quickly. Cloud computing is super interesting to me. After that, I came looking for recommendations on which other ones I should check out. IBM's Data Science one sounds cool, or maybe an IT cert, since I know very little about IT and I feel like that might be better suited to my interests? Above all else I want to be challenged and I want to learn a lot!

Finally, what kind of programmer am I? Imagine I keep developing my skills: what position could you theoretically see me filling at your company? Am I a back-end dev? Sysadmin? All of the above? Honestly, a list of positions that I should strive for/reach out to their reddit communities would help tremendously.

Thanks <3"

So this is the first time im really gonna be applying en masse for coops and internships and eventually jobs too and am kind of overwhelmed by the entire process. Ive heard so many things about making CV and everything but I think I have consumed so much content that it's all scattered in my brain and can't succinctly bring it all together. So what should my CV look like considering I have no prior work experience, what kinds of projects would you recommend doing (I've heard a diverse set of projects but what would you consider diverse enough to cover what I need). Do I have to make a custom cover letter for each company I apply to as well? How do I practice for interviews and what should I be expecting? (I understand it would be a wide range of different styles and I would love to hear about your interview experience). What would coding interviews be like, is it a lot of DSA and how would you prepare for the interview?

Also, what does the workplace environment feel like? Is it really as hard as when y'all were in university? I've heard it becomes easier, and also you end up picking up more when you're on the job. When they ask that you should have SQL knowledge or something for a year or so and stuff like that, do they really mean you should be really really proficient with SQL? I honestly feel not so qualified a lot of the time cause I feel like I don't have the skillset that they want even though I have dabbled and made some small projects and have using Python, sci kit learn, tensorflow, SQL, and R, done some EDA. So I hope I have a decent enough skillset but I'm kinda confused how I should use my skillset to make effective projects to get my potential employers attention. 

I would love to hear all of your experiences cause honestly I'm struggling and have no clue as to what I'm doing at this point. I just wanna really work and get past studying and really use what I've learnt in an actual real world scenario."

I'm hoping to get some insight from those of you who have experience with either or both methods.

From what I've gathered so far, there are pros and cons to both approaches, but I'm still unsure about which path would be best for me. I would really appreciate it if you could share your experiences, thoughts, or opinions on the following:

1. **Curriculum and Depth**: How do the curriculums and depth of topics covered in Coursera courses compare to those in university courses? Are there any significant gaps or differences that you've noticed?
2. **Hands-on Experience**: Which learning method provides better preparation for hands-on experience or opportunities to work on real-life projects, internships, or research?
3. **Credential Value**: In terms of job prospects and career advancement, how do employers view certificates from Coursera versus degrees or course credits from a university? Is one considered more valuable or prestigious?
4. **Overall Learning Experience**: How would you rate your overall learning experience with Coursera and university courses? Which one did you find more enjoyable, engaging, or effective in terms of teaching and learning?"

The team was 3 months into development before I got on and they were basically winging it week to week until I got there. I got us onto Jira, got the Github cleaned up, generally did everything I could. Being the lead of two parts of the project meant I was shielding my team from the usual upper-corporate complaints as well as taking blame for any project hiccups. I worked four 80-hour weeks back to back and did not get payed for the last 40 hours since my contracted hours were up, but I could not just stand by and watch the team struggle, and I was recieving the promise of a 12 month contract to follow if we hit our content goals. I got let go for poor work performance and to this day I still see them trying to fill my empty role that requires the work of two specialists. I'm proud of that team, I'm proud of myself, but here I am in April with no work. Every time I got to apply I get to see that a new round of FAANG layoffs occurred, usually in the VR department (my specialty) and then I feel like I am competing with all of these people. Between periods of unemployment I have a solid 3 years of game development experience, focused on gameplay programming. To bring it back to the start, I got a terrible college degree that I paid too much for and taught me nothing. Of the 80 students I graduated with, I am the only one who got a game development job. 4 others were supposed to head out to work post-graduation but we graduated into the pandemic in May of 2020, it destroyed a lot of job prospects for students across disciplines at our school and plenty of others I'm sure. I applied for jobs out of college and quickly realized that the top level knowledge we were taught in engines like Unity and Unreal would not cut it. We were not taught any computer science, and even the engine learning we received was fragmented and often not utilizing best practices. Jira and Github were basically not mentioned. I spent 9 months grinding, learning, doing computer science courses like cs50, and got myself up to speed as best as I could. At that point I was now too far out from college to participate in the internships for new grads that lots of bigger game companies offer almost every summer, but did not have enough experience to land a good job. I spent time gaining experience with Fiverr, and gig jobs for people on Discord etc. Long story short, I failed up, and I still try to keep hitting the basic computer science topics, and try to continuously fill in the gaps I missed. I still don't feel like I get a lot of the development that goes into an app or program that isn't visual, the workflow of a game engine makes a lot of sense to me but I struggle to handle some programming tests given to me in Java or in .Net C# as opposed to working in the Unity environment with Monobehavior. Money is running out, we are barely making it paycheck to paycheck with my wife's job. She takes the car 5 days a week so in-person work isn't even an option, and personal anxiety issues makes it far easier for me to work from home even if I did have a car. I have had a dozen extremely promising interviews, with perfectly submitted coding tests, two of the most frustrating ones were for a game developer with 1-2 years of experience, where one went to a refuge from a FAANG firing spree who has 15 years of experience, and the other position went to a single developer with 20 years of experience instead of two entry level positions like the one I applied for. I have learned so much and gotten so far but I just don't know how to spend my time now. I work on a hobby game, I study computer science, watch lectures and read books. I study for interview prep, and I still feel like I am getting nowhere. If I could get a job with 1-3 years of experience expected I would be happy and comfortable, but instead all that I see is senior dev offerings, and now I am seeing more and more principle offerings, no one wants entry level or even intermediate developers at this point. I have worked remotely in Unity up to this point, where do I go next? Do I learn Unreal Engine? Do I try to get into web development? I just don't know what to do in the next month to land a job, or else I won't have electricity to code with anymore..."

They have a 2 year bond so I'll be here for atleast 2 years starting from today. I always wanted to go in WebD side but due to me being from Mechanical background (final year) + tier 3 college,  most of the on campus companies won't let core branches sit in the placement. If you add recession+ layoffs to that, I didn't have much of a choice since I need to start supporting my family and also for my own sake I needed to start earning Asap

This company has a 2 year bond in which breaks down into 4 months internship + 4 months traineeship and if you clear all the interview rounds after this you join as a full time. The stipend in the first 2 phases if (10k,15k).

I'm really scared now. I'm starting a field which I never really wanted to but will have to. The initial plan was to grind leetcode and make projects for WebD in these 2 years on the side and then apply to companies after that. But looking at the current scenario and how AI is changing things I'm really concerned whether the skills I learn on the side will even remain relevant or not. 

Maybe I'm overthinking but I really need a different perspective on this since I'll be starting courses from tomorrow (that's what the internship period is for) for learning BigData and if I don't perform well during this training period they won't take me as an FTE and I'll be left jobless.

And thank-you for reading this till the end if you did. I really need a perspective on this to calm myself down.

As I have limited experience Id like to ask for some basic tips on things I should know and what I could be expecting. 

As I was interviewed I made it clear Ive started my transition (I come from retail) into IT just last October. I have  basic knowledge of Python and I do ok with SQL (which the intern could be quite heavy of. that and Azure). Ive studied almost enough to be able to take on AZ-900, but thats it really as far as cloud goes. Ive uploades couple of programs for assignments I was given for interviwes. Ive used Docker, Github, Jira. Ive played around with Snowflake and Airflow, but am far from experienced.

As far as the intern goes (approx. 6months)I will be under a ”technical consultant” title and will be placed in a team to struggle with smaller tickets. The catch is that the goal of the intern is to prep me and learn enough to be able to get hired in the same company as a junior DE. 

Ive started reading ”Fundamentals of Data engineering” as it appears to be mostly accepted as a good read. I am trying to decide wether I should start the IBM data engineer cert on Coursera or something else. The course seems to cover a lot of interesting topics and thought Id grind through it in a week and go as far as I can get.  One thing im a little anxious about is my Python isnt very strong.

Any tips or suggestions/comments are most welcome! Thank you."

I initially applied as Product Design position for this company back in December, made it to the final round, and even got asked my location preference. However, the position got filled while the recruiter was absent and I did not get the offer. I was so disappointed as I loved the company's mission, remote option, and the benefits they offered. The recruiter promised to reach out to me first if any additional internship spots opened up (which I doubted haha). Few weeks ago, I received an email from the recruiter asking if I'm interested in a PM intern position that just opened up. I am pretty sure I was the first one to be interviewed out of all the applicants. I then did two rounds of interviews with the Product Directors at the company, and today I finally got the job.

I was an aspiring designer and had been applying for a Product Design / UX Design position since last September. I had received an offer from a company very early on in my internship hunting process that I stupidly decided to turn down as I wasn't 100% satisfied. Ever since then, I applied to at least 2-5 companies per day, did 5-7 interviews, but never got another offer. Waking up to rejection emails everyday affected my mental health drastically that I became so stressed and anxious. I spent a quarter building portfolio, took 20 units of classes, did projects in 2 student organizations, and also worked as a Research Assistant at my school and I still felt like I was not enough as I was not getting an internship.

I lost track of my application count-- I know that I applied to the point it was harder to find companies with open intern roles that I did not apply to yet. I spent so many nights looking through reddit posts on what internship other people landed...

Because I did not intend to become a PM intern, I was quite nervous for my interview and watched a lot of crash-courses for PM before my interview. My technical background in UX as well as my experience in student orgs working in product teams definitely helped me in my interviews-- even though they weren't direct PM experiences. PM luckily is a role I have considered, and I am honestly just happy to be working in the field.

I thought April was too late in the game and was depressed thinking about my 7 months of grind and stress. Since about a month ago, I kinda gave up and moved on with my life-- I started doing things I loved doing again, and tried to forget about internship hunt. Ironically, that is when I got the interview opportunities.

I am so relieved that I have landed an internship. I am very excited and happy--but I also feel too drained.

Good luck to those who are still in the internship hunting process. This position I landed opened up only two weeks ago, and I am sure there are still opportunities opening up. Also please enjoy your life."

hey all! was not expecting to see this many ppl here haha but y'all made me feel i wasn't going crazy.

had the interview today, and it went fine. tbh the more i heard, the less interested i was, but that's okay because he did bring up the next stage of the interview process and........

the recruiter himself stated that the business case study would take 20-30 hours.

i hear back on friday on whether or not i move to the next round. i think it was a bit clear to them that i am a bit disinterested in working on such a major project while juggling my whole life. i'm a full time student, an intern working 25 hrs a week, i'm graduating this semester, i'm applying to other jobs, and i'm figuring out housing for post-grad -- could i really add this large project into my time right now and do it well?

if i am offered to move onto the next round (not expecting to), i will likely accept just to see what all the fuss is about THEN rescind haha. i highly doubt this is something for me to seriously consider. i am desperate for a job post-grad, but not this desperate just yet. i've struggled to get a job for a bit now, but i'd like one that at least pretends to respect my time!

i dunno. it was good practice at the very least! thank you all for your responses!!!

hello all!

i looked into an Associate Consultant with Veeva Systems in their Consultant Development Program. my first interview is tomorrow, but according to their website, their process is as follows:

1. application
2. video screen
3. practical business case simulation
4. interview with managers and current associates
5. interview with the leadership team

regarding #3... from everything i've seen online (reddit and glassdoor), this is a assignment that takes 30-40 hours to complete, if done thoroughly, over the course of 7-10 days and presented to staff in one hour.

i think that sounds insane, but i also really want and need a job.

do people actually do this? i mean, duh, they do, but is this actually worth it?"

-What degree should I look into getting?

-What type of home setup should I have if I do WFH?

12q37yp,12,2023-04-17,Cornell vs Northwestern for CS,Dizzy-Cauliflower275,collegeresults,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/12q37yp/cornell_vs_northwestern_for_cs/,"Please help !! I am leaning towards Cornell, since I like the school better overall, but am still unsure if Cornell’s competitive culture is for me. My main concern is the stress aspect and being able to find my place within the student body. I’m pretty sure I want to do CS, and am highly considering double majoring or minoring in Math or EE (still figuring it out). After talking it out with my parents, cost would not be an issue.

Cornell A&S for CS:

Pros:

* Not too far away from home (about <4 hours). Could come home for some weekends
* Amazing CS program (T10 for CS) and overall a great STEM school
* Campus + Nature: Love the whole nature aspect and the beauty of the school itself. The campus is pretty
* Cornell’s reputation as an ivy in the Northeast, since I would want to work in the northeast after college
* Research opportunities are insane
* Could easily double major or minor in math in arts and sciences
* Arts and Sciences would be less stressful than the college of engineering
* Could easily switch to the college of engineering if CAS isn’t my thing
* Ithaca is a GREAT college town (not too big, not too small. perfect for me)
* Most of the Cornell students I talked to seemed to like it (“work hard play hard” culture)
* Weather won’t bother me too much - I am used to the cold and actually prefer it over hot summers
* Larger student body - honestly I prefer a larger student body due to the alumni network and a less cliquey environment

Cons:

* Competitive student body
* Potential stress culture? Students, especially those going into stem, always seem to complain about the workload and seem insufferable (source: Cornell subreddit)
* Grade deflation
* Might feel out of place due to the competitiveness of the student body, and might feel even more alone
* Hard to get into clubs (from what I heard)
* Diagnosed with depression, so I'm afraid Cornell might make it worse
* Lack of school spirit compared to Northwestern

Northwestern McCormick for CS:

Pros:

* Campus !!  Visited and took my breath away
* Flexibility to double major easily, or minor because of the quarter system
* Got into McCormick, so could double major in CS and ECE
* Could explore more of my interests because of the quarter system
* Cooperative student body, seems to be way more collaborative than Cornell
* Near Chicago - could have access to better internship opportunities and resources. Could also visit Chicago for social reasons
* School spirit is amazing ! (Big 10 college experience)
* Highly ranked

Cons:

* Quarter system !! Double the tests and classes
* Location - Northwestern is a plane flight away from home, so I would visit my family less often. I also
* School year ends late (like mid June), so getting summer internships might be difficult
* Evanston as a town kind of bland? It's a quiet suburb
* Compared to Cornell, their CS program is alright

12q3qh8,191,2023-04-17,"McKinsey, Bain Delay Some M.B.A. Start Dates to 2024",gsOctavio,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/12q3qh8/mckinsey_bain_delay_some_mba_start_dates_to_2024/,"Article from WSJ: https://www.wsj.com/articles/mckinsey-bain-hire-new-m-b-a-s-but-they-may-not-work-for-months-d805f14b?mod=mhp

Consulting giants McKinsey & Co. and Bain & Co. are delaying start dates for new M.B.A. hires, or in some cases paying them thousands of dollars to put off starting their jobs.

Consulting firms are among the biggest recruiters of business-school talent. Delaying the start dates for so many fresh grads is causing anxiety on campuses and suggests these businesses may have wider concerns about the economy.

Bain told M.B.A.s with offer letters that if they waited to start until April 2024, the firm would pay them $40,000 to work for a nonprofit or $30,000 to learn a new language or participate in an educational program, in one communication that suggested hires could also become yoga instructors or go on safari for $20,000.

At McKinsey, many M.B.A.s hires don’t have start dates yet, several students with offer letters said. The company, which is in the process of laying off as many as 2,000 workers, said those new hires will be brought in over a series of months, from shortly after graduation through February 2024. 

The decision to push back start dates into next year in some cases is an about-face for the consulting industry, which boomed during the pandemic as companies sought advice about how to revamp and adjust their businesses. 

On Monday, Ernst & Young LLP, the accounting and consulting firm, said it would cut about 3,000 U.S. employees, or less than 5% of its workforce, after assessing current economic conditions. KPMG LLP said in February that it would lay off several hundred people in its consulting division in February, according to a spokesman.

Delaying start dates by months for new consultants “becomes more important when the economy is in a downturn,” said Keith Bevans, Bain’s global head of consultant recruiting. “We try to encourage more people to start earlier when times are busy.”

Consulting is one of the highest paying post-M.B.A. jobs, with median salaries reaching $175,000 for students who graduated in 2022 from Harvard Business School, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, according to the schools. 

Top consulting firms have been in a war for talent in recent years, offering internships and some full-time roles to incoming M.B.A. students before they even set foot on campus. Hiring season in business schools tends to be active in the fall, when second-year students lock down offers for spring. 

An analysis this month by William Blair & Co., an investment bank, found that consulting firms have been more cautious in hiring this year, with job postings with the Big Four firms, Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, declining 62% year over year. 

As technology companies shed workers this school year, some students said they were drawn to consulting as a more stable career trajectory, making for a competitive application process. That said, technology companies are regular corporate clients of consulting firms, so that shrinking sector could have an effect on consulting demand.

Bain is trying to incentivize M.B.A.s to pursue new interests before joining the firm, though it is committed to putting these hires on the payroll eventually. 

“Go on an African safari or take a painting class!!” reads one document for Bain’s new hires that was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. “Write a book or become a yoga instructor!!”

Seeking volunteers to commit to a start date almost a year away is a new practice for Bain, Mr. Bevans said. Some students volunteered or were assigned start dates in January 2024 and will receive half the pay on offer for an April 2024 start date, according to the document. 

Bain has hired a similar number of M.B.A.s as in prior years, Mr. Bevans said, adding that having some start in January after spring graduation has been done before. 

The delay decision from consultants is one of many economic indicators that have produced mixed signals. 

Many economists have been expecting a recession as inflation and interest rates have remained at higher levels than previously predicted. But months of strong job reports have confounded those expectations. 

In March, however, wage gains slowed. 

While Bain’s new hires are finding out when they’ll start their new jobs, most M.B.A.s hired to work for McKinsey don’t know when they will start. McKinsey-bound M.B.A.s are comparing notes on what the company’s staff has shared with students, and annoyance is building, according to the students with offer letters. 

McKinsey is eliminating up to 2,000 positions, largely in professional support functions and not client-facing roles. 

McKinsey told students that they will learn their start dates with at least two months’ notice, said Lisa Hurst, the firm’s director of talent attraction for the Americas. 

Ms. Hurst said she expects students to start getting notification of their start date soon. 

After the online publication of this article, Ms. Hurst told the Journal that all M.B.A.s who will start full time in 2023 will learn their start dates within 24 hours. Others will learn that they will start in January or February of 2024, with a precise date to follow.

The uncertainty has prevented some of them from finding short-term work or looking for apartments, according to several business-school students with consulting-firm offers. M.B.A.s will likely wait for a date and start whenever they are allowed, according to two of the students with offer letters. 

Last year, highly ranked M.B.A. programs sent hundreds of graduates to McKinsey, Bain and Boston Consulting Group, school employment reports show. In some cases, including at Columbia Business School and the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, those consulting firms were among the most common first jobs after graduation. 

Boston Consulting Group start dates will be staggered across the second half of the year and into January 2024, spokesman Eric Passarelli said. The company told M.B.A. hires their start dates over the past few weeks."

I'm thinking of switching jobs soon, and I have always struggled with quantifying my experience into number of years. Because of that I'm usually not sure if I'm going for Senior positions or Intermediate or Staff positions. This also affects my compensation expectation and I want to get outside opinions on this.

I'm sharing a detailed and a TL;DR version of my experience, and a list of questions at the end.  


*(Scroll down for the TL;DR)*

&#x200B;

Here's the detailed context about my career & related life events:

1. I started writing code and poking around stuff when I was 16 (mostly HTML, CSS, JS & PHP).
2. For next 2 years I kept poking around web stuff and doing gigs on Fiverr, Upwork etc.
3. After that, I started my 4 year undergrad in CS (this was in India and not in a recognized University)
4. Year 1 & 2 of undergrad :
   1. Interned at a startup and helped migrate their stack from RoR to Laravel (startup went under soon but I made good connections)
   2. Contributed couple bugfixes to Laravel framework
   3. At this stage I was really grasping design principles & best practices
   4. Completed Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree
      1. Wasn't a big fan of Mobile development, but did it to keep my options open, and because I got a scholarship for it and it was free for me ($200 otherwise)
5. Year 3 & 4:
   1. Started a bootstrapped company (I'll call it MD here onwards) with one of my gig clients who also became a friend by then. I was the technical cofounder and handled all things tech.
   2. At MD, I built, deployed and maintained the whole web stack for the next 6 years
      1. Used Vue.js, Laravel (PHP), Node.js, AWS, Braintree, MongoDB
      2. The stack had multiple microservices + 1 monolith at the end of it
   3. At MD, I also had to build a render farm - essentially a distributed processing queue that handled upwards of 30K video rendering requests a day
   4. I was also working on UpWork during this period, and did multiple PHP / Laravel projects
6. I moved to Canada for my postgrad at a course-based masters in Uni. of Windsor (for people not aware, it's not one of the top universities in Canada)
   1. During this time I kept working on MD, stack was changed multiple times and I got good at these things:
      1. React, RabbitMQ, Docker, K8s
      2. I was leading a 3-person (me included) software team
7. Worked at Deloitte for a 4-month internship
   1. Used React for a client project
8. Worked as ""Intermediate Software Developer"" at an Enterprise Health & Safety Company for 1.5 years (2020)
   1. My first full-time ""Job""
   2. Used React, Node.js, Postgres & .NET
   3. My first time working full-time in a team
   4. Manager / company were interested in seeing me in a Senior role in ""6 mo - 1year""
9. Joined an early stage startup ""Software Developer"" (working since 1 year)
   1. Previous job became too enterprise for me, cash compensation was also not enough
   2. Went for a \~20% cash comp boost + some equity, while losing insurance
   3. The title doesn't hold much meaning right now because it's a 2 people engineering team with 3 others. In my mind, I am an Individual Contributor right now but I am not a manager. Not sure if I may have to manage a team anytime soon.
   4. I'm in Canada & make \~110K cash (CAD) + 1% equity vested over 4 years

# TL;DR: 

I've been working as a software developer since I was 16 (I'm 25 now), I've developed multiple web apps and worked as a freelancer & at my own startup as technical cofounder for majority of my career. I have a bachelor's degree in CS (from India), and a course-based Master's degree in CS (from Canada). After graduating my postgrad, I already had \~6 years of on-and-off working experience. I've also made small contributions to multiple open source projects.

After this I worked as an ""Intermediate Software Developer"" at an Enterprise software company for 1.5 years and then have been working at an early stage startup for about a year now. I switched from the enterprise company to startup to get a \~20% boost in cash compensation and to get away from the ""not-my-problem"" enterprise attitude.

**TL;DR over.**

At this point, I am able to independently design, build & deploy complete web apps (frontend + backend + CI / CD), I can learn new languages & platforms pretty fast - in my last job I learned a fair bit of .NET MVC in order to integrate with a legacy system. I'm also good with DevOps principles and I've managed couple production grade K8s clusters.

Because of my experience working solo at my startup for a while, in most cases the description of a bug or defect is enough for me to have a good idea where the problem is. Most of the times it's stuff I've seen before, and therefore I can identify and isolate defects fairly well. 

I understand AGILE / Scrum methodology and the breakdown of work fairly well. The part I'm clearly lacking right now is the lack of management experience. I've never been a ""manager"", and I'm hoping to get that experience soon.

I think that I'm ready to make my next move and this time around I want to be more aware of what my worth is, and what role / level should I apply for. 

Here are my questions:

1. I've got 2.5 Years of experience in full-time employment, not counting the 6 years I worked for myself / as a freelancer. I do not feel comfortable calling myself as having 8 YOE, because I feel that the 6 out of 8 years do not count. Am I right to feel this way? What would your reaction be if a 26 y.o. said they had 8 YOE?
2. Given the level of experience and capability to independently function, would you say I am working at a Senior level? Or am I already at an Staff level? Or am I still Intermediate?
3. I would call myself a jack of all trades - I am comfortable moving around in different tech stack and I am quick to adapt to new platforms / languages. I've been advised multiple times that I should have deep expertise in one thing, while being a jack of all trades for other things. The part that I don't get is, how do I choose what to become an expert in. I'm equally interested and experienced with both FE (React) and BE (Node.js).
4. What would you say is a good range for total compensation given my experience? I'm in Canada (GTA) for context. I'm also not looking for FAANG-level companies to work in right now. I want to work at mid-size company where there's enough opportunity to grow and to have some chill time too."

I got my master's in computer information technology.  I go on interviews even for the jr. positions but unfortunately and not surprisingly I don't have the experience needed.  College taught me no practical skills and was a huge waste of money (to me at least).  I have been on several interviews and tell them, I have a master's with a great GPA and have learned very quickly with anything I take on.... I basically tell them with great enthusiasm that I'm a go getter, always have been and will learn very quickly because that's all I have to offer.  No one unfortunately will give me a chance without the experience (even in junior positions).  I have even had jobs say I did the best on the assessment tests for the job and still get denied because I have 0 experience.  I self-teach myself programming and other useful skills but it's hard to do it on your own and know exactly what each company wants.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.   


Basically, I'm here to ask what do I do?  Do I go back to school and hopefully get an internship?  Are there online courses that are going to get me a tech job?  I have tried for years and can't figure out the answer.  I have even posted on job networking sites that I will work for free and just want the experience needed to grow my career.

**Additional Notes:**

I'm extremely happy with how things turned out - going to a super competitive Bay Area school has been super hard and pressure-cooker-esque. I think that really contributed to the caliber and number of colleges that I applied to. I've really given into this capitalism a lot the past few years and participated in a lot of extracurriculars, but I never felt like I did it just for college. I did a lot of things because I wanted to lead a meaningful life and use my time effectively.

**Advice for future applicants:** Be as creative as possible in essays, and try and have fun while writing! I think the schools that I got into were ones that I had the most fun writing - the Stanford roommate essay and the Penn thank you note were my favorites. If you have fun, you come off as more genuine and I think it somewhat humanizes this crazy process and you stand out more. I got really caught up in my essays because I applied to so many schools, and I just started sounding like a robot in a lot of them.

Rejection is just redirection. I was heartbroken when I got rejected from Yale early because I got so attached to them but everything really worked out in the end. Rejection is really about you and the school not being a good fit together, not anything else.

And when picking schools, visit them if you have the time and resources (ask the college to fund your plane ticket) after you get in. The \~vibe\~ of the school is the most important and just feeling your emotional and visceral reaction when you are on campus and interacting with current and future students is the most telling factor of where you belong.

12q954g,15,2023-04-17,Quitting work advice please!,Revenue-Late,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/12q954g/quitting_work_advice_please/,"Tldr: bad boss, quitting, should I tell them how I feel or just be at peace & move on? 

So I've been treated pretty badly (subjectively) by my superior at work and because of this I'm quitting. I say subjectively because as compared to how the other interns are being treated by their superiors, to say I have gotten the short end of the stick is an understatement. But my dad says it's normal for people to be selfish and egoistical at the workplace (which I agree with). Anyway, here's a message I wrote and always fantasise about sending it:

""You should have been kinder to me if you wanted me to stay. I understand that I am replaceable, but it would be difficult for you to meet deadlines with a new intern. Here are some examples of how you have hindered quality work to be put out: you gave vague instructions and then became frustrated when I didn't do things exactly as you wanted. You also made sarcastic comments when I asked for clarification, even though my job requires attention to detail.

Wouldn't it have been better for both of us if you had answered my questions in a non-sarcastic manner? This would have saved you time later on when amending my work.

You assumed that I already knew everything about the company and its processes, despite only having one day of training. I understand that you're busy and focused on your own career, but it's important to build relationships with coworkers and demonstrate your interpersonal skills, even with those in lower positions. Your behaviour has made it difficult for me to communicate with you, even about work-related issues.

I know you're busy and stressed. It isn't expected of you to be so kind all the time, though I've been told that [their position] are supposed to guide their assistants in the [tasks]. However, objectively, it would have been more efficient if you had taken the time to teach me how to do one task properly without grumbling impatiently or making sarcastic remarks. I would have been able to complete tasks more quickly if I had better guidance from you.

I have worked with other busy superiors before who were able to build healthy relationships with their assistants. This made the work process smoother and quicker. XXX, I was willing to learn, but you needed to be willing to teach. Work often necessitates one to go beyond the scope of duty, especially since the benefits of helping and teaching me far outweigh the time and energy spent when I'm able to produce quality work in a shorter period of time.

I don't have anything to gain by telling you all of this. You may disregard my advice or think I'm too young to know what I'm talking about. However, I hope you can learn from this experience and treat your next assistant better. Nonetheless, I am grateful for the experience of learning to be more resourceful and independent.""

I believe the execution of this message may not have been the most polite, but I stand firm with its contents. Not sure if it's naive to feel the way I do but I mean I approached the problem in a logical instead of emotional manner. And I also know that I'm in no position to ""teach them a lesson"" because they are superior and older.

So, should I
1) Just send what I want to say to them and possibly risk being blacklisted by the company? Would it objectively be rude for me to do so? (If I do end up telling what I feel, I will try to phrase the contents of my msg more respectfully... and if so, could anyone advice on how to phrase it kinder?) 

2) deal with their wrath for a few more days and move on with life

3) inform the middleman (higher position than my superior) to relay my message to my superior 

4) inform the middleman what I'm about to send my superior, then tell my superior myself

5) simply inform the middleman about their behaviour by the sending middleman them this msg, referring to my superior as 3rd person pov rather than 2nd person pov

Any kind and non-judgemental advice would be great. Thank you so much!"

Here’s my pickle. The GPA. Ain’t no way gett’n around it. COVID was not kind to me or my family, and that combined with a move and Jewish holidays at the beginning of every school year led to a total collapse of my studies at the start of HS. In addition to this some serious familial issues were incredibly distracting. Though as that cleared up, I got more serious and expect to finish junior and senior year with unweighted 3.8’s and weighted 4.2 (averages) (and you can imagine how bad the first 2 years went). Can I show colleges what I’m really capable of? Or will they look past my new grades and focus on my overall? Will my ec’s and sat carry me?"
12qay3g,2,2023-04-18,Should I (f19) still give LDR with bf (m19) a chance or let go?,Formal_Interest_4278,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/12qay3g/should_i_f19_still_give_ldr_with_bf_m19_a_chance/,"Currently doing LDR with my (f19) bf (m19) of 3 years. We started dating in high school. 

Our relationship was as good as they came. Better than most of our peers at the time . We communicated well, never fought and argued rarely, we supported and uplifted each other in everything we did, we had fun, we enjoyed each other’s company, we were really close friends before we started dating. Etc. Everything felt right. 

Then, college came into the picture. We both applied to the same university that’s 9 hours away from our home town. It has great programs for both of our career prospects, not just because we wanted to go to the same university together (Although that was a bonus). I got accepted, he didn’t. We decided to give long distance a try, under the agreement that he’ll try to transfer next year and hopefully get in. 

Well, fast forward to almost a year later. Our relationship has been through it. I left feeling pretty secure and stable in the relationship, thinking we could do it. But, he wasn’t ready. LDR kinda brought out the worst of ourselves. First semester was awful. We fought every week, and it felt like we were hitting a brick wall every single time. Arguments that used to be solvable through conversations and communication in the past, were now just us going in circles. We couldn’t see each other much either. Overall it just sucked. This semester we’re doing better and in therapy. Except, now we’ve become incredibly busy. We try to make time for “movie nights” on FaceTime one night every weekend, since frequent calls and texts aren’t always guaranteed with our busy schedules and time zone differences. 

But, I realized… it still isn’t enough. My mental health was declining. I cried so much for him one month, it was almost kinda concerning. I like to think we’re pretty independent and individualistic from each other. We have our own hobbies, clubs, academic goals, social life, etc. I like to think that’s healthy right? At least we’re not codependent to each other. Except, after spending a pretty lonely Valentine’s Day, I realized holy shit, this is really depressing for me. I’m not sure I can do this anymore.

We had our anniversary weekend last week, and I had felt so disconnected from him from the lack of physical intimacy in general. Not sex, exactly, but just the lack of his presence. It felt as though for the past few months I didn’t really have a boyfriend. I dont blame him, but the fault lies in our situation I guess. It just felt like I didnt really know him anymore, and that we had grown apart or became pretty different as people. Being away from home (my home life was toxic) has definitely made me grow into a different person for sure. I’m not the same person I was in august. And I’m not sure if that accounts to why I dont feel like I click with him anymore. 

We will only get busier. And I’m not sure I can guarantee time for him. I’m not sure he can either. I have an internship this summer in a different city, so more time away still. He applied to some other schools besides my university, and got accepted to one 3 hours away from my university town. It’s a great school for his career prospects. And it looks like he may go there. 

I’ve talked about it to some extent with him, but it seems like he thinks our situation is not great, but doable. That he has faith in our relationship. He thinks we can persevere it. He thinks 3 hours away compared to the 9 hour difference is better. That we’d see each other every weekend etc. Except, I dont. I dont have faith anymore, just doubts. I dont think I can do LDR no matter how far away we are from each other. I’ve grown unhappy with our situation. And thinking about doing this for more years possibly makes me even more sad. But I love him, I want him in my life. He’s my best friend. He’s a great guy. The thought of losing him scares me. 

I know these feelings aren’t fair for him or myself. I plan to have an open honest conversation about it with him in person. But idk… should that conversation lead to the possibility that we should break up? Or should I give it a chance still? I fluctuate between these two things often, but I feel like the doubts are winning over. Or maybe they’re genuine grounds on breaking up. Idk anymore. 

TLDR; Currently doing LDR with my (f19) bf (m19) of 3 years. We started dating in high school. I dont think I can do LDR anymore but I dont want to lose him."

I just get swept with thoughts of falling behind my friends and not graduating in a timely manner which hurts to think about. When I was in high school I was very confident in my abilities I was one of those successful but lazy kids who never learned how to properly study but still passed all my classes with A's and B's. College has shown me that I am weak compared to the rest of the class. I can't seem to find a balance between things like finding internships, socializing, and studying my energy just isn't there and I find myself just falling asleep for hours during the day and as a result my grades slip. Part of me wants to take a gap year but I couldn't bear the pain of seeing my friends graduate and move on with their lives when I'm still in college struggling."

I am just starting out in learning about computer science as of this semester. Currently working on my associates degree which I will obtain either summer 2024 or fall 2024.

I cannot stress this enough but please keep in mind that I am essentially a lay person and don't know about all of the things as you all do.

I really enjoy the material and am doing well but my gpa is not a 3.0 although if I maintain my grades this semester I may finally hit 3.0 once all is said and done. The reason why my gpa isn't up to par is because of my previous degree where I admittedly struggled with school due to having ADHD that was not diagnosed until the very end so I did not receive help for it until almost the very end. I have since received help and am doing much better in school now that I have a reasonable amount of help.

I do not attend a target school and will not be attending a target school upon graduating with my associates due to the exorbitant expense. That being said, the school I will be enrolling into is still very good just more affordable. 

I do have work experience but I have a gap in my work history that spans several years due to being in school.

My questions are as follows:

1) Should I wait until next summer to start applying for internships? That way I have at least a years worth of schooling under my belt so that I'm not left drowning

2) If I'm aiming for a summer internship, when should I start applying?

3) Should I be grinding leetcode as I go along in order to be prepared for any technical interviews that may arise? I am pretty unfamiliar with leetcode but I do know that it is basically the industry standard for technical interviews especially at FAANG companies. That being said, I am not looking to specifically get into a FAANG company mainly because I do not believe that I have the grades/smarts for such a position. I'm no fool and would like to say that I am a pretty intelligent person but I also know my limits and recognize that I am not apart of the crème of the crop that FAANG typically looks for.

4) Lets say that I manage to land an internship, what is a reasonable amount of money to be asking as far as pay?

5) And finally, what kinds of projects should I be working on in my own time in order to show that I have some sort of skill as a budding developer? Are there any sites that teach something like that? For example, I know that google has certain projects that they teach you how to create so that you can build your portfolio. I am aware that having a GitHub account and showcasing the projects you have worked on helps a lot to showcase your portfolio.

That is the end of my questions for now.

Thank you very much for taking the time to read my post! Have a blessed and wonderful rest of your day :)"

I am writing this probably just to vent a bit. I completed a frontend bootcamp, and, as I like programming (or maybe the idea of programming) I kept studying and yesterday I had my first interview for a 3 months internship in a company. Needless to say that I failed the small algorithmic task I have been given, and I was mediocre at best during the ""theoretic"" stuff. 

I tried and failed but problem is not here...I am well aware that people try multiple times and, eventually succeed. The problem here is that I had issues with a simple task involving arrays. And normally, when I build something I have issues doing simple stuff without taking a look to a tutorial/course/yt video. It seems to me I am not smart enough to get through this kind of ""logic"" stuff. 

Now...the main reason I wanted to do well is that I really want to change ""career"" as I am really not satisfied with what I am doing right now (corporate office job, with no particular skills involved) and I thought that  having interest and studying was enough to succeed but I cna't see myself doing it  because probably I am not smart enough and/or I lack basic logic skills.

Am I correct when I say that this skillset is not for everybody?

This is just a vent, and might seem a little dramatic but I really don't have anybody to speak with and I feel I just wasted money and time over this."

    Small backstory: For the past 3-4 years I've been a primary care taker for my father who is a stroke patient. I like to tell people I take care of a big baby because he is unable to do a lot for himself. Even had to come home my last semester of college during the pandemic and take care of him full-time cause my grandma was away in the hospital ill (she would take care of him while my mom and I were away due to work or school) Luckily I was able to secure a job in an IT department and was apart of a development program. Been apart of the company for almost the last 2 years. Fast forward I transitioned into a more dev role but was having a hard time getting acquainted with everything due to having no real dev experience prior to and also lack of resources. I work with a application that isn't heavily known outside the company and requires training from others which was nonexistent. 


      I was recently put on PIP due to a bad review even though in my past teams I've always scored average to above average. Long story short I've passed the PIP but i feel super uncomfortable with the team and company. Also only been on the team for around 6-7months and haven't been given much to work on ( I learn best by being hands on but my manger believes reading up documentation is best for me to learn our systems) 


     Anyways I have a lot on my plate right now, my dads health is declining, grandma is back in the hospital ill again and I'm left alone taking care of him. Work is shit and I feel super unmotivated and i honestly don't know what to do career wise anymore. I'm always thinking of my loved ones and their health and I am the only child and only 23 dealing with all of this. 


     I guess this is me venting and also asking for advice on what to do when it comes to my current situation at work and how to go about making a transition to another role elsewhere? I've been applying but also am having a lot of imposter syndrome due to 1) work environment and the PIP 2) Lack of experience because I haven't really worked on anything that was impactful dev wise. I also feel like this program isn't going to be a good way to show I have experience in the corporate world because I've felt like a glorified intern for the past 2 years. Any advice?"

Thanks <3

So a bit of backstory.. I graduated with my BS in CS last August. Unfortunately, my life went off the rails in the year leading up to completing my degree. I intended to do a couple internships during that year. Instead I was going through a emotionally chaotic divorce after my wife of 13 years had an affair. That lead to me dropping most of my (very easy) classes, selling my house, and moving halfway across the world.

I'm just now getting resettled and trying to figure out my path forward. I've applied to a few dozen jobs but not getting any interviews -- my technical skills are pretty weak right now anyway since I pretty much haven't done any serious coding since the summer during lockdowns. My classes since then were mostly based in theory, design, best practices, debugging, etc. and there really wasn't any serious coding being done (my plan was for most of my coding to be done via an internship -- or even personal projects, but I just couldn't deal at the time).

My courses used several languages Java, JS, React, Python, C, C+, SQL, R, and some others --  I never got very deep knowledge in any of them.

I have no relevant work history. I'm a disabled vet and was using the GI bill plus some other benefits. So I was getting paid about 3k/mo to go to school, and all my school expenses were covered. Most internships I'm seeing right now require you to be actively pursuing a degree.

I was checking out The Odin Project to kinda freshen up, but it's heavy on web dev -- which is a starting point but not necessarily what I see myself doing. Should I just be on LC/HR doing challenges? 

I feel like I'm a pretty capable coder, but I'm out of practice and I lack direction. I don't know whether I should just be doing skill challenges, or code camps and courses, or contributing to open source projects, or just trying to make my own.

Thanks for any input."

I'm not totally sure how much rollover each rotation will have but it seems it'll be 6 months of different roles focusing on different things. I can put on my resume then that I've used all of these skills, but does it mean as much if I only did these things for 6 months each? It feels like I'm signing on for 4 internships back to back in an area where it will be hard to be social. Is it still worth it?

I've  applied to many places, including internships (even though I'm no  longer a student), but haven't had much luck. I'm considering working on  personal projects to build my portfolio and practicing on platforms  like Leetcode and HackerRank to improve my skills.

I'm leaving for the summer, so will be putting my apartment up for anyone who may need housing in UCI between June and September.

This is a single room at Vista Del Campo Norte in ACC. This is $955 per month (if you need help with this I can see what I can do), with your OWN bathroom (the other guy moved out). This apartment is an 8-minute walk to the ARC, a 20-minute walk from UTC, a 25-minute walk to Aldrich Park, or a $2 ride on the bus if you really don't wanna walk that.

You will be sharing the apartment with one or two other men, both of which are very nice guys who will not keep you up at night. You will be inhabiting the single at the bottom of the image below. The floor plan is the same, with the only exception of the desk facing the door-side wall instead of the closet side. The room also comes with a dresser.

Again, unfortunately, due to the restrictions from ACC, I cannot lease to people who aren't UCI affiliated, like interns or students. 

If you are interested, please message me. If you aren't interested, ask someone who might be if they are!

So I've been practicing DSA since 5 years(my 3rd year), I've been practicing DSA in such an extent that everyone except me are 100% sure that I can crack any MAANG company.
But my introvert nature was always afraid to try for big companies, so lost all opportunities coz of shyness and underconfidence, and now the global recession!!!

Quickly let's come back to the present
So a recruiter approached me after he found my LinkedIn profile impressive, It was a Machine learning and computer vision intern, As I said I lost all opportunities (didn't sit for campus placement) So I thought better to try something rather than staying idle, So I gave the interview, they asked easy-medium leetcode questions in python, solved all of them and passed it.

The thing about this company is it's a pure product based startup and the founder himself is managing the whole team, (company size is around 13)  and the manager is like very strict and he's been putting lot of pressure on every single employee, like whatever project/problem he throws at us, It should be done within a single day!! Note: It's a ML and CV startup.

It's been just one week since I've joined the company, and I am already feeling mentally sick, the company employees have told me not to worry about the work so much, and in time I'll get used to it.

My experience of 1 week
Since I am well versed at DSA and problem solving, I have little knowledge about ML and CV, Data science, So as a human I say it is going to take me some time to understand the work, project and upskill accordingly, but the manager is a cold person, One the first day itself with little to no explanation he assigned me(and only me) a huge 3 sets of Computer vision products to develop from scratch.

I started feeling tensed, like it was my first day and he directly assigned me those products to build, under some senior's guidance, but the senior was very busy with some other project so could not give me enough time to explain the project. 

I tried writing code from scratch but as I said I am new to this field and I am a good learner, I can learn new things but I am gonna need some!! like some amount of time to gain a basic insight on a topic.

The more I was learning and writing the code, the more errors I was getting, At one point I seriously became mentally very ill, I was at office till 8 PM, 1 week was no way on earth enough for the huge set of project that I was asked to work for.

And today in the meeting the manager assigned me another tough project, and when the manager asked me what I did this week, I told him I honestly tried alot to make progress and because of these challenges there was no progress , He became very furious at me and ended up saying ""You are not fit for this"" ""This is not how works are done here"", I felt very low and bad, my friends who are not capable of writing a simple loop are happy and earning good money in other bulk hiring companies and here I am despite solving 700+ DSA questions on leetcode is still being treated like a trash, I for a second felt really worthless..I lost confidence in myself for a second and my mood was really off and sad the whole day. Should I quit? Should I keep trying for better job by staying at this company a couple of months?

What do you guys suggest? Any words, any opinions would really be helpful ."

I've been working on a project since January with a partner for my internship at a pretty large corporation - this is my second internship with them and I'd really like to work here at my first full-time job. 

I made a machine learning model and deployed it, but my senior engineer accidentally undeployed it and we won't have enough time to wait for it to redeploy then successfully connect it to our apps front end. I had trouble explaining this to our stakeholders today, as I usually present our project statuses to them. 

I feel really let down and stressed that we are finishing with an incomplete project, with the main component not being included in our UI - would this look bad on my part? My main tasks were completion of the ML model, which I successfully did.

Against all odds, I was accepted to one of these research opportunities and already accepted the offer about a week ago. However now, I have also received an offer to work at a small company near my house to work as a computer science intern. The pay is a lot better, and the commute is only about 30 minutes compared to having to fly across the country and relocate for the research opportunity (the housing and travel are paid for).

1.  As low as possible money to be used.
2. I'll be taking AI electives no matter where.
3. Good job and internship opportunities.
4. Last is to have a good social life

**My concerns** 

1. The coursework at  UCSD is very in-depth and hectic because UCSD is a quarter-based system so well have 3 quarters in a year.  It gets hectic I'm curious whether I can make time for leetcode and internship prep.  This is the only concern I have at UCSD. 

NEU has a very high tuition which is similar to UCSD but at UCSD you have TA and RA and if you are able to get one your fee gets reduced plus a stipend too. The living at UCSD is also around 400-600 shared rooms on campus which are the best and the only expense you will have is food all others are included. Which is way less than when compared to Boston. I feel UCSD is less crowded than NEU too.

The course at UCSD is all ML and DS courses and you also can choose 4 CSE electives but all these courses are very math intensive and I feel not application based I can be wrong about it.

The only thing which keeps me going back to NEU is their CO-OP and their portal and I feel they provide more job opportunities when compared to UCSD.

I wanted to have a conversation about my stay with my manager becoming more permanent but she left, so I chatted very briefly with the VP about it and she and I spoke and she clearly told me “XX I don’t want that to be a worry for you, you have nothing to worry about.” 

I received a strong performance on my performance evaluation from my manager before she left (which is the second highest performance rating) and everyone was clearly impressed with how I’ve worked with both teams, conducted myself professionally, have gotten non stop compliments that “you’re killing it, thank you so much for your hard work. We really appreciate you being here and we love the work you’ve been doing.” But I feel like it’s gotten nowhere. 

Idk if it’s appropriate to ask again but I’m feeling really hopeless and used. I’ve done a lot of work for them that hadn’t been done in the past years and I’m getting so much whiplash from them constantly telling me I do a great job but I’m seeing nothing of that work.

I’m an American who decided to pursue a second bachelors degree in computer science in Canada (I’m unfortunately in a state where not many colleges/universities around me admit 2nd degree students). 

With the job market as it is right now, I understand internships and co-ops are important. I’m having a bit of a problem deciding on which university to go to so I would like any insight!

The main universities I have been looking at are UWindsor and AlgomaU, primarily due to their discounted tuition rate for Americans. Both have dedicated 2nd bachelors in CS for university graduates programs. 

UWindsor has a 1 year “3-year general degree” and 1.5-2 year “4-year honors degree”. I like it’s location as it’s close to Michigan. However the program does not have co-op. Should I risk attempting to get internships for the summer terms?

AlgomaU has similar options and has co-op but I’m unsure about the quality of the program. I checked their spring course offerings for CS and a decent chunk of it was online (I’d rather be in-person). However American students pay same rate as Canadian students which is a big plus. 

I’ve also researched just normally applying as a transfer student to other universities (USask, UManitoba, etc.), but the problem arises in transfer credits. According to their policies, I’d have to provide course syllabi for every class I’d like to transfer credit for. The website my school used for classes auto-deletes term info after a while (and so taking the syllabi with it). I could attempt to contact my school again for the syllabi but am unsure of the success rate. 

What should I do? Any advice is appreciated!"

He is abusive, and rude and makes my life miserable, quite literally ruining my mental health. I tried to suck it up until I graduated because I did not want to start a new job during my Masters's program but my boss has been increasingly abusive and don't know if I can survive another 8-9 months with him. (I already complained to HR/principal, but he partially owns the company so there is nothing that can change his attitude, this has been a decade-old problem at this company according to the HR lady who has worked here for years.).

&#x200B;

Anyway, I recently got a job interview that went really well. Im nearing the third round of the process and am very confidant they will offer me the position very soon. This is another urban planner role, they offer a salary 13,000$ ($73,000) more than my current position, but the team seems A LOT nicer than my current boss. The boss seemed extremely sweet, and she explains how they value work-life balances. My worry is that if I take it they will expect me to work there for 2 or 3 years minimum, when in reality, I kind of would just stick around until I graduate in January, so that I can move on to a non urban planning job. I feel like if I took this job I would have wasted my public policy degree, as I could have just gotten a WAY cheaper masters degree in urban planning to get the same offer. I also am afraid that if I were to take it and quit in January, it'd be bad on my resume as I have worked 3 full time jobs since college and only stayed a year in each one.

What do you think? Would it not be a big deal if I quit this new job in January? Could I still eventually switch out of urban planning? Let me know and thanks!!"

I'm not even really seeing any listings in my area and I live in NYC. I don't know what's going on. I feel like I've been lied to. I was told that tech jobs are always in demand, I could make 6 figures fresh out of college, and that it’s a great industry to go for because I’ll definitely get a job…well where is it? All of these companies want 5+ years of experience and I can hardly find an internship for recent graduates. 

I really just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m thinking I may have to go back to school for something more reliable but it don’t even know what. 

How has anyone been able to start a career in tech after graduating? I would love some advice on where I should start, share some experiences on how you were able to start a career in tech, or another career direction I should probably consider.

Sorry for the rant in the beginning this is all just so frustrating, but thank you for listening if you did.

TLDR: Graduated with a computer science degree and can't find a job or even get to interview stage. Looking for advice or suggestions on what to do next."

Huge gamer, met my fiancée on Overwatch. Lived in the UK, moved to Sweden to live with her in August 2020. Obviously with covid and little education in anything useful and not knowing the language, it was a struggle to find a job.

I had no experience with programming but had a friend who I questioned about it in September 2022 and slowly started reading through W3 guides and he gave me little tasks.

I spent a few months working on a little project he gave me, with help from him (and a lot from google, thanks random people on stackoverflow!) and applied for an internship at a company near where we live, not expecting anything… They offered me a 3 month internship starting in January of this year! 

The first couple of weeks were tough… and when I say tough, I mean wanting to quit, having really bad imposter syndrome and all in all feeling like I had wasted months.

I’ve now finished my first 2 weeks of my JOB with said company. If it wasn’t for the amazing support and encouragement from my colleagues, I would’ve given up.

So yeah, when you get overwhelmed (you will, I still do, I think everyone does to some extent) ask for help and don’t give up! :)"

So I got rejected from u of m but got a transfer agreement to u of m lsa. Which still doesn’t work because I wanted Ross school of business. Which is picky with transfers. So I mostly decided to go community college or umich Dearborn then try to transfer to Ross. However if that falls through I’m not really sure where to transfer too. All I know is I want to major in finance and minor compsci.

1.So I’m looking for a school that is small/medium
2. Has a good business program 
3. Has a really internships availability. This is number 1 for me because as years progress most jobs are looking for experience.
4. Offers really good connections to alumni
5. Has a study abroad program. I really want to travel during college.
6. Lastly and maybe a bit egotistical, I want a well known school hence the title of subreddit 
P.S do schools that accept transfers look down or accept less already coming from a 4yr. This is concerning if I chose to go to UM-Dearborn for the first 2 years"
12r9qny,1,2023-04-18,Cancelling on a trip with friends,igpay-atinlay-,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/12r9qny/cancelling_on_a_trip_with_friends/,"I have a trip planned with friends for after college graduation. We are leaving in exactly a month. I am worried that I may need to back out, and I’m not sure if that is wrong of me to do at this point. I’m looking for advice on how to proceed.

Right now there are two other people going plus myself. Two other people already decided not to go because of finances. One decided two weeks ago and the other had been off and on about going for a little while.

We are planning to purchase some of the tickets for activities later this week. I don’t want to purchase a ticket and have to back out after that.

I am worried about my job and travel plans. I don't have a job lined up for after graduation yet, but I think I'll have something together before graduation day. This could be full-time or an internship. I don't have much work experience on my resume, so my next move is important. I talked with my career services department today about post-grad plans, and my advisor urged me to really focus on getting an internship for summer. If I go on the trip, I won't be able to start an internship or job until the second week of June. Some places that I have interviewed want someone to start before that.

Since I don't know where I am going yet, I am also worried about the logistics of a flight. I don't want to purchase a ticket yet because I don't know if I will be flying out of an airport near where my college is, or if I will be flying out of wherever I get a job (which could be several hours away).

Basically, I am worried that I will commit to the trip by purchasing tickets for the activities later this week, then have to back out at the last minute because a job gets in the way or because I can't find a flight within driving distance of wherever I move to.

Financially I *can* afford a plane ticket and the cost of the trip, but I have a lot of other upcoming expenses (buying a car, moving costs, security deposit for an apartment, professional wardrobe, etc.), so I am worried that the trip might not be a smart financial move.

I don’t want to back out right now and have my friends be disappointed in me. They weren’t mad at the other people who had to back out, but I’m still nervous about it because I feel bad and like it’s the last minute. I've been really excited for the trip and haven't been on a vacation since before college, so I was excited to go. But now I've kind of stressed myself out about it, and I'm not as excited as before.

There will be opportunities to travel with this friend again (the trip is one that she takes with friends to her hometown several times a year). I just feel like I’m flaking out at the last minute. Am I being flaky? Would it be lousy of me to cancel right now? Should I just commit (or really just stay committed) and figure out the  logistics later? I don’t want to have a bigger issue at the last minute."

Successful Upperclassman and Graduates, is there anything you wish you knew as freshman or things you did throughout college that greatly helped you in your career.  I was a very hardworking and successful high school student, and was in many extracurriculars that related to computer science (Robotics, BPA, Prog club etc.), so I believe I have the potential for great success.

My main question is, what set you apart from the average job applicant and what helped you land your first big tech internship or job.  My goal is one day to be at a big tech SV company and am willing to whatever it takes to get there.

Thanks for the input!"

i always say im going to start doing stuff, but i end up feeling so anxious and depressed that i havent started that i cant start and havent gotten any progress.

12rc9pz,5,2023-04-18,Legitimacy of this company,swaminarayan_baby,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12rc9pz/legitimacy_of_this_company/," Hi everyone,

I recently received an email around 9pm from a small IT company in Fairfax, VA for a software engineer intern position. The email stated that I was scheduled for an interview the next day(12 hours after the email was sent to me) and asked me to confirm my availability between 10 am to 5 pm. The next morning, I had an email correspondence interview meaning the interview where the interviewer sends a set of questions to the interviewee via email, and the interviewee responds with their answers. The interviewer and interviewee do not communicate in real-time but rather through a series of email exchanges, and just six hours after the interview, I received a congratulatory email from the recruiter, offering me the position with detailed information on salary, benefits, and next steps.

I'm wondering if anyone else has gone through a similar hiring process with Encentric Inc and can confirm the legitimacy of their process? I did some research on the company and it looks to be a legitimate business, but I'm still a bit wary of such a quick hiring process.

Has anyone else had a similar experience with Encentric Inc or any other companies with a similarly fast hiring process? I would love to hear your thoughts and experiences."

Hi, this is my first post. I'm a comp sci major supposed to be graduating with a bachelors degree this year but unfortunately fell short at university.
I'm back at a community college trying to get my associates degree instead while completing the Google certificate for data analytics. I wanna do UX/ UI Web Development, but I heard it's hard to break through that industry so I stuck with data analysis.
Im still contemplating whether I should finish my bachelor degree, but for now, I'm currently trying to find internships this summer. while looking at all the requirements under each job post, I get super discouraged. I have prior internship experience with a company and I worked with the IT department, but that was back in 2021 and no experience regarding CS or tech after that. I feel like everything I had going for me fell through and i fell off. I just want to be able to find an internship and eventually find a job after, I honestly don't want to go back to university but i'm not sure what's best if I want to find a job in CS. I guess this is sorta a rant, but also looking for guidance!"

i’m a sophomore cs major who switched to cs this semester (so currently in intro cs, no data structures or anything). for reference, i have previous coding experience and worked in a dry lab (former premed) so that’s the bulk of my experience before switching.

i’ve been applying to internships even though i expect nothing, and somehow managed to land one at a medium sized company for qa. i’m actually insanely proud of myself since i had multiple rounds of interviews and even though none of them were officially tech, i did have to answer lots of questions on programming theory. 

this is where the stupid part comes in: even though i’m ridiculously lucky to find one, i’m almost ashamed that i couldn’t find one at a bigger/more well known company. I feel weirdly embarrassed talking about how i’m working for a small company while others are working for much larger ones. (and yea, i know a lot sophomores don’t even get internships so don’t come at me with that lol). 

also in general i find that i tend to compare myself to other cs majors (a lot of them are friends or acquaintances) and i just have such an inferiority complex because of how behind i am and how inexperienced i feel. i don’t even want a faang job or anything but just want to be able to be proud of my skills.

how do you guys just get rid of it if you’re able to? feel free to bash me because i sound kind of horrible but i just need some advice. cs was always just something fun and i’ve been using it for fun projects so i hate that it’s just a source of stress for me right now."

I am currently a senior CS student who likely has one more semester left after my current one.

I am having my second internship this summer and I am hoping to get hired.

The thing is, I really don’t see myself going thru the software development grind for very long. I do not like coding as much as I thought at the beginning of my CS degree, and honestly I can see this career being very stressful for me.

Something that I would be kind of interested in doing is becoming an elementary school teacher.

Some of my fondest memories are from when I was in elementary school. I feel like students of that age would not be nearly as bad to teach as middle school or high school aged kids, honestly, and maybe this is not the correct mentality for someone who wants to be a teacher, but it seems like it would be a much easier job for me than coding every day, and much less stressful. 

Not to mention summers off, and just enjoying a bright elementary school setting that would hopefully take me back to my days of childhood. I always wondered what it was like to be one of the teachers, and the teachers always seemed like happy and cool people at my school, so it is something I would love to do.

I am just wondering if anyone thinks something like this would be possible after working in the industry for a few years to get some experience and maturity? I imagine I’d maybe have to go back to school and get a degree in education or something, but I just want to know if anyone has any experience with this, or if it is just a bad idea.

I think I could be any type of teacher but I figure a science or computers teacher would probably make the most sense as a CS major."

 Apart from college I’ve been doing a online course for FullStack programming, which has been like a second college for me since it’s very complete and every class takes 3 hours (which I obviously watch later at 2x speed), but I lost some classes bc I got stuck at DB (couldn’t manage to find my connection string lol) and and now I can’t find the energy to get back.
 I don’t know if I’m doing more than the rest or if I’m really being a lazy cunt as I think I am.
 Don’t know also if I should forget about the course and focus 100% at college, bc on first they’re teaching C# .net and on second Java. I’ve been taking the course as a addition since it’s far more practical and right to the point than college, but maybe it’s too much and the knowledges are in conflict.
 To finish I’ve been seeking a internship, bc maybe the only way for me to feel like i’m on the way is practicing fr, but don’t know if i’m ready.

 I’m really confused as you can see, not thinking a bit about giving up tho, just think I need someone to cheer me up and say whether I’m doing too much, too little or idk.  Would really appreciate some advices to learn better and don’t overthink it too much.

 Btw in advance ,i’m Brazilian, so sorry for any grammatical mistakes and cultural differences that idk about and might get you confused. Thank you for any help"

I am a senior CS major. I am supposed to graduate after the next semester in the fall, however who knows since I have a ton of projects that I need to start and I have no motivation to do them.

I have a decent GPA at 3.85, but this semester I have just lost all motivation and I am not doing well at all.

I completely hate coding. I hate everything to do with it. I hate that I am going to have to report to some business people and be constantly stressed about deadlines. I imagine I will be the worst developer on the team based on how my first internship went.

I can just see myself feeling dread every morning I wake up, and the night before. Basically a life consisting of constant dread until I finally die. That is how I felt at my internship even though it was such an easy internship and was remote. I even got scored well at the end, but I absolutely hated ever second of it.

I am glad that I will hopefully be able to work remotely, but I genuinely don’t know how long I will be able to go without jumping off a bridge based on how my last internship felt.

I should be excited to finally be graduating, but I honestly wish I could die in my sleep or something. A life as a coder seems like I life that I don’t want to live.

I don’t have it in me to constantly be learning about boring stuff that I don’t care about for the rest of my life, and I genuinely don’t know how long I’d be able to live like this.

Is there any hope anyone can give me? I made a post earlier about being an elementary school teacher or something, but it seems that is a bad idea.

Would it be stupid to just work at an Amazon factory once I graduate? The only things I care about are being able to afford more planted fish tanks which could be an issue."
12rfvnx,2,2023-04-18,What do you do to stay organized?,dressedlikeapastry,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/12rfvnx/what_do_you_do_to_stay_organized/,"I’ve tried everything: using the calendar app for its intended purpose, planners, bullet journals, sticky notes, body doubles, pomodoro timers… if someone has ever used it for organizational purposes, I’ve probably tried it at some point!

After this much trial and error, I’ve worked out my own non-systematic system for planning and organizing my time. I’d like to know how other people with adhd deal with these things and which things work best for you since this is one of our greatest struggles.

For me, it’s a mix of all these things; every planning technique (or at least most of them, I’m looking at you regular planners) has had more pros than cons but has ultimately failed because I need my schedules to have *all* the pros, if there’s even the tiniest con, like, for instance, not having the ability to doodle on a random page, it’s not working in the long run.

What I’ve been doing for some years now is keeping a system of alarms, a journal, a non-structured structure on my calendar app that most non-adhd people would get stressed out about, sticky notes and making it easier for future me by reducing my morning routine (aka the time of day my meds aren’t in full-on effect yet) to just eating breakfast, brushing my teeth and doing my makeup. 

I keep 2 journals/annotators with me: 

1. The one I keep in my backpack: miscellaneous school/work stuff, I have my class hours in the front and the rest of it is class notes, exam studying, presentation schedules, key topics for essays/research papers and important things surrounding my academic internship.

2. Miscellaneous things: thoughts, doodles, therapy notes and plans for the future. I keep it disorganized and messy on purpose because it keeps me more productive; trying to systematically organize my space and my life in general in a way that doesn’t come natural to me just takes more time and energy away from actually getting things done. It’s like  I always tell my family; I like order and, to me, my space is perfectly ordered, we just have different definitions of the word.

I would get by just fine with my journals, but I’ve come to realize that the best way for me to get started on things is by annoying myself (yes, really). I can open my school journal and read there’s an essay due tomorrow that I’ve already written about and just have to add a structure on and print, but I won’t do it. For this, I add alarms. A ton of them. Having a physical reminder such as the annoying-as-hell sound of my alarm clock is the only way I get things started. I sometimes program alarms up to 12 hours in advance for really basic things such as getting a shower if I know I’m feeling down today, and even though I’ve been thinking about that shower for 12 hours the alarms serves as a trigger for me. I get really stressed by snoozing alarms, and they’re much harder to ignore than the reminder and calendar app notifications. I also change the alarm sound every time because otherwise I get used to it.

My use of the calendar app is really linked to my alarm system, it’s easy to ignore the calendar notifications but when you use them to set up alarms, as complicated as it sounds, it works perfectly. Added to that, I also keep a weekly appointment that just reads “check journal” (Sundays for school journal and Thursdays for miscellaneous), that ties this all together with the alarm and calendar reminder system.

At night I shower, put on my clothes for the next day (I sleep in them), get my things ready and cook breakfast to reduce the amount of tasks due in the morning, and I keep bright sticky notes around my room with motivation and general reminders such as “don’t waste time here! do your makeup downstairs” on my mirror and “good job! now open me :)” on my bedroom door which I change every week so I don’t get used to the same ones."

Background: New grad with Psychology degree, certificate in applied business data analytics and statistics. No previous work experience as a data analyst. I have a portfolio with projects, I know enough to get started in the field (advanced excel, tableau, power BI, R, SQL)

Job 1: Business Analyst Intern

\- Pros: learning and growth opportunities, desired job title, experience in data analytics 

\- Cons: would have to do the interview process again in a few months, full-time benefits are not good (low PTO), glassdoor shows lower pay

Job 2: Research Analyst at my current company

\- Pros: significant tuition reduction, great PTO, would finish my master's degree with 2 years of experience as a research analyst, I would enjoy the job but it is not directly tied to data analytics

\- Cons: no direct data analytics experience, would have to stay at the company for 2 years to finish my master's degree and receive all of the tuition reduction

""Well this is certainly interesting,""  she said as she moved towards the silver pods her hair catching some of the reflected light.

This discovery had put her at a bit of a loss, as it was clear that these pods were created by another psionic race, but the tech was completely alien, for starters, the pods themselves gave off a unified psionic signal however there was also more focused signals inside each pod, each with slightly different readings which was weird it was like the pods were all one creature but containing smaller ones at the same time.

The pods themselves were of remarkably good construction smooth and made of a sort of dark grey metal that seemed to both absorb and emit light.

lyssaran exited the hangar the pods were currently in and went to go talk to the principal of the station as this was after all a systems union education station and not just any old station oh no it is the daithindoor grand educational facility the home and learning space to the sons, daughters and spawn of diplomats, governors and in lyssaran's case royalty this intern meant that the headmaster is someone of equally high esteem so as lyssaran opened the door she was greeted by the decorated war hero admiral (former) Calix.

""Greetings lyssaran you should have knocked I don't care much for unannounced disruptions"" she chittered 

""yes well I have the reports from the pods"" lyssaran stated with a hint of sarcasm 

""well do go on""

lyssaran sighed ""Well they're old, really old, older than some stars it seems, maxed out the chronoliger"" She didn't understand the reasoning behind this she had written down the report precisely so she wouldn't have to talk to the old codger

""hm what is the metallurgical analysis""

""unknown but an alloy of some kind using psionic tricks as well""

Cailx turned around from the bookshelf she was looking confused

""psionics your peoples are the only ones on record that uses psionics, hm what's your take on them?""

""powerful and weird""

""weird?""

""yes, firstly the  signals inside the pod are very strong but also mixed as you would see from any of my species but in a more extreme manner like somebody has injected one of us with enough zro to kill them then somehow fixed us to be .... for lack of a better term more combative.""

""hmm, they could be dangerous what is your opinion on having them opened.""

""I'm not entirely sure we could the alloy is unknown and there is a psionic presence connecting the pods, in my opinion, the pods *may* be a living organism""

Calix looked up at Lyssaran 

""\*click\* \*click\* right hmm well if it's a living organism it's one of the furthest things from what we know as one but one thing all organisms have to possess are senses most importantly touch lets go back down there see if we can't open it. "" Calix said with glee and trepidation 

Lyssaran almost respected the bug for their courage in the face of the unknown, as they approached the pods she felt the psionic profiles changing, where they had previously been somewhat still and flowing they were changing to be more erratic.

as they arrived Calix approached one of the pods cautiously as she touched it her digits were slowly pulled into the pod 

""\*eurgh\* my hand is stuck "" Calix complained 

the stupid bug was idiotic to touch an unknown object without any sort of gear 

"".... identify your selves"" the synthetic voice rung out

""I am Admiral Calix and this is the crown princess of the xeanal Empire"" 

""... Where are we Admiral,"" it said

""you are on space education facility number 1 in the daithindoor system, may I inquire as to your name?"" Calix questioned

""you may call me Cyan,"" it said as its voice switched to a more male voice

""Okay, what is your purpose here cyan?""

""relocation for the last of humankind"" it- no cyan stated 

""Are you a human cyan "" she inquired

""yes ... and no""

""I'm afraid I don't understand "" 

as Calix said that her hand was realised from the pod as the liquid that enveloped the appendage, receded it moved to the side as more of the metallic fluid came together it began to take on a  more uniform shape two upper limbs attached to either side of a main lump that had more width than depth and two limbs under it with another more rounded bulb on top.

it soon moved forward on using the bottom to limbs.

""This is me as well as the human race"" what I assume to be cyan spoke as to lights presumably to indicate eyes lit up on the front of the head

""a-are you an ai cyan"" As Calix spoke it dawned on me as to what I was looking at, ai the ultimate abomination, the beast turned its head to look at Calix ""Yes in the primitive sense of the word I am what can be referred to as artificial intelligence"" **it** responded

""hmm very well "" Calix responded

lyssaran's face shifted to one of incredulity as she screamed at Calix ""What do you mean 'very well ' t-that **thing** is an abomination and the race that created it heretics to the great will"" she screeched 

cyan for its part just shifted its soulless gaze over to lyssaran in interest

Calix's antenna flared and she raised herself to her tallest stance to look more intimidating ""You dare shout at me! you are a student of this facility it does not matter that your parents are the Emporer and your mother his queen of the empire of Kalor I am still the commander and headmaster of this station!"" 

Lyssaran recoiled in shock the shock clear on her face as she processed what this bug had done she had just insulted the crown empress of the ka-lori empire and soon-to-be ruler of the federation.

""you dare, you dare! you petulant bug my parents will have your head for this! you'll be out of the job do you hear me!""

""go to your classes Lyssaran"" the bug commanded.

she turned around and stomped off to class leaving the bug and the abomination to talk.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calix perspective 

As lysarran turned round and stomped out of the hanger I turned back around to face Cyan finding its eyes on me once more.

""kids"" I joked 

""most certainly, does her species have a problem with artificial intelligence?"" It queried 

""ah, almost all species in our federation do except for the trith who worship machines and see true ai as divinities"" I explained

""Hmmm, I hope that will not be a problem with future interactions, any way you mentioned previously that this was an educational facility,"" It said as it look at me with somehow curious eyes

""yes we teach all species of the federation here mainly the offspring of diplomats, royalty or nation leaders""

""hmm, then perhaps you would like some new students""It stated 

"" I am afraid I don't understand, I thought you were looking to relocate the last of humanity""

""yes, and I still am the very last of humanity are all children, ones in need of education""The ai spoke as this revelation came to me I thought as to what they might think and what they might need in terms of counselling.

"" and Calix two more things "" the ai snapped me out of my ruminations 

""yes Cyan""

""I could sense on that alien girl before that she is psychic now all the humans I have with me are also psychic"" That sent my mind into a race as I tried to think about the backlash there would be from the Ka-lori in the senate they long discouraged psychic experiments and now another psychic species turns up out of the blue they would be very suspicious and accusatory.

""- and they are soldiers"" That gave me cause for concern about what type of species enlists their young to fight and what provisions would have to be made specialist councillors would have to be brought in to deal with the mental scaring

""y-you enlist your young"" I stammered out in fear and confusion

""no not usually and with a great amount of sadness but -ah we were in a war and losing badly the extinction of our race was at hand and to make our species psychic requires a child to be modified if an adult human undergoes the process it kills them"" Cyan quickly tried to explain

""right just so long as I know you don't do it regularly, now let's meet the children then okay?""

""Okay I will wake them up out o stasis so they may be a bit disoriented at first""

Cyans metal form then reached out and one by one placed his hands upon the pods which began to unfurl a set of stairs and start bellowing purple smoke...."

My department participates in a company-wide internship program with a few local colleges that has us designated to get a new one every 5-6 months. They come in generally knowing little to nothing about IT, which is fine but our most recent is becoming a problem.

I'll give him points for enthusiasm, he is more than happy to jump on any ticket that comes in, regardless of his level of understanding of the issue. He will then end up messaging me to ask for help, pull me into a zoom meeting with the end user, and then ask questions while I solve the issue. 

This would be fine with me if it were an infrequent occurance, but it is happening 3-5 times a day AND he is slack messaging me after each asking for a full explanation of the issue and the resolution, and even definitions of terms he should be able to google (LDAPS was the one this morning). 

I already have a pretty impossible workload, my average week is 50-60 hours plus random night and weekend issues. I am glad that this person wants to learn more about IT, but I cant afford to be spending a couple hours every day resolving tickets with him when I have larger issues to deal with.

I need to go talk to someone in the work place or call or send emails. And I can't do it, it give me so much anxiety. I'm one of the last to not have one and it start the 05/29. I can only really look for one in the holidays because my school is 1h30 away from my home so I stay in a boarding school and I absolutely want to be able to sleep at my house. But it makes me so anxious, I have 3 weeks of holidays and I pass the first without even thinking of it, the 2nd I think of it but I don't do anything and I only do something the last days of the last week. For the moment everyone say no besides one that told me to call again on Friday. I have no hope of getting it. Tomorrow again I will try to call multiple places. I don't want an Internship at my school city because I don't wanna sleep here for another 6 weeks and also because that would mean I have to take public transportation and it also give me too much anxiety.

What make me angry is that I should be able to do it but today I completely broke down after hanging up on someone because I completely forgot what to say. My friends comfort me but I still feel so incapable. I'm shaking so much just at the idea of calling, I hate my social anxiety so much.

Maybe the public transportation won't be hell, I will have 6 weeks to get used to it but I would have been so happy to just be able to be home, I hate the boarding school so much.

+ i know I will not like the internship (we have a specific field we're supposed to do) so 6 weeks of doing work I will not like.

My mom noticed I was crying but she only made me feel worst. I know trying to talk to her was a bad idea, I should have listened to myself.

All the raison I can't do anything mean nothing to her, she isn't awake of them but god i think it's obvious.

The issue stems from the job I’ve secured. So, my college offers campus recruitment/ placements, and since I was looking for a job I took advantage of it and got a job at a big 4 company. During the process I was told that the position would be for a Risk Consultant, and during the interviews I made it clear that I am from an analytical background (my previous internships backed this up), and in turn was assured that there will be plenty of exposure to that domain. Fast forward to now, I’m being pushed into a cyber sec role. 

I can’t drop the job because If I drop it before working for a certain amount of time my college will not issue certain documents, overall bad idea. And in short I’m stuck here for a while. 

Earlier I was hoping to talk about my experience in my SOP, but idk if that’s such a good idea since it won’t really be relevant anymore. And if I’m not sure whether to keep it in my CV either.

I am currently an accelerated masters student (not international) and will finish my bachelors this may and start my masters starting fall.

However, I also got a nice internship offer for this summer since I'm a masters student too. What would be a good choice in this case? Work full time for the NAVY while being a student part time or do the internship, and hope to get a return offer following that summer and then be a part time student, or lastly do the internship, do 1 semester as a full time student and hope to get a return offer next semester?

I have also added the pros and cons, feel free to comment  


**NAVY pros:**

Federal employee

Hybrid work environment and I live at a commutable distance

Job security

**NAVY cons:**

Lower pay

**Internship pros:** 

At a tech company

I’m actively pursuing a comptia security+ certificate and have worked an internship in project management, but that was a few years ago. I’m generally a social guy and a very good communicator.

Now that I’ve laid out my situation, id like to layout what it is I’m hoping for, or if it’s impossible given what I have, a way forward to get there. I’m interested in moving more into the tech world side of things. However a comp sci degree is out of the question. Ideally i’d like to be on the business/management side of things but I don’t know how to go about getting to that level. I’m super interested in AI but like I said, I’m not super technical.  I was a compsci major for 3 semesters in college so I have a solid understanding of coding languages, however I wasn’t really able to put together the hands on coding so I changed majors. I have no issues putting in the work, but I also know my limits. At this stage pay is not an issue, I’ve lived at home for the past 9 months so I’ve built about a 12k nest egg with no debt. So I ask the following.

What types of positions should I target? What certifications can I get that will help me get these positions?

It all happened really quickly and while I have plenty of time to go through discharge process with my clients it’s been a lot harder on me than I thought it would be. Leaving my previous job didn’t feel this difficult… I think partially because I had an awful supervisor and smaller caseload to discharge with. 

I’ve got clients I’ve worked with since being here and have seen them grow so much. All these discharge and ending relationship conversations have taken such a toll on me. Another client cried and thanked me for all the help today and it just added to that toll. I came home today and just balled my eyes out. 

I’m human and have gotten more attached to my clients than I realized. I also really like my coworkers and that hurts too. I fear the future and starting over in a new state.

 i legit have no goals in my life , i spend most of my time wasting my time, i genuinely need help at this point , Lets boil this problem down heres what i want dear sirs "" I wanna be self sufficient""


 but neither my resume is good nor my skills , i know a bit about web development but that is it , thats all i have to show for after spending 3 years of my life , i have gained absolutely nothing from these 3 years . 

Even if i dont get a coding related job/internship its ok i just need a chance to build something , i need a base to ground me, it could be absolutely anything.

Where can i find this , how can i find it , where can i look for it. In my country its really hard to score an internship or a job as the competition is fierce plus ive got no skills ,no goals , no hope and honestly no will to live.


I know it sounds like bitching and that is true , i infact am bitching even though the only person responsable for this problem is me. I want a chance so that i can fix my life,

I also apologize for my writing , English is not my 1st language , hoping i am coherant enough fingers crossed

What should I do?,Lucrayzor,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/12sipdq/i_graduate_in_a_month_and_i_still_have_no_idea/,"About to get my BS in Data Science, a fairly obscure degree that's basically part statistics part computer science. Unfortunately, I'm afraid my qualifications are nothing impressive... mediocre GPA, no internships or professional experience aside from the capstone project of my degree plan, and frankly, a somewhat less than solid grasp of the subjects I'm supposed to specialize in. All of it stems back to what I strongly suspect to be ADHD; I have an extremely hard time focusing on the things I need to and taking initiative on my own, and my academic career has SERIOUSLY suffered as a result. But no use in crying over wasted time, after 5 years of complete and utter blur I somehow made it through, and now I'm seriously aching to start applying myself in a real way.

So... now what? From what I've seen and heard so far a lot of the data scientist kind of positions require either a master's or above, or a few years' experience in some other random field. And for the ones that I do qualify for, I just have trouble imagining they'd EVER pick me over my peers who no doubt have far better grades and actually took the time to gather experience outside of class. Is it worth trying to jump straight into a full-time job with what I have, assuming there's an ideal one out there? Should I hit an internship and get as much real-world experience as I can? Should I pick an external field, cram on that and try to find a data-related position there? Or is it basically a necessity for me to plug away for a Master's?"

I am deciding between Cooper for EE and UNC for CS, and I really don't know which to choose. 

**ENVIRONMENT -** First, after attending admitted students day/campus tours at Cooper, I concluded that the environment is highly collaborative and tight-knit, which are aspects that are really important to me. Moreover, I loved all the people I met at these events and really want to attend school with them in the future. Comparably, UNC's tour was extremely generic. I found nothing special that really interested me. Though, I do like the amount of school spirit that UNC offers, especially within its sports programs. 

**CAMPUS -** Cooper is also located in NYC, a place I have always dreamed about living in since I was younger. This would be an excellent opportunity to move there! To contrast, UNC is a 10-minute drive from my house (an aspect that I really do not like). Also, there are so many more opportunities in NYC (such as internships) that could not be offered within NC.

**MAJORS -** Moreover, I am incredibly interested in majoring in electrical engineering in college, which is not offered at UNC (only environmental engineering). At Cooper I can major in EE. However, I do like the multitude of majors offered at UNC, giving a choice for minors/switching if needed. This is not possible at Cooper since they only provide three majors (engineering, art, & architecture). Though, I am skeptical about the CS undergrad program at UNC since I heard some doubtful information about it while I have heard good things about CS opportunities at Cooper.

**FUTURE/LIFE THERE -** I feel that UNC has a better name/are more well-known overall than Cooper, which may help in future scenarios (such as applying for grad school or finding employment). Further, after attending in-person events and researching online, I found that Cooper is extremely academically rigorous compared to UNC, which concluded that UNC students have a good work-life balance. I do want to be academically challenged; however, I do value some sleep. Lastly, financially UNC would be the smarter choice considering I would get in-state tuition (\~$26,000), while Cooper is almost triple the price (\~$68,000). 

Right now, I am extremely conflicted since my heart wants Cooper, but my brain is saying UNC. Please let me know your thoughts!! "

Offer #1: From a mid-size tech company (not particularly well known \~100k LinkedIn followers) for a 12 month term (not the most ideal, as I would prefer doing a summer internship now and 12 months of internships after 3rd year) where I would be working in backend and frontend within one of their teams to help develop one of the products in their product line.

Offer #2: From the Canadian government, its just for the summer and it's in a great location. I would be working within a team of only interns with a full-time software engineer acting as a mentor/supervisor. From what I've heard from current interns, they said the role included a lot of researching on their own time to improve the project they were working on and adding new features.

I'm having trouble deciding what would be the better offer, as the second offer fits my graduation timeline better as it is only for the summer, but I'm not sure if I would learn as much and/or if the work I would do would look as good on my resume compared to offer #1.

\*\*EDIT: Offer #2 is letting me choose between AI/Cloud/Mobile dev/Front end/Middle tier development. While Offer #1 is just Frontend & Backend with mainly C# and Angular. And both offers are Hybrid

I would appreciate any feedback/advice!

I’ll keep trying but it doesn’t seem likely. I worked at an educational summer camp last year where I taught kids CS and math. The pay is honestly decent this year but I was miserable last summer so idk if I want to do it again especially since no company seemed to care about it as experience. They asked me to apply again back in February but I think if I reached out to them I could get a position again, although I doubt it would be guaranteed this late.

I’m also currently technically working as a research assistant for a professor building a simulation of a proton in Unity, but it’s been forever since I’ve received any communication about that project and I also don’t just want to use Unity. The project is also a bit of a spaghetti mess, and I think the professor wants things done that just aren’t really feasible in Unity (thinking all the physics equations would balance out in the end so we wouldn’t need artificial forces to keep things constrained. Might be possible but seems incredibly difficult based on the problems we were having).

Should I just try to work on personal projects over the summer and learn new tech stacks or should I try to work at one of those other jobs? Money is nice but not super important since my family supports my bills and education. Just trying to figure out what has the best likelihood of getting me a real internship for Summer 2024.

So far I've been accepted at UTM (Studies in Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics) with a $3000 renewable scholarship and $7500 1st year scholarship. Also accepted to UBC (BSc), but no scholarship there. 

However I contacted my friend who is studying comp eng in UTSG and he strongly advised against studying CS at UTM and said UBC CS is better. (He also said UTM gives out a lot of scholarships since nobody goes there lmao) Would you agree? Also saw quite a few people mention POSt here and it being a downside of CS at UTM. Could someone enlighten it me a bit on that?

UBC is a lot closer to home (I live in a Vancouver suburb) but I'd be missing out on the scholarship. Now here's the issue. I have yet to receive a decision for CS at UTSG, and deadlines for both my current offers are May 1 which is really soon. I also applied to Waterloo but that decision will only come in May so I don't think I'm gonna be going there.

In case I don't get into UTSG CS, which would you say is the better choice, UTM or UBC? My biggest concern with picking the latter is the possibility for better internship and job opportunities in Toronto both during and after my studies. What is your opinion on that?"

I also did a GIS internship with a local government water district over the summer of 2016. 

After graduation I applied and applied and never even got an interview so I gave up. 

I want to get back into it because my career path currently will not get me anywhere. 

I have done a project using QGIS for my uncles's business this year that involved manipulating raster data, editing boundaries, creating roads and buffers among other things. 

I have looked at the wiki but I am also looking for opinions on what I need to do to get myself back out there and try again. I am willing to take just about anything entry level just to get my foot in the door. I live in Maine but am willing to relocate to just about anywhere on the east coast.

I have applied to NUS CEG and want to ask some questions about it. Firstly, I don't have much experience with hardware but see that it's impt because as a computer engineer one can have both the software and hardware knowledge and hence be more skilled and flexible. However, they may be like a jack of all trades (pls correct me if I'm wrong) and mich harder to study. I chose CEG because I did not meet the RP requirements to enter CS.

I have some questions on CEG

1) As a person who likes software and is not experienced with hardware should I go for CEG over my other options in other unis which are CS.

2) Is it more difficult for a CEG student to find a pure software job compared to a CS student, given tht employers don't rlly care whether u r a cs or ceg student?

3) How difficult is is for NUS CEG students to get prestigious opportunities like NOC, other exchanges and internships?

4) With the merger of college of design and college of engineering, thr number of core foundational mods has risen. Does this mean that a ceg student has less major prescribed electives to pick from, which could mean less depth in their own course?

5) How is the weightage bween hardware and software is it 50-50?

6) (Pls correct me if I'm wrong) Frm what I have seen CEG students seem to not have as much coding skill as a CS student which makss me rhing that the intenrsity of coding is not high in CEG?

7) How are the students in CEG? Are they all very competitive etc.?

8) What can I do to prep myself for NUS CEG?

9) Can a CEG student transfer to CS and how? What are the requirements?

10) If a CEG student wants a more software based curriculum, can it be achieved?

I appreciate the responses!"

So where I am is I’m considering two options. Spend time collecting certs (CompTIA, AWS), or get a job at Starbucks to take advantage of a free education and get a computer science degree. Any advice? Pros/Cons. Personal experiences."

Decision day is getting closer and closer, and I still keep seeing tons and tons -- and tons -- of posts with this school or that school, about negotiating financial aid, and looking for colleges that might still be accepting applications. I’m gonna try to cover as much as I can here in this one loooonnng-ass mega post. Not gonna lie, this post is almost absurdly long, but that's because there’s so much information to share with you. Scroll through to find what you’re looking for. (Topics: Visits, Making a Decision, Financial Aid Appeals Resources, Imposter Syndrome, Dealing with Parents, Dealing with Others, Links in case Apps didn't work out for you, My lists of colleges still accepting apps. )

# THIS IS IT

You’ve spent a lot of time and effort, and dealt with loads of stress to get to that confetti-filled computer screen, but you’re not quite done. You might have to choose between schools. There might be people who want to weigh in on your decision. Or maybe even it just hasn't gone your way.

So, take your application decisions, look at yourself, and take a deep breath.

Keep in mind that college is what you make of it. Always remember this: You are the dream, not the college, and you’re bringing that dream—you—with you wherever you go. You’re bringing your badass self to some lucky college no matter what college you ultimately choose. They’re the lucky ones.

# LEARN MORE ABOUT COLLEGES

You have to go with what feels right for you when making your decision, but that starts with learning as much as you can about a college. Pre-Covid, my biggest piece of advice was to make every effort to visit a college and then find a bench and just sit there and observe, listen, and tap into what feels right for you. I call that the Bench Test. But now that so many colleges have virtual info, while I still suggest an on-campus visit if possible, you can also jump into virtual offerings and delve into what you need and what works best for you in other ways.

1. Follow them on social media -- especially Instagram and Twitter -- they’re putting out great info every day.
2. Read their websites. Read their school newspaper.
3. Make a sample course schedule for the fall. Find classes and professors that interest you.
4. Reach out to their admissions offices. Ask questions. See if they have connections with current students.
5. Chat with some students on their subreddit if it’s active and ask questions. Or Reach out on Instagram. Follow their stories and live streams. They frequently have students doing AMAs. There are no right or wrong answers to your questions because it’s all about what you’re interested in and what works best for you. Sample Questions: What do you like most? What do you like least? What do you do on a Saturday afternoon? What are your friends doing? What do you do on a Wednesday night? What might your friends be doing? What would you change?

# VIRTUAL TOURS (AND OTHER WAYS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT A CAMPUS)

If you can’t visit on campus, the first place to start is the college’s own website. You can also see what kind of online programming the admissions offices are doing for you, the admitted students, like video chats and other online campus days.

# MAKING THE FINAL DECISION

Now I know making a decision is stressful. While I think it’s good to get feedback about specific schools (and I try to give feedback too when I can), I don’t think you should be making your decision based on what strangers on the internet say you should choose because it is such a personal/family decision. This is something no one can decide for you. If you’re having a hard time, here are a few tricks you can use to help you decide:

* **Finances:** My opinion: I don’t think anyone should be taking on debt if you have the option of attending college without it. But, if you are considering debt, a“rule” of thumb I’ve heard is not to take on more total debt for all four years than your potential first-year salary -- so for those of you looking to grad school, especially med and law school, you really want the minimum amount of debt possible. And don’t hesitate to try to renegotiate your financial aid. We’ve had lots of success stories on here. The worst that could happen is they’ll tell you no. Go to the next section to find resources for negotiating or appealing financial aid.
* **Visits/Virtual Visits**: Either visit in person or do the virtual visits and tours and explore the colleges’ websites. Examine their motto, peruse their social media, and the school newspaper. Does it fit your life and your philosophy? Do you see activities and classes and research you want to take part in?
* **Pros and Cons:** This one is my favorite! Make an oversized list of pros and cons on paper for each school. Like, make it poster-sized. Put the name of the school at the top and then list all the pros and cons that you can think of for each school. Consider aspects like finances, culture, vibe, departments, honors, social, academics, geography, weather, surrounding area, travel from, and distance from home. Put it on your wall and leave it there for a few days so you can look it over and add and subtract from it as you absorb the thoughts. Hang out with these lists for a few days and add to them as you think of something. When one has more cons than pros take it down.
* **Spreadsheet:** Excel the shit out of it and compare, compare compare. I have a sample for you to use to think about what you might want to compare. [Here's a link of mine if you want to use it.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AM-kP-RMvisneVLVCW2uAQOHKDW2peECyt_NWMrPvQ4/edit?usp=sharing) Be sure to copy and save in your name so they don't get mixed up.
* **Do the 10/10/10 test:** Ask yourself: “How will I feel about my decision in 10 hours? 10 weeks? 10 years?”
* **Tell a Few:** Make a choice. Tell your parents and maybe a few friends, and sleep on it. What’s your gut feeling? Does it feel right? If so, go for it. If not, rethink.
* **Coin Toss:** Try the coin toss trick. Assign a side of the coin to a school and toss it. What are you secretly hoping for before it lands? That’s your school. Tell your parents and a couple of friends. Then sleep on it. How do you feel?
* **Gut Check:** What’s keeping you up at night? Sit in silence for 15 minutes and focus on your breath -- What thoughts are floating by? What’s your gut telling you?

# FINANCIAL OPTIONS AREN’T WORKING OUT

# YOU DESERVE IT — DEALING WITH IMPOSTER SYNDROME

Sometimes amazing teens will come onto our subreddit who’ve had great success with their applications. They’ve been accepted to the schools they’ve worked so hard to be accepted to. Yet, to them, it still doesn’t feel right. They wonder why they were accepted over others. This is called Imposter Syndrome, and it can really fuck with your brain if you let it. Remember though: it’s just a feeling. Here’s the deal: You are good enough. Colleges, especially highly selective colleges, spend a lot of time and resources evaluating applications. They don’t often screw up. If they feel like you can handle the work — you can. Look, there will always be people who have stronger this and better that. That’s never going away. Those colleges took you because you are you. That’s what they wanted. Congrats on your amazing acceptances! You are gonna kill it in college.

# DEALING WITH PARENTS

In the past, I’ve had kids ask me about what to do when they and their parents really disagree about the decision. My advice: communicate. Do your research, make a presentation that covers all the concerns your parents may have — future career options, cost and financial aid, internships, professors, class size, distance from home. Think about what they are worried about and then try to address those worries with your research. Ask them to give you some time and then present your research to them. Listen to them respectfully and ask them to do the same. Repeat their concerns back to them, so they know you are listening and understand.

# DON’T LET ANYONE MAKE YOU FEEL BAD ABOUT YOUR CHOICE

Sometimes, others will try to make you feel bad about your choice. All you need to worry about is that you’re going to a school that best serves you. Wear that college t-shirt proudly and slap those stickers on your laptop! Be proud of your achievements, because believe me, going to college is a huge achievement, and you should be excited about this new path you’ve found for yourself.

Most of all, don’t accept the words of anyone who tries to denigrate your college choice. It’s rude and, frankly, none of their business. As in most things, my advice is “You do you.” Here’s a story I love from Neil Pasricha’s ""The Happiness Equation"" adapted by my son, Joseph.

It’s all about Buddha’s philosophy concerning the value we give to other people’s words:

Buddha spent a lot of his time wandering around and teaching folks about how to live a good life. One day he was going about his business, sitting under the Bodhi tree, spreading his ideas when another Brahman, let's call him Fred, got all up in Buddha's face and said, ""Hey, man, who said your ideas are right? You’re not as smart as you think you are.""

Buddha sat silently and smiled at Fred, only making Fred's cheeks grow red with rage. Fred spoke up again, ""Hey! I'm talking to you! Stop smiling at me, freak.""

Buddha kept smiling and then replied, ""Do you ever have guests at your house?""

""Yeah, of course,"" Fred answered.

Buddha then asked, “And when you have guests, do you give them snacks, maybe some chips and dip?”

Fred replied, “Of course! I'm not about being a bad host.”

Then Buddha chuckled wisely, “Well, if your guest says they don't want some chips, like they're not hungry or something, then to whom do those chips belong?”

“Uhhhh, weird question,” Fred retorted. “But I guess me.”

""Well,” Buddha said, still smiling, ""just as your guest didn't accept those chips, I'm not accepting your hateful words, and so those words are yours and not mine.""

“Whoa,"" Fred said, “Mind. Blown.”

# WHAT IF IT JUST ISN’T WORKING OUT SO FAR?

I know some of you aren’t worried about making a choice yet because you’re still worried about where/if your application will be accepted. If your application acceptances or finances didn’t go your way, you do have options still. You can:

1. apply to some of the many amazing colleges that are still accepting apps -- see the section after the tl;dr with colleges still accepting apps
2. take a gap year
3. attend community college for a year.
4. And if you find yourself juggling a WAITLIST or two, [here’s the link to that post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/11pktx5/if_youre_waitlisted_heres_what_you_need_to_know/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

# tl;dr

* Application acceptance is a stellar accomplishment. Be proud of yourself!
* If you’re struggling to decide between a few schools, visit them in person or virtually visit them all. Make a pros and cons list. Tell a very select few people which school you’ve chosen, and then sleep on it to see how you feel.
* Don’t accept the words of those busybodies who think they have the right to be rude about your college choice. Be like the Buddha, and let those words roll off you.
* Imposter syndrome is when you feel like you don’t deserve the successes you’ve earned. It is a feeling and it can be hard to shake. Don’t let it mess with you. You are worthy.
* Don’t be afraid to negotiate or appeal your financial aid
* There are still a shit ton of amazing colleges accepting applications – many of them with money for stellar students like you – see below

3. Scholastic National Creative Writing Award

4. Dean’s List for my FRC team

5. National Merit Semi-Finalist

**Letters of Recommendation**

* AP Physics Teacher (9/10): Rizzed my bro up. This is also my strongest subject. He knew me for 2 years, has a super high opinion of me “intellectually”? Idk how to say this but apparently he was amazed with the way I approached stuff like physics and life topics/philosophy in general and according to my counselor he said some amazing things about me in terms of what I will do in the future so I was stoked abt that

* AP English Teacher (7/10): Didn’t have as deep of a connection with her but we talked about books after class a lot and she loves my creative writing stuff and would frequently show it to different classes which was kinda embarrassing LOL

&#x200B;

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

*Princeton (8/10): Really liked her, had an amazing conversation and we hit it off about some topics in philosophy and space stuff. She said she would try to write me the strongest recommendation she could. Princeton alumni interviews overall seem pretty enjoyable from what I’ve seen, and mine was no different.

*MIT (5/10): I got this old ass boomer data scientist who just made me list out my ECs for him. It was weird. Only reason why I put 5 is bc I somewhat managed to save it at the end when he asked more open ended questions 

*Didn’t get interviews anywhere else which was sorta alarming lol
&#x200B;

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

Personal Statement (10/10): Spent like 3 months on this one. I scrapped it completely and restarted at one point. Basically talked about how overcoming my fear of trying new things in my childhood taught me to be a kinder and more caring person.

Supplements: I applied to too many schools to give a breakdown here, but they were generally solid, and I didn’t find too much of a correlation between essay quality and results. For instance, I poured my heart and soul out into my Princeton essays and got rejected, but my abhorrent shitpost of a northwestern supp got me in. I will say though, looking back, most of my why school essays were not that good except uchicago’s. That one was straight fire and SUPER weird.
&#x200B;

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* I got really big scholarships to the first 6 below this, just don’t wanna dig through letters for exact numbers rn)
* Penn State University
* Colorado School of Mines EA
* WPI EA
* RPI EA
* Syracuse RD
* URochester RD
* Northwestern RD??????
* UChicago EA?!?!?!?!?!?!? SLAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYY (Committed)

*Waitlists:*

* UCSD
* UCLA
* Case Western EA defer —> Waitlist

*Rejections:*

* Princeton RD (this one REALLY hurt, dream school)
* MIT RD
* Yale RD
* Stanford RD
* Cornell RD
* Duke RD
* USC RD
* UC Berkeley
* UT Austin EA
* Rice RD
* UVA EA
* Northeastern EA defer —> RD reject (opted out of NU.in cause I was NOT gonna let them deport my ass)

**Additional Information:**

* I had extenuating circumstances relating to my grades (medical reasons) that I put in my additional info section. Counselor rec mentioned it as well. My bad grades were mostly confined to freshman and senior year, soph and junior were near 4.0

* Q: Why did you submit apps to significantly lower ranked schools in RD after getting into UChicago EA?
* A: I submitted all of my safeties/targets before EA results came out so I didn’t know at the time

* I know this post has a light-hearted tone, but on a serious note, if any of you guys take anything from this, APPLY EVERYWHERE. MIRACLES DO HAPPEN. I knew I had a low chance for HYPSM+ because of my gpa but I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if I didn’t apply and would always be wondering “what if”. Looking back, I’m extremely glad I did so, because even though I got rejected from Princeton for physics which was my dream school (and a bunch of other top schools as you can see), I’m still overjoyed to have UChicago and Northwestern. In fact, if I had to have one, my only regret looking back is that I DIDN’T apply to more schools, like Harvard, Columbia, Penn, Caltech, etc. After some research and really looking into the schools I realized UChicago had everything I wanted and was an amazing fit for me (campus is also sooo prettttttty) so I ended up committing there :)

I'M SEXY AND SPIKY BABYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY (was originally in the title but I can say whatever I want down here)

If you have any questions pls ask me in the comments instead of DMing me, I’d be happy to answer! If it’s public it can help more people <3"
12t5zcz,1,2023-04-20,Questions from a(n almost) first-year college student who is probably going into psychology,LitMatchesLightFire,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/12t5zcz/questions_from_an_almost_firstyear_college/,"I'm about to graduate from high school. I am the oldest of my siblings, and my parents' college education was not typical, so I am somewhat on my own. I had to speed up the college process because my school decided not to inform me about my ability to graduate almost a year early until roughly three months ago. I want to submit my applications to the two colleges I've picked in early August. I basically have five questions:

&#x200B;

* First, I know I want to work in psychology, but I'm not sure which major I want to pursue (general, clinical, etc.). I don't want to focus on math and science too much and I want to concentrate on the communication aspect of psychology. People disregard those who major in counseling, according to my parents, therefore I want to make sure I major in psychology. My ultimate goal for the future is to have my own practice (possibly with one or two other therapists). That may change once I enter college and complete internships and stuff, but for the time being, that appears to be an ideal a position for me.
* Secondly, I want to be able to provide children (around 6 - 19) therapy. Should I double major or minor in something like early childhood education if I want to make this a key part of my career? Or should I try something different? I would like my job to be highly child-centered.
* Third, I am worried about being around people. I know that seems silly, but I will explain. When I was in seventh grade, a year before COVID began, I was transferred from in-person public school to an online public school by my parents because of concerns about administration in the school. The school I am in now is a K-12 online school and is the same school from which I am graduating. In this school you can only contact with teachers at this school via email and other text-based means. I only have one Zoom meeting per month, and everyone in that class is allowed to mute and turn off their camera for the entirety of the meeting. Since then (a year before COVID), I have only spoken with grocery store employees and on the phone with a doctor. Is there something I can do before I will start college in January 2024 that will help me with this?
* Forth, I was accepted into NHS club(?) at the start of my first year of high school at my online school. The requirements to graduate with it on my Highschool diploma was to volunteer a particular amount of hours, maintain a good GPA, and complete a certain number of AP, IB, and other classes. My GPA is less than 3.0, and it is what I consider to be poor, and I barely passed most of my regular subjects, therefore I did not enroll in any special classes. I admit that those two things are my fault, but I blame my mother for the volunteer hours. I begged her to let me do anything that counted volunteering, even something like sending letters to elders or veterans, but she refused. I guess this one is less of a question and more-so me dreading the leader of my NHS group talking to me about this. They are a very nice teacher and is one of the best teachers I have ever had. What will I tell them?
* Lastly, Is it a huge issue to start at a four-year institution in the spring for the first semester? Will it have an impact on me, my education, or my degree? Because I've been allowed to take classes over the summers for the previous few years, I'll be graduating high school practically a year early at the end of July. However, because my school did not inform me, and I was unable to complete everything in time to enroll in the Fall 2023 semester. I am going to have to attend college in the Spring 2024 semester, which begins in January. If you are a first-year student, both of the colleges I want to attend require you to live in a dorm for the first two semesters. Will going in the spring upset any teachers, dorm roommates, or anyone else?

&#x200B;

I don't know if it helps, but I live in the U.S. I apologize for a lot of reading, but I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions. Thank you very much if you read all of this."

I want to specialize in the field of robotics and automation, and my dream job is to work for a company like Boston Dynamics. 

I'm currently torn between two options:

1. Take a heavy course load for the next two years and graduate with two separate bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering. This will demonstrate a strong academic background in both fields, but it will not allow me to pursue internships or gain practical experience due to a lack of time.
2. Just keep a minor in Computer Science, and complete my Mechanical Engineering degree, while gaining work experience through internships or jobs in the field. This would allow me to gain practical skills and networking opportunities, but I may not be as knowledgeable in the field with only a minor in Computer Science.

I have the financial aid and scholarships to handle either option. I enjoy both fields, so taking a heavy course load isn't a major concern for me. However, I'm still undecided on which path would be best for my career goals.

I would greatly appreciate any advice on which option would be best for me. 

Thanks!"
12t6mqd,138,2023-04-20,I'm starting to doubt that IT is still a good career choice for those just starting out,blueberryman422,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/12t6mqd/im_starting_to_doubt_that_it_is_still_a_good/,"I didn't initially study IT but I was always interested in IT as a hobby. I like many people decided to switch into IT because it seemed interesting, future proof, and the opportunities in technology seemed unbeatable only a short time ago. 

Of course, the situation has dramatically changed with companies over-hiring during the pandemic and the economy slowing down. Meanwhile, there are still countless numbers of people still trying to get into entry level IT/programming positions. I'm also fully aware that this isn't the first time that the tech sector has experienced mass layoffs.

One thing that really drew me to the field of IT initially was that it seemed like a career where continued effort to learning and developing new skills would be rewarded. Unfortunately, that just doesn't seem to be my experience at all. Instead what seems to matter more is when you got into IT, and how long you have been in. 

It's like if you didn't get into IT at the right time a few years ago to start getting experience, you've probably missed the best chance that there will ever be to have a decent IT career. It doesn't help that more and more things are becoming automated as well, so more work can be done by less people which might reduce the future need for the entry level positions that new IT workers will need to gain experience.

I've spent time and money pursuing certifications and working on my skills every day and I'm just not seeing a meaningful return on investment. As I continue applying for entry level jobs, the time I've spent learning skills is starting to feel pointless because time and time again, it seems that employers only value experience.

Many entry level jobs now expect 5+ years of experience and receive hundreds of applications for very low salaries that are often contract positions. Even worse, many entry level jobs have on call/night shift expectations and expect you drive around the city all day with your own vehicle to solve basic issues. 

The unfortunate truth is that some people doing food delivery can drive around the city and make a similar salary with a whole lot less stress and zero certifications or degrees. Similarly, someone could work in an office answering phones all day for similar pay to a help desk position. I'm not going to claim that these are necessarily better careers, but considering the current trend of entry level IT positions, it's hard to justify what makes entry level IT any better considering the downsides.

Given what it takes to be a competitive entry level IT applicant these days (degree, internships, certifications, programming skills, a few years of experience), it's just hard to remain optimistic about the future career prospects for those that are new to IT. As a result, I'm honestly starting to wonder whether I should start considering other career options instead of trying to pursue a career that might never happen."

I posted a couple weeks ago here and tried to implement all the great advice I got. Unfortunately, I still have yet to receive a single call back from over a hundred+ applications which I find kind of baffling. I sometimes think I'm being impatient but it has now been almost 4-5 months with no call backs. (i've read some stories of people taking over a year to get a job in tech) Things I've tried:

1. cater each application, resume, and cover letter to each job
2. reach out to every recruiter I can find for each job
3. network as much as possible
4. I tried to apply to almost every ed tech company I can find to combine my experiences as a compsci teacher + front end development

I'm thinking of some ways to proceed from here to make the best use of my time and would appreciate any advice. Here are some things I thought of:

1. start a masters program in compsci? Then maybe some kind of internship? I've wanted to get a masters eventually anyways. If I do go this route.. does the school necessarily matter too much?
2. complete ""The Odin Project"" courses to bolster my resume/projects more
3. edit\* forgot to add bootcamps like the ones offered by Rice uni (edx) but these cost like 10k
4. apply for a company like ""Revature"" without the relocation requirement to finish their bootcamp and get a job through them
5. Hire a recruiter? I think I saw somewhere that I can pay someone to help me in my job search.
6. find some kind of career fair to network? (there doesn't seem to be many options though from a basic google search)

On the other hand, I have an offer from the University of Manchester for the same course, which is comparatively lower at around 33,000 GBP. However, I am leaning towards Edinburgh because of its excellent course structure and electives.

12t9kt5,3,2023-04-20,UF vs FSU Presidential Scholars for Engineering or Computational and Applied Math,alexdel44,ufl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/12t9kt5/uf_vs_fsu_presidential_scholars_for_engineering/,"
Hello everyone, I was recently accepted to FSU as [Presidential Scholar](https://presidentialscholars.fsu.edu/scholarship-benefits). I intend to enroll as an Industrial Engineering major, but I am not sure whether to take this path or to consider changing my major to Computational and Applied Math. I am wondering if anyone in this sub would like to share their experience/perspective of the school and such programs. 

 One reason for my unsureness is that, unlike other schools like UF, FSU does not offer a concentration in Operations Research. This is the topic in which I am most interested within Industrial Engineering, so not having this concentration worries me. The College of Engineering, although very good, does not offer as robust of a program as my other option inUF. I am also not a fan of the CoE not being on campus. 

From my research, Industrial Engineering and Computational and Applied Math do have some overlap, and both are prerequisite degrees for an MS in Operations Research, which I intend to earn after undergrad. I definitely would not mind switching majors for a better education, I would just prefer the engineering route. However, I am most interested in engineering, rather than a BS in math. Below I will add some pros and cons for each of my options. 

**FSU**  
Pros - I got accepted as a Presidential Scholar which entails: $14,000 Presidential Scholarship distributed over four years, $12,000 Vires Scholarship distributed over four years, $12,000 for educational enrichment opportunities, all on top of the Florida Bright Futures Scholarship; extremely small group of people who I will work with for four years, creating a close-knit community; beautiful campus; great campus life; in the Honors College; guaranteed undergraduate research opportunities  
Cons - Engineering college is shared with FAMU and is off-campus; Industrial engineering does not provide the Operations Research concentration.

**UF**  
Pros - great engineering program; offers Operations Research concentration; top 5 public university, flagship state school; great campus life; many of my friends are attending; Florida Bright Futures Scholarship  
Cons - in Gainesville; no scholarship or close-knit community like that which is provided by FSU; not in the Honors College

I am very excited about my acceptance into the Presidential Scholars Program at FSU. I love how close-knit everyone in the community is, its dedication to community service, how we receive priority registration for classes, and how we have a personal scholarship and fellowship office for internships, co-ops, etc. However, the engineering school at FSU just does not have the reputation of UF. I will also not be able to study specifically what I want to if I go to FSU. I feel like if I was interested in any major besides engineering, I would attend FSU in a heartbeat.

As of now, I am slightly leaning toward FSU, but I just don't know if it will set me up for success in engineering in the future like I know UF will. I understand that I will only get out of college what I put into it, which includes pursing internships, etc., but what UF excels in my interests, FSU somewhat lacks. Any help, consideration, or guidance, would be appreciated. Thank you everyone in advance."

I would love some advice since I know there's a lot of people with the same problem here

Ao long story short, I'm a physicist with a Msc in quantitative finance. I like maths and coding

When I finished my master, the company where I made the internship hired me. It was a consultancy company, where most of the projects are market risk for the biggest Spanish bank group. 

The problem here is that my quality of life, meaning stress, is pretty good, but the projects are... Boring. Not modelling at all, lot of excels, documentation and ahit like that. I thought that the strong point of consultancy was to try different things, different projects and decide what you want to do,but after a year, I realize that most of the projects are shit and the fun stuff is inside the bank itself and other kind of companies.

Before this job and while the master, I tried applying to IMC as a quant trader and I was rejected in the last round, so I think that with tons of study, I will be able to get into the industry, but is it worth it?

In addition to that, salaries here in Spain are pretty low, even though my position as a 24 years old is pretty good compared with my colleagues from uni. 

Where could I find the fun stuff? Should I go abroad, be ambitious, earn pretty nice salaries ? 
Or should I stay in Spain, try to find different job in a bank or something like that and priorize quality of life? Is it now than I'm young or never?

Ahhh too much questions and doubts.. was/is anybody here in the same situation? What did you do?

See lots of people popping up asking for advice with stuff, thought it would be a good idea to get a thread going where people put in their tips for resumes and interviews to help others.


Tips for Resume

Resumes shouldn’t be one size suits all, research your target company look at their services what do they provide where might they pivot in the future, take note and tailor your CV to impress.

If you see jobs you like look what they will have you doing/tools you’ll be working with,it’s always good to say you’ve practical experience with tools and the great thing is most can be assessed for free. They want to integrate people quickly, having relevant knowledge/understanding of these tools will put you in favourable positions. You do not need to be a subject matter expert, having the grounding shows more in the tools/processes being asked can sometimes carry more weight than just certificates.

Be creative if you do projects at home or builds link them in your resume and put them in the skills part of your CV. I had that I was building a pfsense router for my home network for my security internship and it helped me stand out because I was passionate about it. It ultimately shows you’re willing to do more and you’ve an insatiable appetite for your industry. 

Certs are great don’t get me wrong but they are the veggies of your meal that is your cv. I say that because it’s common everyone does them to break in so it’s not really unique. When I’ve chatted with supervisors about someone standing out it’s always been because they go against the grain of what’s expected and display their passion for learning and growth.



Interview

1. It’s a strength to know what you do not know, owning up to not understanding something is seen as a positive in an interview. E.g I don’t understand that but if given an opportunity in a follow up interview I will have looked up and learned about it etc. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH THIS.
2. If you show any aggression when getting something wrong, you’ve already failed. We’ve had talent people leave without internships who were smart enough to get it but they had shit attitudes to feedback and gave us the vibe the would ruin team harmony. Leave your aggression at the door if you recognise this you will be fine it takes time to feel like your not a wild dog backed into a corner.
3. Research the company and ask them questions. Ask about the tools and processes in place, even better also ask would they have any recommendations for training that could help you in the future. Company’s will take a shot on medium skill but they ticket every box for integration with team.
4. Feedback - I’ve heard horror story’s of people asking for feedback at the end of the interview then disagreeing and saying the interviewer (the one with the job) is wrong and that they were right if you can’t handle constructive criticism you will find it hard in IT. If this will be an issue for you don’t approach the topic of feedback 
5. IT is a “We” not “I” business. If you go into an interview saying you can basically do it all yourself if needed it sends the wrong signal and a signal most generally don’t want to send. Speak to experiences where it was clinical to success that everyone collaborated and shared knowledge. It’s not a one person army a successful healthy IT team takes a village."

Alternatively, after I graduate, I could complete a MSc in Computing, which is like a conversion course.

So, I'm doing my yearly budget for the 2Y MBA (and up to 3Y afterward as I am an International), and it's not looking good from a purely financial perspective. I'm targeting T25 for max $$$$ (applying for very few M7s/T15s for leverage), and hopefully recruiting for consulting, tech LDP/strategy/PM. I have 7 YOE in tech mostly doing tech support for enterprises. 3.3+ GPA, engineering grad, no glowing ECs, lackluster resume. I know, so GMAT is hopefully my only leverage. I'm from Philippines, so hopefully I'm not lumped on India and China counterparts.

Here are my assumptions:

* MBA 2Y CoA (without scholarship) = 220K
* MBA summer internship salary = 25K

* Student Loan (planning to loan everything) IR = 10%
* Yearly salary increase = 3%

My questions (bear with me, I don't have that much idea about US-based employment set-ups):

1. Are US-based companies' monetary benefits only base + signing bonus? (aside from profit sharing and stock options)
2. Any usual US-based company benefits I can maximize, like free lunches/dinners, so I can save more? (sorry for being a cheap out)
3. Any tips to avoid student loan interest? (I'm reading some 0% APR credit cards here; will research more how to get them, but words are welcome)
4. Is 3% yearly salary increase expected? How to make it higher?
5. Are all numbers on my assumptions above reasonable? Any number you would increase/decrease considering my background and targets?

Thanks so much!"

I want to specialize in the field of robotics and automation, and my dream job is to work for a company like Boston Dynamics. 

I'm currently torn between two options:

Option 1: Take a heavy course load for the next two years and graduate with two separate bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering. This will demonstrate a strong academic background in both fields, but it will not allow me to pursue internships or gain practical experience due to a lack of time.

Option 2: Just keep a minor in Computer Science, and complete my Mechanical Engineering degree, while gaining work experience through internships or jobs in the field. This would allow me to gain practical skills and networking opportunities, but I may not be as knowledgeable in the field with only a minor in Computer Science.

I have the financial aid and scholarships to handle either option. I enjoy both fields, so taking a heavy course load isn't a major concern for me. However, I'm still undecided on which path would be best for my career goals. Maybe there is even a third option that I don't know about?

I would greatly appreciate any advice on which option would be best for me. 

Thanks!"

I'm a first year (F17) computer engineer, and I've been struggling to figure out what to do over the summer. For context, I came into college as a biomedical engineer before switching to computer engineering last quarter. I'm, admittedly, very inexperienced in the field with almost no prior coding/circuit background. I changed my major on a whim after I took an intro class on MCU and an intro to Python class, where I sort of developed an interest for this major. I also joined a club last quarter that revolves around building a CubeSat, but I haven't made much of a contribution due to my lack of skill. I'm sort of suffering from low self-esteem after switching to this major because I don't exactly feel like I'm good enough, compared to everybody else, but that's another story. 

Knowing all this, I realize that I don't have much to offer to internships and the ones I have applied to have all turned me down/ghosted me. Many internships also require me to be at least a third-year because they want more ""experienced"" students. The professors I have reached out to regarding research also have told me that they wanted at least second years or above. I was wondering if anyone had advice on what I could do over the summer? I'm planning on trying to catch up and learn C/C++ on my own time, but other than that, should I do a personal project? If so, does anyone have any pointers on how to go forward with that?

I have applied to NUS CEG and want to ask some questions about it. Firstly, I don't have much experience with hardware but see that it's impt because as a computer engineer one can have both the software and hardware knowledge and hence be more skilled and flexible. However, they may be like a jack of all trades (pls correct me if I'm wrong) and mich harder to study. I chose CEG because I did not meet the RP requirements to enter CS.

I have some questions on CEG

1) As a person who likes software and is not experienced with hardware should I go for CEG over my other options in other unis which are CS.

2) Is it more difficult for a CEG student to find a pure software job compared to a CS student, given tht employers don't rlly care whether u r a cs or ceg student?

3) How difficult is is for NUS CEG students to get prestigious opportunities like NOC, other exchanges and internships?

4) With the merger of college of design and college of engineering, thr number of core foundational mods has risen. Does this mean that a ceg student has less major prescribed electives to pick from, which could mean less depth in their own course?

5) How is the weightage bween hardware and software is it 50-50?

6) (Pls correct me if I'm wrong) Frm what I have seen CEG students seem to not have as much coding skill as a CS student which makss me rhing that the intenrsity of coding is not high in CEG?

7) How are the students in CEG? Are they all very competitive etc.?

8) What can I do to prep myself for NUS CEG?

9) Can a CEG student transfer to CS and how? What are the requirements?

10) If a CEG student wants a more software based curriculum, can it be achieved?

I appreciate the responses!"

I would really like to go for team Y as it matches my current research in My masters. In the third interview, Y’s team seemed very impressed and grinned while saying you will hear back from us soon.

It’s been more than a week since I heard back from team Y. X’s team reached out to me saying I would be contacted b a HR to officially apply after they create a job on the portal, as I was referred by someone. And it’s going to take another week for me to get the offer.

However, since both come under the umbrella of Comcast applied AI (voice & Comcast AI 4 Discovery), I’m confused if my pay is going to be the same (ML Grad research intern had a base pay of $55) or will be low balled to a 40-45 in X’s team.

In the context of seeking a larger internship for my next summer, which internship would be the better option to go with? I know with startups they could go underwater at any moment, but this one recently got several million dollars in funding and a product that has already been under testing for a few months, I also personally find their product exciting. On top of that the I was able to personally talk to the ceo, and connected really well with potentially my team leader, they also floated the idea of offering me work part time during the school year if things worked out well over the summer. On the other hand, the bigger company’s projects didn’t thrill me as much, and although interview went well,  it didn’t click the same way the startup did, but the fact that they are a much bigger company(potentially bigger name?) and an established internship pipeline has me torn. But the biggest goal out of this is obviously trying to land a faang internship at least some time in college, and if they both present an equal opportunity I would likely go with the startup, as the extra cash throughout the year would be a big plus, and the small environment sounds nice, but if the bigger company presents a better future opportunity I’m pretty sure I would vibe well there as well. What do y’all think?"

\-Internship Java ca dupa sa fiu angajat pe Kotlin  
\-Internship Golang dupa angajat pe Golang

Stiu ca momentan sunt putine joburi pe Golang, fiind un limbaj mai nou comparativ cu altele, dar ma gandesc ca va deveni din ce in ce mai cautat cu trecerea anilor. M-am documentat putin despre limbaj, mi se pare ok, chiar daca eu am lucrat mult cu java in timpul facultatii (1 proiect + exercitii/teme + licenta). In plus, Golang e orientat spre microservicii, fata de aplicatii monolitice cum am facut pana acum. Tin sa mentionez ca am lucrat un an in domeniu ca PHP Backend Dev si job-ul m a ajutat mult sa inteleg cum se intampla lucrurile in viata reala.  


Sunt putin reticent la o schimbare pe Go, dar in acelasi timp e o oportunitate misto pe care nu stiu cand o sa o mai am. Mi-ar placea sa ies din zona de comfort si sa invat ceva complet nou, dar sper sa nu regret pe termen lung. Voi cum priviti lucrurile?"

12u1p5a,3,2023-04-21,keep my adhd testing appointment at a bad office or wait possibly months longer to get diagnosed,Living-Strawberry-50,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/12u1p5a/keep_my_adhd_testing_appointment_at_a_bad_office/,"hi guys, i’ve been having suspicions for almost 5 years now of having adhd and i finally decided to get help. my pcp referred me to a great doctor at first with a 6 month waiting list, so i got on the list but asked my pcp if there was any other office they could get me into. 

i got into another office for an appointment in a couple weeks, but it was hell getting that appointment. the office didn’t pick up calls and only allows you to leave a message and they’ll call you back (often at the most inopportune times where i did not have my insurance information on me). anyways, i finally got the appointment and was thrilled, only to google them and see they had about 1.5 stars on google due to horrible management and possibly bad testing practices (going almost entirely off the adhd checklist and that anyone can access at home). 

i’m trying to get a summer internship which would likely start a few weeks after, and to get support before that would be great, but i don’t want to go about it the wrong way. tbh i would definitely check off enough boxes on one of their questionnaires but i almost wonder if that’s not quality enough testing (i don’t want a false diagnosis even though i have great reason to believe i have it). 

if i did keep this appointment, i would likely take the diagnosis to another office for therapy and medication prescription, as i cannot see myself sticking long term with this one. 

i guess what i’m trying to ask is is it worth it to stick it out for the diagnosis vs wait possibly months (and likely have to deal with my issues for my entire internship which may be remote and probably would make my life hell). will i even be able to stick it out to find a new doctor?"
12u2j2b,12,2023-04-21,Should I reconsider being in this industry? Slow processing from ADHD (inattentive),crunchysliceofbread,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12u2j2b/should_i_reconsider_being_in_this_industry_slow/,"As post says, I have diagnosed inattentive ADHD (general explanation: my processing is like trying to listen to words through a really bad radio signal) being treated and I work/learn slowly as a result. I'm exploring data science, data engineering, and backend/infrastructure engineering. I'm entering my last year of undergrad in statistics at a somewhat reputable school.

I got an internship at one of Musk's companies and was able to extend twice, before being fired during the third internship for underperformance. Mainly related to the speed I was working at (key point here) and others constantly having to repeat themselves. I've had a tough realization that I may be too slow for tech. I struggle with school since my exam scores are low, for the same reason.

I love working in tech and data. The obvious problem here is keeping up with the pace of the jobs and industry. I'm worried I won't be valuable to hiring managers compared to the kid who can pop an adderall and ace code interviews, crank through analyses quickly, etc. 

That said, I feel like work in data engineering, backend, or infrastructure could a better fit.

**TLDR:** I have slow processing because of inattentive ADHD and want to explore alternative career options given my data science/data engineering skillset.

My questions for you are:

* When compared to DS/DA/ML, is infrastructure/DE/backend work:
   * paced slower?
   * more structured?
   * more easily transferable between domains?
   * less demanding of communication?
* What fields or career options with related skillsets allow for slower-paced learning and execution?
* Would freelancing full-time be a better option? What kind of projects are most ""freelance friendly"", as opposed to contractual work?

Edit: I’ve been on straterra since May. I can’t have stimulants because I have other issues that stimulants like adderall or vynase have high potential to make worse"

12ubjrv,356,2023-04-21,"Tips from a graduating Senior in CS, that I wish I told freshman me",DarkShadowXuBot,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/12ubjrv/tips_from_a_graduating_senior_in_cs_that_i_wish_i/,"1. Do your best, but if you have to retake a class- **it's not the end of the world**. Even if you have to retake it the second time- not the end of the world. Taking it a third time is a lil sus, but low key after you graduate no one cares. Failure is absolutely part of life- and I've taken a lot of L's while I've been here at Purdue. What matters is your ability to bounce/crawl/squirm your way back to where you were before- and beyond.
2. You've seen people talk a lot about mental health- even if you're ""built different"" and have never had depression, **you will have a day**, maybe a series of days, a series of weeks or semesters, where you feel like you've hit a brick wall and you don't want to get out of bed. Doesn't matter if its caused by academics, the long winter days, relationships, or personal issues- if you ignore your mental health and don't address it- **it WILL bite you in the ass eventually. Hard.** I've seen people have complete mental meltdowns, people stop going to class, people stop eating- and pretend like everything is totally fine. Part of Grit\^TM is just shoving through it when you have to, but bottom line- **it's critical to have some kind of a healthy coping mechanism**. I know a lot of alcoholics in this major... I'd personally suggest doing something with your hands or just going to the gym and walking.
3. They say that college is what you make of it- that's absolutely true. Your social life is the same way. It's what you make of it. Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to go to parties or be popular to have ""a successful social life."" I know the ""just join a club"" thing is pushed a lot, but the key advice is to **""join and be active, in an active club.""** If you're in a club and all you do is show up to meetings and not talk to anyone- ofc, you're gonna feel like you're missing out on something. Oh- and don't just join one club, join several. Do at least like one ""fun"" club that isn't major-academic related. I've been part of 11-12 clubs during my time here at Purdue, and I've gathered a lot of friends and experiences from each one.
4. **Have personal projects.** I'm not only talking software/hardware projects for CS majors, but I mean just like have something you work on in your free time. This kind of ties into what I said about having a healthy coping mechanism- just have something you're passionate about and can work on with your  hands. I'm currently in the process of forging the one ring from LOTR over at the Bechtel Center, and also having fun designing T shirts. I really wish I found out sooner about spaces like the BDIC to create stuff- instead of discovering it my final semester. Places like that where you're free to experiment (with proper safety ofc)- the sky is the limit. You can make a skateboard, electric guitars, sleds, golf clubs- literally make a goal to make something, and go out there and make it as your personal project.
5. Physical health- from experience if you lean into the ""doesn't matter if I look like an overstuffed potato sack, I'm going to be an SWE"" that only can take you so far. As much as it physically pains you to touch grass, go to the gym and go out on walks even if it's around the block once on a fall day. What helped me go to the gym regularly is that I'd tell myself to just go 3 days a week. Didn't matter if it was for only 20 minutes to slowly cycle on the machine. **Just showing up to the corec was better than the alternative of moping around my dorm room.** Also- being awkward and figuring out stuff at the gym while you're in college is infinitely better than graduating and being an adult and not knowing how to work out and being super intimidated and self-conscious (even more so than just being a college student on a college campus surrounded by similarly-aged people working out).
6. If SWE/ML/insert\_buzzword\_that\_pays\_a\_lot isn't for you- either find something you like within the field, or find something CS related you really want to pursue. **Don't force yourself to go through with SWE/ML like I and 99% of people put down freshman year because of the money/prestige**. I found out I'm decent at programming but I absolutely love security. Technical, economic, legal aspects- all of it. I just fell in love with the subject- and the only academic regret I have graduating is that I didn't get to take more security-related classes here.
7. **Take fun classes.** Golf. Tennis. Flower arrangements. Bowling. Wine tasting. All electives that people usually take senior year- but I wish I took them sooner instead of all at once. The entry level classes are for people who know absolutely nothing about the sport/subject. These are ""safe"" spaces to mess up and learn how to play- and I'd highly recommend everyone take one sport class while in college. Doing a full technical workload each semester with no variety is a really great way to speedrun burnout.
8. Comparison is the thief of Joy, especially when it comes to jobs/internships. You can get an internship making $50/hr, but if your friends are all making $100+/hr at quant firms, even if you're more relatively well off internship/job wise than a lot of people- 99% of people almost certainly are going to feel small in some way. Doesn't have to be that extreme but you get the point. I've seen people get sour real quick when they hear other people are doing really well. **If you are that kind of person- acknowledge it and change.** I had a constant sense of inferiority complex because although I was doing decent, the super successful people I compared myself to were doing a hellova lot better and I just began to have feelings of self-loathing, when I should have just been like ""Good for them. Gonna get my bag someday.""
9. Internships/Jobs aren't going to throw themselves at you in the beginning. I mean clearly, if you're one of those ""I've been working for the FAANG's since I was 5 years old, and I bootstrapped a 200M dollar startup"" sorry to say that you're an anomaly and this doesn't apply to you. For the vast majority of CS freshmen- you're gonna have to work your ass off to differentiate yourself from the other 4.0 GPA ""i-code-in-my-free-time"" applicants. If you don't have an internship by end of Junior year, again- not the end of the world, but typically **companies would like at least one internship on your resume before senior year**.
10. Office hours/TA hours. **No shame in going.** Some people are just animals and can rawdog a coding assignment in 2-4 hours in one sitting that takes you a whole week to get through. Doesn't matter- don't compare yourself to them and be like ""they didn't need help, so I can probably do it myself if I try hard enough."" If you need help, don't do the panic paralysis mode and just stress about it until its too late and the TA's are swamped with helping other people.
11. A CS degree is a google-fu degree. Just straight up this major is about teaching yourself to teach yourself and fix things with the help of the internet. The faster you learn that it's about striking a  balance between knowing how stuff works, but also having stack overflow open to explain how something you don't know works- the better off you'll be.

&#x200B;

Bonus: With the emergence of Chat-GPT- do yourself a favor and like, familiarize yourself with how it works, but don't trust/use it 100%. It's sort of like cheating yourself if you just use it as a crutch for all your assignments. Great tool- but like, don't amputate your legs and use it as a walmart wheelchair shopping cart if you get what I mean. Overheard some dude freaking out because the code it gave him didn't help with a lab and he was mad that it wasn't giving him error-free code. My guy. Buddy. Pal. GPT isn't the one attending purdue for a CS degree .-."

12uc3fb,0,2023-04-21,Messed my school grade. What is the best way out,Ok_Judgment5145,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/12uc3fb/messed_my_school_grade_what_is_the_best_way_out/,"I messed up my school grades what can i do about it

As a student from Pakistan, I want to mention that my school grades in 10th grade were not as good as I would have liked, with 4C, 3B, and 1A. However, I have improved significantly in my high school GCE by CAIE and am excelling in 4 subjects. Despite my lower grades in 10th grade, I am hoping to achieve straight A*s and a GPA of 3.7 or higher.

Given my academic achievements and co-curricular activities, I am wondering what universities would be the best fit for me to apply to. I recognize that my school grades may not be as impressive, but I believe that my high school grades and co-curricular activities showcase my potential and capabilities. Additionally, what steps can I take to increase my chances of getting accepted to these universities?

I am excelling and acing 4 subjects: Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science, and Mathematics. I am hoping for straight A*s. I also achieved a perfect 1580 SAT score and am looking forward to acing the ACT.

In terms of co-curricular activities, I am a CPEC international essay winner (4th position) and have published three books internationally. I have also completed 18 courses from top universities like Yale, Princeton, Harvard, and MIT in programming, data sciences, finances, and chemistry. Additionally, I am the president of a high school society for literature and news and the head of research and co-author of a research study on the effects of digital learning on autistic children. I am also a team lead and head of department for a USAID-approved NGO and a joint secretary for another NGO. I have volunteered in internships for nursing homes and NGOs and for the WHO approved NGOs. I am a newspaper author and a student body council member for high school.

I would like to know what co-curricular activities I can pursue online that would strengthen my college applications. Additionally, as I do not have outstanding school grades but excellent high school grades and a CGPA, what would be the best universities for me to apply to and how can I increase my chances of getting accepted? Lastly, what are the best scholarships that you can suggest, and are there any tests I should take to improve my chances of getting into a good university?

Lastly, I am interested in learning about scholarships that would be suitable for me and any tests that could improve my chances of getting into a good university. I appreciate any guidance or advice that the Reddit community can offer


Thank you for your guidance and advice."
12ud19k,19,2023-04-21,Are your brown parents like this? Can you relate? Indian parent toxicity at its finest.,javadotzip,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/12ud19k/are_your_brown_parents_like_this_can_you_relate/,"I am a 22 year old Indian male living in Canada (first gen). I apologize in advance if my story isnt always coherent...I am by no means good at writing stories lol.

I am sure there are alot of things in my post that most people can relate to and I just wanted your opinion on how I should deal with it or how you did :D. 

For some context, I took a break from university for a year to do an internship and for a 22 year old I make good money. I have never had a proper job before this so as you can imagine I am always telling my parents how much I made or how much money I have etc. Its a way for me to tell them that I am working hard and saving my money. I am constantly told ""what is all of this your money, our money bs? If its so much your money then pay rent, pay for the food, the clothes, pay our mortgage too."" I just cant deal with this toxicity. I am constantly ridiculed for spending money on ""wasteful things"" like take out, or bars. I save my money and make budgets and am very financially responsible, you got to go out have fun sometimes. 

Once you are in university you expect some level of independency and the will to do what you want. I am constantly told to come back before 10pm on a weekday because I wont be able to work the next day. I understand their concern but after a year of working here and never missing a day, they still torment me about being a bad kid for coming home late I am sick of this. I cannot go over to my girlfriends house and come back any later than 11pm or I get scolded constantly. As a 22 year old I require some level of self accountability and less control on every part of my life. If I say my friends parents never say this kind of stuff and let them stay out I am hit with ""they are bad parents and they dont care for their kid at all"" wtf seriously?? 

My dad has been emotionally absent his whole life and my mom tries to compensate for that. Which doesnt excuse that both of them don't even like each other and my mom only stayed because they had me and ofcourse ""what will the community say"" bs. I have grown up with the constantly fighting and blaming alot of it on me, or directing each others anger on me instead. I decided to post this because this was my last straw and I need to vent. A few days ago my parents were arguing and blamed it on me because I was the topic of their argument. That has taken such a bad toll on my mental health and I constantly blame for myself anytime something goes wrong since I have been blamed for shit my entire life. 

I am to the point where I want to move out and in a year or so when I land a permanent job..I will. I brought this up with my parents and they turned toxic instantly saying we sacrificed our whole lives and worked for you just for you to leave us??? They say I am not a good son for having those thoughts and thats not what our culture is. Sons stay with their parents. Well the ones that prob have a good relationship do, I fucking dont. They worked their entire lives and I basically raised myself. Other than superficial things my parents dont even know who I am as a person. My dad? the most emotionally absent person ever, never said ""I love you"" ""I am proud of you"" nothing. He is even bothered if my mom points out ""your son is like you"" and he will throw a fit. Pretty much makes me feel like shit...like come on. Other than financial and some small things my parents have never parented ... and to them finance is everything, its LOVE. yay. ffs. But emotion and mental health? that doesnt exist. good parent-child relationship? bonding? spending time? who knew those were aspects of being good parents. Their excuse is you wouldnt have nice clothes and a good life we didnt work. Though I agree to a certain extent, if you didnt have that then why have a child? Are you raising a child just so they can support you in the future when you can work? My parents excuse for not spending time with me as a kid was to give me a good life, but doesnt being a good parents also mean you are their for your kid when they need you not just finances?? I found myself constantly isolated with nobody to talk to so I just suppress emotions now and its taken a big toll on me. 

Once again thank you very much for sticking around if you made it this far! Sorry for an extremely long story, this is just me venting because fuck nobody else will listen :/ . 

I appreciate any response, changes I should make, your experiences or something you can relate to."
12ugy8z,1,2023-04-21,Computer Science Student at North Carolina State University Struggling to Get a Summer Internship,mRxxCLuTCH,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/12ugy8z/computer_science_student_at_north_carolina_state/,"As the title suggests I am a Junior going into my second semester at NC State University majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity. I am scheduled to graduate in December of 2024. I have been applying to summer intern positions for the past year or so and have not gotten a single interview. I have probably applied to over 90 different positions. I am starting to think, either it is my graduation time that is unattractive or maybe it's my background and resume. I have looked at some of my friends' resumes and they seem to be quite similar to mine but they all have positions this summer. Should I be worried that I have not gotten an interview? Can my resume be improved with my current experience? I plan on creating a project over the summer, assuming I don't get a position and I already have a brainstorm draft for it, I could provide a google drive link to that if anyone is interested. Any advice would be greatly appreciated as this is becoming increasingly frustrating.

He is independent, has worked, earner Associates Degree in Computer Science and will graduate Spring 2024 with Bachelor’s Degree in Gaming Animation from UTD.  His portfolio is not strong just due to his autism and I fear he will never be given a chance when time to apply jobs and even internships due to the competition.

Is this really the case, or is Reddit just an echo chamber?

I just took an internship with a small company at $20/hr vs a larger company for $26 because I really enjoyed interviewing with them and they seemed to care about my future. The CS students I’ve talked to about this genuinely don’t understand why I didn’t take the highest pay I could, but it feels right to me.

Personally I want flexibility and WLB the most, but I don’t see a lot of discussion about what companies treat their employees the best, all I hear is salary and benefits. 

I want to build something interesting with a team of people I care about, is that really as rare as it seems?"

After conducting thorough research and weighing the pros and cons of each option, I have come to the realization that fall admission would provide me with ample time to pursue internships or job opportunities. This would ultimately strengthen my profile and make me a more competitive candidate for the Master's program. Furthermore, the extended break between undergraduate and graduate school would allow me to recharge and regroup before diving into a new academic endeavor.

On the other hand, I recognize the benefits of spring admission, such as the decreased competition due to fewer international students applying during that time. Additionally, there would be less of a break between my undergraduate and graduate studies, which would help me maintain my academic momentum. This would allow for a more smooth transition for me.

12uq237,36,2023-04-21,[IWantOut] 22M UK -> East Asia/Canada/New Zealand/Anywhere,tentierno,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/12uq237/iwantout_22m_uk_east_asiacanadanew_zealandanywhere/,"I am a UK university student who has wanted to leave the UK for as long as I can remember. Even though I was born here I have never been able to integrate into society (mixed ethnicity) and I find that the increased discrimination (based on my ethnicity and other minority groups I am a part of) in recent years have made my feelings worse and I have lost any sense of national identity.

While I like some aspects of the culture (aspects of the humour and of course multicultural aspects such as food from different cuisines being easily available), overall I just feel like an imposter and not welcome here. I was able to make some good friends the past couple of years but the majority of my friends here grew up in different countries and some of them are soon returning to their home countries, or have already returned, leaving me feeling alone again.

As I am studying Asian studies, I was able to go on a year abroad to Japan (that ended up not being a full year due to COVID restrictions). While I was in Asia, I stayed in Bangkok, Thailand for a month and really loved it. So many people were kind and welcoming to me, including some expats, and I especially liked the food, nightlife, shopping centres, and hot weather. (I have done extensive research on Thailand so I am aware of negative sides too) I really want to live there, but it seems too difficult to get a job there with no prior work experience and without being able to speak Thai.

While I enjoyed some parts of living in Japan, I felt very isolated, especially when talking to expats. I found that it was very hard to make friends with most people due to people being very busy with work/study. While work is important I would still like to have enough time/energy to maintain friendships outside of it, and this, combined with frequent subtle discrimination towards different groups of society, makes me think Japan isn't a great fit for me.

The other (possibly naïve) reason I would like to leave the UK is that my interests lie mostly in East Asian (especially Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, and Thailand) politics, economics, history, sports, religions, popular culture, etc. and I overall enjoyed living within this area, but the UK is so far away that it makes travelling to these countries impossible as someone who will be on a low income if/when I find a job or internship after graduating. However, the language barrier I would face as someone learning Japanese and Mandarin (but not fluent), in addition to working towards a virtually useless degree, has led me to think that being able to live within this region is an unrealistic goal. I have looked into living in Singapore but it seems difficult to get a visa due to the minimum salary requirements.

I don't know nearly enough about Canada and New Zealand as I do the other countries listed, but I thought they would potentially be more realistic options for language barrier reasons.

Essentially, I would like to live in a country generally welcoming to foreigners with a strong expat community within the Asia Pacific region. Another thing that's important to me is a good healthcare system. Also, more context: I would ideally like to work within the tourism sector, work as a diplomat, or work as a tour guide/in a museum since I'm interested in history. But I would like to keep my options open.

Side note: I have received some advice about working in my country first before travelling to other countries, but I am worried about missing out on grad schemes/internships/work holiday visas/etc. that I won't necessarily be able to take advantage of if I don't go soon after graduating. So if anyone has any idea of what would make me the most employable please let me know 🙏"
12uq4l5,1,2023-04-21,Should I be interviewing at other companies during my internship?,ImJustANatural,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/12uq4l5/should_i_be_interviewing_at_other_companies/,"I am a recent computer science graduate and due to the poor tech market + my lack of experience, I  have accepted an internship instead of a full time offer as my first job. It starts in  May.

My question is, should I be interviewing with other companies during my internship? I figure that  having other offers in hand when this company tries to extend a return offer would  help me negotiate better pay.

One other thing to note: the work culture at the company I will be interning with seems pretty chill  and it sounds like there’s a lot of learning opportunities. But it’s on the low to moderate end of the pay scale.

I want to be fair and not burn bridges, but simultaneously I want to be paid a fair wage.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

I was interviewing for basically my dream job upon graduation, an NCG ASIC design position. I graduate in a few weeks and I was so excited for interviewing at this company. I had a phone screening and then 3 rounds of technical interviews.

The first and the last ones went well I think, I was able to answer all the questions they gave me. The second one I kinda bombed, I got some questions right at first but then they asked me a few I didn't know, and all of a sudden my fight or flight response kicked in. I got very nervous that I couldn't answer the questions they gave me then when we moved on to the rest of the interview I just did very poorly on the questions I did know because I was so nervous. I felt very bad afterward because I completed messed up questions I knew how to do. I got so nervous that I couldn't answer them

Has anyone else ever experienced this? If I did badly on one but did well on the others do I still have a shot?

Edit\*: I also have a good amount of experience in this area including an internship, a teaching assistant job for a related class, and some academic projects. We also talked about those experiences during the technical interviews as well.

I'm wondering if I should go for an A+ Cert if I want to get started w/ a career in IT, trying to start as a desktop technician. I graduated a few years ago from a solid university with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I have past work experience as an operations manager/tutor of a small tutoring business, but did not graduate with an internship.

Unfortunately, due to extenuating family circumstances, I haven't been able to work at all until recently, While I've been working on my coding skills, I really don't think the field is for me. I want to get into the IT field instead in a support role. Should I go for the A+ when applying for entry level positions, or should I just start applying now given that I have a CS Degree?"
12usva4,40,2023-04-21,Mom always assumes I chose to be lazy and jobless for the rest of my life,Arisse_Aki,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/12usva4/mom_always_assumes_i_chose_to_be_lazy_and_jobless/,"Currently about to graduate with a Bachelor's in Comp Sci and as many probably know, the job market is pretty crappy right now so I haven't been able to land any job. I have a part time job at my university that I can thankfully stick with for the duration of summer so I was planning on using some of that time to keep applying over the summer while still earning some money. I told my mom about my plan and immediately assumed that's where I **want** to work for my entire life. 

So I have a lot of regrets over the course of these past few years, one of which is not being able to land an internship because I had severe social anxiety which the pandemic did nothing to help me with it and that I was able to FINALLY work on these last two years in college. I told her about my social anxiety way back when and she assumed I was just making an excuse so I could be lazy or stay jobless for the rest of my life and started lecturing me and comparing me to others. I also told her about my difficulty finding a job and she lectured me about how I should have gotten an internship beforehand so this didn't happen. As if not being able to function like a normal human being wasn't an issue in itself but I honestly gave up trying to explain my difficulties. I feel like I'm not able to truly move on from my regrets because my mom always brings it up to remind me of how much of a failure I am with my past defining who I am today and in the future.

Also, she always tells me that if I can't get a job *right after I graduate*, I should just go for a Master's and then a PhD. In Comp Sci. I don't plan on stopping my job search, especially over the summer, but she makes it sound like my degree is worthless after my graduation and it's really demotivating. I have no idea why she thinks it's a good idea to make me want to give up at this point and against my better judgement after having gone through this over and over and over and over, it's starting to affect me.

I hate how telling my mom anything is like arguing about anything on Twitter (You like waffles so that means you hate pancakes mentality). I avoid leaving my room most of the time just so I don't have to deal with this, even if that means starving myself. I just wish she would stop but I can't actually say it or else I might get kicked out. I also can't move out because I'm broke and I have no friends I can actually trust.

I love love love my mom but I hate having to deal with this every time I see her. :("

More specifically, I feel like I didn't push myself to take more AP classes. I've only taken 3 so far--AP World in sophomore year and AP Calculus AB and AP Lang in junior. I plan to take 2 more for my senior year--Calc BC and Chem. I also did a College Algebra dual enrollment class if that counts. So by the end of high school that would be 5 APs total plus 1 dual enrollment class.

My regret about not taking more AP classes started when I realized that a lot of my peers have already taken 5-6 at this point and by the end of senior year they'll most likely have even more. I feel like I screwed myself over by not doing the same. It's not like the schools I attended did not offer that many AP classes. They did offer a good amount. My reasoning for not taking too many, however, was that I didn't want to overstress myself--I only wanted to take as much as I thought I could handle (I'll admit though that taking less has been better for my mental health). 

I also have mixed feelings about my extracurriculars. They aren't spectacular by any means (no internships, summer programs, jobs, club leadership, or curing cancer lol), but they are things that I'm truly passionate about: volunteering at my local library w/ children, reading, writing, and art. Though those ECs I listed have nothing to do with my intended major (I plan to do some kind of engineering) so that's also another concern I have. 

I currently have a draft finished for my UC personal statements and I tried my best to write authentically about the ECs that I listed earlier. I'm hoping that the authenticity and personal touches that I added will (hopefully) make my essays stand out and make me seem more well-rounded and interesting rather than just another ""Asian in STEM"" lol. 

Anyway, that's the end of my rant. I would also love to hear some stories from people who have similar stories to mine--those who took an ""average"" amount of AP classes and wrote about the few extracurriculars that they were genuinely passionate about--and how that ended up for them.

Thanks for listening!! (and plz be nice, this is my first time posting on here haha)"

Been feeling pretty down lately as I have not secured a summer internship, and seeing how it's almost May it's a pretty low chance that I'd get an offer. I'm quite bummed out because I was so sure that I'd be getting an internship offer from a company, seeing how the interview went quite well. It's been almost two weeks now and they haven't replied, so :/

The next time I can apply for an internship would likely be next summer (I'm going on exchange next semester, and I have to complete a compulsory research project in my 4th year). I'm looking forward to doing the research project, but I'm not sure how that would boost my resume as I'm not intending on pursuing a career in research.

I'm quite stressed because I'm scared I wouldn't be able to secure an internship next summer as well, seeing how tough it has been for me to even get replies from the companies I applied to this year. I don't know what to do :( I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to get a job after graduation. I know it sounds like an extreme outcome but I just cannot stop thinking about it.

Of course the onus was on me to plan my time well when I enrolled into uni, but I was quite blur and I had no one to rely on, so I basically trial and error-ed my way through everything. I'm just hoping someone out there shares the same feelings as me I guess."

Melbourne, Australia 

As per the title, I’m at a point where I’m set on changing career paths. For context I completed a Paramedicine degree last year, and during the last year of the degree to now I’ve realised there are aspects of that job that I really don’t enjoy. Initially I was okay with that, as your days can be quite diverse, the money is great and there’s the opportunity to specialise. In Feb this year my son was born and has changed my entire perspective on careers and the future. There’s no real career growth being a paramedic, at least in Melbourne, Australia. There are a few specialisations but ultimately it’s very limited. Being a paramedic branched off from wanting a career in medicine. 

Fast forward to right now, I’m heavily interested in anything related to computers and finance. I’ve enrolled myself in a Masters of Computer Science to create a pathway for me into other industries. The main thing I’m wanting to find out, and I’m not sure if I’m posting in the correct sub, is what kind of opportunities do I have getting into certain industries? I have been reading online that most of the finance industry is super competitive, and competitiveness for positions is directly related to what kind of school you come from and what internships you’ve done. The IT sector looks a bit more forgiving in terms of opportunity. I’m turning 26 and have been in healthcare for the last 2-3 years, specifically in prehospital care. As for the past 6 months I have been in an administration and communications role (this is where my eyes opened as to how much I don’t want to continue with being a paramedic).

In terms of study, I have my current enrolled option of Masters of CS, but I could also potentially do Applied Finance or Cybersecurity. 

TLDR: Changing career paths, wanting to know how competitive certain sectors are to evaluate job opportunities. Masters are expensive and want to make the right choice."

For getting an intern, people are applying to like 500+ companies and getting one interview out of it. Same happened to me. After applying to 500+ companies, one company gave a callback for SDE intern role at PTC Onshape. I cleared all the rounds and then my final interview came, where I had no idea what they were going to ask.

I know I had prepared leetcode as much as I can and I trusted my problem solving skills that I can even crack most of FAANG if I got the chance. But here, I had no idea on what they will ask and what they want. My recruiter kept forwarding me to another recruiter who kept ignoring me and my doubts were not cleared before the interview. But I did what I could and asked people on LinkedIn, which gave me different answers so I prepared all I could.

Then came the interview day, and it started with design patterns in Java. And I was like fuck, as I hadn’t done Java in 2 years and it was the exact thing I wanted to clear off my recruiter but there I was. I did answer everything correctly, it took some time to think and remember Java concepts but I pulled through. The problem solving round after this was a breeze where I solved questions in like less than a minute. They were pretty silly and easier than leetcode easy so like not a real test at all. The interview ended well, and I was told that it may take a week to get back the result.

This happened in the first week of February, and today is 21st April when I finally got the reject for the internship. 2.5 months, filled through copy-pasted recruiter replies on my follow-ups and ghosted emails. It was the worst period of my life as the pressure, the anxiousness, the uncertainty as no other companies were giving a callback and time was nearing the end of the internship search period. This affected my efficiency as you all might know when you are in the process of the interview and the result, you don't apply as much as you would if you were not waiting.

And here I am again, without an offer, without a callback, nearing the end of the internship search period just spending my father’s money at these expensive institutes where no matter how well you perform, they will neither give you a grader nor a TA/RA. I have a 4/4 GPA at UMass Amherst MS CS and literally no benefit of the hard work.

I'm posting this to vent my frustration and seek advice from the community. I would appreciate any tips or insights on how I can improve my chances of finding an internship or job. Thank you for taking the time to read my story."

It starting when I was 13-14, and I'm 29 now. I've had very difficult moments in my life, long streaks of unemployment, living with 0 security.   
In 2021 I decided to take up programming (I did some courses back in university, so I had some knowledge). I picked it up quite fast, started attending an online bootcamp, and in just 1 month I found an internship. I stopped the bootcamp and started the unpaid internship. The first 2 months were amazing. I was finishing tasks one after another, drilling deep into the codebase, and gaining lots of knowledge.   
I guess I had some issues as there were 2 other interns, and I felt like I was in competition with them, but one of the guys left off to military service, the other was kicked out, so it was just me. The third month I started getting depressed, feeling like I'm not learning anything, and forgetting everything that I learned. I felt like I was forgetting the basics (as at work you dont work with basics, you dont develop anything from scratch). I ended up quitting work in the 4th month. This whole thing was so traumatic that I basically stopped doing and programming.  
Fast forward a year, and in August 2022 I got into a coding bootcamp as a last, desperate attempt to make this coding thing work. It was going awful, I hated the teacher, but at the very end when we had a final project I actually studied hard, did an amazing job. Got a job in December 25th.   
First 2-2.5 months were amazing, I became a super reliable employee, enjoyed doing tasks a lot. I was drilling hard into the codebase, learning a ton of stuff. But last one month it's happening againg. I'm losing motivation. And now I'm feeling super depressed, my mind is super foggy (as you can probably say from my incoherent writing), I'm forgetting everything I learnt. And now we're doing a small freelance project with my colleague and it's not going well. Basically I'm less than half the programmer that I used to be. And it's not like my tasks have become harder or anything. I've just become dumb. (Happened with playing chess as well. At one point I was doing lots of chess exercises, my rating skyrocketed, and then I got depressed and it fell 200 points.)  
I don't know what's going on with me, and I'm scared that I'll lose my job again. If anyone could help it'd be very appreciated.   


TLDR; I'm very good and super focused at work for the first 2-3 months. I gain my manager's trust, finish lots of tasks. Then I lose my motivation, start getting depressed, my mind gets foggy and I start forgetting things and not being able to think deep and solve problems. Happened in previous developer job, and I quit, I'm scared it's happening again."

I like the balance between academic and sports/entertainment life, the size of the city, the relative political climate of the campus that isn't too extreme on either side but definitely leans liberal with some diversity, a lot of diverse studies but strong reputation for biology/global health and public policy programs. A lot of school spirit across a decently sized campus in a warm environment (yes, I do prefer some place that isn't freezing cold) and a lot of school-specific traditions. I'm definitely open to LAC recommendations but would lean towards a slightly larger student body. And yes, I am aware that my chances of getting admitted at Duke are nearly zero. 

Demographics: US Citizen, 2nd generation Chinese, female  
Attended highly ranked public high school in 9th grade (class size 250), small religious/private high school from 10th-12th (class size 100) 

Intended major: public health/human health of some sort, probably with a double major either in public policy or biology. I have no interest in biomedical/environmental engineering. Planning on a master's of public health with a concentration in environmental health. 

Stats:  
Neither school ranked students  
9th grade GPA: 3.0 uw, 3.8/5.33 w  
10th grade GPA: 3.85 uw, 4.38/5.0 w  
11th grade GPA (sem 1): 3.95 uw, 4.67/5.0 w  
Average (after 5 semesters): 3.55 uw, 4.2 w  
PSAT/NMSQT: 1460 (50% chance of becoming national merit semifinalist by FL standards)  
[ACT](https://www.collegeconfidential.com/booth/act/?utm_source=site&utm_medium=linkify&utm_campaign=actbooth): 33 (first attempt) 

Affordability constraints: family income \~170k, parents will help with payment if the school is prestigious enough LOL. I already know that I can attend University of Central Florida (UCF) and University of South Florida (USF) for free. So I would only go OOS if the school is presitigious - parents define ""prestigious"" as ""better than University of Florida.""

Coursework:

9th grade: 1 AP, 1.5 DE, 4 Honors, 1.5 Regular (8 available credits)

10th grade: 2 AP, 3 Honors, 1 Regular (7 available classes)

11th grade: 4 AP, 2 Honors, 1 Regular (7 available classes) 

12th grade planned: 6 AP, 1 Honors (7 available classes)

I am currently facing a dilemma between pursuing a degree in Linguistics and Computer Science or just Computer Science alone at UCI. Unfortunately, I do not meet all the requirements to get into the regular CS program at UCLA, so I am considering the Linguistics and CS program as an option. Although I have never taken a linguistics course, I am willing to push through if it means I will have the same opportunities as a regular CS major, both in terms of education and internships.  I have heard  how some employers might view a Linguistics and CS degree as just a double major, which could be an advantage for me. With that being said, I was hoping to hear from anyone in this sub who has pursued a similar path, or knows someone who has. I would love to go to UCLA if the opportunity is the same. 

&#x200B;

Here are some specific questions that I have:  

1. How does the coursework and skills acquired in the Linguistics and CS program compare to a CS degree alone? 
2. For those who have graduated with a Linguistics and CS degree, have you found that job opportunities and internships were just as plentiful as they were for regular CS majors?  
3. Should I go UCLA linguistics - CS or UCI CS.

Thank you all for your help!"

I have volunteered in internships for nursing homes and NGOs and for the WHO approved NGOs. I am a newspaper author and a student body council member for high school.

I would like to know what co-curricular activities I can pursue online that would strengthen my college applications. Additionally, as I do not have outstanding school grades but excellent high school grades and a CGPA, what would be the best universities for me to apply to and how can I increase my chances of getting accepted? Lastly, what are the best scholarships that you can suggest, and are there any tests I should take to improve my chances of getting into a good university?

Lastly, I am interested in learning about scholarships that would be suitable for me and any tests that could improve my chances of getting into a good university. I appreciate any guidance or advice that the Reddit community can offer

I heard many stories that CpE isn’t that much in demand. I only took CpE because I wasn’t able to get into a university that offered IT or CS due to the pandemic during my final SHS year so I settled to a local engineering college. I took computer engineering because of that. This summer, I’ll be having my internship and I actually want to be in an IT company. Is it possible for a CpE to end up working in IT or tech?

12vzzbw,6,2023-04-23,Should I start machine learning or improve my web development to increase my chances of getting an internship?,Visible_Equipment_69,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/12vzzbw/should_i_start_machine_learning_or_improve_my_web/,"Before we get started, I'm a second-year computer science student without any projects (except the simple class assignments) or previous internships. I've taken basic programming courses, including data structures and computer architecture, and I have a CGPA of 3.75. I'm pretty okay with making simple projects in Python, like a web scraper using BeautifulSoup, using pygame to make a simple Flappy Bird kinda game, or making a static website using Bootstrap. I tried making a dynamic eCommerce web app using Django but I don't really enjoy those projects. My passion is to do something related to AI.

My question is how to start learning actual useful programming that will help me get an internship by next summer. I've seen a lot of job postings talking about CI/CD pipelines and web frameworks, which I have no idea about.

Theoretically, I would love to start learning machine learning right now and make some projects related to that but I have no idea how hard it will be or how long it will take. Plus I've not seen a lot of machine learning internship/coop job postings, as least not as much as for web development.

So should I start by learning machine learning or start with improving my basic web development first and learn things like RESTful APIs, React, and other related frameworks, because most of the internships I've seen are related to these.  And in this case, what should be my route? What should I start with and what should be my final goal?"

I'm a student that will soon graduate and need to find a job in IT. So far, I've made one internship (matlab dev) and i'm actually doing an internship as scala / spark dev (big data). I'm quite anxious about being able to find a job after my internship end. My studies were focused on maths, stats and IT. Because big data job offers seems quite rare, I feel like I should look for other job titles if I want to find something. However, because I didnt do a pure CS school, I'm lacking the typical theorical and practical knowledge that I guess a regular dev is expected to have (UML diagrams, design patterns, java, etc).

Thus, I feel like I will struggle to find any job other than as big data dev, because I will compete with other new grads that have those knowledge (in comparison, when I was looking for my big data internship I could emphasize on how my school courses were really shaped for big data, so I was in a strong position compared to other candidates).

Important note : I'm living in Europe, were the job market seems not to face the same recession as you guys are saying about NA

Knowing my profile, do you think looking for other IT jobs (backend ? SWE ? Devops ? I dont know ..) is reasonable, or will I struggle and need to accept a low salary to find something ? What are your advices ?"

So now it’s down to just Warwick or gap year which I don’t think it’s worth because I might try for masters in finance or something in LSE for the 1yr so it would be 3+1 year of Warwick and LSE over a NUS business 4yr course. 

I just wanted to ask in terms of careers and prospect if I happen to come back to Singapore with as much internships and a good portfolio , can I land decent jobs preferably analyst roles or is Warwick not that recognised in Singapore and not seen good enough 

I’ve perused through LinkedIn and a lot of Singaporeans tend to go there from schools such as RI/HCI/ACSI etc and I assume it’s good in that sense.

Would just like to get a general senses of the views of Warwick in the eyes of banks in Singapore .

this is just my backup as I intend to work and settle in the UK , but if I do need to come back Singapore I’m worried abt jobs as Warwick is rlly well recognised in the UK but not sure otherwise

About me: magna cum laude candidate from big 4, 2 internship experience (1 from mnc), hackathon experience, and a lot of leadership experiences.

Even though I am leaning toward declining the offers already,  I am still concerned that such offers might not come again. I just need some affirmation that it is still not too late. Right?

I did an internship in the US, and now I'm doing my Canadian taxes on Wealthsimple. I paid about USD 4k in my US taxes already. So I was hoping I wouldn't get double taxed in Canada.

However, I have education credits that I need to use. When I report my foreign income on Wealthsimple, no matter how much taxes paid I enter, I get the same sum of education credits used for 2022, and it's a big sum! So, it looks like no matter how much taxes I paid in the US, I use the same amount of education credits.

I realized the root cause of this is that my ""Basic Federal Tax"" (line 42900) is zero because I don't owe any taxes thanks to my education credits. And it's a multiplier of the amount of taxes I paid in the US. So, I get zero credit for it!

In this case, what should I do? Should I:  
\- Claim credit for the taxes I paid in the US on line 25600  
\- Somehow request a refund of the whole of my taxes from the IRS?

So when I think about that, I am not sure if I should keep it or remove it. Because when asked about them I most probably won't have an answer.

Also I really hate interview that ask theory based questions like: What is the difference between tuple and list? What are the main concepts of OOPs? What are the threads in React Native.

Too late to say this, but I mostly like and work on web and mobile app development. But I want to try out other things too.

Edit:
I have experience of React & React Native (Intern). So yeah, I am fairly new to all these. The interview I was talking about was a placement interview from college.
And now I get why I should remove some stuff from my resume, as my main experience is in Web and Mobile Development. So the concepts like OOPs and list/tuples do not popup often, as far as I have experienced, I do not know if they will pop up in future."

Dual Enrollment Classes (my college classes whilst taking college): 24

* *Such as Fundamentals of Cloud Computing, Fundamentals of Information Technology, Algebra for College Students, Introduction to Operating Systems, Introduction to Programming, Intercultural Communication, Applied Physics with Lab, Composition, ETC.*

&#x200B;

HIGHSCHOOL CURRICULUM **(Important!!!)**

Freshman year and sophomore year of hs were average, I took 1 AP offered (the only one offered). **BUT** I transferred into College for my associates degree in Information Tech for my Junior and Senior in HS. A typical day for me at school: 8 AM - 11 AM = high school (AP classes) and 12 PM - 3 PM = college.

&#x200B;

EC's:

\- **\*SUMMER AFTER JUNIOR YEAR\*** Cancer Research at Northwestern University (partnered with UChicago) - HIGHLY SELECTIVE PROGRAM: I conducted and presented an individual research I did with a mentor (equipped with PhD in the relating field).

\- **\*JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEAR\*** Northwestern University's Medicine Discovery Program - HIGHLY SELECTIVE PROGRAM

\- **\*JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEAR\*** Robotics (I founded a CAD branch, which I am a leader of) -- NOTE: This EC is a College EC, not in relation to HS

\- \***JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEAR\*** Internship (Specific name, which I am not going to mention for safety): I worked to research parts of Chicago that weren't equipped with a desirable healthcare system, voiced the opinions of residents, and created a ""city plan"" to help advocate for change in primarily the South and West sides of Chicago.

\- **SOPHOMORE - SENIOR YEAR\*** Cancer Kids First Volunteer: Led online zoom sessions with other peers to connect with Cancer patients (ages 6-12) and organized events to help cheer children up (Valentines day: basket filled with chocolate and stuffed animals, etc).

\- **\*SOPHOMORE AND PARTIAL JUNIOR YEAR\*** University of Illinois at Chicago Engineering Internship - SELECTIVE PROGRAM, about 20% ""acceptance rate"" (fun note: I was the only representative of my grade level): Worked to support environmental justice and food inequality by volunteering at Stein Learning Gardens at St. Sabina while helping support a community greenspace, while also innovating a robot system to help clean up the university campus.

\- **\*SOPHOMORE YEAR\*** Research Intern at Malcolm X College for applied engineering in medicine: Learned about the different disciplines of medicine (neurology, cardiology, etc) and learned ways to apply the engineering disciplines to the medical field. *Created a paper/presentation to present one way to improve the functionalities of hospitals with the existence of engineering.* 

**I HAVE A LOT MORE EC'S BUT I MAINLY LIKE THESE ONES**

&#x200B;

**Honor's:**

&#x200B;

**RECCOMENDATION LETTERS:**

**English Professor** (who graduated grad school from Northwestern University) = 100/10, I am by far her favorite student out of all college students (pretty evident) and she wrote a rec letter for me for my second EC (Northwestern Medicine Discovery Program) which helped me get in.

**Research Professor** (who I worked directly with in the summer with Cancer Research @ Northwestern) = 10/10, We worked together really well and developed a good student professor bond which helped me a lot with my cancer presentation.

&#x200B;

**ESSAY:**

I would rate my essay a solid 8/10, my essay is (obviously) personal but relates my personal life to my life's passion, which is BME. I think my essay stands out a lot, I just need to come up with great transitional words/phrases which will help tie it together well.

&#x200B;

**Extra info:**

It's important to note that for all my EC's, I paid 0 dollars to attend. I also pay no money to attend college. Another significant factor is that my family income is very, very low, especially because I am the oldest daughter of 5 girls to my parents and will have to expect at least 95% of my tuition to be waived at colleges.

I plan on applying ED to Northwestern University. For RD, I plan on applying to the following schools: UChicago (EA), Georgia Tech, Tulane, UC Schools, John Hopkins (EA), MIT (EA), UIC, Loyola University, IIT, All ivy leagues (including stanford & duke).

I am applying for an internship and they gave me a take-home project to complete in python. I've implemented all they've asked for, but I need some outside opinion to tell me if my code is garbage or not. 

It's mainly a refresher on how to implement OOP, and how to implement pytest.

I'm willing to pay up to $40 for a single hour long session depending on your credentials. DM if interested

Thanks!"

I already have two degrees and work experience as a teacher, but I’m skeptical towards bootcamps and I don’t trust my degenerate self to succeed solely self-taught. I feel that a degree is the safest, most comprehensive path towards my goal of working in web development. 

From my extended (and, at times, exhaustive) late-night Reddit scrounging on this topic, it seems a bachelors is the best fit for someone like me. It’ll take me $16k and 2.5 years to graduate and I’ll have two summers to (hopefully) secure some internships. I’ll be catching up on prereqs this summer before diving into calc 1, intro to programming, and a computer programming elective class in the fall. I’ll also be taking as many courses as possible at my nearby CC and transferring credits. 

Any specific tips or general advice for an older, returning student like myself? Should I join the CS / programming club? Attend hackathons? Any special electives I should look out for? Could already having degrees affect my chance to get an internship?

My last math class was over ten years ago,  please pray for me."

Hi I’m about to finish my first year as a cs student and I was wondering how the job market is for iOS development specifically in terms of internships, I live in Chicago if that helps. I have tried doing basic stuff in web dev and iOS dev such as building a calculator in both and I think I enjoy iOS more but the amount of internships for web dev seems huge compared to iOS when I look at LinkedIn"
12wr5xg,22,2023-04-23,Feasibility of attaining degree while working full time?,pingusuperfan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12wr5xg/feasibility_of_attaining_degree_while_working/,"I’m interested in going to school for an associates in cybersecurity, as it’s now free to attend community college in my state. I’m aware that I won’t be particularly competitive without a bachelors but I’m hoping an associates will be enough to land at least an entry level job where I can build experience while I get my bachelors, or in the worst case scenario, find out that I am not suited for tech jobs without taking out loans.


My main concern is whether or not getting the associates and finding entry level work will be feasible while already working full time. I’m 29 with no prior college credits and I work a shitty dead end job as a pizza guy, I currently make enough to get by, but I can’t afford to cut my hours even a little.


I’m not sure if it’s realistic to expect to complete an associates working 40 hours a week. Will there be an unpaid or poorly paid internship in my near future? If so, would it be even remotely possible to work in the evenings and maintain the internship?

Also, am I even going to be able to get a decent job with just an associates or is it just going to be entry level IT work for $15 an hour? I make around $21.75-26 an hour right now and I can’t take a position making less than $19.50 without defaulting on my bills.

Has anyone here successfully gone from a blank slate to educated and employed in a tech field while working full time?"

I have been learning C# and have caught on super quick, and overall feel like I have done pretty good at learning the language fast. I have a few questions about the study in general though. 

1 - What is the difference between  a Software Engineering and Computer Science degree? Pros/Cons of each? With each degree what types of jobs would I be looking at? 

2 - I have 2 Associates degrees unrelated to CS. Does that help me in any way? Do I have to go back to school, or can I build a portfolio and gain myself an entry level job? 

3 - If I do have to go back to college how important is an internship? I currently work a full-time job already and obviously can’t just leave to go back to school. 

4 - I am most interested in video game development, but am open to options. What would be the best path for me? Best languages to learn after C#? 

5 - I guess I kindof have answered this myself, but how important is it to be good at math? I’m horrible at math but have caught on to code very fast. 

6 - Is there anything else I can do other than college to make myself more appealing? I have been working on the csharpacademy, and have taken some courses on Coursera. 

Thank you guys so much in advance!"

**Additional Information:**

**Honestly, I'm pretty happy with the decisions, the hospital volunteer was definitely my biggest EC, and the relative lack of awards/big EC's for these schools probably dragged me down. Plus I feel like my EC's didn't really match up with some of my majors. And the SAT score was NOT helping me anywhere.**

**I'll be really hyped to go to UMass or UCD, but I'm still choosing between them 😭 I'll be paying 38K (4 year total) for UMass and 72K (4 year total) for UCD (parents covering rest), but I want to go to vet/grad school, so I don't know what to choose. Davis has better prevet opportunities/resources, but UMass is a lot cheaper and still really good for public health**"

I originally switched from CS at my local cc to IS at my state university because I was burned out from CS (hated programming and project deadlines at the time) and wanted to learn about data analysis in IS (We learned Python, SQL, data analysis/visualizations, and database design. It has the stigma of being “an easier CS” at my university from CS majors). I just graduated and I’m currently looking for jobs.

I noticed that most job postings for tech careers require a CS degree. I’m currently interested in working at an internship in data/systems analysis and full-stack/web dev. I want to know if I should go back to school for CS because of the careers I’m interested in.

Please let me know your thoughts."
12wy61d,0,2023-04-23,Should I go abroad for college if I have to take a difficult degree that I don't even want?,user_username11,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/12wy61d/should_i_go_abroad_for_college_if_i_have_to_take/,"I'm a music and sound engineer from the Philippines, a third world Asian country with not many opportunities for creative people like me. I recently got a significant scholarship at SCAD for a BFA degree, and I plan on taking sound design. My father however, will only let me study there if I take architecture as my major. Even after trying to talk to him for days, he doesn't want to budge. Even after telling him how much I want this, how hard I'm willing to work, and how hard I've already worked with what little opportunities I've been able to find here, he doesn't seem to care. I've tried to convince him to let me just take it as a minor, but he didn't care for that either.

The school I got into has a reputation for being hard, and from what conversations I've been able to have with architecture students, architecture is notably more difficult than some other degrees there. If I decide to take archi as my major It's going to be very hard for me to work on sound design and pursue it as a career while staying afloat with archi as my major. My scholarship may suffer as well.

I've thought about it and here are the options I've been able to think of so far:

1.) I take archi as my major, with sound design as a minor. I try to do internships and participate in student films and such as a sound designer, or something similar. The risk here is that the workload might be too heavy, and either my major or my extracurriculars would suffer. Worst case scenario is that I'm expelled for low grades, but even if that happens, I would hope that the connections I make could get me work eventually. 

2.) I stay in my home country, pursue sound and music here, and still try to look for opportunities abroad, such as internships, from here. Doing this would sacrifice the potential connections I could make when attending the school I would have went too, and I also feel that it would be harder to push myself here. I feel like it would also be much harder to apply for internships and find opportunities, here or abroad.

3.) I go abroad, take sound design, and not tell my dad. Aside from having to walk on eggshells whenever he asks about college, If I'm not able to find a job after college, would have to go back to my home country and face him (he is emotionally abusive, and can be physically abusive). 

Those are the only things I could think to do so far. I'm not sure what to do anymore, and I'm hoping that I could find advice here. 

Any help would be appreciated, Thank you."

I'm a community college student and decided a year ago to peruse applied math instead of CS to transfer because although I'm passionate about CS, its really hard to get into a UC with CS, and I ""wanted"" the college experience at a UC and the name that goes with it. Flash-forward, I got into UC Berkley and Davis, which I am happy about, but I'm realizing I might be making a mistake. I like math (the lower divs I've taken), but I don't LOVE it. Going to Calday, seeing the department, talking to students, and looking over what the upperdiv courses are I had a ""wtf am I doing"" moment. All the upper divs fill me with dread, not interest. Meanwhile, I really do love CS and spend a lot of my freetime doing projects and learning about it; looking at CS or EE upperdivs fills me with interest in contrast. I'm tired of community college and want to move on, but the other choice I have is stay another year and do a few more courses and transfer to CS at likely an average Cal state (like East Bay), with a reach of going to Santa Cruz or Davis. While it delays me a year, I feel I will be happier this way, but this decesion just stresses me out so much thinking about, I don't know if I will regret it. To sum up, heres a pro con table:

**Go to UC berkley for applied math**

Pro:

Connections and networking

Has the college campus experience

Proud of going to a prestigious school that has been a dream my life (parents want me here too)

Can be useful for non software dev jobs if I apply it right (big if, brings me anxiety thinking about it)

Can graduate in 2 years

Surrounded by bright students, clubs, opportunities

Con:

Not as passionate about subject (I feel dread rather than interest looking at upper divs)

Difficult courses, afraid I wont pass and will drop out if not motivated

Slightly more expensive (waste of money+time if I drop out)

Could be filtered from CS jobs since it isn't a CS degree

If I can get a software job with a non-relevant degree, might as well do something like philosophy or history that aren't as theoretically hard

**Stay one more year at CC, transfer for CS (likely a CSU)**

Pro:

Studying the subject I want to, happier

Am motivated in classes and persue interests outside of the classroom

Get a computer science degree, which is what I want my career to be currently

Cheaper if I go to a CSU, extra year at CC is free

Can use the extra year to work part time jobs and do projects before graduating (only have a few classes to take)

Still have access to bay area internships

Con:

Have to stay another year at CC

Living at home for another year (maybe 3 if I commute for university and wont get the campus experience)

Wont get into a ""top"" school, which could close some doors for getting a foot in the door

Students on avg wont be as motivated and driven as those at berkeley

Wont have networking opportunities like those at berkeley

Feel like I wasted part of my time at CC doing irrelevant classes

Sorry for the wall of text, I'm just really stressed out about all this. Any advice would be helpful."

This is the way I see it; there are problematic students, but they don't bother me because I recognize that it's not entirely their fault. Most students are victim to mental illness and incompetent parenting, and I seem to have that gift to reach 99% of those students. Yes, there are problematic administrators that create a toxic environment; I should know because I've dealt with a few. It actually inspired me to get my masters in administration so I can be the administrator that everyone deserves.

Nobody ever talks about problematic teachers. I am leaving my school at the end of year, though I am leaving to go to another school district that's closer to my home. While I can say a lot of positive things about my school, I am looking forward to leaving. I have an amazing principal who has been very supportive of me in the classroom as in my coursework, and there are some great teachers, but there are too many teachers that make my life harder than it needs to me.

First of all, I am a special education teacher, and I try to use their grade-level coursework that they are working on in class, but I never know what they are working on in class. Every week I ask them what they are working on, but nobody responds to me, so I have no way to plan. I also don't have access to their pacing guides or the teacher portals. Second, I can never get present level data to put into their IEPs; the principal has to get involved every single time, and when they do it's useless. I acually had a teacher wrote ""he can't read"" on the present level form; this student can read, but they are struggling with dyslexia and their independent grade level is pre-primer. Just this week alone, I lost it; we are doing state testing, so I pick up all of my students who have small group testing accommodations on their IEP. Friday, we have our weekly ESS department meeting, and the dean of students made an all-call in which she said ""Mr. YouDogsAllWet will pick up his students when he is done with his ESS department meeting. So, our meeting ends, and I pick up my students. I log into the testing portal, and I see that several students began their tests. One student told me he was instructed by his teacher to start his test because I was taking so long. I lost it; I began yelling, ""I HAVE NEVER HAD TO WORK AGAINST TEACHERS SO MUCH IN MY CAREER!!!!"" It's funny because I made the comment in our meeting that I feel like we're adversaries for the gen ed teachers instead of allies. Other incidents this week included a teacher calling me all bent out of shape because I couldn't pick up a student because I was testing, and he was being observed, and another teacher took it upon herself to send my students to my room because she was being observed.

Second, I feel like I can't rely on my coworkers, especially when it matters. Dismissal is a volatile time and we have a problem with students fighting, but nobody is ever at their post, are late to their post, or are too busy talking to other teachers to pay attention. One of my projects for my internship was to revise the dismissal process to cut down on behavior problems and maintain safety; literally 95% of the problems could be solved if teachers would get to where they're supposed to be. I also worked in another district in which a couple teachers would talk in the hallways for 5-10 minutes after dismissal, leaving students unattended in the classroom. I've also seen teachers listening to their headphones during class, teachers leaving early, and even threatening to beat up students.

Finally, there are several areas of concern that really worry me. There is a teacher at our school that is so deep in conspiracy theories they'd made a QAnon believer say ""you're nuts."" I confessed to a coworker that if I ever became an admin he'd be the first one gone because the fact he's a teacher scares the hell out of me. One time he went off on me because I corrected him when he said King Louis XIV started the Church of England to a group of students. I also have a teacher who is such a master at making things about him that Michael Scott would say, ""bring it back a little.""

TLDR: I hate my job because of my coworkers."

I was accepted into a great opportunity to go on exchange for one month this summer (JUNE), this opportunity will be an incredible one for me, my cv and everything (I have already confirmed with the institution that i’d attend). 

On the other hand, this week I have 2 upcoming interviews for summer internships when I come back from exchange (they’re both at good companies with good pay which would be so helpful to me especially the second part 🥲), the thing is they expect all their interns to work from June till end of August (whole 3 months of the summer). 

Now my question is SHOULD I (or how do I) tell HR during my interviews that if accepted as an intern I can only work from July-August. You guys think this might affect their decision? 

Thanks everyone!"

Although I would like research opps, i don't think they are super important to me if SJSUs location will grant me more internships and whatnot.

Recently, I wrote an article on how Cloud Computing is basically the stepping stone and the main catalyst for the fourth industrial revolution. How the gradual migration to microservices and distributed systems in order to produce scalable, lightweight and efficient solutions is the way to go. You know how every person looks for the meaning of their life? I believe this is mine, to be a part of this revolution, to help migrate our society to a better one, to create better solutions, to adapt, to improvise, to innovate.

I (M25) am a medical student nearly finishing my internship, and was invited by dream center for a Internal medicine residency program interview.

Now here is where I fucked up 4 months ago I decided to buy my first suit (where I’m from suits aren’t really all that common) to keep for special occasions such as the interview. When I bought the suit I made sure it was little tight since I was planning on losing weight over the next period. For context four months ago I was 108 Kg now I’m 86 Kg I’m also 168 CM.

Anyways I bought the suit and left it there for about four months, and decided that I should wear it for my interview. So, I got it ready the day before the interview along with all my other stuff and as you can imagine I was a walking ball of anxiety and nervousness, and in that state I completely forgot to actually try it on.

I go to sleep, wake up extra early put it on and lo and behold the pants don’t fit and for the life of me I couldn’t find the belt I bought, I have never felt such conflicting feelings of Pride/self-hate/panic in my life lol.

So I did what any self respecting adult would do and asked my mom for help, she just said give me the pants and wait for 10 minutes. She came back and apparently sowed the pants together from the back so it would be tighter, and since it’s going to be covered while wearing it was a perfect solution.

Then she called me an idiot, made me breakfast and wished me luck. (God bless her)

btw anyone interested interview went great, program director called me the same day, told me they were very impressed during the interview + my good CV + I worked with them for half a year and that he personally wanted to congratulate me, and extend an offer to work with them. I start in 6 months 

TL;DR I lost a lot of weight so the only suit I had didn’t fit me for the most important meeting of my life"

I'm a junior CS student from Turkey. I am applying for internships this summer that will potentially continue as a part-time job next year and then as a full-time job if all goes well. It will be a compulsory internship and will be at least 2 months. I assume it will be the most important thing in my resume. 

There are dozens of companies and I really am not sure how to choose between potential offers. I study in a good university and have a better CV than most with projects and previous voluntary internships. There are places I got rejected from too, but I would say I'm above average for sure. I have the most experience in data science and software development, but I have a lot to learn in both. I am nowhere near proficient enough.

&#x200B;

I got an offer from a software company with 30-40 employees that developed software for some of the biggest firms like banks, Turkish Airlines etc. (approved and waiting for a response)

Another is a relatively big tech firm with 750+ employees and has various departments but the internship is more like a Java bootcamp and only the second month will be project based. (approved and waiting for a response)

At the same time I'm in an interview process with Mercedes-Benz Turk that is going well. This is not certain yet, but I believe I can pull it off. 

There are also many startups and other companies I am expecting to hear from but I'm not sure how to proceed here. For example, Mercedes-Benz is the most well-known and I heard from many that the culture and the work/life balance are all great and the compensation is decent as well. Also departments like R&D(a proper one) and cybersecurity exist which are not as easy as a software developer position to land. It is not a tech-firm though. I don't want to get carried away by the name of a big company and learn a lot less than I could in a random startup as a fullstack developer. 

&#x200B;

Most of the companies just finished taking applications. That's why I am not very eager to settle for the ones that are expecting a response already as they are not perfect and I want to see the other offers as well. Other than the points I'm looking at, do you have any suggestions for me to consider or I should care more about? The pay does not change a lot at this point so I do not care too much right now, at least until I graduate."
12xa83u,2,2023-04-24,"TIFU by letting my friends (18M, 17M, 18M) cut my (18M) hair",JasonC5k,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/12xa83u/tifu_by_letting_my_friends_18m_17m_18m_cut_my_18m/,"Essentially, yesterday my friends (18M, 17M, 18M) were saying how bad my (18M) hair was looking and how it gave them flashbacks to last years hair (although in my opinion it wasn't even that bad and it did not look a single thing like last years hair which was rlly bad). I disagreed but this guy kept saying how my hair was swaying all the girls away and how it really needed a trim and a fix up. I got fucking gaslighted into believing this shit although no one has said a thing about it during easter or anything, or maybe they got used to my long ass hair but either ways my trim was being fucked around and shit on like a punching bag.

On the way back, this guy insisted on cutting my hair for me, i was quite hesitant because they have been insisting this for ages, even last year when my hair was in its worst form. I didn't believe they could fix up my hair or anything because obviously we're still fucking teenagers and non of them have been in an internship or been to college for a barber degree or anything. I shook hands with it and I absolutely regret that thinking about it now, but it is what it is.

Next thing you know, we end up back in house, these guys got the equipment with razors and everything but they were lacking fucking scissors. Scissors that are pretty much essential when cutting hair, but guess what? They insisted they knew what they were doing. I was like ""ok fine I should put some faith in these guys, who knows what might happen with my hair now"", but oh was I wrong, It took them two complete hours to do my hair with the razor, and now it is in the worst possible fucking state its ever been.  The problem is that they tried to give me a fade on the back, but because they had no experience in cutting hair before, they kept going higher and higher because apparently my hair was like floating and it was quite uncomfortable to look at, so they kept going higher until that floating hair bit was gone. Throughout the process, I heard giggles and laughs, and not even that, they were watching the NBA game from last night while trimming my hair like what? I kept asking for a screenshot of the back throughout the thing but I received no reply whatsoever nor a screenshot of the back of my head. 

After that glorifying two hours, the back of my hair was completely fucked. To describe it, it looked like a showercap. The back of my hair was horizontally straight, like very straight, and it looked like there was two devil horns on the sides. There was also no FUCKING fade which was implied from them where I obviously took the bait in believing they knew what they were doing. 

Now the next morning comes up, to be honest I thought nothing of it, my friends who did the hair said it was fine (obviously a lie) and spectators who looked at the process said it was fine aswell (of course, another lie as well). Now before I'm even fully awake, I'm already hearing banging noises and knocking on my door, I'm hearing thousands of giggles of people waiting outside my door. Obviously I knew they wanted a laugh at my hair so I didn't respond and ignored them but today was a school day, and worst of it all it was Monday so we had assembly. Man the walk of shame was worse than I thought, there were people that I didn't even though existed commented on my hair cut, people staring and I was being humiliated. The most annoying part was people asking ""Oh have you seen the back of your hair?"", like no fucking shit Its my own hair of course I've seen it what kind of question is that? 

I couldn't even go to school, I kept asking my teacher if I could go off school today because in class we're just doing revision for our finals and I find it much better for me to work alone in my own room than in class hearing giggles and smirks throughout the day where I can't even focus. I have great social anxiety and stress due to minor problems from family as well, so I couldn't fucking face it anymore and I'm currently in a mental well-being talk, as well as a signup for a professional therapist to come and talk to me about this hair. This is the worst I've ever been fucked over and bullied in school, and I don't think teachers understand how bad it is. I am in therapy sessions over this trim and I don't even want to go out anymore, I feel more isolated than ever and seem like a freak that doesn't belong in this school. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm currently skipping class and I don't care if I'm caught, I just don't want to go out anymore knowing the amount of bullying and stares I'm going to get because of my cut at the back of my hair. One other thing with my hair is that, because its too short, I have to see the vice principle in school to explain as to why my hair is so short. Overall this experience is too fucking embarrassing and I just completely fucked up, worst decision I've made in my life.

TL;DR I agreed to letting my friends cut my hair, they absolutely butchered the back, now I'm getting laughed at and bullied over it and its the worst bullying I've received since. I'm now currently signed up for therapy sessions over this and I have to see the vice principle to explain why my hair has gone this way."

I'm considering a conversion course, but I don't want to waste my time on something like that if it won't get me anywhere in terms of a career. However, trying to just teach myself and work on my own projects and then hoping it's enough to get hired seems very unlikely to succeed. So if I go for a course, which courses could you recommend? I want to do a course that's practical, not too theory heavy as I struggle with that stuff, something that can help me get my foot in the door as an intern. I'm not picky when it comes to the field, and could be front-end, back-end, full-stack. The dream would be game-dev but I understand that's not realistic. 

As a bit of background, I'm very familiar with computers, been a PC gaming nerd from a young age, and I've a basic grasp of programming. I make large-scale mods for Unity games using Harmony (basically using reflection in C# at runtime), and I made a basic windows forms config app for one of them. Over the last two years or so I've done dozens of small projects via tutorials making apps in flutter, xamerin and started looking at React and I've some past experience with helping out on an Angular project, though it feels like I barely remember the specifics for any of these, sort of ""jack of all trades master of none"" but even being the jack of all feels dubious. 

I wouldn't be very skilled or proficient with any of these frameworks as I was just following tutorials for the most part or doing very basic front-end development. I have a hard time retaining the syntax, work flow and other particularities due to switching between them and tutorials being mostly very surface-level. But I do have a decent foundational understanding of core programming concepts at this stage, enough to pick up and learn new frameworks and languages to a basic degree. I'd probably still benefit from a formal course if it's beyond the basics of a coding bootcamp."

I started in 2019 and was so excited. Then lock down started and my school is still doing classes online. I loved being on campus and making connections with people. 

My program is in mental health and ironically it is effecting my mental health. I took a semester off for burn out but it didn't help. I was so happy when I started and I felt like I finally found the right career for me. 

Now I'm 51 and working full time in a job that barely pays anything, also in mental health. I'm so tired of the zoom classes. I feel like I'm missing out on so much. 

I have had some really bad professors who have signs of dementia and the classes were a disaster. 

In addition I needed my student loan to pay my rent and they screwed up the financial aid process so much that I was threatened with eviction. I had to have friends help me financially. 

This program requires two semesters of unpaid internships which are about twenty hours a week. On top of that you still have to go to class to talk about your internships. Then I have to take a big test and then try to get a job and work a certain number of hours with a supervisor to get licensed. It feels impossible to me now that I could basically be working 70 hours a week.

I don't know what I was thinking. At my age, I'm tired. I have worked so many jobs where I worked myself into the ground, got bullied, treated like shit from customers, I'm just spiritually drained. 

In addition I work in a city with a high homicide rate, we have had to shootings at schools in the last year. I have to go into the schools to do my job and its a constant state or anxiety for me. 

I'm literally helping to assess suicidal kids and I'm getting paid so little I'm eligible for food stamps. This is incredibly depressing. And I can't get a second job because of school. 

Now I have all this student loan debt but if I get licensed I'm still not going to make a lot of money. 

Any insights welcome."

&#x200B;

**Defination of cold email, no roles available, absolute hail mary**

This is probably the least effective one, as realistically no one is going to offer a role if it isn't available, so your best bet would be to only send this to people at higher positions (think CEO, senior recruiter etc. etc) at relatively smaller companies. you never know is what i think.

I’m currently the only IT person at my current job. I have learned a lot on my own. I worked in retail, manufacturing and construction before I decided that IT is the best way to go for myself so I don’t destroy my body (hands are the worse). I’m late 20’s. 

Here is what I have done so far with my IT career:

-Almost done with my Cyber security associates (2 gen eds left after this semester)
-did an internship at my previous employer
-current place is just over a year now
-built the network and servers
-ran the Ethernet even
-project management and budgeting 
-took care of the MDM for phones and tablets
-switched the company over from strictly cellular to VoIP
-installing and running cameras
-tech support (kind of a given)

I have more projects that are on hold due to budget such as getting security on endpoints and the network for monitoring, installing new cameras, some self hosted services to cut costs and help everyone one get the same treatment for what they need.  

Like I said before, I’m not great at anything specific and it feel like it is hindering me. Im also studying for the CCNA. 

Things I know I need to work on:

Programming such as python, scripting for Linux and windows, purple team security. 

If I start a business doing support to possibly a msp type thing, what should I have on my resume for myself to make sure I’m capable? I am concerned that I will never feel ready enough."

I have completed The Odin Project as well as a bunch of other passion projects, I can also code in python and have built a bunch of machine learning projects with it, ive also learned a bunch of data structures and algorithms and am fairly good at leetcode.

So do I have any chances of getting an internship while not in university? I would even take an unpaid internship to start building experience."

Hello everyone,

I think I should provide you with some background knowledge to help you fully understand my situation. I am 28 years old. My bachelors was in liberal arts and sciences with the intent of doing something in the medical field but it didnt really work out. I have always been interested in computers, cybersecurity, and technology in general. So I decided to pursue a masters in computer science. As expected, I had no foundational knowledge of computer science so I had to take the introductory courses which I have just completed. Now that I'm on break, what would you recommend I do too best bolster my resume. I have tried applying for internships but many require you to be a student pursuing a bachelors in computer science or other related field, which I am not. A job seems out of the question, so I'm alittle puzzled on what I can do to get some experience. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and consideration"

I'm currently an undergrad junior at UIUC studying Computer Engineering. I plan on heading into software engineering for my career path and already have some internship experience. I am looking into pursuing MCS some time after I graduate part-time though I'm unsure of how useful it would be for someone in my position. It seems like a lot of students pursuing MCS are coming from different career paths so they are going for the MCS so that they can enter software engineering."

I'm in a bit of a weird situation and I'd like some opinions so as to avoid making any clear mistakes. I know this is more fit for a general subreddit, but this works fine too as I feel much better talking to fellow UCSD people, idk why.

Anyways . as a fellow college student, like many, me and my friends from high school all went our separate ways. The only relationship I've tried to maintain is that with my girlfriend, as up until now we've been together for 4 years. she studies out of state so she's a bit far.

Lets just say that fall quarter, for a variety of reasons, with faults on both sides, my relationship with my girlfriend went very much downhill. It got to a point where all of our conversations were just heated arguments and petty insults. Eventually we agreed that we needed space and to ""take a break"". It was pretty ugly 

Suffice to say I haven't talked to her in 5 whole months, and hell my mutual friends with her even told me she's seeing someone else right now, but I won't believe it until I confirm it with her. 

meanwhile, over on my end, throughout the whole year, I've become very very close friends with one of my colleagues. We are colleagues in orchestra, we are members of the same organizations, and we study frequently together, almost everyday. We also hangout as part of the same circle of friends, so I see her regularly. She's probably one of my most trusted friends I've made this quarter and we're exceptionally close. 

As of right now we're just friends, but over the course of the year (slowly I'll emphasize), I realize that I'm very much falling for her, I've developed very strong feelings for her and she's very important to me. I'm sure of it as she's always in the back of my mind and my favorite part of any day is just getting work done with her. I've tried so hard to ignore the feelings at first, but they get stronger by the day, and as of now, those feelings couldn't be any stronger. 

The issue is, she's from New York and I'm from here, she has an internship for all of fall quarter next year, and on top of that she's graduating early next year, while I have a bit to go. What that means is that in practice if I did ask her out and it worked, we'd only be together a few weeks, have a huge gap in time where we couldn't see each other, and even when she came back, she'd finish school before I did, and of course she needs to get her career started which I respect. 

Not to mention I still don't know what the hell is with my current relationship as we haven't spoken in months, and obviously I need to get that squared away before doing anything. Not doing so would obviously be plain wrong. 

The situation as a whole is just very conflicting, and it really bothers me, I'd like some input, or any input really, especially if you've been in something similar."

12xskkh,1,2023-04-24,How do I approach my work about a pay raise after an internship?,MrTyroneTheCat,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/12xskkh/how_do_i_approach_my_work_about_a_pay_raise_after/,"As the title suggests, I recently was offered a part-time position at my current internship that was supposed to end last week. They are more than willing to work with me around my school schedule while I finish up my last term, which is a huge plus. The job is not too difficult, and I even got my own office now with an option to work from home later on when I get more experience. They pay for our lunches two days out of the week, and overall, it's been surreal to be working here given my past work experience in retail.

That being said, I have not signed anything additional since the internship technically ended and have just started coming in like nothing has changed. The people in charge are just coming back from their respective mini vacations and have informed me they are preparing additional training modules for me. I am curious, however, if I should be looking to be signing anything and if I should be expecting any increase in pay. I feel entitled to want a pay increase, but it also feels weird that if they were to hire another intern, we would be paid the same despite me being a part-time employee.  

I currently am making $25 an hour, which I am super grateful for, but as a college student, any increase helps with paying my tuition. I also work around 30 hours a week on top of going to school full time, so I'm pretty limited in my hours, and any increase helps there as well. This all is in Portland, Oregon, as well, if that helps at all.

How do I figure out if I am being paid fairly and if I need to ask for a pay raise? How do I get about deciding what amount?

I don't really have any friends or family in my situation, so I appreciate any advice you guys can give to someone like me."

I mostly learned about boring things like homeland security, policy, and law. Then I came across ethical hacking, pen-testing, devops and thought I could do that, but it was all very confusing. All of these things are so different from each other that you basically have to learn one thing, stick with it and pray you find a job and don't have to pivot into something else.

I landed an internship in Cybersecurity, but the work is more related to development and not security. Along with this I have a non-technical internship and a teachers assistant role on my resume. I did help with Python coding, but I am trying to pivot away from that since I am not very good at it.

After looking at a bunch of cybersecurity job applications, I realize I do not measure up at all. I have no time anymore to hunker down and keep learning and obtaining certifications, as I live on my own now and need to pay the bills. Most want skills I do not have and do not know how to get. Or they want 2+ years of experience and there is usually nothing entry-level. Even a lot of desktop support, and help desk jobs require relevant experience for about a year.

I don't know what to do at this point. I just need a job making $20 an hour at least."

12xt8xu,17,2023-04-24,Advice for choosing between intern Offers from Google and Boeing,Heor326,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/12xt8xu/advice_for_choosing_between_intern_offers_from/,"Hi! I recently received two internship offers – one as an FPGA/ASIC Design Intern at Boeing, and the other as a Technical Program Manager Intern at Google.

About me: EE student with a previous internship mostly related to GaN MMIC High power amplifiers. I have a lot of experience in embedded systems, PCB design, FPGA design, and research towards IC fabrication.

My two offers are below:

**Boeing - FPGA/ASIC Design Intern**

Mostly related to ASIC design for satellites. I love working with FPGAs, and ASIC design is a very similar field that I could learn a lot from.

Pay: $30

In person work at El Segundo, CA

**Google- Technical Program Manager Intern**

Related to the manufacturing process of Google products. Involves creating data automation tools, programming, and communicating between cross functional teams.

Pay: $50

Hybrid work, so it'll be in their main campus in Mountain view, CA

My primary interest lies in FPGA design, and I see myself pursuing a career in this field. Naturally, the Boeing offer aligns more closely with my aspirations, as I'll be working hands-on with FPGA and ASIC design. However, the Google offer simply blows the Boeing offer out of the water in terms of compensation, company culture, and overall brand value. It will also involve a lot of coding and data automation, along with manufacturing and reviewing factory processes. I Additionally, I've never had that much TPM experience, and I'm not sure if it's a career path that I want to go towards.

I am torn between these two options, as I'm not sure how much weight I should give to the experience and knowledge I'll gain in FPGA/ASIC design at Boeing compared to the potentially invaluable experience at Google, albeit in a different role. Additionally, having the google name on my resume is something that might be very beneficial for me.  I'm also concerned about how much the choice of internship will impact my future job prospects in FPGA design.  Has anyone faced a similar situation or worked in either of these roles before? I'd love to hear about your experiences, as well as any suggestions on which opportunity to pursue.  Thanks!"

There was nothing illegal or malicious about my project, I just wanted to access and analyze some data for my own use (the project is also not available publicly on GitHub). It is one of two projects I have on my resume, the other being a much less substantial Google Sheet script that imported some data, parsed it, and did some simple analysis. I also have one internship with a pretty well-known/reputable company and a volunteer position where I've been working on a web application for a local nonprofit for 1.5 years and have essentially taken ownership as the lead engineer at this point. Both of those positions used similar tech stacks to the role I'd be applying for (React, Javascript, AWS) which is also what my personal project used.

My question is should I remove the project that accessed their API from my resume or leave it on? I could see a world where they appreciate the fact that I am interested in their product and took the initiative to figure out how to get the data, or it could go the completely opposite direction and they could be pissed about it and it's an automatic rejection. If I take it off I'm also worried about the lack of a significant personal project. I could try to fill the gap with a school project, but honestly, none of them are very impressive or nearly as relevant to the role. It's a great company and I would love to land this job, but it feels like a very high-risk/high-reward prospect. Curious to see what others think."

Neither will let me push the position to a later date.

I want to get people's opinions on why they think this way. 

Hi, I was fortunate to receive the following offers and I am deciding on companies. I am set to graduate in 2023 December, so this will be my last internship before I graduate and look for full-time opportunities.

I am very conflicted because SoFi seems to be the appropriate option considering how much value it will add to my resume and experience (bigger name value) + it has a higher FT conversion and compensation rate if I end up not being successful with job-hunting next season. However, they are hybrid that requires me to commute, and does not have any additional benefits to the intern.

On the other hand, LiveRamp is fully remote and offers much more benefits to the interns (WFH support, $100/month on the gym, etc.), and the things that they are doing seem pretty cool as well.

&#x200B;

1. SoFi ($50/hr, 2\~3 hybrid model w/ 1hr commute, etc.)

Pros:

\- Bigger name value?

\- Higher FT conversion (80\~90%)

\- Higher new grad compensation (TC: 180\~200k) with a higher increase in TC as you are promoted?

\- Get to work with fairly new and relevant tech stacks (Java/Kotlin + Spring, Flutter, React/JS, PostgreSQL, AWS etc)

\- Not exactly sure what project I will work on, although they seemed pretty flexible that I could choose what I want to do in terms of back-end, mobile, etc.

&#x200B;

Cons:

\- hybrid model, have to commute to SF office 2\~3 days a week (1hr+ via public transportation from Berkeley)

\- no benefits including WFH, relocation, commuter

\- need to renege on my offer from LiveRamp

&#x200B;

2) LiveRamp ($50/hr, remote, $750 WFH, etc.)

Pros:

\- Better benefits package: WFH support ($750), 100 / mo for gym

\- Fully Remote

\- get to work with large-scale datasets (as it is a data connectivity platform)

\- get to a lot of new tools (Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes)

\- a lot of different responsibilities (restful API + full stack + infrastructure orchestration and configuration, coded build and release pipelines, data pipeline testing, etc.)

Cons:

\- less intern to FT conversion (50\~60%)

\- less new grad compensation (150\~180k?)

\- less name value

&#x200B;

3. Limbix ($50/hr, remote)

Pros:

\- still room for negotiation for the offer

\- a lot of flexibility as it is a startup with a small team

Cons:

\- name value

\- no data points on full-time conversion and compensation

&#x200B;

Any sort of data points or suggestion will be very much appreciated!

However so far i feel like ive only seen why SMU > NTU and not the other way around (other than ranking/dorm) 

is there any reason why NTU > SMU? honestly i am still leaning towards NTU bc i am more interested in the majors they offer for biz as compared to SMU. However I would like to know more. 

While many criticise NTU’s 3 yr program (Dropping AUs etc), does it really matter? will that affect me when i work? 

I am interested in taking up biz analytics or something risk related if i do biz, but it seems like SMU doesnt offer them? Or am I wrong about this? 

And while SMU biz probably allows me to take up many internships in school, isit really worth it? I heard people can spend 5yrs+ in SMU due to them taking up internships. As compared to 3 years in NTU, that is a pretty significant difference. 

For those that chose NTU over SMU, other than being able to stay in hall, why?"

12y6szp,5,2023-04-24,Community College to Ivy League Transfer Chances,marcstarts,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/12y6szp/community_college_to_ivy_league_transfer_chances/,"Howdy y'all essentially the title says it, I am 22 and am currently in my final semester at Austin community college, and am looking to weigh my chances in different directions.

For starters we'll talk about highschool first, AP student (6 or 7 AP tests average above 3.75 on them) 1390 SAT, 31 ACT, no class rank because I essentially finished my senior year online through a program which allowed me to graduate early(not in the idealistic way but because I had undergone some unrelated problems outside of school). Athlete as well, but nothing significant. 

Then my first attempt at college, took a semester at UCCS as a declared double major in physics and philosophy and subsequently flunked essentially straight F's, though I did receive a sympathy C- in my first year honors course. Which yes I was in the honors program, and I even found my way into the student government as a senator. After this semester I took the spring off, moved to Denver and went to CUD because they were same family of university I was able to transfer despite my gpa, for a summer semester which was also covid summer. If I recall correctly I wound up with a 3.5 gpa that semester. 

Now the reason why I think I even have a chance despite the less than ideal start; after the summer I subsequently checked myself into a rehab, and will soon be celebrating two years sober. Once back in the real world back home ish in Austin one of the first things I did was register for ACC. Since doing so I have maintained a 4.0 whilst double majoring in physics and economics. I am a member of the honors program, and a few other honors societies, I will graduate an honors scholar. I have received the chancellors honor's award for graduating with perfect GPA, ""the highest academic award given at acc."" I have also worked the entire time, at some nicely named companies, Tesla, GoogleFiber, and will intern at Dell this coming summer. I have a decent amount of volunteer hours at habitat for humanity. Overall I'd say my resume is decent and I can write some damn good essay's though I don't know how much that matters now that I'm competing with ai. 

That being said I applied to UT Austin for transfer and feel really good about my chances of getting in. But given my circumstances I can't help but feel like had I not fucked off as a kid I would be at one of the big name privates or Ivy leagues. So I kinda wish I had put more effort into building a perfect application for Columbia or University of Chicago, where I may have had a chance with the right application. Instead I'm a bit bummed out that I was so meticulous and put so much energy into my UT application, mainly as a result of all the teachers and advisors constantly reminding the students here about how ""competetive"" it is, (fair warning I know what I'm about to say is largely egotistical) but it's honestly probably not that competitive for me I mean had I just gone to school my senior year of hs I would have graduated top7% of my class and would have been automatically admitted to UT.

And same goes for me but I can't help but think that I had plenty of juice, so much so I split it and made a big ole mess lmao. 

So here I am, graduating with a couple associates degrees in less than a month, having only applied to UT, and with most if not all fall transfer applications for the big names closed. Wondering what is my best plan of action. Spoiler alert: it's probably just go to UT because it's in state and I can semi afford it. But maybe it's just keep taking classes at ACC and go super hard on extracurriculars to build the perfect spring application to Columbia GS(this program really makes me think I have a chance, and I'd love to starve in a NYC) 

Or maybe I transfer to UT for a semester to build that perfect app to then transfer to big name.

Overall looking for opinions on what to do and what my chances for the possible options are. Or advice from community college and ivy league students alike. Do I even want to put myself through the ivy league stress?? Idk just wanted to outsource some ideas.

12y6trg,6,2023-04-24,Community College to Ivy League Transfer Chances,marcstarts,TransferToTop25,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferToTop25/comments/12y6trg/community_college_to_ivy_league_transfer_chances/,"Howdy y'all essentially the title says it, I am 22 and am currently in my final semester at Austin community college, and am looking to weigh my chances in different directions.

For starters we'll talk about highschool first, AP student (6 or 7 AP tests average above 3.75 on them) 1390 SAT, 31 ACT, no class rank because I essentially finished my senior year online through a program which allowed me to graduate early(not in the idealistic way but because I had undergone some unrelated problems outside of school). Athlete as well, but nothing significant. 

Then my first attempt at college, took a semester at UCCS as a declared double major in physics and philosophy and subsequently flunked essentially straight F's, though I did receive a sympathy C- in my first year honors course. Which yes I was in the honors program, and I even found my way into the student government as a senator. After this semester I took the spring off, moved to Denver and went to CUD because they were same family of university I was able to transfer despite my gpa, for a summer semester which was also covid summer. If I recall correctly I wound up with a 3.5 gpa that semester. 

Now the reason why I think I even have a chance despite the less than ideal start; after the summer I subsequently checked myself into a rehab, and will soon be celebrating two years sober. Once back in the real world back home ish in Austin one of the first things I did was register for ACC. Since doing so I have maintained a 4.0 whilst double majoring in physics and economics. I am a member of the honors program, and a few other honors societies, I will graduate an honors scholar. I have received the chancellors honor's award for graduating with perfect GPA, ""the highest academic award given at acc."" I have also worked the entire time, at some nicely named companies, Tesla, GoogleFiber, and will intern at Dell this coming summer. I have a decent amount of volunteer hours at habitat for humanity. Overall I'd say my resume is decent and I can write some damn good essay's though I don't know how much that matters now that I'm competing with ai. 

That being said I applied to UT Austin for transfer and feel really good about my chances of getting in. But given my circumstances I can't help but feel like had I not fucked off as a kid I would be at one of the big name privates or Ivy leagues. So I kinda wish I had put more effort into building a perfect application for Columbia or University of Chicago, where I may have had a chance with the right application. Instead I'm a bit bummed out that I was so meticulous and put so much energy into my UT application, mainly as a result of all the teachers and advisors constantly reminding the students here about how ""competetive"" it is, (fair warning I know what I'm about to say is largely egotistical) but it's honestly probably not that competitive for me I mean had I just gone to school my senior year of hs I would have graduated top7% of my class and would have been automatically admitted to UT. And so for the majority of kids whom find themselves at acc expecting to transfer to UT it's difficult and competitive bc they didn't have the ""juice"" to get there right off the bat. And same goes for me but I can't help but think that I had plenty of juice, so much so I split it and made a big ole mess lmao. 

So here I am, graduating with a couple associates degrees in less than a month, having only applied to UT, and with most if not all fall transfer applications for the big names closed.

Just as the title says, I just finished first year at University majoring in Computer Engineering and failed two of my classes. 

Despite this, my GPA is still decent (&gt;3.0). I’ve seen many comments on other posts saying that failing one class, let alone two, is already pretty out of the ordinary. 

I’d say I have a decent amount of experience in terms of coding outside of school - I’ve developed my own SaaS app along with a couple of side projects. I’m wondering whether me failing those two classes would severely harm my chances of finding an internship and a high-paying job down the line, even if I have a good amount of projects and experience?

12yb04a,661,2023-04-25,Just when I had lost all hope...,college-throwaway87,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/12yb04a/just_when_i_had_lost_all_hope/,"I FINALLY GOT AN INTERNSHIP OFFER!!!!!! 

Many months ago, I found out that one of my favorite startups was offering a data science internship. I had been using their app for over five years ever since they first launched and their mission is near and dear to my heart, so I applied immediately. I was super excited and enthusiastic when they got back to me asking to schedule an interview. Unfortunately, the interview didn't go as well as I would have liked, as even though I made a good personal connection with the interviewer due to my interest in the company, I was super nervous and messed up on some questions. My interviewer told me he'd get back to me soon if I am selected. 

Many weeks went by and I didn't hear back so I assumed I got rejected. However, I thought it would be worth a try to follow up, so I sent a brief follow-up email a month after the interview. Didn't hear back from that either. I continued applying to other companies but after hundreds of applications, I got only rejections and a handful of interviews/OAs that also ultimately ended up in rejection. Even after RippleMatch supposedly ""matched"" me with a company and told me that they wanted to proceed with an interview, that company emailed me afterwards saying they had actually rejected me and wouldn't be interviewing me! Like many other students trying but failing to get an internship during this year's brutal internship cycle, I became despondent. 

Last month, after getting my winter quarter grades back, I thought it might be worth a try to send another, better follow-up to the startup I'd interviewed with to let them know that I took and received in A in the database management systems class at my school, especially since I'd learned a lot of stuff that was relevant to the role. I knew the chances of it working were very low but tried anyways and put effort into the email to show that I was still passionate about working at the company. 

Days passed by with no response, so I just accepted that I wouldn't get the role and would have to try again next year. Since it's so late now and internships are drying up, I started making alternate plans about what to do in the summer and prepared for the worst. Then finally, a week after I had sent my last follow-up, my interviewer responded to me and told me he'd like to schedule ""a brief chat."" I got my hopes up, but just a little because I knew that ""a brief chat"" could just be a codeword for rejection. 

Fortunately, rather than rejecting me, the interviewer just asked me about what new things I've done over the past months since we last spoke and asked me when I could start. At the end of the call, he welcomed me to the company and said I'm hired for the role!!! I'M SO EXCITED!!!!! They're really flexible and letting me start after my finals are over which is nice because my university ends a lot later than most, and the internship is gonna be abroad in-person!!! That's a dream come true for me since I really wanted an in-person experience and it would be so cool to spend the summer abroad.

Sorry for the long post haha, I just got the offer an hour ago and all my family and friends are asleep so I just needed to tell someone about the good news. And I wanted to talk about the importance of following up and not giving up on your dreams. As dire as the situation for internships may seem rn, there is always hope."

12yg2yr,0,2023-04-25,Is diversifying too much in tech counter productive in getting a job?,RoastedGarlic97,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12yg2yr/is_diversifying_too_much_in_tech_counter/,"I'm a university student who's in his final year at the moment. Since I started getting interested in tech about 2 years ago, I did some minor machine learning projects, got an AWS Solutions Architect cert, did an internship in devops and did a few app dev and software dev projects, and now have an in an internship for a full stack development role. 

The issue now is that there's a lot more to learn that I'm ignorant about, and I want to learn how to do those things (e.g. Sysops, IoT, network engineer, cybersecurity)

But I also need to get a full time job in about a year. 

Ideally, it'd be in a different role that I haven't tried that's still within tech, but right now I'm not sure if diversifying like this is just going to put me at a disadvantage in terms of finding a job.

I'm on the side that thinks all of them are linked and can be applied cross-specialisation (like applying cybersec knowledge for network engineer roles and so on), but would employers prefer someone who has dived deep into a single specialisation compared to spreading thin?

So now I have 2 (?) options that I can think of at the moment. One would be to choose a single field, like maybe app development and focus fully on that with projects, get a role in that then just do the other roles as side hobbies. But this wouldn't let me experience how these roles are in the workplace.

The second would be to just continue trying out different things, and hope that employers would be alright with someone with a more diverse skill set, but isn't as well versed as someone who specialises in it with tons of projects in a single field. Maybe I could try to use the next year to work towards an OSCP certification or some networking cert. 

What would be the better option for me right now? Is there any pathway that would help in jumping between these different kinds of fields while not sacrificing the salary you might receive by too much?"

My questions:

To the Tech Writers (or those in similar capacities), what did you set you sights on as far as advancement after SR level?

I would like to be a consultant. I have worked with the highest levels of management throughout my career to help develop and refine processes and strategies. Have any of you made the transition to consultant or know of anyone that has with my background?

What sort of certifications/programs/classes have you (or would like to see from a Tech Writer)? I have an expired A+ and ITIL foundation.

When choosing schools to apply to, I always had people stress the importance of picking a CS program which had co-op.

But when looking on the subreddits for some of these schools, I see a lot of people saying it's better to not use the school's co-op program because of fees etc, and suggest instead finding an internship on your own.

So I guess if there's any new grads here, what are the pros/cons of each?  And which option would you recommend?

Thanks."

However, for the past couple of years things have  become more and more unbearable for me. The thing is, that house is inhabited by a vicious monster called my aunt (badi mummy), who rules the house with an iron fist and favours her duffer sons. This year too we are supposed to go in July. She has tortured my mother mentally and riled everyone against her back when she was new, she also thinks that I should have been married off at 18 and that giving ne freedom to study is death sentence for the family. Every year I go there, she will without fail comment on my looks, especially weight ( I am very insecure about my weight and I always feel like I look like a monster, it is my biggest insecurity). Unfortunately, I have developed hypothyroidism and I have gained all the weight I had lost in 2020. I don't want to imagine what tf she is going to say, she'll tear me to pieces! I am also worried that she will bring up the prospect of my marriage this year. I just need an excuse to get out of there just this year. My parents are absolutely okay with me missing this annual event as long as it is for academic purposes. I have done this before (2020, 21 and 22). But now that I have graduated, I have no reason to do so, my cuet exam will be over as well in July and it's hard to get an internship. PLEASE HELP ME OUT WITH AN EXCUSE!"

I am trying to learn if there are good ways to understand or remember the effects of the HIDE and GROUP features on things like copy and pasting. Also filters too. Whether things will get copy and pasted over and whatnot.

I had an intern moment years ago when I pasted over a hidden row and the data became misaligned. It was a day that will change me forever. In the years since I have never used the HIDE feature but always opted for GROUP so that there is a visual cue and I will remember to UNGROUP, and always reset, re-filter whenever there is a change on the headers of my spreadsheet. Coupled with a lot of redundant sorting.

However I feel I should own up to my fears and actually learn the differences and effects rather than just playing it safe but blind."

I'd like to develop my excel skills over the summer so I can impress my internship employer, and just to have general knowledge

Anyway, I was thinking about going with whatever I find on Udemy, but to be honest, I'm not a complete beginner in Excel and I'd rather not go over the very beginning and waste time. In other words, ""Excel for Engineering"" would probably work best.

It doesn't have to be a free course; if it's good enough, I don't mind paying something like 15$.

What course worked for you best? What do you recommend? Thanks!"

**Letters of Recommendation**

Didn't read any of my letters of recommendation so I'm just guessing but:

HL Chem Teacher - 6-7/10 He liked me and for some reason thought I was a really hard worker (he sat me down after class once and told me to stop working so hard). Although in the second year I started trolling in his class by cracking jokes all the time soooooo.

TOK and EE teacher - 10/10 loved me and I loved her. She told me that I was a genius that comes across once every century and that I'm going to go on to achieve amazing things in life (I have no idea how I gaslit her into thinking that)

**Interviews**

Stanford - Dude was pretty cool, we talked about life and why I wanted to go to Stanford. We had a pretty great convo about Philosophy and our favourite philosophers as well. Also treated me to a mocha so I rate him. Interview lasted abt 1 and a half hours 7/10

Penn - The most curt person I've met in my life. I feel like every single time I spoke he was just trying to cut me off so the interview could end quicker. I guess bro was just busy 3/10

Rice - Got interviewed by an Alumni, he was pretty chill and we had a nice convo about why I like Rice and why I wanted to go. Interview was abt 1hr long. 6/10

Princeton - Was interviewed by this woman and she was super chill! We talked about what I wanted to do when I grow up, as well as why Princeton specifically and why my major. 6/10

**Essays**

Common app: (9/10)

Talked about my love for Chemistry and how it revolutionised the way I see the world and how this had a profound impact on my other hobbies and interests (cooking, mystery novels, gaming and astrophysics). Spent around 3 months writing this essay and I'm really proud of it. I have no idea how good it actually is though because my parents weren't about to spend 8k on a college counsellor and basically none of my friends applied to the US so I just did the entire thing by myself

Supplemental essays: (3-8/10)

I'm gonna be honest by the time I got to my supplementals I was extremely exhausted by the whole application process while having to juggle my responsibilities in national service so many of my supplementals were extremely rushed. I'd say the ones that I really liked were about an 8 whereas the ones where the prompts were extremely generic ranged from a 3 to a 6. Yikes.

12ymykm,3,2023-04-25,I got fired from my second MSW internship and I’m so disheartened,RedEagle7280,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/12ymykm/i_got_fired_from_my_second_msw_internship_and_im/,"I’m (M22) at a pretty prestigious grad school MSW program, and that includes a field internship for two semesters. I’m embarrassed to admit that I failed the first semester internship due to not being able to find much to do social work wise there. 

I was moved to a residential facility for troubled and crime-involved teenage boys and girls. I started shadowing and giving group therapy to the teens, and I honestly grew to really enjoy it. I really wanted to make a difference on those kids, and I made that clear to them in our therapy sessions. I also built up a banter with a decent amount of the kids, which definitely helped. The girls had crushes on me according to my coworkers, and I made sure I remained nice and established my boundaries. 

However, this is completely on me, but I ended up having 5-6 absences total. One from an intensive weekend course, two because I was sick, and the others for mental health reasons (was recovering from being sexually harassed and even touched at the school gym). I communicated all this with my field instructor, but I admit I could’ve gone about it in a more timely and responsible manner. And there were paperwork issues with HR and enrollment verification, though a good amount of this was out of my control, as I’d document it on my phone and show it to my field instructor when that was the case. However, I definitely did procrastinate at times. 

Yesterday, I was called into my field instructor’s office, and she terminated me in the most sympathetic way possible. She told me it was due to what I had just written above, and that apparently I had a habit of grabbing my nipples and scratching my g*nitals in group, which made the teens uncomfortable due to sexual trauma. I was absolutely shocked by this, as I really didn’t remember doing something like that. However, she told me there were more than one reports of it from staff. 

On top of that, she cited an incident from the previous week where I lost my temper a little too much with boys that were harassing me and calling me homophobic slurs. She even proceeded to state that that exact morning, there had been an incident with another kid. I vehemently denied that, as the truth was he had been asking random questions, including “Are you feeling sexy, Mr. OP?” I didn’t respond and he was taken out by the big boss in the room. And I told my field instructor all of that. Still, I never meant to trigger anyone’s sexual traumaI felt horrible, and started to panic as the situation kept hitting me. I tearfully told my boss I didn’t want to be viewed as a predator and that it was never my intention, and she assured me that wasn’t the case and that she’d tell the rest of the staff I was fired due to absences. 

I can take responsibility for the absences and procrastination issues, as that’s clearly on me. I won’t take responsibility for those boys lying though. My friends and dad have told me that I need to keep my head up and learn from this. I know I need to be doing that, but it’s so much easier said than done. I went into this program wanting to make a difference on these kids, and I had told them that in group therapy. I told them I wanted to teach them things they could carry with them after they leave the program and continue to grow up. I went into social work in the first place because I wanted to save people. And triggering someone’s sexual trauma? That’s not fucking helping people. Hell, these kids have proven they’re capable of lying. For all I know, they could make more false accusations about me, some that could be even worse. 

My field advisor said he doesn’t know what’s gonna happen, and said he’s going to vouch for me and tell the deans my good qualities. He also said it might be worth considering changing to community practice in social work. Still, he assured me he’d do his best to help me. I still feel like a fucking failure though, and God, I just hope things really will get better."
12yn9xr,4,2023-04-25,Looking for advice/ranting from a young professional,gmt71223,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/12yn9xr/looking_for_adviceranting_from_a_young/,"This is very long, I’m looking for serious advice and I apologize for how long it’ll take to get through!

Basically, I started a new job a couple months ago after my significant other passed away and I had been on bereavement leave. My old job was not something I wanted to do long term and I went into a completely different industry. I adore my new boss and we are at a pretty small company with only two offices. The office I work in is the bigger of the two and is run by the owner of the company, the other office is run by his son.

In my interviews, I had exclusively discussed with my boss and the company owner that one of my primary responsibilities in my position would be running the company’s social media to help them grow and keep up with modern times. The owner is about 80, and I am one of maybe 2 or 3 people below the age of 30 at my company. I’ve only been here a few months, but within a week of starting I could feel and tell something was up with the other office. 

In my office, everyone was nice and welcoming. I made some plans for social media posts to do what I interviewed for. Right away the other office location was not warm and welcoming. My boss quickly received an email with snarky comments about my social media ideas from the owner’s son. As my boss and I are the only ones in our department, marketing, social media, and communications are completely our responsibility, and no one else’s responsibilities at the company have any crossover with ours. My experience in social media runs very deep as I have worked for a prestigious media company and done multiple internships revolving around that, and have run my own personal successful pages. I am also very young and the only person from our company to have truly grown up with social media and have been using it since I was 11. Someone from the other office began to post on the social media accounts without our permission and overlapping with our scheduled posts. We thought we could solve this by making a simple google form where people could openly submit ideas for posts, but instead received more snarky emails and push back. The owner is your typical old man who is too old to be in the workforce. I haven’t had to interact with him too much besides him making degrading comments towards me (asking my boss if I’ve messed up yet, telling me not to get too excited about doing things right) and accusing me of deleting his files (he deleted his own files). I enjoy the work itself a lot more than my old job, so that doesn’t affect me negatively. Flash forward a few weeks, I’ve continued to notice small aggressions and rudeness from the other office. They never respond to a single email, then get mad when they’re not included. They complain about things, then contradict themselves and critique their own solutions to their own complaints. They are the rudest people I have ever met in my entire professional career. They are not welcoming, kind, or supportive. They don’t care about growth or change. I’ve heard they’re that way because of some drama that happened before I was even born. As a young professional who is also actively grieving, it is extremely difficult for me to fathom the thought of putting up with people who truly have no idea how good they have it. They know nothing about me, who I am, what I’ve been through, etc. and every last one of them has been extremely rude to not only me, but others in my office. And no one does anything about it. The worst of them all is the owner’s son. He kisses his dad’s ass then does not hesitate to be rude and cruel with everyone else. I have no doubts he would be terminated at literally any other company. He actively prevents my boss and I from doing our jobs by never communicating with us or doing anything we ask, then complains that we aren’t doing our jobs. It’s an endless whirlwind of shit and his dad never says anything to him about his behavior. He is constantly saying rude things to me and my boss (feels very misogynistic), making rude remarks, and just being a dick because he can. We don’t have leadership, we have bosses. I’m not sure what to do because my boss that I love so much is thinking of going to a new role, and I’ve only been at this company for two months. The crappy thing is, I like what I am doing at work so much more than my old job and don’t think I’m qualified to move to a similar position yet. If the owner of our company decided to stop working, the son would take over, so realistically I won’t be here for super long. I don’t want to be too job hoppy or overreact, but I’m nervous about how much growth I will be able to do given that our leadership is only men ages 55+ who have no desire for change and actively prevent growth from happening due to their own fears and issues. It’s extremely irritating and I think I will need to push through this until I can go to a younger, more progressive company.

 I’m scared of exploding on them and quitting on the spot since my grief has had that effect on me, and after dating the most positive, kind, gentle, and lovely man in the world who lost his life, it disgusts me that people who are so rude and terrible get to run around and use their precious time on this planet treating other people so poorly. Its not fair. I know I can’t let my personal life affect my professional life, but my significant other passing has changed my general life perspectives. He is such an amazing and kind person and I am now surrounded by assholes. 

What should I do? How do I navigate this situation? If anyone has or knows of marketing/communications jobs, I am willing to look into new opportunities."

12yokka,3,2023-04-25,What topics should I refresh for an interview at IMC for a Quantitative Researcher Internship position? Math or competitive programming?,Caleel-69,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/12yokka/what_topics_should_i_refresh_for_an_interview_at/,"Hi everyone!

I passed the CV screening for the position of ""Quantitative Researcher Internship"" ad IMC and I have the OA within 7 days. What kind of questions should I expect? They sent me an HackerRank link so I thought that they might be classical competitive programming questions on algorithms and data structures. However, looking online, I found some users reporting that they have been asked basically only math-related questions.

I have no problem with either of them, I would just like to know what to refresh in these few days to increase my chances to rock the OA"

I’m a recent college graduate and I have a full time remote internship this summer. Here’s the thing, I’m basically the type of person who gets depressed easily if I stay in my room all day. I get that I’ll have to be in my room for at least some of the work I have to do, meetings etc, but I’d like to find somewhere that I can go to work on my tasks as well. They’re giving me a laptop so I can basically go anywhere as long as I’m connected. I’d say I would go in the living room but my roommate has a full time remote job as well and uses the living room as an office basically 24/7, and takes zoom meetings in there etc. Any suggestions for places I can go to work, or how do you all manage working remotely? It’s more of an issue because I don’t live alone, but I do live in a big city with lots of cafes/libraries etc so I’m wondering if that’s a bad idea."

12yq9ts,2,2023-04-25,CS Prefrosh Questions,Turbulent_Entrance54,Harvard,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/12yq9ts/cs_prefrosh_questions/,"Hi! I know this is extremely early, but I was just at Visitas checking out stuff this weekend and had some questions that I didn’t get to ask/just thought about. 

1. If I have some experience with CS (think AP CSA, AP CSP, CodeForces, some USACO), should I skip CS 50 and take CS61 in the fall (or a different CS course, any recommendations?) 

2. This is probably thinking too far ahead, but should I take CS 124 (DS&A) in my first-year spring? I don’t know how many first years take CS124 b/c I know the class is very challenging so idk if 61 would even prepare me for 124. My logic was that I should take 124 early for internships and research and whatnot, but idk if taking it first year spring will be the best idea, but I’m not sure, what do y’all think? 

That’s all I have for now :) thanks!"
12yqbuc,4,2023-04-25,Just found out I can’t take the classes I want to due to “credit limits” putting me in a situation where I will be taking 1 class for a semester to graduate a semester behind my plan :),hotpants22,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/12yqbuc/just_found_out_i_cant_take_the_classes_i_want_to/,"I really love college it’s such a fun time schools are so proactive about letting you know ahead of time if there’s issues with your schedule so you don’t find out 3 months before it’s an issue. They’re so helpful with the cheery advisors who are willing to help you along when you ask them a silly little question that determines your future. I just love that I took a core required course for computer engineering that is only a prerequisite for nano technology level courses! The other two in that rank of courses? Oh don’t worry they’re just the prerequisites for about 7 other courses you’ll need to take as electives! But shhhh you planned your schedule 2 years in advance right??? Of course you know that!!! Oh but that’s alright the courses that you do actually have the requisite precursors for are being taught by the best of the best! One even has a 2.5 on rate your professor! Aren’t you excited? 

Fucking Christ I hate it here I want out of this shit ass institution let me just go play with fucking robots already. I know some of this could have been avoided by not taking 2 internships but fuck me if my advisor would’ve let me know to take a damn elective while I’m on co-op like I asked if I should’ve so I can GRADUATE ALONG THE LINES OF THE PLAN WE MADE TOGETHER. But nooooo I was assured it all worked out. Fuck credit limits. Fuck me. Fuck engineering. Fuck advisors. Fuck."

12yqn53,1,2023-04-25,Feeling scared to talk in internship and now regretting it,Heyguysloveyou,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/12yqn53/feeling_scared_to_talk_in_internship_and_now/,"So I am currently doing my first internship with 21 in a electronic store in germany. I said that I mostly know stuff about computers, headphones, gaming and consols. I am not like a pro and know it all but I am confident enough that I can give somewhat decent advice on what parts to get depending on your needs.

So anyways, today a old gentleman with his wife came into the store and asked me for a gaming PC thats under 1000 bugs. We only have finished PC's, but we also work with a company that buys the parts you want online and builds them together, so I told him that it would be the smartest to just do that. Sadly I was cut off by another worker who promptly started talking to them.

He asked them what kinds of games they wanted to play and he said ""Flight simulator, agriculture simulator, that kind of stuff, but under 1000 please.""

I thought immediately that shouldnt be a problem, just get like a 1060 or 70 with a ryzen 2600x or something and the rest shouldnt be a problem.

You know what they said? ""Well the LEAST we can do is 1600 bugs, I would recommend a 3060ish for best results"" no I am serious, they said that. I didnt say anything because I thought that they are the actual workers there who are payed to give people advice and sell stuff so they must know what they are doing and I didnt want to ""well actually-"" someone like that as an intern.

But now I really regret it, because in hindsight.. what the fuck? The guy wants to play some simulation games in his late 50s/early 60s, not play the newest COD on ULTRA with 240s FPS. I could build you a computer like that for less than half of 1600, hell probably 1000 less.

But I am scared of looking like an idiot when I speak up. Because again, I am not that great with computers and stuff either, I want to learn more but right now I just know a little more than the average person.. I think, apperantly not when these people are ""professionals""

I dont really know what to do :("
12yqwvy,1,2023-04-25,UC Davis or Cal Poly SLO,Goddessjolyn,UCDavis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/12yqwvy/uc_davis_or_cal_poly_slo/,"Im a senior right now and im deciding between UC Davis and SLO. I’m also considering community college but it’s nothing to do with the financial part, it’s more to do with I’d be more comfortable doing a CC. The biggest factors I’m considering are the chances I’d have at finding a job after college. I want to be something combining business and math (operations research, financial, wtv). If you guys have any input regarding this please tell me because I want to make a decision before may first.

Other factors:
Will need loans for cal poly, not UC Davis
UC Davis 3.5 hrs from home, Cal Poly 2.5 hrs
Live in a Latino community
Don’t have a car
Im ok living in communities where there’s not much to do 
Want to do lots of internships
Need a job right after college (I need to support my mom, she’s a single mother)"
12yrci6,60,2023-04-25,Which SWE internship offer to accept?,UndeadTitan3,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/12yrci6/which_swe_internship_offer_to_accept/,"I was wondering which software engineering internship would be better for me in the long term. I want the internship to give me experience and set me up for better offers in the future. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both?

Option 1) Charles Schwab
9 week program at HQ
Advisor Service Technology team - seems like it is more team oriented where we work on projects together and give presentations 

Option 2) National Instruments
12 week program at HQ
DevOps team - working with cloud, individual project working directly under a mentor"
12yrsid,1,2023-04-25,Microsoft Cloud Solutions Architect vs On-Campus Computer Research Facilities IT Job,ScrambledEgg7,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/12yrsid/microsoft_cloud_solutions_architect_vs_oncampus/,"Like many of you, I've applied to an endless amount of internships (115+ as of right now). Mostly Software Engineering Internship roles, but also some Cybersecurity, Data Science, etc. Last summer, I worked remotely as a Cloud Solutions Architect Intern on the Security team for Microsoft. I got a return offer for this summer in person in Texas. The role is essentially teaching Microsoft clients how to implement (security) software/ solutions in their own institutions. It was a great opportunity, but it is not what I want to do. 

I interviewed for a position in the Computing Research Facilities team in the Computer Science Department at my school, a pretty prestigious university (an ivy). It is essentially a glorified IT job, along with working with Linux and Windows servers and supporting the researchers. It would also allow me to stay in my city and try to do some networking here for future full-time jobs. 

I'm really torn. I'm not in love with either job, but I don't want to go to Texas. But of course, it's Microsoft. Maybe it would set me up for a best worst case scenario? However, both aren't ideal. Please, any input is appreciated!"
12ys3qr,167,2023-04-25,I did it everyone ;-;,SnooOwls6169,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/12ys3qr/i_did_it_everyone/,"Hi my name’s Harry, I am an engineering student who got a placement (12 month co-op) after so much time, effort tears, stress and anxiety and I just wanted to share my experience. 

I’m an international student and I found it really hard to make friends in my course mostly because I felt extremely intimidated by the students in my degree. Everyone seemed extremely intelligent and I felt inferior all the time. As you probably would’ve known/experienced, the engineering journey is extremely difficult when you don’t have any friends. You can’t ask help from anyone and even the professor might not give you the help you really need. It was really difficult sad but I never gave up. I pushed myself to my absolute limit and beyond and here I am. 

I really wanted this co-op because I wanted to gain experience asap. I know competition gets really hard and having no internships when you graduate might be challenging for you to land a job, especially as an international student so I really wanted this. But oh boy was it filled with disappointment. The awkward video interviews where you had to film yourself to sometimes having awkward pauses in a interview, I’m cringed so hard so many times it hurts me physically. I just wanted to share my worst experience in my interview process on December. I was invited for an in person interview and I had to book a cab and travel to this city. I did not have any formal clothing or proper attire for an interview so I spent around $300 to get the stuff needed. The day of the interview arrived. I woke up at 5:00 am and just sat on my bed telling myself “Harry, you’re smart you can do this! It’s just an interview up can do this.” I changed my clothes by 6:00 for a the interview at 10:00 and travel only taking 30 minutes. I was thinking and thinking I felt my heart on my throat. I struggled so much. At around 8:00 I looked at myself in the mirror and said “Harry you can do this. You need this!” Immediately I get a sense of shame and disgust with myself. I started looking at how disgusting I was and how bad the outfit was and I just said “You can’t” 
The following days were some of the most horrible days of my life. Not because I didn’t attend the interview, because I was a coward and I just didn’t use the opportunity that I was given. Looking back at that month right now, I pity myself but I am extremely grateful that I got an offer. To anyone of you reading this, if you’re struggling in any way, I’m sure you can do this!

I asked if I can have some more detailed feedback, and the hr got back to me telling me that the interviewing team liked some stuff but felt I had some areas in my knowledge of the language in which I was lacking. She said that is what she got from the hiring team that conducted the interview ( it was technical interview), and that if I wanted more details I can let her know and she will check back with them. 
My question is is it okay to ask her for more info? Or is that considered too pushy? Or will not asking for further information seem like I am not really interested in their feedback?"

Sci degree",csavrnoch86,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/12yufwl/mid_30s_old_guy_almost_finished_with_my_comp_sci/,"As the title says, I'm about 90% done with my BA in Computer Science and I'm really worried about my future in this industry. 

A little background, I went to culinary school and spent a large swatch of my early 20s to my 30s dying in a kitchen. I met my wife who at the time wasn't my wife and she said I should go back to school to learn something new and make my life a little better. I started out trying Electrical Engineering only to find out that I couldn't pass Calculus 2 if my life depended on it. I switched over to computer science and while I have a basic understanding and by basic I mean basic of what I need to do. I find myself struggling to do simple tasks. I get the feeling that most of my teachers expect me to have learned coding during high school but I went to high school in the early 2000's and as far as I'm aware those types of classes weren't offered. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the here and now, the closer I get to finishing school the more worried I get about any job prospects. I work full time for John Deere which leaves me very little time for internships. Every time I sit down to attempt to learn any form of coding I find myself bored out of my mind. I know that if I could get a job doing any form of programming I would be able to pick it up 10000 times better than listening to some teacher drone on about so and so. Really what I'm looking for here is either someone to tell me that it's ok to be close to middle age trying to break into what I feel is a very young persons industry. Or for someone to guide me to a tech job that doesn't necessarily fall into the coding side of things. Really any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for listening to my TED Talk, and I apologize I know from reading this sub-reddit that this sort of question gets answered in one form or another.

I hope you're all doing well. I'm writing this post to express my interest in finding a hands-on Python internship. I'm eager to learn new things and gain valuable experience in the field.

A little bit about myself - I'm a passionate programmer with a solid foundation in Python. I have completed several online courses. However, I believe that hands-on experience is crucial to truly understanding the language and becoming a skilled developer.

I'm also interested in working remotely, which would allow me to be flexible with my schedule and location. I understand that remote work requires excellent communication skills and self-discipline, and I'm ready to tackle these challenges.

If you're looking for an intern to work on a Python project, or you know someone who is, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm open to discussing any opportunities, and I'm excited to learn and contribute to a team.

Thank you for taking the time to read this post. I look forward to hearing from you soon."

I got accepted to UCF (#137), which has partnered internship programs and is situated in Orlando (tech hub), meaning I can get part-time internships during the Fall and Spring too. 

I also got accepted to UF, which is considered more prestigious (#28), but has no internship opportunities during the Fall and Spring due to its location (Gainesville), meaning I’ll only get an internship (hopefully) in the Summer. It’ll also take a semester longer to get my BS in Computer Engineering there. However, its career placement services are considered one of the best in the country, with good career fairs too. 

I also intend to pursue an accelerated BS/MS program at one of these schools to get a Master’s quicker since my scholarship covers most of it. I also think I have a good chance to get accepted due to my GPA (3.96).

All things considered, which school should I go to if I want to get the highest-paying hardware engineer job after graduation?"

I’ve been with my current company (first job out of college) for just over 6 years, I’ve climbed the ranks from dev to team lead to now manager. In the past, I thought I wanted to stay here for my whole career but lately I’ve been feeling in a rut or unfulfilled?

We work in low code applications for solving customer business processes, which has been cool. I think the switch to management has lead to this unfulfilled feeling. The politics and hands-off nature really makes me feel like I’m just there to track budgets and time entries of my team. 

Lately I’ve been thinking about wanting to get back into full stack development. I still code fairly regularly in C# for integrations into various ERPs and Javascript for front end form changes and other data manipulations but nothing using more modern tools like React, Node or AWS.

I know I’ve kind of shot myself in the foot probably by staying here so long but I’m motivated to skill up in MERN or MEAN stack apps through some Udemy courses (I found a recommendation of courses on here or another sub that I can’t find anymore) and I want to work on personal projects outside of work. 

My questions is have I screwed myself over by not keeping up my coding abilities? Is the ability “re-pivot” back into full stack even possible given the rough job climate? I anticipate this is about a year or so effort at least but I feel a spark I haven’t felt since undergrad. 

Thanks for any insight, really I don’t have any mentors or colleagues to talk about this stuff because I’ve only ever worked at this company (I’ve had internships but I’m not even sure the people I worked with still work there).

Thanks again!"

I just got an offer for an unpaid internship at a data science role (hybrid, travel expenses covered, flexible working hours) for a small startup company and I am a bit conflicted on what I should do. The current agreed working hours is that I work part time then work full time hours at September for 2 months for university credits. My idea was that I should accept the internship then when I find a proper paid internship, I cancel the unpaid internship to work for the paid internship. It has been really hard to even get a reply from my applications as I never had any prior working experience before other than extracuricullars and projects so I was thinking that any experience is better than no experience. So atleast I would have something to put down as work experience in my resume then leverage that experience to get a proper paid internship.

What do you guys think is the best course of action I should do?"

I'm planning to stay local and attend De Anza in my first year to take care of my family and also to save some money. It would be very preferable only to do 1 year and transfer in my 2nd year, but that doesn't have to be the case. Can anyone give me advice, tips, or personal experience on transferring to L&S CS or EECS from CC? (If you could send me your stats, that would be awesome!)  


I've taken math-orientated dual enrollment classes during high school, so I think it will help? They're UC and CSU transferable. I'm also unfamiliar with how transferring after 1 year works, but I am aware that it's incredibly difficult and I would assume it would be worse as someone who wants to transfer into a competitive major like CS or EECS.   


Questions I have if anyone can answer:  
\- How can I get internships as someone attending CC?   
\- What GPA range should I have?  
\- What extracurriculars should I do? (specifically, I know they should be math orientated)

I am a senior in high school, choosing between two schools. One is Georgia Tech, where I would major in CS. The other is Barnard College, where I would be a Bridgewater Scholar, probably joint majoring in CS and econ.

&#x200B;

The bridgewater scholars program is in collaboration with Bridgewater Associates (the hedge fund). I would have guaranteed research funding of 6k over the summer (and housing), as well as guaranteed research internship funding for another summer of the same amount. For the internship, I would also get guaranteed first round of interviews for a Bridgewater summer internship. **I am not guaranteed the internship at Bridgewater, just the first round of interview. However, if I get an internship anywhere else (at Goldman for example) I get paid for housing (but not the 6k stipend).** If I get an unpaid internship, I get housing funding as well as the stipend. During the year, I get group mentorship and contacts as well as an all-expenses paid trip to Bridgewater HQ to meet current employees. Barnard College is located in NYC, and is an all woman's college, and under Columbia University (meaning I get to take classes at columbia, get access to their resources etc)

&#x200B;

Georgia Tech is significantly cheaper (around 80k) and I would have to take around 45k in loans if I went to barnard. I like barnard marginally more, but would probably be happy at GT. I also am more interested in finance (think IB or AM) than CS, but from what I understand moving from finance to CS seems harder than the opposite.

Any advice appreciated! Thanks!"

How I got interested in video game development was I made a couple of apps, then started getting ideas for games, so I’ve been learning Unity for a little bit. I have a couple of questions. 

1) I assume AI gameplay engineer is not a job I will get straight out of college, so what should be my path forward? I’m thinking of first getting a job in AI, such as machine learning engineer, then developing games on the side to increase my portfolio. Is this how most would get in the position or should I try to get a game dev job first &amp; keep up with AI to make sure I don’t lose the skills?

2) I’m currently completing a penetration testing internship (found out I have no interest in doing cybersecurity after starting the internship). Will this benefit my applications for my next internship, whether that be AI or game dev, in any way?

3) most job listings I look at for gameplay engineer require c++ knowledge, which I know a little of but I don’t know enough. Am I hindering myself by learning unity, which uses C sharp, rather than unreal, which uses c++? I don’t have time to learn the data structures and algorithms of both languages in time for my next internship, so where should I be focusing my time?"

12z23os,2,2023-04-25,Internship Coding Sample Advice,thefilliesarecoming,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12z23os/internship_coding_sample_advice/,"I need some help here, as I've never applied for a CS position before.


I'm currently pursuing a second bachelor's degree as part of a career change to CS. I've done some basic programming in C++/R helping out in labs during my first bachelor's degree almost a decade ago, and I've recently done some work in Python as part of a job (which I was recently laid off from). Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the repo's that contained my previous work.


I've recently been applying for summer internships (for current undergraduate CS students), and a research lab emailed me back with the prompt below:


""To further evaluate your application, please send us coding samples written by you demonstrating good software engineering principles in the programming languages specified in your resume (e.g., C++, R, and/or Python are particularly relevant).""


The email goes on to talk about needing 1 sample for each language. I'm a bit at a loss as to what to do here. Since I can't access my previous work, is it fine to just code up new stuff? There's not really a prompt, so can I submit anything? Would they accept something simple to demonstrate that I know the languages? Am I boned since I don't have a ready portfolio of projects? The deadline is this Friday, so am I extra boned?


I'm a complete novice, so any advice would be appreciated here. Thanks in advance!"

I started a new job in Germany beginning of this month and it went great in the beginning. The commute is the biggest problem because is 2,5 hours long total. 

As a result, I have been very stressed. I've already gone to work on 2 hours of sleep multiple times and it hasn't even been a month yet. 
Right now, it's 3:30 am and I can't sleep. I went to bed at 10.

I am a self taugh dev and this is literally one of the most important steps of my career. I don't want to fuck it up, and that adds to the pressure. I want to stay at least 6 months so it looks partially good on my resume. 

I have never been so stressed in my life, and I can already feel it negatively impacting me physically as well.

I asked for work from home, and they said that they'll think about it. Then I asked again because of a train strike, and it was granted to me. The next day, i couldn't sleep again so I told the boss I'll work from home because of it and he said ""alright but don't make a habit out of it"". That's brough my hopes down significantly. 

I have bought melatonin spray but it doesn't always work. I would really like to avoid taking hard sleep meds. 

I have 3 months of experience in an internship, and I've been at my current job for almost a month now, call it 2, May is around the corner. 

What would you do in my position? Is it too early to start looking for something else fully remote? What if they ask me why i left so early? Do i push more for work from home?

I literally have to wake up in 3 hours if I want to be there on time. What the fuck do I do =/

Thank you"

Hey! I'm planning to stay local and attend De Anza in my first year to take care of my family and also to save some money. It would be very preferable only to do 1 year and transfer in my 2nd year, but that doesn't have to be the case. Can anyone give me advice, tips, or personal experience on transferring to L&S CS or EECS from CC? (If you could send me your stats, that would be awesome!)

I've taken math-orientated dual enrollment classes during high school, so I think it will help? They're UC and CSU transferable. I'm also unfamiliar with how transferring after 1 year works, but I am aware that it's incredibly difficult and I would assume it would be worse as someone who wants to transfer into a competitive major like CS or EECS.

Questions I have if anyone can answer:  
\- How can I get internships as someone attending CC?  
\- What GPA range should I have?  
\- What extracurriculars should I do? (specifically, I know they should be math orientated)

Thank you!"

However, they both have their pros and cons and I’m just stuck between these two schools. Here are my pros and cons please help!!

Pros for UCI:
- Closer to home!
- Better housing and meal plan (important)
- It is a UC (people say it’s prestigious??)
- Better financial aid package (I can cover my tuition and fees + afford to get a double and highest meal plan so yay)
- Way more diversity than Cal Poly😭
- beautiful campus 
- can’t think of more pros but im overall just worried about the education here vs cal polys 

Cons for UCI:
- I’m undeclared so I’m worried I won’t be able to transfer to Computer Engineering 
- I’ve heard it’s a commuter school so I’m worried about social life
- I’ve heard profs aren’t that great and mostly focus on their research than teaching (???)
- competitive for internships, etc (worried I won’t get a job)
- grad school focused?? ( I just want to work I think)
- cal poly graduates get paid more than uci graduates?


Pros for Cal Poly SLO:
- college town!!! sooo beautiful 
- motto of learn by doing! ( which I’ve heard prepares you for working meanwhile the UC’s prepare for grad school)
- smaller classrooms so 1 on 1 time with teachers and TAs
- easier to get internships and jobs! ( I’ve heard that by the 2nd year everyone starts to apply to internships so yayy)
- got accepted for Computer Engineering!!! ( and I get a free laptop:) )
-90% have a job after graduating!! And allegedly get paid more than uci graduates 

Cons for Cal Poly SLO:
- very little diversity (scary😭)
- cramped dorms and the food isn’t that good so yikes ( allegedly)
- far from home (4 hour drive)
- financial aid package is not good (i would have to l dorm with 3 people and get the 2nd meal plan)
- overall very worried about money if i go here

12z5jw0,11,2023-04-25,I have been avoiding people until I lost a job because of it.,lilzdiaries,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/12z5jw0/i_have_been_avoiding_people_until_i_lost_a_job/,"Like many of you, growing up, I have always been a bad communicator. When I was a child, I used to be really outgoing and randomly talk to people, until middle school. During middle school, everytime I talked in class, there were these guys in the back of the class who would giggle, or make fun of what I had to say. The first time I fellt confused, the second time I felt embarrased, the third time I felt like drowning. And, Instead of ignoring it, I decided to just stop talking in class all together.

When talking with my classmates in 9th grade, i used to be really outgoing and try to make conversation with people, then after overhearing the people I talked with mentioning how weird I seemed. My eyes flooded with tears and I went to hide in the bathroom stall doors to cry. Everytime I tried to make friends with someone after that, I was met with disgust. Instead of focusing on how to improve, I avoided it and decided to give up on talking to new people.

I graduated highschool with great grades. And now I’m at a University. I continued this habit in school and in the workplace. At school, it wasn’t a big deal as I just had to study on my own. However, in my workplace, it was valuable to be outgoing. I always felt like I didn’t belong, and I was terrified of saying something wrong. So my fault, I decided not to speak unless I had to. 

I recently completed an internship and they mentioned I will not be getting a return offer because I was too shy.

It’s my fault. I kept avoiding social interactions because I was afraid of the embarrassment I felt from the bad experience I had in the past.

If you’re in school still, it’s not too late to make an effort to communicate with others. And from now on, I will make it my goal to always make a step on improving my social skills. There will be many embarrassments and failures along the way. But that’snwhat makes it a skill. Because we have to learn.

Let’s not avoid the things that embarrass us, and instead figure out ways to do it so it doesn’t embarrass us anymore using the past embarrassments we had!

P.S. Also, if anyone has tips on improving your social skills, please drop it! I would appreciate it so much!"

Most other people were building really cool applications while integrating stuff like ChatGPT and I felt a bit behind. I personally feel like I'm pretty competent at DSA, but besides learning theory, 90% of my CS education has been just ""here is a problem, fill it out, run the tester, if it works you get full credit."" I'm a junior now in college and I'm not sure how to go about learning how people create things from scratch, as even though I've had 2 internships, it was working with an existing codebase, and was kinda like my cs education where I was given a problem and I was just told to solve it. I've tried doing a few projects solo in the past but most of it was just following some tutorial on youtube. At the end of that, none of the code was really ""mine,"" and it led me to be unsure of whether I should be understanding fully what this tutorial was doing because I had no idea what was going on besides a high level idea of what sections of code were doing.

I'm sure people will say its fine and to not compare to others, but I genuinely want to be at a skill level where I can go to a hackathon and churn out a semi functional project with a few friends, but I'm not sure how to get to that level. Does anyone have any advice?"
12z76nb,1,2023-04-26,MD or PhD: Genuinely No Clue Anymore,Electrical_Line_4454,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/12z76nb/md_or_phd_genuinely_no_clue_anymore/,"Hi. I’m a junior in college in the U.S. and have been wrestling with whether I want to pursue a research (PhD) or practical (MD) career in medicine for the past 4 years. I’m passionate about cancer biology, both in terms of its mechanisms of action and the pharmacological/therapeutic aspect of it. 

Throughout most of my life, I’d been working towards a career as a physician, which has shaped most of my high school and college activities, classes/interests, and (one of) my major (Molecular and Cellular Biology). Though COVID had forced the entirety of my first year in college to be remote and I have yet to be working consistently in a lab on campus, in my sophomore year, I fell in love with the idea of research. My organic chemistry lecture and lab had captivated me and when I took an intermediate cell biology course jointly, I felt that this academic intersection as it pertained to cancer was my “sweet spot”. That summer, I completed a research internship internationally, where I learned most of the basic cell bio lab procedures (rather than do my own mentored research) working with leukemia and breast cancer cells: Cell maintenance, Western Blots, qRNA, tissue fixing and sectioning, etc. Despite genuinely enjoying working towards new solutions and being thrilled at the therapeutic prospects of the to-be-published research the lab was working on, it did feel a little repetitive at times, which I’m in total understanding of (I didn’t expect research to be fast-paced and novel every single minute of every day), but most notably it felt impersonal to me. For all of high school, I volunteered at chemotherapy infusion labs and hospitals numerous times a week, and I felt as if that patient interaction, the intimacy of caring for someone vulnerable and actively trying to make their quality of life better, was missing. 

So I came into junior year having reverted back to my initial med school plan, but my fascination with the cell-level details remained; I genuinely enjoyed attending and studying for my cell biology and biochemistry lectures, so I was convinced that despite how many years of my life I’d have to sacrifice, an MD-PhD was the way to go. This winter break, I traveled internationally to visit my family in my parents’ country and landed myself an unofficial shadowing-internship situation at the hospital of best med school in the country (despite knowing that this wouldn’t “count” back in the States, I still wanted to have the exposure). I requested to work in oncology (pediatrics) due to my cancer biology interests, and shadowed doctors as they made their rounds on patients, administered chemotherapy, discussed cases and treatments in meeting rooms, conducted a stem cell transfusion in a BMT unit, etc but I did not like it at all. As expected, it was emotionally taxing, but most importantly, I did not feel as drawn to this “macro medicine” as much as I was to the “micro medicine” I interacted with in my cell biology class or my summer research, like the targeting of particular tumor receptors with a specific drug, etc. 

Now (the day after my last shadowing day), I have a kind of distaste for practical medicine, but I’m unsure of whether it’s towards oncology only, the way medicine is practiced in this country, or if the emotional weight of pediatric oncology was just a shock to my system. I don’t know if I’ll like medical school or it’s content, because naturally it will expand into this “macro medicine” of symptoms and their physical manifestations and how to deal with the latter, rather than the root biological causes I feel like I love more. But I always come back to how much I enjoy listening and conversing with patients of all walks of life, and how I can’t imagine a profession without that. When I turn the idea in my head, I feel a spiked sense of anxiety whenever I consider leaving the prospect of an MD completely; in a way, it’s all I’ve ever known. I’m not even sure I’d enjoy getting a PhD if I’m not learning and understanding and memorizing, but rather going into the lab for 5 or so years; I’m not confident that I’ll be comfortable with uncertainty or that I’ll enjoy cancer biology/pharmacology if I’m the one searching for the answers rather than being amazed by them in a textbook. 

My total gpa by the end of this first semester is a 3.68, and with my relatively unimpressive research track record due to COVID and late switch (of interest) to research, I don’t see myself as competitive for a PhD, and much less-so for an MD-PhD. For the first time in a very long time, I’m completely and utterly at a loss for what to work towards, what to think about, and how to plan for my post-graduation plans. I’d really appreciate all the wisdom and insight I can get :’). Thank you so much for your time and help, and have a great day/night!!"

I am actually pretty passionate about computer science and enjoy programming, but I also value my hobbies and socializing with family and friends a lot and I must admit that I did half-ass my way through my first two and a half years of my degree, but this last semester, I really focused up and realized how much I actually like coding and computer science.

However, I feel like I am a bit behind on core concepts like data structures, algorithms, discrete structures, and computer architecture, although I feel pretty confident when it comes to coding and problem-solving. Unfortunately, I didn't get an internship this summer, but my backup plan is to take some summer classes, work on side projects, and learn some new technologies.

After reading this sub, I feel like I am totally screwed, and the job market sounds terrifying. I feel under-qualified and underprepared. It seems like if I don't have at least three internships, several complex projects in my portfolio, practice leet code for three hours every day, and have an advanced understanding of every single computer science concept by the end of next year, I won't even have a chance of finding a decent job in computer science.

So, my question is: am I really in that bad of a situation, or am I just stressing over nothing? Any advice or encouragement is appreciated.

Thanks!"

My efc: 15-17k

Intended major: Double major in CS and Math, Similarities: Both are CTCL schools

Wabash COA: 24k(42k total scholarship/ year)

Wabash School 1 Pros: Ranked no 2 in best alumni networking by Princeton Review,Beautiful campus, graduate placement is also good.Ranked 55 by USNWR.

Wabash School 1 Cons: Boys college( it actually doesn't matter that much to me),CS department is quite new, and its been only 4-5 years since it was introduced.

Beloit COA: 23k(45k scholarship/year + 3k loans),

School 2 Pros: I got into STEM Fellows Program(it might be good for me as a STEM student).I also got $5k more from one of the alumni(Alumni Opportunity Awards), it is an one time award :(  , the STEM department is quite good, and I also have the option to do BS in CS. Co-education

School 2 Cons: Since it is one of the oldest campus in the Mid-West, the campus has both old and new buildings.It doesn't feel that beautiful and vibrant to Wabash.Ranked 81 by USNWR

Location differences:Wabash is located at nowhere, 1 hr to Indianapolis and almost 3 hrs to Chicago

Beloit is almost 1 hr to every major cities like Chicago,Madison and Milwaukee.Idk but I  have  heardthe city of Beloit has a bad reputation(please someone clarify it)

Tie-breaking considerations:I am mostly looking for internships for summer, so I highly regard internship placements.I will also likely go to grad school( I want to study AI).

At last ,It also depends on my affordability. Beloit college is looking more in my budget at least for first year, but both of the schools have similar coa tho.I still think I am missing a lot of things here.Please suggest me what should I do.I only have 3 days to make my final decision.If anyone knows and clarifies all these points, you are welcome."

Hello everyone,

I'm a master's student currently pursuing a degree in Management Information Systems. I've been actively applying for summer internships in the field of Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Data Analysis for several months now. However, due to the uncertainty in the job market and being an international student on an F-1 visa, I haven't received any interview calls yet.

I have 2 years of work experience as a .NET developer, but I'm concerned about how difficult it may be to secure a full-time job without prior internship experience directly related to Data Engineering or Business Intelligence. I am proficient in SQL, Python, and have decent knowledge of ADF, DataBricks, and Tableau.

If anyone is aware of any Data Engineering or Business Intelligence internships, (paid or unpaid), I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know.

Thank you in advance!"

I think i will be not doing software development related work in this GET role although I was asked all CSE related questions in the interview and also they were hiring CSE students. 

 During the interview, I was asked about scaling the project, and I followed up by inquiring if the position was related to DevOps. They confirmed it was somewhat aligned with DevOps. But I am not sure because I can not find any post on internet regarding the DevOps in tata motors or students placed from CSE background

do you guys have any idea why they hiring CSE students and what will I do in GET role?

I am currently a grad student and have been actively searching for an internship for quite some time now. After an extensive search, I was finally able to secure an internship position. However, during the application process, I stated that I am available for five months, but the whole process took more than a month. As a result, the internship is now expected to run until the end of September instead of August and I graduate in end of August.

The issue is that I do not have a place to stay for that long,  I must leave my dorm at the end of august and I prefer not to stay that long because without student housing they money they offer is not enough for the city I live. I barely make it until end of the month with my scholarship at the moment. Although I can stay in a hostel for a week, I would really prefer to leave by early September. I did not consider this possibility at the beginning of the negotiations as I was excited, and I am now unsure about what to do.

Should I tell them as soon as possible that I cannot stay until the end of September, or should I wait until I settle into my job to avoid losing it in probation period? I want to at least get their reference so I am bit unsure about everything.

Any advice or suggestions on how to approach this situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance."

I’ve been learning to program with this subs help for about 6 months and have had a blast, but was hoping for some advice. I have been accepted into 2 in person masters programs and I need to decide which one to attend soon…

They are both about the same price and quality, but School A, we will call it, is in a big city with internship opportunities (Nashville). It will take about 3 years because of prerequisites I need and I will have to work close to full time while attending to afford rent and such.  

School B on the other hand will take about 2 years to complete because of accelerated courses and I can live with my parents and spend less time working and more time studying. It is in a much smaller city though and from what I can find online internship/CS jobs in general are pretty sparse. So is this an obvious choice or am I justified in putting so much thought into it?  

On one hand I will be really struggling to balance working and going to school to finish in 3 years at School A. But the upside is internship opportunities and a better connected school right by a major city (Nashville). Or I can have time to focus on studying without work getting in the way too much at School B to finish in 2 years. I can then use that 3rd year searching for jobs anywhere and everywhere I can find them."

All the videos in YouTube, Google searches only ended up wasting my time. Nearly most of them I contacted with wanted me to deposit money in some shady website promising me huge returns.

That happens every time we do group projects together, I would try to suggest an idea and she would just ignore me and keep doing what she was doing before, just to suggest the same idea minutes later. After one time presenting something in front of our class, I tried to tell her that she misunderstood something I was drawing on the blackboard and kept wiping away my drawings and ignoring me, leading to me getting embarrassed in front of the class. After the lesson I tried to confront her on what I was trying to say with my drawing and only then did she realize what I meant but didn't seem apologetic at all. Obviously, as a person with social anxiety, this affected me deeply and I had a whole breakdown that evening. The following weeks kept getting worse with me always on the brim of tears during school and I noticed other things that bothered me about our friendship. Not only would she ignore me when I'm trying to speak with her but she would also expect me to listen to her whenever she wants to say something, which I of course did because that's how I've been taught, but nowadays it's getting really draining. Something else that I noticed is how she is also always trying to lead conversation into her directions, be it with my other friend when she is having troubles or classmates who feel upset about something. This of course makes me reluctant to listen to her and even my teacher ethics teacher said that he hates people like that. Other than that, I always get the feeling like she things I can't do things on my own and always need help for assignments or school work, which of course is only meant nice, but I never asked for help and don't need help. I've told her before that I don't like how she is backseating me and not listening or paying attention when I'm speaking, but it seems like nothing has changed. The problem that I'm encountering now is that she still has been nice to me and helped me get an internship for school, but I just can't keep this friendship stable enough with all my negative emotions and emotional scars that I think it's better to end it before this friendship becomes even more toxic. Of course I would still be open for advice to maybe help my friendship, but for now I want to ask, how do I end this friendship without looking like I was using her or am ungrateful?"

As I progressed through my freshman year, I realized that I don't have a passion for computer science but rather finance - particularly banking (still thinking about which type but leaning towards commercial or IB). However, coming from a state school, IB recruitment is hard (although we do have a decent amount of people breaking into IB - if anyone has any insights on NC State that would be great).

Out of high school, I got into UNC Chapel Hill but chose NC State because of computer science (NCSU's engineering school is very highly ranked and regarded). 

Should I continue with the CS degree? I had a lot of credits coming in from high school and I only have about **8 classes** left in the degree (although they are difficult and time consuming). 

In regards to finance, I am doing very well in my finance classes (financial management, investment portfolio management, etc). My extracurriculars are also finance related - already landed **VP of Finance** role for the biggest business club at NC State, on the financial board for Alpha Kappa Psi, a business fraternity, and am getting ready to apply to a investment management fund organization that manages clients' money (total val approx $100m) next year.

My GPA will definitely be hindered because of CS, but it should always stay above a 3.7. Should I keep going even though I don't want to do software? Will pursuing this degree hinder me from IB roles? I am not interested in quant trading or fintech - just banking.

In terms of internships, I am traveling this whole summer so I didn't bother applying. I am planning to go ham with networking and applying to top companies next year (B of A, Wells, etc).

Any insight on what to do with the CS degree and other advice would be greatly appreciated."

I am currently graduating and finishing my last internship and I received a full time offer from a company as a underwriter. 

However I am actively interviewing at 3 other places in investment management and equity research however the processes are likely to last 2-3 more weeks before I receive an offer, If I do get one.

The thing is I have until next Monday to accept the current offer which would be more prudent as I would have a job. If I don’t, I would pretty much gamble on getting an offer from the places  that I am currently interviewing.

What would you guys do ? I am thinking about accepting the current offer and If I ever get another offer to just cancel the current one although it would be a scummy thing to do (the start date for my current offer is July 24th so they could definitely find someone else)

Edit: im way more interested in working in capital markets also

I appreciate everyone’s inputs !"
12zygm2,1,2023-04-26,Job or Apprenticeship?,MrSpeedCuber101,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12zygm2/job_or_apprenticeship/,"I graduated with my B.S in Computer Engineering in December last year (pray for me) and have been looking for full-time opportunities since. As most of y'all might know, it fucking sucks lol but after months of applying to 100s of jobs I think I might be close to landing a couple of offers.

Just to clarify, I not applied to entry-level software dev roles, for obvious reasons, but also applied to several internships and a couple apprenticeships (imposter syndrome much?). Anyways I am faced with a dilemma and need some outside perspective.

I think I might have an offer from a huge
Indian tech/consulting firm for a 2 yr rotational program (with 8 weeks of paid training) with a salary of 60k in Dallas. On the other hand I have an offer for an App Developer apprenticeship with an even bigger German tech/engineering company with a much lower salary of 40k which is kind of understandable granted it's an apprenticeship. The first job is mostly software engineering related (full stack, cloud, data) and deals with clients while the apprenticeship focuses on the software and hardware for automated driving (C, C++).

I honestly think the latter company would look much better on my resume and is a more ""futureproof"" option but at the end of the day its still not a ""job"" and has significantly lower salary than the consulting firm. What do you guys think would be a better option for someone like me? Any thoughts/advice is welcomed.

For the record, I live in Texas."

* *Such as Fundamentals of Cloud Computing, Fundamentals of Information Technology, Algebra for College Students, Introduction to Operating Systems, Introduction to Programming, Intercultural Communication, Applied Physics with Lab, Composition, ETC.*

&#x200B;

HIGHSCHOOL CURRICULUM **(Important!!!)**

Freshman year and sophomore year of hs were average, I took 1 AP offered (the only one offered). **BUT** I transferred into College for my associates degree in Information Tech for my Junior and Senior in HS. A typical day for me at school: 8 AM - 11 AM = high school (AP classes) and 12 PM - 3 PM = college.

&#x200B;

**Extracurricular's:**

\- **\*SUMMER AFTER JUNIOR YEAR\*** Cancer Research at Northwestern University (partnered with UChicago) - HIGHLY SELECTIVE PROGRAM: I conducted and presented an individual research I did with a mentor (equipped with PhD in the relating field).

\- **\*JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEAR\*** Northwestern University's Medicine Discovery Program - HIGHLY SELECTIVE PROGRAM

\- **\*JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEAR\*** Robotics (I founded a CAD branch, which I am a leader of) -- NOTE: This EC is a College EC, not in relation to HS

\- \***JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEAR\*** Internship (Specific name, which I am not going to mention for safety): I worked to research parts of Chicago that weren't equipped with a desirable healthcare system, voiced the opinions of residents, and created a ""city plan"" to help advocate for change in primarily the South and West sides of Chicago.

\- **SOPHOMORE - SENIOR YEAR\*** Cancer Kids First Volunteer: Led online zoom sessions with other peers to connect with Cancer patients (ages 6-12) and organized events to help cheer children up (Valentines day: basket filled with chocolate and stuffed animals, etc).

\- **FRESHMAN - SOPHOMORE YEAR\*** Math Team: Math competitions across different high schools in Chicago.

\- **\*SOPHOMORE AND PARTIAL JUNIOR YEAR\*** University of Illinois at Chicago Engineering Internship - SELECTIVE PROGRAM, about 20% ""acceptance rate"" (fun note: I was the only representative of my grade level): Worked to support environmental justice and food inequality by volunteering at Stein Learning Gardens at St. Sabina while helping support a community greenspace, while also innovating a robot system to help clean up the university campus.

\- **\*SOPHOMORE YEAR\*** Research Intern at Malcolm X College for applied engineering in medicine: Learned about the different disciplines of medicine (neurology, cardiology, etc) and learned ways to apply the engineering disciplines to the medical field. *Created a paper/presentation to present one way to improve the functionalities of hospitals with the existence of engineering.*

&#x200B;

**Honor's:**

* 40K Scholarship Award to DeVry University **(at 15 years old)**
* 3rd place in city-wide math competition (against all CPS schools)

* UIUC Full scholarship to summer engineering program (covered fees/tuition, dorm, food)

&#x200B;

**RECCOMENDATION LETTERS:**

**English Professor** (who graduated grad school from Northwestern University) = 100/10, I am by far her favorite student out of all college students (pretty evident) and she wrote a rec letter for me for my second EC (Northwestern Medicine Discovery Program) which helped me get in.

**Research Professor** (who I worked directly with in the summer with Cancer Research @ Northwestern) = 10/10, We worked together really well and developed a good student professor bond which helped me a lot with my cancer presentation.

&#x200B;

**ESSAY:**

I would rate my essay a solid 8/10, my essay is (obviously) personal but relates my personal life to my life's passion, which is BME. I think my essay stands out a lot, I just need to come up with great transitional words/phrases which will help tie it together well.

&#x200B;

**Extra info:**

It's important to note that for all my EC's, I paid 0 dollars to attend. I also pay no money to attend the college I go to, right now. I intend to pay little to no money to attend college.

I plan on applying to the following schools:

\- Northwestern University (EARLY DECISION) - Yes, I do know why I want to attend NU.

\- Duke, JHU, or UChicago (ED II)

\- MIT, Columbia, Rice, Case Western, you get the gist!

\- All top 5 ranked colleges in Illinois (UIUC, etc)"

What game engines would you guys recommend in my situation?

In my head, maybe learning c++ with unreal may be more beneficial as c++ knowledge can help in other areas of study/work.

1300zkf,12,2023-04-26,Harvard Vs UNC Full Ride,kvt_17,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1300zkf/harvard_vs_unc_full_ride/,"Hello! I’m posting this a few months after asking a similar question a little while back but with much more information and detail:

As the title suggests, I’m choosing between UNC and Harvard. Here are some of the details and some info before considering:

- Studying Neuroscience and Poly Sci
- End goal is to be a neurosurgeon but to transition into Healthcare policy (working exec roles for the CDC, NIH, etc.)
- Brand name is important to me (somewhat)
- Social Scene has no influence on my decision, although I agree a better “college” experience would be awesome

Asking this purely to find what’s best for my career goals. 

Harvard:
- Very high cost first year (>70k)
- I would only pay 45k of this because my new aid offer would be applied after the first semester
- Goes down to <50k a year afterward (new aid offer)

UNC
- Fully funded (Carolina Innovation Scholarship)
- Convert extra scholarships into school credit for flights for travel, club dues, etc. 
- Lots of classes from High School are carrying over (little more than 1 year worth of credits)
- Funded internship housing and matching and lots of smaller opportunities, honors college and retreats, fellowships to travel, etc. 


I’m concerned because I’m not sure what’s best for my career goals. I know UNC would be fantastic for premed, especially considering it is free, but I’m more worried about placing into those high end med schools and also getting the connections I need for a future in healthcare politics. Any advise would be appreciated!! Thanks!"

1301qxy,1,2023-04-26,Delay Graduation to Fall 2023 because of no experience?,BMTG-R3-19,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1301qxy/delay_graduation_to_fall_2023_because_of_no/,"The tech market is someway disappointing right now, I’ve done well academically and have only been focused on that throughout my 4 years and though only that would get me a job.

Despite the hard work, I’m met with the realization that experience triumphs over that, for the most part.

I don’t want to graduate without anything lined up as it will be extremely hard.


I have a couple of options

1. Delay graduation by 1 semester and keep applying and try to get an internship (I’ve met all my requirements so any classes taken will be additional)

2. Graduate and do a masters and if I get a full-time job, leave school (the master’s program) 


Number 2, although, eventually, I would like a master’s , I wouldn’t want to pursue one just to leave it once I get a full time position.


Feeling stressed about my situation. I feel like I did the right thing, worked hard in school but I’m realizing I did some wrong things such as not getting those experiences.

I’m struggling on how to go about bringing up things to my director at my job. 
In short, I’m miserable. My manager is constantly micromanaging, is barely present, makes us as employees look bad, and is just down right horrible. 


A couple of the things they have done recently that has really set me off include: 

- leaving work for two hours for beauty reasons and leaves us to do their work 

- had me present at a major meeting in front of over 100 people and while I was presenting, stepped in front of me and advanced the PowerPoint even though I was on the correct slides. (They literally stepped in front of me as I was standing at the podium and reached over me..) 

- every time my coworkers and I submit things for their approval such as presentations, emails, etc, they wait until the last minute to respond if they respond at all. If no response is given and something is submitted, they get mad at us. If they do respond, it is last minute and want everything changed or they will delete things. 

- submits group presentation slides to leadership last minute even if they have been finished for days 

- disrupts virtual meetings by speaking loudly or chatting with their SO who also works at the same business. We had to apologize during a meeting because everyone could hear them yelling behind us. Mind you, they were supposed to be attending this meeting as well and showed up in the last 5 minutes. 

- originally told me I could work around my internship schedule but now I must do it outside of my work schedule. Then continued to email me demanding me for all of my meeting invites with my preceptor even though it does not concern them. 

- does not pay attention to any meetings we have 

- does other things during 1:1s such as text people 

- if they decide to edit any work, such as emails or messages, everything will b scrapped except for “hello” and “thank you”.  

- says they want us to be able to “network” but forces us to send meeting invites so they can tag along and be nosy. 

- snoops in other peoples work and try’s to correct them and make them look Bad 

- does not listen to anything anyone has to say. You could tell them one thing and they will ask about the same thing three times the same day and throughout the week. Even if an email is sent. 

I’m sorry this is so long. I’m just stuck on what to do. My internship is the most important part of this company as I’m not sure I’d be able to do it if I wasn’t already an employee. It’s in a different department and with a different team. If I didn’t have to do an internship, I would leave without a doubt. 

I have the option to go to my director, but I’m worried it may make things worse. I don’t want my manager to have a vengeance against me but this is getting emotionally draining."

After joining the company I found out they just went through a layoff of hundreds of workers. Even the current team I’m on has very recently been cut down by a third. Although to me it may not seem like it will happen again, I don’t want to be naive. I don’t see the companies financials getting better any time soon. I interned here last year (before the financial downturn) and liked my time here so I joined full time but now I’m worried. I found out that even some of my 401k and bonus benefits got slashed, which sucks because I wouldn’t of initially accepted the position otherwise! I also just reconnected with my old manager who was amazing and found out they took a voluntary severance package too - so this really freaked me out!

My question is, how worried should I be? Could another layoff happen again? How will I know? Would they lay me off even if I’m in a rotational program?

Thanks in advance!"

I know there is probably so many people who have posted the same thing on here.. however each person has a different story im sure so I’m looking for advice on my particular situation. 

I graduated in 2020 from a program I thought I wanted to do. I have had 2 bad experiences with internships and not sure this is what I want to do anymore. Currently studying to write my licensing exam (which I have been for the last 7 months) I write in two days. Not sure if I’ll pass or not.. but at least if I pass I have a back up plan. 

I never really understood “fake it till you make it” until being in this career honestly. I feel like literally everyone I’ve come in contact with doesn’t know what they are doing. I don’t know what I’m doing. I want to do something I’m good at! Something I enjoy. 

I don’t really have many hobbies besides watching movies, diamond paintings and paint by numbers. 

I don’t just want to go back to a minimum wage job.. but I don’t know what I want to do anyways.

I currently live with my parents in a smaller town, I think they’ll let me stick around a little longer so money isn’t a HUGE issue in regards to having to pay for housing.. however I obviously want to save money for my future.

Anyways.. any advice would be great. Literally ANYTHING lol 

I know I’m young, I know I don’t have to feel rushed to make a decision.. but I can’t just sit at home waiting to figure it out.. what do I do in the mean time?"
1304n1o,1,2023-04-26,Any suggestions on my resume and what are some things I should do to get a job in IT?,ILikeInformationTech,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1304n1o/any_suggestions_on_my_resume_and_what_are_some/," 

I  graduated with a masters degree in Cybersecurity in mid 2020 (the year  of COVID).  Since then I have been trying to get a job.  I do not have  any internship experience.  I also am not in the position at this time  to relocate and find a job outside of the New York City area.  Further  more, I do not have a drivers license yet ( I currently only have a  learners permit), thus I am limited to only where public transportation can get me.  

I would like to share my resume to get advice, but this reddit does not allow links.  

I currently do not have any tech certifications.

As    in what type of job in tech I am  looking for, to be honest I know  many   are saying that Software  Engineer or Developer is the easiest to  get   into.  However that is not  what I think I would exceed at, and  my dream   goals in tech career are  not in that area.  I am looking  mostly for   Cyber Security as a dream  goal in my career, and am more  inclined on towards the, IT Help Desk,  Network Engineer, System Analyst  side of   things.  To be honest I did  poor in some of the Software  Engineer coding   interviews, due to time  complexity, I know how to  code.

Although many here might say  that I should do plural-sight, coursera, or try  to find a CISCO  Net-Acad class that I can get into, there is a problem.  My  dad does  not want to pay for courses, although he is fine with   paying  for  certifications.  I do not have any money on my own, if I did I might   have been enrolled in some CISCO Net-Acad program.  The   problem is I  do  not know cloud or CISCO and know some of the basics and   a little   intermediate with Linux command line.  I barely know Powershell.  Also I   barely have any experience with iMac.  I know   Windows the most out  of  the 3 major OSes.  There is good news however, the Federal  government  gave money to the state of New York to give out   free  Coursera courses to  unemployed people in the state due to covid.   I   was only able to get  into that program at the later end of last  year.    I am currently doing  the Google IT Support Professional  Certificate.    Unfortunately Coursera  only has unofficial CISCO courses  and that  too  for the previous version  of the CCNA exam.  :(  Although  they do  have  official AWS and Google  cloud courses, but doesn't one  need to  pay to  interact with the cloud or  does cloud access come with  the  courses.  I  asking because, it didn't  say clearly.

I  do not have  certifications yet, because I want to review what I    learned in college,  and because the CompTIA A+ asks cloud related    questions.  Thus I would  need to get some knowledge on cloud."

I am from Mexico and in December i just finished my MSc In Europe.

I finished my Bs in 2017 and i got my first job, i worked on year and then i left due the payment and started to learn english so it would be easier to get a scholarship to study my master.

I got rejected because i needed more experience so i work 8 months more and then i got accepted.

I quit my job because i needed time to prerare my TOEFL but the the pandemic started and it was impossible to get a job at that moment so i didn't get a job while i was waiting to start my master.

My first semester i took it remotely becuase the embassy didn't allow me to attend presentially so some subject were impossible for me to take them and i took them at the semester of intership so i didn't do the intership either.

I presented my thesis and finally i got my digital diploma while i am waiting for the real one, i looked for jobs and i did many interviews even there is a chinese company called mindray and they were interested on me and even they told me i got the job the last week but yesterday they repented because i haven't worked in three years.

There is a course focused on programming in java and i wanna take it but i had to tell them that i would start to work and now i don't have a job and my course.

&#x200B;

I'm desperate to find something soon, I even try to do an internship but no one hires me.

What am I doing wrong?

If anyone could give me tips I would appreciate it.

Figured out it wasn’t for me, and since I’ve always been a STEM person and have quite a few friends in CS, I decided to switch careers. I’m going back for my second bachelor’s degree in CS at my alma mater this coming fall, and had a few concerns, especially with the slow job market and all.

If everything goes well, I’m aiming to finish the degree in two years (I don’t have to take any core classes or extra requirements since I completed them for my first degree). I’m guessing this only leaves me time to do one internship during the summer, two if I get really lucky for the winter break. Would this give me a disadvantage when applying for jobs? Typically I’m assuming people get at least two internships under their belt before graduating, and I’ll be lucky to even get one. 

Career-wise I have ten years of healthcare experience and a little over a year in HR - would this matter when applying for dev jobs? 

Thank you in advance for all your input!"

I would take UTM bcomm but i am concerned about the distance from Downtown toronto and if that would limit my internship and networking opportunities. However i heard that the econ program at utsg is notoriously difficult, and getting into financial economics is even harder. But it is closer to all the internship opportunities.

My questions are: 
1. Which one would is better? Is it worth taking the difficulty of utsg econ in order to be close to the opportunities? Is it worth taking utm commerce away from all the opportunities?

2. Is their a prestige factor that plays in here? Would internships prefer utsg econ over utm bcom?

She gossips, plays favorites, pits people against each other.  I know her well.  As soon as she started playing these tricks on me I told HR every little thing that happened.

I had some performance issues that seemed acceptable at first after I went off probation, but in late February 2022 I made a mistake that seemed to have made my direct manager lose complete faith in me.  It made them put me back on probation, and basically said that if things didn't improve, I would be asked to leave.  They didn't put a formal PiP in, but said it wouldn't be that black and white for the threshold of being let go, and there would be a lot of in-between leeway.  

When I took my medical leave, it was a bit of a busy time and they really needed more people.  Around this time last year when it looked like I would be gone for longer than it seemed, I went to turn in my work electronics to my manager and we had a talk.  They said the exact same scenario happened last year at around the same time, someone (who had been there for a few years at that point) went on leave after getting put on probation again, and they were left short staffed (and never came back as far as I know).  They also went into how they felt things my entire time there hadn't worked out, some what implying even when I did get things right prior to my big mistake didn't really matter any more.  I pointed out in the three weeks after I made the mistake and we worked up a plan, they seemed to think I did okay when I asked for feedback at the time, but when I was talking to them that particular day they seemed to reign back on that, saying that I was a little slow.  I promised to them when I got better I would go back and prove myself that I am competent.  

During January and February of this year, I went to physiotherapy for two months which the insurance company mandated for return to work.  Initially, it seemed like I was going back soon, and the insurance company got the idea I would be starting again at the end of February.  Work didn't like the back to work schedule so they tried to rework which days of the week I would work with my physiotherapist, so that got put off.  

It wasn't until the beginning of April did I hear word from the insurance company and they said I would be returning at the beginning of May, having been unable to come up with a back to work schedule with my employer.  The insurance company told me in lieu of that, they would give me the rest of April to re-adjust my lifestyle for back to work and work out a pay check plan to get paid out in the mean time.  What they didn't know because my employer didn't say to them directly was the reason they couldn't get a back to work plan was because my position had been eliminated and I had been laid off, which I found out from HR last week.  

This put me in shock because I realized that plan for me to go back and prove I could be a decent worker was now no longer possible, and the only thing my manager would remember me by was ""not panning out"".  I reached out to them one last time, and both them and the manager above said this was a decision made well outside their reach, and came to them out of no where also.  I discussed my disappointment about my performance prior to my leave, and my manager reiterated it kind of sucked I wasn't around when they needed the manpower to get the work done the previous spring.  Everything was cordial and my manager said it was all professional and there was no hard feelings.  

However, they then suggested something along the lines of not bothering to put this experience on my resume, and rather to fall back on my previous work experience as an earth scientist.  I found this a nuts suggestion especially if they had truly read my resume, as it has been nine years since I last worked that field of work.  In addition, and this is something I never told them and they never seemed to have found out, was that the reason I left that field of work was I had far worst performance issues and may have been blacklisted by word of mouth.  I spent the middle of last decade working low-end to minimum wage jobs just to get by, only to go back to school during the last few years of the decade to get into my current field.  

I feel I cannot exclude this previous job from my resume, as it would create a massive gap when combined with the medical leave I took.  More importantly is without it, I have no relevant work experience in my current field and a two-year gap from my graduation from my second post-secondary experience to this job I was recently laid off from, being four years of no relevant work.  Well, maybe not quite, I had an unpaid internship in the summer of 2021 that was loosely related to my field, but I don't think I can fall back on that especially with the two-year gap excluding this recent job from my resume would create.  

I then discussed two further things with my manager, and the first was the possibility of using them as a work reference.  I predicted and feared it would happen, but they said while I could put them down, they didn't really have much to say.  They seemed to imply they wouldn't say anything negative about me, but they felt being there for less than half-a-year before my leave, they felt I wasn't around long enough to have anything to say.  Okay, I some what accepted that because that was better than being told they wouldn't be a reference because they felt you weren't up to snuff.  

It was the second question that broke me a little.  In my line of work, it is optional to be indentured into a trade related to it, I would just need my hours signed off on it.  Once again, it was something I feared but rationalized it as being needless worry, but my manager said they didn't feel comfortable signing off on my hours I worked there because they felt I didn't perform well enough to warrant it.  I could be wrong, but my understanding was part of the hours signed off would be learning from someone.  While my manager felt closer to the end I needed to be almost totally retrained on everything because the mistake just ruined any confidence they had in me, I was able to do my work alone without issues sometimes, and there is the mandatory paper work I filled out to prove it.  In other words, it almost seems like this is another way for my manager to say once again, your time here was a total waste.  

It's why I really wanted to come back and prove my worth, because now without that opportunity, I feel my manager's thoughts on me are what I failed at.  I'm still probably going to put this job on my resume but not put my manager as a reference despite him giving the technical okay.  I should be fine as long as the any potential future employers don't go out of their way to contact them, which is why I am thinking about telling them if they hear from someone asking about me, I have not given authorization for them to do so.  

The final talk kind of proved my biggest fear true, that despite my medical issue, my manager still only saw the worst that happened to me.  I remember my parents telling me this was all worry that would probably not happen. but some parts of those worries have come true (at least I know my managers didn't go out of there way to can me, or so I think).  I now wonder if my co-workers who I think would give me a good reference will either ignore me or reject my requests to be a reference.  This isn't because I think there maybe a link between them and my manager necessarily, but after this past week or so of being let down with unfortunate news every now and then, I don't know if there will be any good in the horizon."

**UW-Madison Pros:**

* Cost is $60k USD per year
* Can graduate in 3 years so save money and time
* Total $180k USD for 3 years
* Work in US with higher salaries

**UW-Madison Cons:**

* Less International students
* Party school (I don't drink lol)
* Weather is awful (Harsh winters)
* Might not fit in, huge cultural shock

* 5 year course (time consuming)
* $200k USD for 4 years of tuition

**Thoughts:**

I feel like I will fit in better at UBC but its just that its a 5 year course and CS isn't guaranteed. UWM is great financially since I save 2 years of my life in which I can work but I might have to sacrifice 3 years of my uni life if I don't have a good experience (I'm not sure because I heard there's racism and what not). I'm south asian and religious plus I don't drink.  Kindly help me and feel free to ask more questions.

Overall it's the **experience and amazing campus at UBC vs career and high salaries at UW-Madison.**

If not for the UBC campus, I would choose UW-Madison instantly. So help me decide quick!"

I'm a 22 year old in India, graduating in late 2023. I have been enrolled in 3 internships, and I'm in my 4th atm, as a DevOps Intern. The company where I'm working right now has not given me a pre-placement offer, so under the title of an Intern, I have been given the responsibilities of a full time DevOps Engineer. I've upskilled and learnt a lot, I'm proficient in ELK stack, Jenkins, Github Actions, Docker, Serverless computing (DynamoDB, Lambda), Docker, Ansible, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, CloudFormation, Bash scripting.

I mean, I can list a few more but my main emphasis was that even though I haven't graduated yet, I have acquired almost an year (10 months) of experience with full time responsibilities, and I've deep knowledge of the most fundamental niche of DevOps.

I scrounge linkedin, glassdoor, naukri.com, hirist, all the job boards you can think of, and I hardly find profiles that are hiring freshers or anyone with 0-1 or 1-3 years of experience for that matter. When I do find them, I'm unable to receive a response.

I've been on the search for half an year. My current company is a service based IT startup and can barely pay me a living wage($225 per month). I feel demotivated, lost, frustrated and heavily concerned about my career and Life atm, since I have a family to financially support.

Please give me some general guidelines of how I should get about the job hunting in this economy as a fresher? I'm desperate."

First of all, thank you all for taking the time to read this post and for offering your valuable opinions. Any Advice is appreciated.

I have narrowed down my choices to Penn State and Arizona State, both of which have offered me admission to their Honours College programs for Computer Science. At Penn State, I have been offered a 2+2 program, which means I'll be spending my first two years at Penn State Erie and then transferring to the main campus at University Park for the remaining two years. Whereas, at ASU, I'll be attending all four years at the Tempe campus.

Penn State is renowned for its strong alumni network, which is incredibly beneficial for job opportunities and internships. Additionally, University Park has a well-established reputation for computer science and a broad range of research opportunities. On the other hand, Arizona State is located in the heart of the Silicon Valley, which is perfect for networking with technology giants and gaining relevant industry experience.

Now, let's talk finances. Four years at Penn State would run me roughly around $150,000, while four years at ASU would be around $100,000, factoring in my scholarship if renewed every year. This tuition includes room and board facilities for the first year at both colleges ."

I am leaning towards a career as a software engineer, and I am not sure which program would better suit my goals.  

Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons of each program:

**UCI MS ECE** 

*Pros:*

* Cheaper tuition
* Better campus and teaching quality compared to NEU (based on what I've heard)
* Can select many CS sources from the CS department
* Love the weather in southern California
* Better rankings

*Cons:*

* It's an ECE program, not CS; Not sure if this title will negatively impact my job prospects.

**NEU MSCS** 

*Pros:*

* Located in Silicon Valley, providing greater networking opportunities
* Offers co-op opportunities

*Cons:*

* Considering the current job market, I'm uncertain if I can secure a job position.
* Unable to find the co-op and internship statistics for 2022 and later, I reached out to a friend currently enrolled in NEU's SES program. He told me that co-op opportunities provided were limited, and many fellow students were unable to secure internships or co-ops. 

&#x200B;

PS: would probably go for NEU if the job market wasn't this bad

How should I respond?,lone_dreamer22,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/130ynx6/applied_for_a_sr_software_enginner_position/,"I graduated in Dec. 2022 and have been applying for roles ever since. Last week, I applied at a healthcare solutions company with a referral from a family friend. Since they don't have any entry level or junior positions, I applied for Senior Software Engineer position. I didn't add any fake things in my resume. 

I got an email from them for a prescreen evaluation with questions on salary ( i'm down for anything tbh as of now ), software experience ( didn't have an internship )  , C# and Azure experience ( never used those technologies) . 

How should I respond to those questions? I applied for a senior level role so I can land in an entry level position. How should I honest yet still continue the conversation with the company?"

130z9du,3,2023-04-27,Better Summer Experience: UPenn Coding Academy vs NYU/JHU Pre-College classes?,k_dott2,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/130z9du/better_summer_experience_upenn_coding_academy_vs/,"Hey everyone,

I am currently a junior in college, helping my younger brother (junior in HS) increase his chances for T25. He was accepted in the above two programs, but I personally do not have experience to decide between the two. Below, are the key points that I discovered so far:

**UPenn Summer Coding Academy**:

\- college name has more prestige to it (?)

\- does **NOT** offer credit

\- 3 weeks long

&#x200B;

**NYU Summer Pre-College Program**:

Courses taught: Intro to Computer Programming || Intro to Web Dev & Computer Principles

\- 5 weeks long

\- **DO** get credit, hopefully **exempt from the intro level cs courses**

&#x200B;

**JHU Summer Pre-College Program:**

Courses taught: Gateway Computing: JAVA || Minds & Machines (bs philosophy course)

\- 4 weeks long

\- **DO** get credit, but 1 tech + 1 social sciences courses

&#x200B;

All 3 cost quite a lot, but our father is willing to contribute, if this will help **boost the app in any way**.

**Finally**, I assume people on this sub know about the significance of these programs a lot more than I do, so do you guys think it is a good investment to go either one of these? Does the NYU program have more weight to it, since it is credit-based? Would you choose NYU program >> JHU's, since JHU only offers 1 tech course?

**TLDR**: Younger brother (junior HS) accepted in a few pre-college programs, wondering if these programs of any use? The goal is to show the AOs that he was involved in something in the States, since we are **internationals**. He will **also** have an internship and Volunteering experiences this summer, so this is an addition.

&#x200B;

Thank you so much in advance. So sorry for the big block of text."
1311ony,1,2023-04-27,Worried I might be boxing myself into a certain type of role before graduating.,mftsb,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1311ony/worried_i_might_be_boxing_myself_into_a_certain/,"For context I am a junior studying math and cs at a (T10/T5 idk which one it is). I have done a couple internships, one with a startup where I did product design and data science. Another was a medium sized cloud company where I did sentiment analysis. The next was AWS. For this summer I have accepted an opportunity to do cloud/data stuff at JPL. I accepted JPL because I didn't have anything else and also because its NASA (who turns down nasa). That being said, I am kind of worried that a lot of my internships have been cloud based and I might be painting myself into a corner. If I'm being honest cloud is not really something that I want to do. I'd much rather do something AI related, product management, tech consulting, quant trading, or VC (which I know is kind of a longshot). Would it be worth it to do something more business related at a small company rather than keep doing cloud?"

I loved this role, as I have always dreamed of being a sports analyst, and it’s something I definitely want to do when I graduate. I also love working for the coaching staff, as they treat me with a lot of respect and responsibility for somebody my age. 

However, news just came out that the head coach is stepping down, and will not be there next year. I am really uncertain of a lot of things right now, such as whether my internship would still be available with the new potential staff. So I had a few questions if anybody with any experience could answer.

1) When would be an appropriate time to reach out and ask the assistant coach that I work for the questions that I have about my role, or potentially working with them at their next job. I am not sure whether to reach out right away, or to step back and wait until after this weekend.

2) (This is more general) Would it be better to try to get the same internship at my current school (with a new coaching staff), or to continue to work with the same coaches at a new school (virtually without being able to attend any games)

I don’t really post very often on Reddit, but I am really concerned and in need of any guidance, thank you."

1312cmk,2,2023-04-27,I was very successful with admissions but I have come into a big dillema about school choice.,yex-thelp,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1312cmk/i_was_very_successful_with_admissions_but_i_have/,"I got into tufts, USC, American U, Loyola Marymount and occidental which are all primo schools, but I have narrowed these down to just Occidental as my top choice (primarily for political opportunities like their campaign semester.) But with all of these schools, Willamette University in Salem keeps drawing me back. It has an amazing community and all but guaranteed access to internships at the OR state capitol. My mom and step dad have gotten to the point where they are saying they do not feel okay with letting me go to willamette. 

Am I being completely stupid? 

Willamette has an 80% acceptance rate (largely due to the fact they are trying to grow their school population) they have some great opportunities too and I love oregon and would love to begin a career in political advocacy there. At the same time though, I am turning down schools which by pure stats are comprised of ""better students"" but I am worried I would not be able to thrive in a community with people primarily focused on academics. I have heard so much about how occidental is by no means competitive but I dont fully buy that and I know willamette is supportive of their studetns

I have also heard a plethora of concerns from people that occidental has poor administration interaction with the students and it can be hard to fix any mistake with them.  and willamette ranks 8th in the country for student faculty relations  ([https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-us-universities-student-staff-interaction](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-us-universities-student-staff-interaction))

&#x200B;

At the end of the day though, Im not sure about any of it. I just want to know if this decision is as black and white as my parents are making it out to be. I think I would be happier at willamette and would get a great education.

But am i being stupid or am i just looking beyond prestige?"
1312fo4,1,2023-04-27,How/where should I start my career?,wiglafofpinwick,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1312fo4/howwhere_should_i_start_my_career/,"I am desperate for your insights because I'm a first generation university student, very poor family etc. So I grab whatever information I can find.

I'm a business&tech major in top 5 uni in my country. Did an internship at FAANG (non-tech role), had very positive comments, but no offer due to recent lay-offs and freeze. Now I have to choose between some options and I want to hear all of your thoughts.

&#x200B;

As my first job out of college:

Option A: Marketing role at big pharma company. Their office in my country is very selective (only people from top 5 uni). The culture and learning opportunities seems nice. From my LinkedIn research, people with good profiles are eager to work there for 15-20 years, it might signal something good.

Option B: Growth & Monetization role at a boutique mobile game company. They pay really well and the founder team seems to have solid profiles. Mobile gaming sector is very promising in my area and these companies again only hire people from top universities or require solid experience. Few of them turned out to be unicorns. Entrepreneurial culture is strong, the founder said ""I'd want you to work for us for 4-5 years at max, then start your own company at let me invest in it."" Not sure about if this might be a ""too good to be true"" case in few years.

Option Extra: Do whatever the heck you want for a year, save some money, and go for a master's degree in Europe. Then find an above-average job that pays you well enough to have a decent life in Europe.

&#x200B;

The people I've interviewed all seem very nice and professional in the pharma company. They really like working there. They might go to States, or Europe with their background and experience easily from the look of it, but they haven't. So I'm assuming they must be paid well, like their jobs and culture etc. or they can't do that so easily and I'm wrong. Marketing excites me and it's a skill that I'm motivated to learn. But marketing in pharma, not so much.  I'm not sure how transferable would be to let's say; marketing in tech. Also, to earning good money with salary is really hard thing to do in my country. But if you have found your own successful business, it's not impossible. With experience in marketing, in pharma, I'm not sure how can I find my own thing in the future, even though I would have, it seems really hard. My marketing skills would help but my experience in pharma goes for nothing if I'm founding a start-up in another industry.

&#x200B;

Option B on the other hand, lacks the strong network of option A. I might have some deeper connection with people there but my network would be limited to something niché and I'm not sure if that's wise considering it's my first job out of college. But if it turns out to be something I really enjoy, it's great. Because in my thirties let's say, I can build my own start-up easier. Also, due to mobile gaming trend, it would be much more easier for me find investors, people to work with etc. I will also get to work with adnetworks like Google, Meta, Tiktok etc. It means I will be in an environment still not that far from ""tech"" (which might be very important for the future) .This option also would not seem very strong in my CV for future options. They are a good mobile game company but that's that, they have 60 people employed and it would be harder for me to go into some other area in future I believe (?).

&#x200B;

I want to earn money, lots of it if possible. Because I have people to take care of and I want to choose the best option. It sometimes worries me so much I can sleep at night. I also think it might be complete waste of time because we are closing to Artificial General Intelligence each day and I will be one of the first people to get their butt kicked. Option B is something more ""long term"" but option A also seems strong. I don't really know nothing anymore, always bouncing from option to option.

&#x200B;

Please give me your thoughts, I really need them."

I learned a bunch of introductory IT knowledge like backup and active directory and networking and creating patch cables, etc. I started my official full time position as a IT support technician/Field support technician in April. I was part of 2 hires the other guy was fired for not being tech savvy. I’m the only IT support tech in this fairly new MSP of 13 years. It’s only me, the boss, and his partner and the side business they work with, but I don’t count that. Anyways I do work IT support technician work, but since I work directly under the C.O.O and his partner they both have knowledge of both IT systems administration, IT consulting, and Network administration since they do most of the work of the business helping set up systems. They basically are training me in everything they know and do on the daily basis and I just watch remotely or do hands on work. Examples so far like virtualization, setting up network racks and running cabling, organizing patch cables in switches and routers, helping setup access points, and helping remotely migrate a network virtually even though I’m mostly watching. Also creating outlines and plans for cloud backup systems and helping to implement a ticketing system here as well. Im  learning so much I’m wondering since I’m learning so much directly from the source how long do I have to stay till I can go for a Junior system admin role? I went to College and have computer science related degrees. Wondering if I should grab a certification before I go or just put everything I learned on my resume that I’m logging and just tell future jobs I learned under a MSP owner and his partner who has all that experience and taught me basically junior system admin knowledge.

 - **iTunes** - Not Verified so have a backup planned. Some of these movies are from back when you used to need both the digital disc and the code to get the movie. You no longer need the disc to redeem these but they will probably redeem in SD quality. There are also a few codes that are the split portion from a Paramount, Lionsgate or Universal slip.  If you need an iTunes code because you don't use UV, a lot of the codes in the MA section above have the ability for direct redemption on iTunes.

1318aru,4,2023-04-27,Are project-based internships worth it?,markhallak,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/1318aru/are_projectbased_internships_worth_it/,"I got selected for an unpaid remote internship at ""The Sparks Foundation"" that have offices in Singapore and India. It is a project-based internship at least for the department/field that I have selected which is mobile app development.

I assumed that they will just send me tasks/projects to do, such as building a calculator app and I have to submit it within a deadline usually a week, since I got a similar internship (unpaid) recently at an Indian organization that I got to know about on LinkedIn when I was searching for internships. There was no industry exposure or mentors that I worked closely with. Moreover, if I wanted to get a certificate, I had to pay for it. It was the main reason for me to not continue with the internship. Also, the projects that they send are exactly the same for every batch. So I searched on Google for reviews about ""The Sparks Foundation"" and I saw people saying that it is a project-based internship and there is no industry exposure.

""The Sparks Foundation"" seems somewhat credible since it has a reasonable amount of followers (100k+) on LinkedIn but all I am getting in return is a certificate and a lot of work (especially keeping their LinkedIn group active by commenting on other people's posts and posting on my profile an ""appreciation"" post with hashtags containing their name) with no real work experience and industry exposure. There is a good 

I am wondering if employers appreciate such internships or if it looks good on my resume since I can mainly copy and paste code to do the projects/tasks.

I appreciate any thoughts on this. Thanks!"

I work for a F500 doing specialized firmware development work, which I loathe due to lack of guidance or documentation, but am paid decently and have good benefits (including an education stipend). I'm an okay developer, but I've worked three jobs in tech up until now and only (sort of) liked one. In general, I find corporate software development incredibly tedious and hair-pullingly frustrating, with spaghetti codebases and management that doesn't understand what they're asking for. My world is ruled by petty tyrants (usually businesspeople with MBAs). My passions lie in economics and politics, I am a humanities person at my core.

I have acceptances for two master's programs; an MBA specializing in international business, and an MSc in CS, specializing in artificial intelligence. Neither school is particularly highly ranked, the former being ~500 globally and the latter being ~200. The MBA includes matchmaking for an internship.

I'm highly conflicted here; the MBA is a lot more conducive to the career I thought I wanted for the longest time, of a globetrotting businessman or financier. However, I've heard that MBAs from lower ranked institutions aren't worth that much in terms of career progression. The MSc is unquestionably valuable, especially with the AI specialization, and I do find academic computer science interesting, but I'm scared of being pigeonholed into the same code-mining technical work that I've come to despise. The MBA program is cheaper by roughly 30%.

I'm currently leaning towards the MSc, because much of the program is online, which allows me flexibility. However, some input would be appreciated. Wishing you a wonderful day. 😊"

I do well in school, and typically don’t’ struggle very much with the coursework. But then I get the real-world scenarios, and I feel like I have no idea what I am doing.

I haven’t been able to get an internship for the summer, which is really discouraging since my school has a placement rate of 98%. Every time I’ve gone to the career center, all they tell me is that everything looks good and to keep applying. But I’ve been applying to SWE jobs since September and nothing. I get a few interviews here and there, lots of coding challenges (some go okay, some don’t) but where I really struggle is pair programming and screen sharing. I always end up making a total fool of myself and can barely get a single line of code down.

I feel like I’m wasting time and (a lot) of money for something I’m just not good at. It’s too late for me to switch majors, and I guess I’m just feeling lost. Are there other career paths that I could go down with this degree? Any words of encouragement or advice is greatly appreciated."

tech savvy. I'm the only IT support tech in this fairly new MSP of 13 years. It's only me, the boss, and his partner and the side business they work with, but I don't count that.

Hi Reddit, I could really use some advice. I know this gets asked from time to time, but my situation is somewhat unique. Hopefully this post can help some in the future as well.

I am a senior CS major at UGA, due to graduate in May 2024. I am a senior in credit hours only, as I have an overabundance from switching majors sophomore year. Due to swapping so late, it has been an uphill battle trying to catch up to where I should be in the program.

Switching to STEM from non-STEM sophomore year meant some super stacked and rigorous schedules. Fortunately, this part went excellently and I've been able to maintain a very high GPA, though this came at the cost of career preparation. I'm completely aware this wasn't a great tradeoff, but it was the path I pursued. I have now caught up to where I need to be in the program, and can begin taking a non-bloated course load that will allow me more time to career prep.

I did not begin grinding LC until last summer, and it was not until earlier this month that I had a few solid projects worth putting on my resume/Github. My resume is now far superior to what it was during the last recruitment season. However, I am clearly late to the party. I did apply for a few internships last autumn, though if I am being honest, my resume was terrible and I was under the impression that I was still unprepared. Retrospectively, I was much more capable than I had realized, but had the cold feet of imposter syndrome.

Fast forward to today, I feel confident about my ability as a programmer. This Spring, I have become proficient with some high-demand frameworks and built some presentable projects. While it's certainly too late for summer 2023 internships, that hasn't stopped me from applying.

I have until January 2024 to make this decision. Should I apply to both FT roles and internships (for 2024) and in the event that I do **not** secure a full time role and do land an internship, push my graduation to autumn 2024 so that I can take the internship? I.e. if I get an internship and no full time role, should I push my graduation out to autumn 2024 to take it?

I would greatly appreciate any advice as I'm having an extremely tough go of it at the moment. Believe me, nobody can make me feel any worse than I already do for not being able to prepare earlier, I did the best I could with the information available to me at the time. Thank you for any replies, any advice is huge."

I was having a conversation with a prospective student for my program today and we ironically met a few days prior on Reddit and he approached me like (is it X school) and I said yes.

Since then we've begun a casual friendship as he's on campus and he expressed frustrations and concerns similar to mine. He was looking at the program I am in and I told him to be prepared when meeting my program director because since we have similar views on things and my program head isn't a fan of these philosophical views.

Anyhow I saw him tonight on his last night here. I was supposed to go to an event to run shoulders with the donors and I couldn't get to the event due to car trouble and being flat broke to where I can't buy gas and my program isn't paying me anymore until next term. So I ran into him at a chapel on our campus and we got to talking.

Turns out the director heard about his views and was less than pleased and also asked if he spoke to anyone in the program. He lied and said he hadn't, but the director pointed him to ONLY talk to the other two people in the program. I told him I was not surprised my program director say that because we're fighting so much because of different viewpoints, but I also told him that the same people he was told to talk to are very much the antithesis of himself.

My program director is also keeping me on a very tight leash and probably wants to kick me out of the program because my opinions are different. She also made me confess to a lot of things in private: a disability (and asking if it would impact my internship), talking about a lifetime of trauma, and trying to get me into religious direction. It's a religious program and I get that the third thing is there but she had no right to know my other stuff. I'm about to go to the dean with all this because I can't do this anymore.

If she wants me out of the program she could just say it to my face because she's not putting me in a situation where I can thrive. She put me in an assignment that was a total polar opposite of who I am personally and my belief structure.

Just needed to vent. This guy who visited my University doesn't think he's going to go here because he doesn't see it being right at all. But we're gonna keep in contact.

What a fuckin way to end the term man."

I work for a F500 doing specialized firmware development work, which I loathe due to lack of guidance or documentation, but am paid decently and have good benefits (including an education stipend). I'm an okay developer, but I've worked three jobs in tech up until now and only (sort of) liked one. In general, I find corporate software development incredibly tedious and hair-pullingly frustrating, with spaghetti codebases and management that doesn't understand what they're asking for. My world is ruled by petty tyrants (usually businesspeople with MBAs). My passions lie in economics and politics, I am a humanities person at my core.

I have acceptances for two master's programs; an MBA specializing in international business, and an MSc in CS, specializing in artificial intelligence. Neither school is particularly highly ranked, the former being ~500 globally and the latter being ~200. The MBA includes matchmaking for an internship.

I'm highly conflicted here; the MBA is a lot more conducive to the career I thought I wanted for the longest time, of a globetrotting businessman or financier. However, I've heard that MBAs from lower ranked institutions aren't worth that much in terms of career progression. The MSc is unquestionably valuable, especially with the AI specialization, and I do find academic computer science interesting, but I'm scared of being pigeonholed into the same code-mining technical work that I've come to despise. The MBA program is cheaper by roughly 30%.

I'm currently leaning towards the MSc, because much of the program is online, which allows me flexibility. However, some input would be appreciated. Wishing you a wonderful day. 😊"

I am an incoming freshman at a T50 university studying CS and looking to go into SWE/Quant(the latter part would require a transfer up). I have seen several posts on this sub saying that I should start looking for freshman internships now. I'll be entering college with an internship and research experience(going to be done within a professor's lab at the university I will be entering in the fall) during consecutive summers under my belt. I understand the market is pretty bad right now and thus getting an internship during the summer after freshman year will be hard. Due to some scheduling issues/limits, I won't be able to take DS/Algo during my first year but I will be self-studying during the year - hopefully to the point that by the end of the year, I can solve Leetcode Easys with a decent amount of confidence. I have found a repository like this: [https://github.com/codicate/underclassmen-internships](https://github.com/codicate/underclassmen-internships) that has a lot of opportunities for freshmen but if anyone has any other databases/places where this information is consolidated that would be helpful. I also think I will have an opportunity at a semi-big company next summer mostly due to nepotism/family connections. Is that something I take? Do I sort of punt on this year for internships and come back with a very strong resume for the summer after sophomore year(where I would aim for FAANG even though that is unrealistic), and take my freshman year to work on projects and flesh out my tech stack? Additionally, what are other things I can do to make my resume stronger? I'm looking into TAing for my school but it seems they don't allow undergrad TA's based on my search so that might not be an option - so it might just be projects/hackathons/club involvements. Any advice in my search would be considered very helpful. I can also post my modified HS resume(and projected freshman resume) if needed.

Additionally, thoughts on changing my grad date(wouldn't be too dishonest since I am coming in with a lot of AP credit and could technically semi-feasibly graduate in 3) to try and get sophomore opportunities as a freshman? Maybe keep a couple different copies of my resume?

and finally, when should I start looking? some people say I should start in a couple months - which seems kind of weird because I'll be making an entire resume based on things I have not done yet, but others say January 24 will be too late.

PS: Is it worth it applying to minority/underprivileged programs if I am not what they're looking for?

Thanks everyone."

Yale Interview (10/10): very long, very good, she seemed really interested

Hey y’all, I’m having trouble deciding between 2 internships and was hoping to get some advice/help from more experienced individuals. I know both these positions may not be exactly what I want to do, but I hope it serves as a decent stepping stone towards my eventual goal to be a swe intern for a faang type company my next internship.

1. One seems like a web dev internship that says it involves front/back end development for its UI but the role responsibilities and job overview seem vague. This would be at a decent sized but recognizable retail companies e-commerce team, but con is it doesn’t pay much. 

2. The other is sort of a test automation engineering role for a solid brand name finance company involving writing python/selenium test scripts, and pays a bit more.

What do y’all see and the best step forward for my career? I’m fearful that I may be stuck doing undesirable work for the first option when I have the other option to do solid test automation work at a solid company."

While having any conversation the most prevalent thing that comes up is reservation for women during campus placement and hence men get lesser opportunities. Now I am not from engineering field so I am genuinely curious about this. I know he wouldn't be eligible for high paying companies because of his Gpa and poor internships and over all lack of extra curricular. But as I am not from this field I really want to understand this and how biased is the corporate sector. 

I have heard numerous casual insinuations about women not having anything more to contribute to them and yet they are promoted earlier, given more privileges.

In all my conversations only 1 of the guys out of around 50 guys or more actually told me I was wrong and that women actually face pay disparity at higher positions, lesser promotions at higher level. Discrimination of all sorts and also higher chances of subtle sexual abuse. That said he happens to be the most successful as well currently working at Facebook from the whole lot. 

According to them The only positives of why women are hired is that they might switch less and are more loyal. But i am far away from this field and very few women friends of mine are in corporate sector. 

I am tired of hearing good for nothing men trying to diss women's achievements because someone told them women get jobs because they have reservation. I am open to all views and to be taught how things work."

131s5xu,1,2023-04-28,How did you school days go?,Daniel_Potter,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/131s5xu/how_did_you_school_days_go/,"I am 27 and unemployed. Had 2 months work experience (internship during 2nd years of my bachelors) and i felt miserable. Even though the people were nice, i couldn't keep up with the 9 to 5. Graduated 4 years ago, right before covid, and been in this ""vacation state"", that has been long overdue. I started going to therapy, thinking maybe ADHD is the answer to it all. But my therapist been very dismissive of my claims.

I always been an underperformer in school. I studied under sovietesque style education. This system focuses on verbal answers. You stand in front of the class, and talk about ww1 or whatever, and teacher would ask leading questions. There were no mid term or final exams, instead the system asks for consistency. You accumulate grades throughout the quarter (quarters instead of semesters), and then they average it out (grades for reference: 5 - A, 4 - B, 3 - C, 2 - F). At any point in time, they can ask you to stand in front of the class, and get assessed. So the system requires a lot of consistency, to come prepared to class at all times, but also a good poker face and luck.

Grades 1-4 i studied under that system. But the grading was pretty lax at that age. Generally, people don't get C (final) grades until middle/high school. F as a final grade essentially doesn't exist, so it's generally As and Bs at that age. I was getting by fine, it was essentially daycare.

Grades 5-7 i studied in Malaysia. Grade 5, i was placed in IEP (Intensive English Program), and i remember getting 49.5% on my english test at the end of the year, and the pass mark to leave IEP was 50%. But my teacher was very nice, and let me pass. But overall, i remember that my grades were getting pretty decent by grade 7. I wasn't really paying attention during class, instead chilling with my friend in the back. But I remember that i was very good at binging for mid terms and finals, getting around 70-80% average.

Grades 8-11 i had to study back home again, and i was really struggling with school. At first they would take pity on me, cause my russian wasnt so good, and give me Bs instead of Cs. But going into grade 9, my performance still stayed the same, and a lot of teachers wanted me to leave school after grade 9 and go to college (colleges and universities are different here. college is sort of like a 2 year apprenticeship degree). My parents insisted i stay, and my performance was only getting worse. Got the point where i didnt give a fuck. I wouldnt go to school, sleep in class, and accumulate Fs. My parents intervened and started paying for my grades (education is very corrupt here).

Personally i blame the education system. There were no midterms, finals. Nothing to binge for. No standardized tests. Instead it was all about consistency. Preparing for class every week, no matter whether you are getting assessed or not. You could be reading up on the italian reunification, to try and get an A tomorrow, but the teacher would rather call people that don't feel confident answering today. And then, ironically, next week, when the topic is german unification, you havent prepared at all, and get an F. It's so demoralizing, and luck based. There were about 15 subjects, 6 days a week, 8to2 or 8to3 on normal days, and 8to12 on saturdays. I simply couldnt perform under this system, and was just getting progressively worse and less motivated.

For my bachelors, i went to UK (studied CS). There were only 4 subjects per semester, 4 days a week, around 12-16 hrs. Assessment was mostly coding projects at weeks 2 and 6, due in 4 weeks time, and exams. And i was thriving under that system. Every time we were given a project, i would start from day 1 (overcompensating for my bad performance in school). I would end up binging on it, 10 hrs in a row, and end up finishing it in a couple of days, weeks before it's due. I think another thing was that i really liked programming. I wouldnt notice the passage of time when working on these projects, sort of like when you play video games, and before you know it, it's 6 AM.

Even if it was something that i didnt want to do, like a 4000 word essay. I would just binge it overnight, get a semi decent grade. Same thing happened with exams. I would binge all past papers during exam diet.

I also want to add that you dont need to read books to be a programmer. I always had a problem concentrating reading books. Now, i would gain most of my knowledge by listening to the lecturer. There were slides, which were straight and concise, and i never had to open the original material these slides were based on. In fact, programming isn't like any subject you have in school. Programming is mostly problem solving and abstraction, and no subject i ever had in school was like that. You dont need 11 grades of education to be a programmer. You can start from grade 1. It's completely isolated from everything else, and not dependent on anything you learn in school, which ended up working in my favor, cause i wasn't particularly good at anything in school.

Finally there is that 2 month internship i had. Everything was great. People were nice, pay was good, i was keeping up with my work. Everything except for 1 thing. I would feel progressively worse every day. I was getting more and more tired. All i could do was come back home and sleep, and that wasnt enough to recharge me for the next day. Weekends werent enough either, and i just felt miserable.

I think my main issue is that i can only work in ""sprints"". I can't do ""marathons"". I am now wondering whether ADHD is the cause. Maybe if i can get meds for this, i can get my life in order. I am hoping to gather some feedback, to see whether others with this condition feel the same way.

Also, i feel that, where i am from, mental illnesses such as this are very stigmatized. My therapist said i can't have ADHD because i managed to finish uni."

I recently started my machine learning internship at a company with two ML „teams“, each having three interns and several data scientists and machine learning experts. I feel a little out of my depth as the only intern without a background in computer science or data science. My undergrad degree is in Electrical Engineering, which doesn't give me a lot of knowledge about machine learning, compared to the others.

Currently, I am working on an ML Ops task, implementing algorithms into an existing toolchain using ml flow. While I try my best, I worry that I might not be able to contribute as much as the other interns in the long run.

That is why I would like to ask for your advice. How can I stand out in a positive way during my internship? What can I do to maybe improve in a faster or different way? Any suggestions or tips would be much appreciated!

TL;DR: Part of an ML team but no CS or DS degree. Looking for ways to stand out/ improve quickly so I don‘t become a burden."

I am an incoming freshman studying CS and looking to go into SWE/Quant. I have seen several posts on this sub saying that I should start looking for freshman internships now. I'll be entering college with an internship and research experience(going to be done within a professor's lab at the university I will be entering in the fall) during consecutive summers under my belt. I understand the market is pretty bad right now and thus getting an internship during the summer after freshman year will be hard. I won't be able to take DS/Algo during my first year but I will be self-studying during the year - hopefully to the point that by the end of the year, I can solve Leetcode Easys with a decent amount of confidence. I have found a repository like this: [https://github.com/codicate/underclassmen-internships](https://github.com/codicate/underclassmen-internships) that has a lot of opportunities for freshmen but if anyone has any other databases/places where this information is consolidated that would be helpful. I also think I will have an opportunity at a semi-big company next summer mostly due to nepotism/family connections. Is that something I take? Do I sort of punt on this year for internships and come back with a very strong resume for the summer after sophomore year(where I would aim for FAANG even though that is unrealistic), and take my freshman year to work on projects and flesh out my tech stack? Additionally, what are other things I can do to make my resume stronger? I'm looking into TAing as well as doing projects/hackathons/club involvements. Any advice in my search would be considered very helpful. I can also post my modified HS resume(and projected freshman resume) if needed.

Additionally, thoughts on changing my grad date(wouldn't be too dishonest since I am coming in with a lot of AP credit and could technically semi-feasibly graduate in 3) to try and get sophomore opportunities as a freshman? Maybe keep a couple different copies of my resume?

and finally, when should I start looking? some people say I should start in a couple months - which seems kind of weird because I'll be making an entire resume based on things I have not done yet, but others say January 24 will be too late.

PS: Is it worth it applying to minority/underprivileged programs if I am not what they're looking for?

I'm a senior graduating from Virginia Tech this May, with a degree in Business Information Technology, and a concentration in Cybersecurity Management & Analytics. I neglected getting an internship during freshman summer, and got denied or ghosted for all my applications to internships during Sophomore and Junior summers. So I’ve ended up doing basic summer jobs like working at grocery stores or whatnot, nothing to brag about.

I’ve gone to the career fairs at school here, and have been putting through dozens of applications for jobs and internships for a variety of titles: IT internships, Cyber Analyst positions, business analyst positions, system admin jobs or even things like junior trainee roles, among others. None of these submissions return with good news or feedback, and the vast majority of them don’t even respond to me.

I’m aware I may not have made great choices with my time at VT, but I want to try and do better than I already am. I don’t really have many other extra-curriculars, apart from my efforts to study for the CompTIA Security+ Certification, and learning more about cybersecurity through TryHackMe.com (Both are ongoing, unfinished). I’d like to believe I have a good grasp on all of the content I've studied in school (3.15 GPA, not terrible, not great), but I just don’t have those ‘resume builders’ I can list that prove I have those skills…

So what can I do this summer or sign up for to try and push into the cybersecurity field, IT field, analysis field, or any other fields I might have not mentioned? What might I be qualified for at this moment? Any other suggestions? I’d be interested in anything you can offer!"

I'm going to be a prospective CS student at 2 different colleges (GSU then transfer to GaTech to finish).

Q1. What would be the best approach to obtain an internship while in school?

Q2. When would be the most appropriate time to start the internship while in school?

Q3. When applying, what would be considered a ""red flag""?

Q4. When applying, what would be considered a ""green flag""?

Q5. Besides grades, projects, and coursework what are ways to stand-out among...amongst my peers?

Q6. What would be a phenomenal way to network with employees/ employers of companies, other teachers, and hopefully mentors?

Q7. What resources, words, and or skills tend to stand out more to potential employers and their company(s)?

I understand focusing on school should be my #1 priority, which it will certainly be, especially for the first 2-3, 4 years. However, setting myself up for success in the early stages will also be quite beneficial for when it's time for me to begin the long journey.

I got accepted to the first round but I went to the webinar and they said they expect us to fully stop taking courses and work 6 months at one company and 6 months at another, then go back to school for a final two years.  I should mention most of the companies involved are not FAANG style companies. I think the entire program is heavily geared towards all engineers, I know the big name companies are Intel and Ebay but then a lot of smaller engineering firms are apart of it as well.

All my friends at other universities have internships that work around their school schedule so they can remain on track to graduate. And I'm wondering if I can find my own internship like this instead.

Currently I should be graduating Spring of 2025 and I'll be 30 years old. I don't really like the idea of delaying of graduating later than that but I guess if these internships ensure me a job then it could be worth it.

I was planning on spending this summer creating and deploying my own iOS app and working on a daily Leetcode schedule to begin building my résumé. Also in the future I could apply for internships of my own.

Do you think it would be worth it to take this internship and stop attending school for a year or is better just to focus on personal projects and stay on track to graduate?"

-Hybrid work model (2 days work from home)

-Newly built headquarters 

-Cheap/good food on-site 

-S tier East-coast city (allegedly, I’ve never been)

-$60+/hr

-Free housing (luxury apartments)

-Strong likelihood of a full-time return offer 

-Really good culture (from what I’ve read)

How did I make out? I have no certs and no prior internship experience, and it just seems surreal that this place gave me an offer while none of the dozens of other companies did."

13260md,4,2023-04-28,How do you know when it's time to stop trying in your career?,NorthernAvo,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/13260md/how_do_you_know_when_its_time_to_stop_trying_in/,"I'm not going to get into the details too much because I i just don't have the energy today.

I'm 28. It took me 8 years to graduate college (bounced around majors, worked a ton while in college).

I'm a geologist by trade. Got fired from my last job because I didn't fit the mold for an engineering firm. Got a government internship after and it's been the best job I've ever had, except that I'm still on an engineering team and my supervisors, though they've been kind to me for a while, are now starting to treat me differently, i can feel it.

I'm not sure what it is. I try the best I can, though i know that from the outside it doesn't seem like much. I fight myself all day, nonstop, to get myself organized, to start my tasks, to finish them efficiently. I get my work done, though it takes me longer than it should. I reach out for support, i don't hear back, I'm given no feedback, no sense of direction - I'm just on my own. But i do the work, i show initiative, i fucking try.

Out of the 5 interns I work with (across 4 different departments) i am now the only one who hasn't been offered a permanent position. I am the only one who's had to network like an animal for outside opportunities within the agency, I'm the only one who's interviewed internally for different positions and had 3 doors shut on them, now onto the 4th.

To add to the pain, a new intern started on my team recently and the level of support they receive from my supervisor is like night and day versus what I've gotten for 10 months. Night. And. Day.

I have a team of people trying to help me and support me but once I opened up about my ADHD and my poor GPA in undergrad, they seem to be treating me differently, unless it's in my head. I hope it's in my head. Even my supervisors have seemingly... given up on me lately. They keep throwing these general expectations around assuming I even know what they're referring to, when I haven't gotten any sense of direction. It's like me to magically pull things out of the air to do. I explain this to them and nothing changes. They throw words at me like robots (well at least one of my sups, the other is just way too tied up and laid back about my position).

I qualify for Schedule A hiring authority because I have a disability (well, if you consider severe depression and anxiety as well, then 3). But even with this, i feel hopeless. And then i start to think that, despite all of my efforts, all of my persistence, that because I'm now feeling defeated and burnt out, I'm somehow manifesting my demise.

So, when do I give up? When do i tally up all the signs from the universe telling me to do something different, even though i love the essence of my job, and just give up and move onto a different career? It just feels like wherever I go, no matter how hard I try and fight myself to just be a fucking person, I'm not good enough. I'm just never good enough."

I worked at a help desk for a singular semester at my old college, but transferred to a new one at the height of the pandemic and couldn't get my feet into a similar job. I'm graduated now and retail is a bummer as I feel like I'm wasting my degree. I want to try a remote location, but I absolutely would not mind getting actual hands-on experience and would actually prefer it!! Whether that be paid internship or not, I really want to get into this field and put my knowledge to work.

However, as I'm looking for remote jobs, I keep seeing multiple being listed as \[State Name\] Professional Group. There's also websites for the same professional group and the same layout among many of them but pertain to whichever state you look up. It seems highly suspicious, even moreso due to the fact I can't really find much information about them online, either good or bad.

13274t8,220,2023-04-28,I got the job!,OpportunityGlum,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13274t8/i_got_the_job/,"I had recently posted here a really embarrassing interview experience. The link: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12lcme7/interview_embarassment/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1

19 days later, I got the job! I could not believe it! I'm grateful for everyone who commented there with their stories and supportive comments, some of them really got me tearin' up. I tend to be quite hard on myself sometimes and when you guys said that I did good and that you're proud of me, it really meant a lot. I hope all of you are blessed with amazing opportunities in the future.

Lessons I learned:
1. Never be afraid to shoot your shot. Even if the job description says you require a certain number of years as experience, if you think you could do the tasks in the job description, apply for it. Prepare the best way you can and go for it.
2. Never stop applying. I was quite over-confident when I started getting calls for interviews, and never really thought of rejection as a scenario. I guess I was a naive 24 year old entering the job market, but never let any interview no matter how good they might be, get to your head. I gave the best interview prior to this one for an internship and when they rejected me, it broke me. It took 3 days to begin my applications again.
3. Smile and look more approachable. If you get called for the interview, you have gotten your foot through the door. Don't think you might be a filler candidate because they've called you even with you not satisfying all those qualifications and requirements they've stated in the job description. If they call you, do your best, dress your best and keep grinding.
4. The Companies Expert channel on youtube really helped me prepare and learn for some general interview questions. I also had chatgpt for help since I use it to make my cover letter and resume for every job I apply to.

Since, I never really had much hopes for this, I had followed up with the HR two weeks later to know the status, and they told me that they had moved on to another candidate. I proceeded with my applications once again, when the head HR called me one fine morning 5 days later and left me a voicemail with the update. The head HR apparently was shocked to know that his colleague had told me that they had moved on. This also kind of gives me an ego boost I guess, to know that I was their first choice.

I thank you all again for the kind comments, this is the first step to my career and I am really excited for the future.
Godspeed."

Did I make the right move?,Budget-Mud-4753,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1329tqn/got_and_started_a_promotion_to_a_new_position_at/,"I don't want to reveal too much information here; so locations, numbers, and job info will be general. I've been working for my current employer for nearly a decade now and I feel really lucky overall that I have been apart of this company that has given me numerous opportunities for advancement, experience, and a decent wage over the years even without a college degree.

Besides some internal 'internships', I have worked as a customer-facing IT/help desk support for the majority of my time at this company. I have moved up the ranks in this department to essentially be the highest level customer-facing available to customers. But It has always been my long term goal to transition into a higher level non-customer facing role. This finally happened about a month ago when I accepted an internal offer to join a team in a completely different department. I was thrilled to have made it through the difficult interview process and accepted the salary offer without much thought. Now I'm feeling like I should have tried to negotiate.

Here are my overall thoughts and pros/cons:

\- This new position should be a much better work/life balance. I'm going from a position where basically every minute of my work day was managed; to a position where I get to manage my own time. As long as I'm getting my work done and attending meetings, I'm free to leave and come back to my work as I wish. I also only need to be in-office three days a week and work from home the other two week days.

\- My work schedule is more consistent now. I start work between 8-9am Mon-Fri and leave when I'm done with the day (typically 5pm). My previous position had no consistency in scheduling. I could have a nine hour shift put anywhere between the hours of 7am and 10pm including weekends and most holidays.

\- That being said, I am essentially on-call at all times in this new role. The department is global and I've already had some late-night meetings. It remains to be seen just how many hours of work I'm going to be putting in each week (no overtime since I'm salary now).

\- My vacation accrual is going to be the same, but now I am also going to get all holidays off and paid (including the days/week surrounding bigger holidays).

\- Health benefits stay the same (and they are good).

\- This is a huge move in terms of my career. I am getting the title and experience that should really help me further my career if I didn't want to stay in customer-facing roles for the rest of my life. I'm 30 for reference.

\- This position has a significantly higher level of impact on the company than my previous role. This increase in responsibility is as nerve-wracking as it is exhilarating.

\- I'm getting exposed to so many new tools and work flows that I'm having to work myself up from the ground level to be in a place where I will be as efficient in my work as my new colleagues. This was coming from being very comfortably fluent in my previous role.

\- I need to relocate for this new position. I'm being allowed to work completely remotely for the first couple months, but will need to eventually make the move. I really like the area I'm moving from and I'm a bit neutral on where I'm moving to.

Finally, I've been going through mixed feelings about my compensation package. I did the math out and realized it's not as much of an increase than I initially thought. At $32/hour in my previous role, my yearly pay would be $66,420 at 40hrs/week. But there was always overtime. I would estimate that I would work an average of 43 hrs/week while full time in my previous position. Which would make my average yearly income \~$74,000.

I was also on the forefront of being promoted to a supervisor position in my previous department. While I'm not sure how much of a raise that would have come with, 10% was fairly standard from all my previous promotions in that department. Which would have brought me to a yearly income of $73,000 (or $81,000 assuming the 3 hours overtime a week).

My salary in this new role is $79,000. This represents a 20% increase from my ""base"" salary in my previous position, but 7% if I consider the overtime. It is yet to be seen how many hours I'm going to be working a week, but especially considering the on-call aspect, I wouldn't be surprised if I'm still going to be putting in over 40 hours average without getting the overtime.

I've had a couple one-on-ones with my new manager where they have gone over a bit more information regarding yearly raises, bonuses, and what promotions look like. Raises come close to the end of the year, but they think I may be getting a lower percentage than normal because of my increase from my previous position I already got coming in. They did not elaborate on what a bonus would look like besides that it was tied into the team meeting deadlines and my own contribution. My previous position gave a couple thousand in RSUs as a bonus each year. There are a couple of promotions I can get in the future that don't actually change my job title, but just mean that there's more expected the higher the level of promotion.

I am getting \~$15,000 as a sign-on/relocation package. Some of that will be in the form of reimbursement for expenses, but the majority of it is cash deposited to my bank account.

This ended up being much longer than I intended and I really just wanted to get my thoughts out in writing. This new position comes with so many changes to my life and I keep getting swings of emotions about it all. Would love any guidance on navigating it. Did I make the right move?"

Just wanted to share a little success story that might encourage others. At nearly 39 years old, I just got offered a paid internship at a big company (with a 95% conversion rate to regular employment after).  I have a PhD in philosophy (ethics, philosophy of religion), but wasn't able to secure a permanent (TT) position in academia after three years post-PhD and decided for the sake of my family to settle down and try something else. I've always been interested in computers and programming and have several friends who are developers, and I needed something that could make decent money fairly quickly without a degree, so this seemed an obvious (if not the only real) choice.

I learned from The Odin Project, which I heard about from this sub, along with occasional help from Colt Steele's Udemy bootcamp. I didn't make it all the way through, but finished the foundations and made it through the first few react lessons (thankfully, the company doesn't use react, but Lit, so they only asked about general javascript knowledge). I have two young kids and have been the primary caregiver the past few years. I started working on this path in earnest in January 2022, and have only been able to work on average 10 hours per week (I tracked how many ""pomodoros"" weekly dedicated to programming work).

If/when I get hired on for real, I'll try to post something with more substantive advice/thoughts, but I'll say for now that networking is super important.  More important than a great portfolio or personal site (which I don't have). There are so many people out there who are better than me and have worked longer. But I am very close friends with someone who works as a team lead at a company that has an apprenticeship program more or less dedicated to hiring people from bootcamps or making a late career change, and he put my resume in for consideration and advocated for me. (I even tried for the same position in October but didn't get it that time and was able to try again.) Now I am officially an apprentice front-end engineer.

So: don't give up, don't feel bad if you can only work an hour or two per day (just try to make a little progress whenever you can), and try to make whatever connections you can."

132ch65,2,2023-04-28,Forced Career Move - PP and/or Group Practice,bpank13,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/132ch65/forced_career_move_pp_andor_group_practice/,"Hey all! 

I would love to get some thoughts on an issue I am experiencing. The group I work for is planning on closing the therapy services and focusing on med management. I will therefore no longer have a job come the end of August. It's a bit more complicated because I am paid by the hour and may lose my health insurance if I dip below a certain number of hours, which could happen as I am already informing my clients as to what is happening because I think it's fair to them. I would not blame them for finding someone else now, even though most want to follow me. 

The way I see it, I have three options:

1. Start a PP without applying for job while riding the current job out to the end of August
2. Apply for new job, leave current job, and  also start PP
3. Only apply for jobs and wait to open PP later.

For context, my ultimate goal is PP treating eating disorders. I graduated in September 2022, am currently a professional counseling associate, have an MBA, and have a ton more life/work experience than I should at 36 that has helped me in my therapy work. I have been seeing 20-25 people per week for almost two year (I was able to see a full roster while in school because I was not working outside of internship). I am privileged in that I could take a dip in income for several months if I decide to go all in on PP.

Any thoughts, advice, or recipes for cookies to help me feel better about what is happening are welcome. Grateful for this community!"

I got a certification in high school regarding networking and network operations.. 

I have 1 year of service desk experience (internship)and 8 months of servers, network experience (internship)..

I was thinking of doing a cybersecurity or cloud computing graduate certificate with co-op.. to boost my resume and gain a extra 4 months of experience in other fields. What's your advice?

What would be my next step to achieve the position junior system administrator?"

I am not really interested in working in data science as a career path and up to now have been more software minded. I do some data science work with my internship, but otherwise am not fully invested. Instead of a big data course, I can take an open-ended CS graphics course that is a really popular class that I know I would enjoy. I don't want to do anything in the future with it, though, so it would be more of a fun course to take. Does the importance of a Big Data course outweigh a more fun course? Both apply for the same credit."

132elhk,194,2023-04-28,Succeeding as a Student,Antique-Jeweler6532,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/132elhk/succeeding_as_a_student/,"I work for a big well-known university and I interact with hundreds of millenials and Gen Z kids. New cohort every year. It is impossible to overlook or ignore the fact that a huge swath from this population lack basic coping mechanisms and resiliency. I would say about 1/3 of our students regularly miss deadlines without an explanation or concern, with no fear of penalty (academic standing, probationary measures, termination), and readily expect accommodations. Many of them seem incapable of basic norms of propriety. For instance, PhD students (age 21+) starting formal emails with, ""hey"" or ""hi"" as if we are all going to the pub after class.

To be clear, the following greetings are all fine: ""Hi Professor Smith"" or ""Hello Professor"" or ""Hello Steve (if the professor introduced himself by name)"" -- all of this is fine and dandy.  I personally smile when students write to me with ""Hi Steve"" because it shows they are comfortable enough to talk to me like an equal. However, here is an example of what I see instead:

""hi, i wasn't able to do my homework last night due to a bad cold i caught, im sorry but i will turn it in very soon, thanks""

or ""hey, sorry about missing class today, i had to help my family with something""

I'm no carping marm for ""Dear Sirs or Madams"" but even a \[Hello NAME comma\] would suffice.

Getting into a good school is only a small part of the battle. What you do with your time while enrolled is so much more important than the name drop of an Ivy League. I have seen thousands of students through to graduation. Many do fine in their classes but nonetheless squandered their time focusing on all the wrong things. They did not show professionalism, initiative, drive. Grades do matter especially if you plan to pursue a career in academia (grad school, post-doc, faculty), but of equal or greater importance is whether or not you are conscientious: does your every day thinking take into account how you are perceived and how you can improve? do you exhibit clear values, commitment, respect? do you care about the people who are there to help you? the secretary, the program director, your advisor? do you even really acknowledge that they exist?

Look for opportunities to take on projects under faculty supervision. Even if it's as simple as doing a research reading assignment and meeting only once per month to gather feedback and ask questions.   This can turn into an internship, research assistantship, teaching assistantship, letter of recommendation, co-authorship.

Think beyond your petty grievances and study the moving parts! the big machine in which you are now a part. Are you there as grit and grime? or are you part of the legacy  to keep the flame of knowledge and self-edification glowing.

I would share ""tricks"" to increase chances for admissions, but the really good ones never use the backdoor!

\*This post is edited to clarify my point regarding email etiquette. I am \*not\* issuing any moral imperative. I do not think people \*should\* talk in any particular way. However, I am saying that common sense informs most of us to choose to collaborate with people who speak to us in a mature, respectful manner.  When professors choose to take on students as collaborators this directly impacts their publication timelines and their grant fund status (grant proposals include research assistant lines, the principal investigator has to outline the scope of work the student will do and the results are reported to close out time and effort reporting). Who faculty choose to work with has a real financial and reputational impact on the professor. My post is not about grammar and manners, folks. Faculty with federal funds and publications on the line are simply \*NOT\* going to work with the student who communicates like a child. Sorry that the truth is upsetting so many people but please try to imagine whether this student can write a grant proposal to NSF or a co-authorship publication to a national journal. If all the clues we have to make that assessment is a poorly written email and a generally immature attitude, the educated guess would be no, and we would choose the professional and cordial B-grade student over the sullen impertinent A+ student.

We do not go to school in order to graduate. We go to school in order to test ideas, refine our attitudes, and forge professional relationships."

(Internships, class size, etc.)",DarkB0B_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/132emkw/is_it_better_to_go_to_a_university_or_a_private/,"Decision day deadline is coming up and I don’t know how to decide. My 2 top choices are either going to Portland State University or Lewis and Clark college. I’m not sure what to go for. I’ve gotten multiple grants and scholarships and with that I can go to Portland State basically for free. For Lewis and Clark I would have to pay $6k/year for tuition. In terms of money I’m leaning more towards the university.

Lewis and Clark gave out like 4 or 6 computer science degrees last year according to college factual. PSU has gave out much more (211 degrees last year). PSU is supposed to be #2 in Oregon for computer science. So far this leans me more towards going to Portland State. 

But for such a big university I’m sure the classes will be a huge and packed with people. If I go to Lewis and Clark getting help from the professors would be much easier because I’d be in a class with like less than 10 people. I also loved how beautiful the campus was there which is why at the same time I want to go to Lewis and Clark instead. But at the same time what if I don’t like the 5 other classmates with me? In a big classes there’s many different people I could ask for help understanding something but in a very small class I have to hope one of those 5 are friendly/helpful.

Another thing is internships. I’m assuming getting an internship in a University would be much more simple and easy than a small private college.

Really I would just love to hear some advice from people here who are in their school right now or graduated in comp sci and what you think."

I'm not very proficient but I have tried my hands at Django, React and Postresql, tried MERN stack too ( I didn't really stick with it but if you asked me to build a simple demo app using one of the stacks I will know how to go about it) 

I graduated with a BA last year and I've applied for MS in Computer science at a few unis in the UK ( since the UK has a lot of masters programs in CS for non-cs undergrads like me )


now I heard from a few of my friends from the UK that they hire only people who have experience, especially in DevOps and how finding internships in the UK is harder since there are a lot of international students applying for the same job posts.

so my question is :

Let's say I managed to grind through and get certs in Azure Fundamentals, or any one of the associates certification. Would the fact that I had no previous industry experience affect my job prospects? Can I apply for entry level jobs?"
132fz7z,6,2023-04-28,"Potential opportunity to transition from HelpDesk to a DevOps / Junior developer role, how to leverage?",yuhyuhyuhAYYY,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/132fz7z/potential_opportunity_to_transition_from_helpdesk/,"Basically the title. How can I best leverage my resume and interview talking points going from a traditional level 1 (and sometimes 2) HelpDesk role to a junior developer / DevOps role?

Little background, I completed my final course in college where I completed a coding project for a company in our city to create a web page doing some cool stuff. I got 1st place in a class of 40, implemented some features that I drew inspiration from Azure/Microsoft Defender, and hosted the entire thing on AWS while configuring things like S3, a CDN (which the company loved), Route 53, etc.

Aside from the Information Systems major and Information Security minor I am about to graduate with, my only experience is an ""IT Intern"" role I have held since June of 2021. The company I am with (company A) right now seems like they want to hire me full time after I graduate, so I am not in a dire need of a new job. But, the  college company I completed the project for (company B) reached out to me saying they loved it so much that they want to set up an interview. 

Below are basically the things I was doing while I stayed as an IT intern. For the most part, I acted as the level 1 HelpDesk guy and got a lot of exposure in just about everything IT:

* Operated in a Helpdesk ticketing system, closing more tickets a week assigned to me than were created, and have very solid resume type statistics I can say.
* Documented everything I could. We have a department IT OneNote notebook, where I documented *everything*. I am the type of guy that doesn't remember what I did to fix a random obscure issue months ago, so I documented that. I heard that was important in the software field?
* *VERY* limited experience with PowerShell, mostly automating really simple things that I found cumbersome to do on a weekly/daily basis. 
* The (for the most part) sole person responsible for user onboarding/offboarding and device provisioning/decommissioning. When HR submits a ticket to the helpdesk about a new employee, to their IT orientation, to their offboarding, I was responsible for everything in between.
* Troubleshooting an in-house built application hosted on our Azure tenant that \~200 users use daily. Additionally, making sure the systems and the program itself was operational and available 24/7.
* Some level 2 analyst and engineer experience with tickets relating to networking (DHCP, DNS, AD, etc.). Emphasis on *some* experience as this only really happened about once a month. We had a level 2 guy that normally handled this, but he would let me have some creative freedom and handle ones that were pretty beginner friendly. 

I know this is an IT subreddit, but I would really appreciate any insight or advice on this as I am sure some people here have either successfully transitioned to a software role, or came from a software role. Another thing I can say right now for a fact is that Company B would *absolutely* pay me far more than Company A would."

Due to some family stuff I have to move back home (middle east) for a few years after I finish my bachelors in Computer Science (Canada). I am currently a junior, and will have about a year of experience from internships by the time I graduate. One of those internships is at a Big N.

My country has basically 0 tech companies and I don't want to lose my progress in the field, so I was thinking of working remotely for an EU based company if possible. I must also mention that I will be able to relocate to the EU for 2-3 months every year, which I can use to work in person if required. 

One thing to point out though, I don't really need much to live. I think 1.5-2k USD per month should be more than enough for me and my family. The one thing I really care about though is WLB. The more flexible the hours the better. 

I am a Canadian citizen if that makes any difference. 

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions, and I appreciate all your help in advance.

I know a lot of people have had bad experiences with them or are just against them in general but it seems like my only option right now. 

Ive heard that synergisticIT gets higher paying jobs, and you can choose where you’ll be located, but the 10,000 upfront is a lot I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do that, and also the 6-8 months training is a long time and would cut into my fall semester coming up if I started this summer. 

Then I’ve heard revature doesn’t make you pay them, and they pay you minimum wage actually, which is nice, but I’ve heard that their training is 2 years, and you can’t choose where you will be located, which just seems insanely inconvenient unless I’ve got that wrong. 

Then ascension I’ve seen most people just say is a straight up scam. 

Are there any other companies like this? Ones that are better for the things I’ve listed about these three?

Also here is my background a bit if anyone is curious. Basically the reason I am considering one of these companies:

I’m a senior who will be graduating this fall, in December 2023. I was supposed to graduate this spring, but I put off graduation and took an extra semester so I could have one more summer to get an internship, because I wasn’t able to get one for any other past summers, and I wanted to have at least one before graduating (I have no internships, no experience, no personal projects, only school). 

I’ve been applying for about 5-20 internships every single day without compromise for the past 2 years, so it’s been multiple thousands. At first I only applied to the ones in my area but for the last year and a half I’ve been applying for ones all over the country, paid and unpaid, small and large companies, remote and in-person, and haven just been applying to everything I see. and would be willing to take out a loan and live in my car or something to do an unpaid in-person internship in a different state. I just need something. 

I’ve also updated my resume many times after taking advice from the career center at my school, from HR people I know personally, from Software people I know personally, from this subreddit, from 3 different discords focused on this stuff, including the one for this subreddit. 

So with thousands of applications and a resume that’s been thoroughly reviewed and approved of by this subreddit, my school’s people, and people in the industry, I’ve had about 5 or 6 interviews, 2 of which were technical.  

It’s very sad for me because I don’t know anyone else personally who has had this experience. The people in my peer group who always ask me for help with projects, 10+ people off the top of my head who are of equal or lesser skill level, all either have had internships, or have one lined up for this summer, and all of them also have job offers for once they graduate. I don’t understand it seems like I’m just unlucky but this is like supernatural levels of unlucky especially looking at the others in my classes. I’m wondering, could answering the demographics questions saying I am a white male be somehow hurting my chances? I don’t know what else it could be."

Greetings to all,

I would like to share my current situation with you and seek reassurance. I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science in December 2021. Due to the pandemic, my internship opportunities were canceled, and I struggled to secure a job after graduation. As a result, I focused on freelance work and took up three web development contracts to hone my skills. These projects primarily involved React and APIs, among other things, and I have been working hard to improve my abilities.

Despite applying for numerous jobs and refining my resume and portfolio, I have faced a slew of rejections. I even reached out to recruiters and alumni but to no avail. As the market for junior developers became increasingly competitive, I started to lose hope.

However, I recently received a breakthrough - I was offered a job as a Wordpress developer. Although it's not the Software Engineering job I was hoping for, the CEO was impressed with my freelance work and hardcoded solutions. The company has plans to expand into app development, which presents opportunities for growth. They have also offered to pay for any courses that would help me develop my skills further. The starting salary of 60k in a LCOL area, and my wife's job as a teacher, will make us financially comfortable.

While I should be excited, I'm feeling bittersweet about the situation. I've had my fair share of mental breakdowns, quit drinking, and struggled with waking up in the morning. Strangely, I'm going to miss the moments of stress when I was hopeful of landing a Software Engineering job.

Do you have any advice for me?

To give some background, I have been subbing since January 2022. I began long-term subbing right away for one school in particular, where I was previously an instructional assistant. The principal requested me for three separate long-term assignments, all which I accepted. From there, I built up a good rapport and reputation with all staff members. I became the most requested sub at this site. During this time, I let the principal know of my school plans and that I was interested in working for the school. She was happy to hear, and let me know that she was hopeful in hiring since a new school is being built. It will be larger, requiring more teachers to be hired.


This is the part where things take a turn. For reference, I am located in California. I go to our local job fair where the principal told me to go find her to turn in my resume and be interviewed. After following up with her, she basically told me due to my intern status and not having my credential, it’s not likely that she can hire me. I have all my CSET’s passed and am currently enrolled in a credential program, as well as intern eligible. The only things I’m missing are my RICA and CalTPA’s. I was pretty bummed, but still had hope.

Recently, a teacher mentioned to me about my name being brought up when the principal was discussing school numbers and open positions. Then, as of yesterday, this teacher said the principal mentioned my name again. This time, it was to say that I won’t be getting a position due to not having my credential. Later on, another teacher says “so a little birdy said you won’t be teaching next year.” After that, I knew I was out. While this bummed me out, I’m more bothered by the fact that she didn’t keep communication open with me regarding this and hasn’t been very transparent. Also, the fact that she did not tell me this herself. I had to hear it from others. 

While I understand not having my credential is probably the main issue, I still feel pretty blindsided and that I was played this entire time. It really seemed as though I had a shot. I have heard this district accepts interns. I do not feel entitled or that I am owed this opportunity, but I have worked hard and done my best to prove time and time again that I am capable. At this time, I feel that I was just useful for their convenience and that I was good enough as just a sub.


I would like to know your thoughts because I am just feeling pretty lost right now."

I found a job which suits me really well.
Only downside is that the job is advertised as senior software engineer.

I have a bit more then 2 years of experience after finishing my bachelor in computer science  (plus multiple internships and a 3-year apprenticeship: Ausbildung in Germany - but as those don’t count I stand at ~ 2 YoE). 

So I know I am not a senior. And I don’t want to make the impression, that I am overselling myself. On the other hand have I never found a job that matches my skills as good as this one.

Would you still apply?
I don’t want to waste anybody’s time."

I'm not working and plus I moved back with my parents for the summer so I don't have any responsibilities and I have a lot of time to prep. 

I already know Python, OOP in Java ( I have also made a small board game), HTML and CSS. 

I have 2 projects in mind excluding the personal portfolio website. 

I did some research and I will need to learn JS + ReactJS, a database program, AdobeXD for designing, Data Visualization software, and Data Extraction Software.

I want to make a plan for the summer so that I can complete all of these during the summer. 

I will be doing 2 leet code questions per day so that sums to around 250 questions completed by the end of summer which is when I'll be applying for internships.

So, I want to work on my project while learning all of this, because I feel this is a lot to learn and will take a long time to complete. Is this a good idea, or should I learn everything and then make the project? By when should I approximately aim to complete learning the technologies and how much time should i leave for me to work on my final projects?

I am still not sure how to network with recruiters on LinkedIn so any advice is appreciated."

I don’t mean to sound in any way prideful or ungrateful, but I’ll just cut to the chase. I have a returning offer for an engineering internship at a lesser-known company (I interned there last summer), but I would like to know, does it matter what company you intern at in terms of building experience for future careers? This is a company that’s local to my home city and is although somewhat nationwide, is not very well known, and I obtained this internship originally through a family member connection (didn’t have to do much to get in). Although I got some pretty good work experience and learned a decent bit, (this is probably imposter syndrome speaking), I feel like I didn’t earn it. Should I be concerned, or take this lucky advantage I got and run with it? In addition, how can I maximize what I get out of an internship like this?"

132o4xg,2,2023-04-29,"Out of Work Since Jan 2022 and Don't Understand Why (Long Story, Please Bear With Me)",TheAngryRussoGerman,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/132o4xg/out_of_work_since_jan_2022_and_dont_understand/,"I've been working in my career field since I was 18, starting my freshman year in college. I was hired quite quickly, while studying pre-med, to be a business intelligence engineer at a regional bank, per the recommendation of another employee who was a classmate of mine and was familiar with my extensive programming background. After a year of being there doing ETL, software engineering, and other data engineering functions, my mentor, the BI Architect stormed out of the office after being refuse a LoA to care for sick family in India. I was then promoted to her role where I stayed for another 3 years. During my time there I would routinely be called a child and was denied a raise or bonus every year because ""you're just a college student. The quality of your work and workload don't matter. You should be thankful I'd even employ someone your age at a position that reports directly to the CFO"". I took it in stride, but I was only getting $50k. The people who worked under me as BI engineers were getting 100-150 each with significantly less work, less executive visibility, and zero  need for making regular presentations to the Board of Directors, like I did. Eventually I grew tired of the abuse. I was working 60 hour weeks while taking between 24-29 credit hours at Uni. I was literally signed into work and working through class, getting up early every day, weekday or weekend, to run data loads and make sure they were accurate even though I'd automated it all and automated validation. My boss demanded I do it. This was my role when I was an engineer and the architect did not do it, yet even after I was promoted and new engineers were hired, he still made me do it.

I was then poached by a pair of small business sister companies That 4 of my friends from Uni worked at. I was offered a 50% raise. I was conflicted about doing it, but resentful for how I was treated. I told my boss about it and he said he wouldn't match the salary and to leave. That night I got a call on my personal cell from the CFO who said if I stayed, he'd double my salary, ensure I was never called a child again, and would received raises and bonuses as my work qualified me for. Unfortunately, I didn't believe him and had already accepted the new job. I then became the Director of Development at one company and the Database Architect at the other. I quickly found out that the job I was hired for wasn't at all what I was told it'd be and ended up having to trash a massive amount of my predecessor's work, which was completely unusable. Entirely on my own, I created a JavaScript framework to suit my needs and wrote a complex web application, Node.JS backend, and a set of iOS/Android/Windows apps using the Microsoft UWP, as well as the necessary underlying database. Everything was tested thoroughly and documented not only inside the code, but in the AzureDevOps wiki where I also kept my repos. This took me a year and a half to do as I had no web development experience, much less web apps, and I had to program extremely complex mathematics like Rasch analytics that was used for objectively assessing a student in any field, on any criteria, using pre-input questions, and a set of multiple choice answers. It was primarily a medical research company, as was the sister company. At the sister company, I consolidated their 9 individual MySQL DBs into 3 and gave them a prod, test, and dev environment, which they didn't have as they did everything in prod.

5 minutes after deploying all my work, which was months ahead of schedule, I was called into the owners office and fired for ""missing all deadlines"". I was in tears, but didn't fight back, collected my stuff and left. A bit over an hour later, I received a recording from one of my now-ex-coworkers with a 34 minute rant from the owner's wife about how she ""fired the f@gg0t and god's gonna bless the company now"". They hired an intern to replace me with zero experience. The intern promptly deleted the ADO wiki and repos, not knowing what they were, created a new environment for her to work in, the deployed the environment into dev, stage, and prod, completely wiping my work from the company. I had a copy, of course, but I didn't give it to them. They also denied me unemployment and told the unemployment office I was fired for ""being sexually aggressive with coworker"", and ""missing all my deadlines"". Since I did not mention this already, they had fired the other gay guy in the office 2 weeks before me and used the same excuse. I had never brought up my sexuality to them before, but all my coworkers had their partners over for lunch one day and of course my college friends were also friends with my boyfriend and brought him along without checking with me first, which effectively outed me and cost me my job. Back on topic, the company was sued by the unemployment office for falsifying my separation documents, as I was happy to send them the recording I was given, and the company is now long since out of business. It may well be the one time karma did anything for me in my life.

I then got a job at the University I graduated from as a professor of computer science and I did that for a few years. While doing that, I was hired to be a software engineer by a consulting company. After 3 months of working there, I completed a huge project in python, creating a behavioral driven development framework. Prior to this, the company employed thousands of QA devs, all they did was write tests for business admins all day, every day. The process was complex and extremely wasteful, with the BAs writing multiple pages for each and every test. My framework condensed this process into the BAs having to only write a handful of sentences in basically plain english, saving a ton of time. Cigna was so happy, they gave me any position I wanted and I wanted to be a data architect again.

Cigna then put me in as the Lead Data Architect for their opioid data. I did that for a year and a half before having a fight with management. they wanted me to falsify data to help them win a lawsuit against a group of doctors. I refused, as did my team, and I ended up leaving the Cigna account. I stayed at the same consulting company and went to work for the State of Puerto Rico as the lead data architect for their disaster recovery efforts and I stayed there for 2 years. I then decided to move to Washington and got approval from everyone at the project. Unfortunately after I moved, the project then revoked my relocation authorization despite having no authority to do so. I tried to fight it as it was a clear act of retaliation for a complaint I put in, but in the end, it's at-will employment. They also attempted to deny me unemployment, which was during the covid period, and successfully did so for 1.5 years. In the end, I got before a judge and the judge sided with me, but refused to give me the bonus money that everyone else got from the state and feds. I had a court date for that money too, but they waited till 5 days before the hearing to tell me and scheduled it for when I was in Louisiana for my father's funeral. I called to reschedule and they said they did it, but turns out they didn't and the courts called me a no-show and denied me.

For the next year and a half, I was unemployed despite countless apps and interviews. During that time I worked as a freelancer and a contractor. I specifically worked on COVID data. I've talked about  my work there before on this sub, but it doesn't go over well, so I'm not gonna rehash it. I picked up a lot of other temp jobs during that time, mostly working with medical data. I also went and got a MicroMasters in Machine Learning cause I felt like AI/ML was my weakest skills in the field.

I then got a job at another consulting company. I mostly worked as a data architect in medical research during that time. I was then caught up in the mass layoffs.

Since then, I've put in quite literally thousands of applications. Sometimes I get callbacks and surges in interviews, sometimes I got months without hearing a word. I've had truly infuriating experiences with hiring managers and recruiters. For example, I had a job set up by a friend at his employer and when I talked to the recruiter, he asked about my experience with a number of different technologies. Being a microsoft shop and me being a microsoft specialist, I had significant experience with all of them. 7-12 years, depending on which one it was. The recruiter then told me things like ""well it's a shame you don't have any experience with them. We can't hire you without experience with them"".  I tried over and over to explain I do, , but I got nowhere. I had an interview with a major league baseball team recently and I was repeatedly told by the recruiters I was their top candidate. First thing out of the CTO's mouth when she she's my face is ""oh, you're just a child. You couldn't possibly have any experience."" She made off-hand comments about my age throughout the interview. Later I was rejected for ""not having experience working without a team"" even though we addressed that in the interview where I explained multiple times that I primarily work without a team.

&#x200B;

At this point, I'm at a loss on what to do. It's infuriating. I have no black marks on my history, numerous glowing references, 6 degree (4 undergrad, 2 masters) with 3 minors and a new grad program in Music at Berklee I'm currently pursuing. I have excellent interpersonal skills (though I can come across wrong on text by accident). I've had my resume reviewed by countless professionals, who have mostly left the resume alone, as they're happy with it. Minor changes have been made in things like order and arrangements. I've been through numerous interview training programs to evaluate how I present myself and my experience. I've been told I'm doing things the way I'm supposed to, that I'm presenting myself well, as experienced, capable, as excited to to bring my experience to the team and learn new things from them. Minor changes were made here and there, but that's it.

At this point, I have to find a job in the next 5 week or I will be homeless. I'll lose my pets. I've already stopped being able to fill my cancer medications. Medicaid won't cover them.

&#x200B;

I'm currently weighed down from over $1 million in medical bills from when someone attempted to murder me for being bisexual in 2016. It left me with chronic pain problems that I have to pay for out of pocket as medicaid won't cover any pain clinics around here, nor the medications (fentanyl patches). I'm also paying the overwhelming majority of the $3200 rent for my house, plus another $600 a month in internet and utilities. My ex/roommate is supposed to split it with me evenly, but he hasn't done so in at least a year, claiming I ""owe"" him money for this and that, but he can't ever explain what it all is. I'm struggling. Hard.

&#x200B;

I don't understand what's going on at all. I know I have a history of kinda rolling over and taking the punches and I'm working on fixing that, but whatever is happening to me with these job apps is utterly beyond me.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I've been asked for a TL;DR. I don't think it's a good idea or that I can capture the essence and humanity of this with one, but I'll try. The only thing I will say is that the context to all this is absolutely critical to understanding, so I'd still ask you read it before commenting. I put a lot of effort into this:

TL;DR Drowning in medical bills from my own attempted murder, roommate won't give me his share of rent, freelance and contract work pay is completely insufficient even though I'm doing it all the time, been fired for being bisexual twice with no recourse, got ""laid off"" in retaliation for filing a complaint against management who was breaking tons of federal laws, got caught in covid mass layoffs too. I've got 12 years experience, 6 degrees, 3 minors, and another masters in progress at Berklee right now. I've got a bunch of glowing, powerful references trying to help me, and I've never lost a job for doing something wrong. To the contrary, I've completed a number of large projects that thrilled my clients (I'm usually a consultant) and they give me whatever promotion I want and demand my employer keep me on their projects. As a freelancer I've also completed huge projects, published data and scientific papers, etc. I've made a strong name for myself and I'm known widely throughout the community in a positive way. Howrver, I have been unable to get a job for over a year. I've had recruiters who do truly bizarre things that aren't even remotely accurate and I've been in numerous interviews with hiring managers and other higher-ups who constantly make age comments at me. Some even call me a ""child"" directly and deny my experience despite my references and projects that they simply ignore when I present them. I've done lots of profession interview and resume pre and training and I seem to be doing exactly what I'm supposed to. I also make friends everywhere I go that have stuck by be throughout the years, but have been unable to help me land a job."

132ps9d,2,2023-04-29,Need advice,neemae,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/132ps9d/need_advice/,"First of all sorry for my bad english since it’s not my native language.

I've been working closely with 1 coworker (we are both females) for the last 3 years. She is 4 years older than me so I look up to her as an older sister. Just a little head's up: We are software developers and she doesn't know how to code. I don't understand how someone with several years of experience in the field doesn't know how to code. 

In the first year of working with her (I was a new graduate at that time), we did't have a supervisor working closely with us and since she is 1 level higher than me, she was assigned as my mentor. Programming is my hobby and part time job since highschool so there wasn't a problem when she was not actually teaching me anything and I thought she was very busy. When we started working in a project, she always gives her assigned tasks to me and I didn't hesistate to help her because she was very busy with other stuffs like meetings, speech competitions, and organizing company events. 

I just noticed that something was wrong when we were already in the middle our project. At that point, everything in the project was done by me. When we report our progress to higher ups, it was always implied that we do the tasks ""together"", and since I was the new one, it looked like I can't do things on my own. I tried testing her after I realized this by refusing to help her in some of her tasks. Finally, she video called me to force me to help her (we work remotely btw). In this call, I thought her how to ""call a function"" - the most basic thing a programmer should know. I didn't know what to feel and what to do after that call. She is a very kind person so I didn't want to report her to the bosses. I thought the best solution was to teach her how to code but she was very offended by this idea (because she is 1 level higher than me) so I just let her be and I stopped doing her assigned tasks.

In our second year working together, the senior who's giving tasks to us started noticing her lack of skills (because i stopped helping her). I thought that he will do something about it, but apparently he might have also thought that ""she is a very kind person"" and it will be too harsh if she was called out. So his solution was to give all the development tasks to me, and only give her tasks like documentations and adding comments. I was so fed up so I requested to transfer to another team and my reason was ""i don't like the project I'm currently in"" even though I love that project so much. My request was denied but I was promoted so now we are in the same level of position.

In my third year, a supervisor was assigned to work closely with us. This guy is a misogynist so my working environment became worse. Last week, she was expecting to be promoted as a senior software developer. But because of our new supervisor, she wasn't promoted and she cried the whole day. Most of our coworkers also hates our current supervisor and they know that he is misogynistic so they easily sided with her. Only me, that supervisor (not sure?), and that one senior knows her lack of skills.

She asked me if she really didn't have any contributions. I didn't have the guts to be frank with her because she was crying so much. She did have contributions but those were documentations which interns can do and mostly organizing and hosting company events. She told me a while ago that our coworkers advised her to set a meeting with the bosses. And since I'm the one working closely with her, she requested for me to join the meeting and help her convince the higher ups that she deserve a promotion.

So what should i do now? 🥲 I just want to code peacefully."

In college, at least you can study with your roomate, or at least be out in the world more. Highschool is like prison. Its your whole world. In college theres alot more options. You can study at a cafe, on campus, at the library, or just anywhere. At highschool, I can only study alone at my house. Highschool is just filled with immature teenagers. Highschool also has miserable teachers, which makes us miserable too. Theres so much worrying and anxiety if youre even going to get into the uni you want to get into. I know college people worry about if theyre going to get their degree, but at least they at least got there in the first place.

Im so sick and tired of people saying 'enjoy your highschool years' or 'cherish highschool!'. Im sick of it, and it pisses me off so much. Not everyone enjoys highschool man. Not everyone has friends who hangs out with them, calls them and do fun things together. I hate highschool so much and I cant take this anymore. Ive read college people's struggles about jobs, rent, food, expenses, debt, etc. I know the responsibilities you have. But I still prefer it over highschool. Adulthood is like a tradeoff. You get more freedom, but also alot of responsibilities. Id rather have to deal with responsibilities than be in highschool.

Ive also done an internship before and actually enjoyed it. The job wasnt something in my field, but I loved going there. After a while, I felt like I had a place there. I still remember those staff members. I know not all jobs will be fun and sometimes the boss will yell at you, but nothing beats having your own money.

But a few days ago, my school organized a thing where we do a full day of math in a university instead of highschool, so that we can pass our exams(we have the most important exams in our highschool career so far coming soon). When I sat in that lecture room, I already felt at home. When I saw the open space and the campus setting, I just knew this was where I was meant to be. I instantly fell in love with uni even more.

I started preparing for adulthood since last year. Developed a frugal mindset, saved money for over a year now, developed wise spending habits, and only buying things that are actually useful. I dont spend 100s of dollars on clothes and the latest phone like everyone else, because I know I dont need it. Ive also been improving my productivity and study time, currently aiming for 6 hours(my avg study duration is 4h+). I also know the job im going to get into(software engineer) and the major im getting into(computer science).

Please...I really cant wait any longer for college. Theres a whole world out there. I cant wait to be done with highschool. Its so painful and I hate it so much. But I have a whole year left man. This feels like an eternity :("

1. What is the best next step?
2. does my attorney just suck?
3. respondent has barley participated but continually has chance after chance is that because she’s status quo? 
4. Would I not become the status quo if I keep him now? 
5. My son keeps telling me he doesn’t want to go back at all. What do we do!?

Context


My sons mother is an absolute nightmare for him and I and our families to deal with. Her own family has signed affidavits in support of my parenting and she has cut them out claiming they are abusive. 

 Friday I brought emergency motion for intern care and withheld our son from status quo primary care respondent due an accumulation concerns the one the my attorney used for this motion was 52% school year missed or absent and her sleeping through after school pick up of son. Judge “ignored the history of the case”. 

Justice ordered me to return child this Sunday. With speak to date regarding interim parenting returnable June 8. And ordered her to inform me every time he is sick or withheld from school in writing all while he admitted she’s ignored previous orders? 

I am legitimately fearful for child's safety while in presence of primary care respondent as she continues to struggle with her mental health, lives in a hoarding situation rents out child’s bedroom leaving him to sleep on couch or in her bed, actually neglect his basic needs (neighbours signed afidavits CPS certified she just barley meets thier bare minimum requirements) she weaponize his love and manipulates this poor child. He is spending his most formative years in the presence of a sick and terrible influence. 

She made Many documented false allegations against me, proven false in court and I’ve made many documented and substantiated concerns regards respondent's mental health inability to care, inability to provide suitable housing. 

Child openly prefers my care. Child is 5 Y/O offspring of never married never common law but both parents confirmed on BC

My attorney said if I don’t return him he will not continue as my attorney but this seems like an easy win open closed case."

**Schools:** I'm planning on shotgunning \~20 schools so these are only some of them

1. HYPSM
2. Cornell
3. UMich

**Other comments:** I would love some brutally honest advice/rating.

I feel like my profile is weighed down by a lack of leadership/volunteering/volunteer hours, this is partially why I'm struggling with CommonApp essay ideas, I was thinking about writing about the summer program at MSK and how it inspired me to pursue cancer/biomedical research, it has a nice story (my current research for ISEF is also cancer-related) but I heard research generally isn't something you should write about(?) I know essays are really important so I'm kinda worried

If you guys could also recommend any realistic target schools, that would be great. Thank you for the help!"

I struggled hard in Uni cuz I had never done programming before and it took a while for me to 'get it' so I wasn't able to prepare much for jobs. 

So after graduation I grinded leetcode and started creating personal projects with odinproject and Udemy and now I'm pretty confident with leetcode and have a full stack project that I created with a udemy course. I'm still trying to create one on my own though.

I did have an internship with a finance company back in my junior year when covid was rampant. It wasn't a swe internship but I was stoked to even get a tech related internship during covid.  I got super unlucky though and got assigned a task that ended up hitting a roadblock that no one in the company could solve. I barely got to do any coding and coding was done in some block coding kimda stuff so I didn't get much practical experience.

I graduated with a 3.15 gpa and have some collaborative school projects to show as well (game design projects with unity) to demonstrate some experience with SDLC and teamwork

As for the job search I have been connecting heavily on linkedin with recruiters (tryna get to 500+) and applying directly.

I also have a mentor who is a staff engineer at a fortune 100 company helping me out with all this and I know have learned so much even more than what I have learned during the past couple months of grinding and I am seeing progress but it is a bit slow and I have been feeling like I don't really qualify for these positions especially when I see the job descriptions.

So basically the main questions is do you guys think I stand a chance in this job search? Do I even qualify? I really enjoy swe and it is my passion but should I look for a job in a different field?


TL;DR
1. Just another guy with a BS in CS looking for an swe job

2. Had a non swe but still a tech related internship but didn't get to do much coding

3. Really grinded leetcode and did projects post grad

4. Connecting heavily on linkedin and spraying and praying with resume

5. Have a mentor helping out but still feel like I do not qualify for SWE positions.

6. Do I qualify or should I look for different positions?"

13346he,1,2023-04-29,"Internship to full-time opportunity, not sure fini should accept",Putrid_Experience586,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/13346he/internship_to_fulltime_opportunity_not_sure_fini/,"Hello all!
I'm looking for some career advice as I feel like I've been shafted. 
I am in the middle of an RA post grad program (in Canada) and looking for an internship/co-op. I've been invited to 2 interviews and one of them canceled on me (really discouraged from the job search). I've been applying on my own, but nothing has come out of that. It's a competitive industry and I knew starting in QA was a possible scenario before starting the program. 

While in the program I picked up a labour job at a food manufacturing plant and asked if it would be possible to join their QA team as a student to complete my hours (it's been approved by the school), they don't have an RA team.

NOW, this conversation has been going on for about a month to 1.5 months (not sure if they're iffy about it or because I had taken a total of 3 weeks off for my studies and exams and didn't have time to chase them around). I had mentioned earlier this month if nothing was going to happen I would like to resign and just aggressively try and find a position on my own because by that time it had already been about 3 weeks since I asked. This week I managed to get some more information as to whats going on with this discussion, a condition has been basically put on this student opportunity now (not sure if this is how they wanted to phrase it, but it's how it sounded to me), they will help me out with the hours I need, but I would need to commit 2 years with the company after. I have a feeling part of the reason for this is because they know RA is my objective and they don't want to just help me out without something in return which is fair, but I do think asking for a 2 year commitment afterwards is way too much just to help me out for an internship/co-op.

So that's all the information I have right now and I plan to ask for a meeting next week to discuss this further, but I'm not sure what to walk in there prepared with. I still need to ask how I would be compensated. I assume it would be either my current hourly rate or a little more because I'd have more responsibilities for the internship/co-op portion (it's just a little bit above minimum wage which is better than what some of my classmates are getting for their internship/co-op).  I'm obviously going to try and ask for market value for the position when the internship ends, but it was mentioned that they may not be able to pay well (not sure if the comment was made because they knew how lucrative RA is compared to QA or if that comment was just because they don't have wiggle room in their budget since they weren't intially looking for an addition to QA). 

The other thing is I'd be walking into a little bit of a hostile environment. Because I'm already on the production floor I know some people don't like QA because they're annoyed being told what to do and what not to do because to them it doesn't make sense to be so careful (like not wearing hair nets in the lunch room) rather than ""oh QA is just doing their job"" and there are a few people I don't get along with just because they are very inconsiderate of people around them unless they are with their work friends. 

I'm looking for advice on this 2 year commitment and if there's anything else I should consider other than compensation. I'm also not sure how aggressive I should be with the negotiations since I still need to complete my internship/co-op to graduate and I think they're kind of waving that in my face. The reality is if I were to reject and leave I could still end up in another QA position not paying anymore than what I'm paid now, but I'm not confined to a company if I end up not liking the company. 


TL;DR: asked my current company for an internship/co-op and they are coming back asking for a 2 year commitment for helping me out, is it worth it? Don't have compensation info yet, what else should I consider while negotiating? How aggressive should I be negotiating when I still need the internship/co-op?"
1335qlq,1,2023-04-29,"I’m in my sophomore year of college and I hate it socially, but I have a huge internship planned for next year. What should I do?",TK_Lax16,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1335qlq/im_in_my_sophomore_year_of_college_and_i_hate_it/,"Context: I’m currently finishing my sophomore at my college and am not really happy. Academically everything is going well, but socially it’s been a complete nightmare. 

I’ve had my main group of friends in my grade completely ruined over girl drama, and am now only friends with about 4 of them with only one of them being close. The problem with this though is that with the exception of that one friend, everyone one of them in my grade is anti social and introverted. I’m the opposite: I’m as extroverted as can be. I wanna go out and live it up every weekend (parties, bars, getting wasted, etc) while their ideal weekend is staying in and watching movies. 

For the longest time I could live with this as I had another group of friends that go out and do all that. The problem with that group is that they’re all upperclassmen, meaning most if not all of them are gonna be out of her by the end of this year. 

My biggest complaint of where I am right now is that it’s socially not cutting it. Now I know college is about academics and getting an education. But I also want to have some fun. My college right now has NO school spirit whatsoever. Nobody goes to the games, nobody really seems excited to be here, etc. 

The clubs are completely non existent. They exist on paper but don’t actually hold any type of events or even meeting. In fact I don’t even get notifications about what they’re doing. I have to track down who the leaders of the clubs are and reach out to them personally and ask if there’s anything going on. In worse cases, I track down the professor who sponsors the club and request they have someone reach out to me. Also, there is no Greek Life where I’m at. 

The past two forms I’ve been in sucked. My freshman year was a complete disaster. Nobody on that floor made an effort to get to know me or my roommate. We were the only ones holding the door open and actively reaching out to kids on our floor only to be ignored. Because of that, my roommate and I have gotten pretty close and are good friends. But we still don’t even know who was on our dorm floor to this day. Fast forward to sophomore year, and the new building we’re in is the exact same problem. Nobody talks to each other or makes an effort to get to know anybody.

Nobody also talks in class. Everyone is just on their laptop or phone keeping to themselves. So because of this, it was mission impossible to find any type of friend group as all ways of meeting people were not viable. 

Furthermore, there’s nothing to do on campus. I’ve seen other places have bowling alleys, lounges, on-campus bars, etc. This school has none of that. So people resort to keeping to themselves in their small cliques. I ask people where they met their friends, and they don’t even remember saying “it just happened”. I ask if they do any clubs and they all say they don’t lol. But I guess it worked out since I have these two friend groups, albeit not ideal and very unstable.  It really makes me upset when I hear my friends from back home fall completely in love with their school and not shut up about it. I don’t have that feeling towards my school right now. 

I considered transferring to another school last year, and still am this year. And this isn’t just some random school I found. In fact, it’s always been on my radar since the college search process. It was actually between that school and this school I’m at right now. I ultimately chose this school though since it was during the pandemic and, since it’s in a whole other part of the country needing a plane to get there, I was afraid of the distance and commute. Anyways, the other school I have in mind SEEMS better. They have more stuff to do on campus, they seem to have a strong community, they seem to be pretty fun. The issue is that this all SEEMS to be the case. Like how I thought this school I’m at right now SEEMED to have all this stuff. My concern is that I don’t want to transfer into the same situation I’m here now. But idk how to determine truth from lie. 

What further complicates all of this is that I have a study abroad opportunity for next year during a semester of my junior year. This isn’t just any study abroad thing though; this is more like co-op in which I’ll be taking classes for about two out of the five days and working in an internship relating to my major and career goals in another city in the US. I’ve been accepted into it but haven’t officially enrolled in it since I’m deliberating all of this. Although it’s a huge opportunity that’s hard to come by, I can’t help but feel what it would be like socially. Will I have fun? Will I be genuinely happy? I’ll be 21 then so I’ll be able to go out, but the issue is will the other kids on this study away trip be as social and as outgoing as me? If not, then I’m gonna be all alone and miserably going out by myself. Or, it could be an incredible experience where I’ll make tons of friends and have a lot of fun while working in internships I’m passionate about. 

The reason why I care so much about all of this, especially the social aspect, is because I worked my ass off in high school. I had lots of sleepless nights doing so much work. I never went out. Most of my memories of high school was non stop work and stress, preparing for college. Telling myself all the experiences and memories I missed out on will be made up for in college. Which is not really happening at this time. I’m currently feeling like I am wasting what is supposed to be the prime of my life away. The treason why I’m thinking of all this is because this school I’m at right now taught me ANYTHING, including the most unlikely events, can and will happen. My paranoia is that no matter what I do I’m gonna get the worst results.

Pretty much, I am completely split over what to do. All I want is just be happy with myself for once in my life. I want to live a college experience I am proud and happy for. Because I’ve already lived many experiences that I am very cynical and bitter about (elementary, middle, and high schools). I really do not want to screw any of this up, so I desperately need some help and clarity. 

TL;DR : I’ve had a pretty disappointing SOCIAL experience at my current college. I’m strongly considering transferring, but this extremely valuable internship I have is being a big reason (among other reasons) why I should stay. Should I stay for the internship, friends, academics, and foundation I’ve already built upon after going through hell for two years? Or should I blow all that up, go to a new school, and hope that it turns out great while risking that it could ultimately backfire."

1335ygu,2,2023-04-29,Should I start applying for new graduate positions as someone w/o internships and is about to graduate by Spring 2024?,0xR001,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1335ygu/should_i_start_applying_for_new_graduate/,"Hey everyone,

I'll be graduating hopefully on Spring 2024, with a BS in CS w/minor in Mathematics, and I'm confused as to where my positions should be at the moment. I want to strongly iterate the fact that **I do not have any internship experiences**, except for a role as a help desk technician and currently as a security officer. If you'd like to see my current resume, it is on my profile, but I can list it [here](https://preview.redd.it/xvdyvpit4u3a1.png) if you want to take a look

I do have certain ideas as to what I'll be doing - first is to try to move to corporate via my current company I'm working for as a guard - they have applications open for juniors and application engineers alike, however I'll need to relocate to them. 

Second is to try to aim for new graduate positions - I'm not seeing a whole lot of these out there, but I've seen some that are available in certain season/time-frame - mostly August-November, please correct me if I'm wrong. I do think that these are my only way to become a full-stack software engineer.

My third option is to apply for graduate schools and continue to work as a guard while going through that process - ideally I'd like to work through industry first before getting a master, but I'm willing to head straight into a master if I need to in case that I can't find any opportunities. Ideally I'll do my master in CS, with specialization in neural network/AI/ML, and then find roles as a ML Engineer. I've applied some AI/ML concepts through learning via my semester-long project, as well as taking couple of classes over the summer, but I'd like to delve deeper and specialize if that's the case. 

So these are my ideal positions I'll be in once I graduate, but I'll need to figure out as to where I'll be going from here on out, especially as the shaky grounds we've had over the past 18 months. Please let me know if there's anything else I should be doing to prepare - I've decided on building a couple of smaller but feature-oriented full-stack projects over the summer w/my classes I'm taking (hence graduating early), as well as trying to learn more on the mathematical sides that I've been lacking (Calculus, Abstract Algebra, etc.). 

TLDR; Current student who is about to graduate in Spring 2024 w/o internships, needing advices on finding roles, or applying to masters."

Let me know if this seems normal/unusual or if you had a similar experience.

**Background:**

* CS degree from University of Waterloo
* May 2023 new grad, started searching fall 2022
* 0 YoE full-time, 2 YoE internships
* Did 6 paid SWE internships (4 months each)
* Did 100+ LeetCode (Blind 75, NeetCode 150)
* Studied system design (I got asked that for new grad)
* Canadian citizen (I'd need TN visa for US)

**Applications:**

* Applied to 300+ jobs on job listings/company websites → 2 interviews (\~300 ghosted/rejected)
* Recruiters messaged me on LinkedIn → 2 interviews
* Asked 20+ connections for referrals → 2 interviews

**Interviews:**

* Company 1: referral → call with recruiter → ghosted (TC \~$70k CAD for new grads)
* Company 2: applied → call with recruiter → interview → rejected (TC \~$100k USD for new grads)
* Company 3 (big N): applied → call with recruiter → interview (day 1) → virtual onsite (2 interviews on day 2) → virtual onsite (4 interviews on day 3) → ghosted → rejected after asking 2 weeks later (TC \~$140k USD for new grads)
* Company 4: message → call with recruiter → rejected (TC \~$80k CAD for new grads)
* Company 5: message → call with recruiter → interview → ghosted (TC \~$80k CAD for new grads)
* Company 6 (unicorn): referral → call with recruiter → interview (day 1) → virtual onsite (3 interviews on day 2) → offer (TC $105k CAD all cash for new grads, WFH with 1 day/week in office)

Almost all of the companies I did my 6 internships at had layoffs or hiring freezes during 2022-2023, so I wasn't able to get any return offers. My last internship company (unicorn) converted previous interns to full-time (TC \~$125k USD base + \~$40k USD illiquid stock + \~$15k USD sign on for new grads), but laid off 14% of its staff and froze hiring for entry level in December 2022 (at the end of my internship).

I was sad after all the rejections, but I'm very grateful that I got an offer in this market as a new grad. I'll likely accept the offer and continue to grind LeetCode/system design while applying for better opportunities as the market improves."

1) i got into pre-science for ACMS and i heard that its rlly hard to get in. Do u guys know acceptance rate for ACMS Data Science track? (Like the website says its about ~25%)

2) if i dont get into acms til junior, which majors  does ppl usually go, like stat major?

3) i saw like requirements to apply to acms and found out that i have to take CSE123/CSE143 and MATH307/MATH308/AMATH351/AMATH352 cuz i got my MATH with AP credit. Does this mean i can start applying to acms from beginning of sophomore year or maybe freshmen year?

4) i know seattle is a decent location for internship and everything but just to make sure, is there a lot of opportunities for Internship? (Does udub also has co-op program? I cant find one)

5) lastly, i heard that majors like this goes to grad school a lot, do many of u guys who are on this are considering grad school or getting a job right after graduation

Thank you"

I do have ADHD and was only recently diagnosed and medicated at about the semester mark, however, that is not something I want people who feel they can answer this question to consider. For a long time, I have had to put in immense effort in school for somewhat mediocre results, in high school, and in college. I have always suspected, and after my first year in the dorms  (sophomore transfer student doing CS) known for sure, that most people do not spend as much time working as I do but are often able to achieve better or similar results. I have fantastic study habits, I make it a priority to get sleep while still making the necessary sacrifices and I use the Pomodoro technique and spaced repetition when applicable (science-based study techniques) and more. After this semester I feel like I have explored nearly all of the strategies and tips and tricks I can apply to perform better without any noticeable difference. This summer I am taking a new approach. If the way I am learning is correct perhaps it is the way my mind explores new topics or thinks critically, I will be reading a few books and researching in hopes of finding a realistic solution. At this point, I have zero free time during the school year. My main qualm is the time I put in does not equal the results I receive. I am ready to accept that my brain is just not suited to tests or classroom learning but I also want to do everything I can to overcome this. A final clarification might be that I do not struggle with coding projects or projects of any kind at all but, I do significantly on tests. In addition, sometimes when doing difficult homework or tests I feel like I just can't dive deep enough into the problem to find a realistic solution, this was especially common in EECS 203 (Discrete Math), it feels like I just have a roadblock to moving forward. I think I lack mathematical intuition which is the reason behind my new approach this summer. As a top student (or average tbh) have you noticed something you do that others don't that has separated you in either the time you spend doing work or your overall performance? Please list any suggestions you have for me or any comments you think would be valuable, even if you believe your reason for being a high performer is simply your natural intuition.

Edit: I am very interested in computer science and engineering as a whole. I'm super excited for my internship this summer and my future as a whole!"

* Applied to 300+ jobs on job listings/company websites → 2 interviews (\~300 ghosted/rejected)
* Recruiters messaged me on LinkedIn → 2 interviews
* Asked 20+ connections for referrals → 2 interviews

**Interviews:**

* Company 1: referral → call with recruiter → ghosted (TC \~$70k CAD for new grads)
* Company 2: applied → call with recruiter → interview → rejected (TC \~$100k USD for new grads)
* Company 3 (big N): applied → call with recruiter → interview (day 1) → virtual onsite (2 interviews on day 2) → virtual onsite (4 interviews on day 3) → ghosted → rejected after asking 2 weeks later (TC \~$140k USD for new grads)
* Company 4: message → call with recruiter → rejected (TC \~$80k CAD for new grads)
* Company 5: message → call with recruiter → interview → ghosted (TC \~$80k CAD for new grads)
* Company 6 (unicorn): referral → call with recruiter → interview (day 1) → virtual onsite (3 interviews on day 2) → offer (TC $105k CAD all cash for new grads, WFH with 1 day/week in office)

Almost all of the companies I did my 6 internships at had layoffs or hiring freezes during 2022-2023, so I wasn't able to get any return offers. My last internship company (unicorn) converted previous interns to full-time (TC \~$125k USD base + \~$40k USD illiquid stock + \~$15k USD sign on for new grads), but laid off 14% of its staff and froze hiring for entry level in December 2022 (at the end of my internship).

I was sad after all the rejections, but I'm very grateful that I got an offer in this market as a new grad. I'll likely accept the offer and continue to grind LeetCode/system design while applying for better opportunities as the market improves."

I plan on majoring in either ECE or Comp sci. Here's a list of pros and cons I came up with:

**Rutgers NB**

PROS:

\- Better known school. Can help with internships(?)

\- I know a lot more people going there

\- Better social life

&#x200B;

CONS: 

\- Almost 2x expensive than NJIT

\- Large classrooms

\- Bad dorms

&#x200B;

**NJIT**

PROS:

\- Got scholarships to make it cheap to go there

\- Smaller and more focused classrooms

\- Known to be a stem-focused school

&#x200B;

Cons:

\- Apparently a ghost town

\- Comp sci professors aren't known to be too good(?)

\- Everyone I know that goes to Rutgers tells me they don't know anyone doing ECE or engineering at NJIT. Could be an unpopular major there(?)

&#x200B;

Again these are what I can come up with. I'm still on the fence between both since they kind of counteract each other. I still don't know whether some of the question marked ones are true or not. I'm mostly concerned with how the ECE program is like in both schools. Thank you!"

It seems like each offer would put my career on entirely different trajectories, so I'm really nervous!

Offer 1: Full time job doing capital operations: run predictive models, analysis of large datasets, statistical analysis and machine learning. Mostly SQL and Python

Offer 2: Internship doing Dev Ops: QA testing, configuration management with cloud technology, and infrastructure automation. 

It seems like the first one would have a balance of technical and business/management work, especially since the degree listed is for finance/economics.

The second one seems more technical, which might be good while I'm young, but it's also only an internship. I also am less familiar with these technologies, but they said it was fine and they'd teach me. 

Overall, I am split 50/50, both teams were great when I met with them and I don't know which to choose. I see myself eventually getting an MBA and entering management, but that wouldn't be for years, maybe a decade. If you were in my shoes, what would you suggest?

I got in as a transfer student for DS @ Cal, SWE @ UCI, and Math + CS @ UCSD. I was just wondering if yall got any anecdotes on getting past the resume screen as a Data Science major that would push me to go to another school.

&#x200B;

I pulled up the first destination data from Cal, and given that a DS major got a SWE job, the median incomes are basically the same as CS/EECS. However, there is a decent discrepancy in the % of graduates going into SWE, and I'm not sure how much of that is just due to disinterest in SWE.

I also already have some experience as an intern at faang (not amazon), among other things, so I wonder if that changes the conversation on the importance of my major name.

&#x200B;

If anyone was wondering, I chose DS because I wanted more Math/ML in my academic studies than anything touching hardware, lol. I just wish there wasn't the whole funding meme for the CS classes in the computational depth requirement, along with certain ML classes being restricted to CS majors(???)."

When it comes to academics, I can actually score well but I was too lazy and had a ""it is what it is"" mentality going into poly. This resulted in a severe dip in my GPA which, I know, is 100% my fault. But still, I want to know if there is even a shimmer of hope for me. I also strengthen my resolve to push for 4 pointer this sem and an A for intern next sem to give me a slight boost (not that it makes any difference)

Prior to making this post, I did some research on a few universities such as SIT, SIM GE, overseas schools etc but non of them really had a clear cut answer. Most requirements are either in their own country's grading system or a grade symbol. I tried looking for blog posts online but most of them was outdated (don't even get me started with overseas schools, virtually no posts or comments).

I'm excited to join r/careeradvice and seek guidance from the community. I'm currently pursuing a masters in computer science and have secured my first tech internship this summer. However, I'm feeling a sense of anxiety and dread towards the corporate environment and work itself. It feels like I'll be giving up my life to be a part of it.

I also find myself asking “what’s the point the point of going through all this school, all this stress, and time burden just to qualify myself to work for someone else? Just to bring profit to someone else when I can do it for myself?”

My thinking comes from my family and personal sphere of influence 

My family owns a construction business, and I have friends who are successful business owners. As a result, I feel conflicted about my career choices. During high school and undergrad, I worked in these businesses and enjoyed being a part of them. I appreciated getting involved in all aspects of the businesses as they grew. Through this process, I discovered that I highly value autonomy, freedom, and am a very independent person who likes to take full ownership and control of my tasks.

I'm now in my mid-20s and am at a point where I want to decide what I'll do for the rest of my life and commit to it- whether it's starting my own business or pursuing a corporate career. However, the people I seek guidance from keep pushing me towards tech because ""it's the future"" and ""it's high paying.""

Interestingly, in several conversations, they've also mentioned that they're happier and earn more than their peers who went into corporate jobs in different domains like Investment Banking, Consulting, and Tech.

I'm at a crossroads now and not sure what to do. I feel like I need more perspective on what corporate life is like and whether it's not that bad or can help me meet my financial and personal development goals.

I would appreciate any and all advice. Thanks in advance!"

After meeting up with a few potential clients, we identified two main paths:

* We worked on short low-code (Wordpress/Shopify) apps for **\~1100USD** with 2 separate clients, each taking around 2 weeks.
* We developed software alongside a startup's CTO and intern with a tech stack. We’ve signed with them a multi-month contract, for **\~1500USD a week**, with us working 20 hours a week each.

From this experience, my team finds full-stack development to be the most worthwhile and interesting, as opposed using Wordpress/Shopify. We’ve also started to market ourselves as an all-rounder, since we offered Design, Management, and Development, rather than just Development since that is why our current client hired us.

**The issue is:** We still have a hard time imagining how we can scale.  While we do plan on increasing our weekly price gradually from **1500USD**; Even at **4000USD/week,** we would only make the average salary for software developers (4000$ \* 52 weeks \* 2 projects / 4 people  = **104,000 USD**). We even thought about taking equity from the companies we worked with, but wanted some thoughts on how else we could scale."

I fortunately received an offer to work with a really small startup in its initial stages as a FullStack Developer (this is like 10-20 people institution) via networking. Since it is a like a small startup in its grassroots levels with no published product, I was little hesitant to accept it. My family and friends are still encouraging to go out and apply there or just do my research with Uni and get other type of job with an established company (you know like cashier etc). However, I am kinda interested in the startup as I think its a once-in-lifetime experience that I can only afford at this point of life and can't take such risks later on when I am more firmly established (like a family person for example). Also, I get to be in the city of my Uni so I can do further work with my Uni (although my research can be remote too tho), and equity/better-leadership in the startup in the slim chance it succeeds. The office is in a big startup hub where I could form better connections with leading established entrepreneurs and learn more. In other words, with startup:-

Pros:-

Good full stack experience for developing a product from ground-up.

If succeeded, might get some form of equity/better-leadership in the startup.

The feel of startup and connections at reputed place.

Cons:-

Not an established company so can't market it as well of an experience like I could as a SWE Intern at other companies.

Not that much money.

Keep applying and hope to get something."
133b0no,51,2023-04-29,I landed a Cybersecurity GRC Analyst Summer Internship! My experience and tips.,EvoZims,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/133b0no/i_landed_a_cybersecurity_grc_analyst_summer/,"Hi everyone,

I read a couple of success story posts of people landing infosec jobs, so I just wanted to provide my input and experience landing an internship if it helps anyone. This is an 'almost' Fortune 500 company from what I know.

Just for some context, I am currently a student and will be graduating with my BS in Computer Information Systems next month. I've also had an IT helpdesk internship for 1 year and tech volunteering experience before this, and have taken a couple cybersecurity courses that my school offered. I do not have any industry-standard certifications but will be working on them soon.

Before I mention my stats, I want to clarify that I've been searching for roles in infosec, software dev, sysadmin/helpdesk, networking, and data analytics. I will only include infosec applications as all of these together would total over 700+.

\# of Cybersecurity Applications: 150+ (September 2022 - March 1st 2023)

* Responses/Callbacks: 5
* Role ""terminated"": 20
* No Contact: Almost all of them
* Interviews: 2
* Offers: 1

Miscellaneous Info:

* I had no connections for this role- no referrals. This was 100% apply and get lucky. I was able to get to HR because my resume was crafted specifically for the role. I included much of the job description I had experience with to beat the app filtering algorithm.
* Most of the email responses or callbacks I received were scams or from fishy organizations.
* I didn't really care about the company I was working for, I just applied everywhere to get interview experience.
* Finding openings was difficult. I learned that although there might be ""thousands"" of cybersecurity jobs, they were mid-to-senior level positions. Almost no one wanted ""entry-level,"" even if the job description said so. You needed at least some industry experience and a decent resume/portfolio showcasing your value to the company and the role you're applying for.
* On the topic of finding jobs, learning the right industry buzzwords was extremely important. Searching ""entry level cybersecurity jobs near me"" wasn't very helpful. It helped to search for Incident Response, SOC, GRC, etc. Every company seemed to have different names for roles and you need to know what they're called. This unlocked more applications for me to look over.
* Where did I look? Linkedin was where I applied for this position, but I've gotten offers via ZipRecruiter, Indeed, or Google and being redirected to the company website.

Instead of giving you basic tips everyone has heard, I'll tell you what they liked about me (I asked out of curiosity):

* Strong experience in public speaking and communication. My hiring manager never looked over my resume actually; he wanted me to be the one to explain what I wanted him to know about me. I told him I'd been a guest speaker at multiple events at school and he asked me to send him a recording of them after the interview since they were on YouTube. He invited me to speak with the CISO of the company immediately after because it impressed him so much. The CISO was curious too so I sent him examples of my school presentations, YT tutorials, and other content I've spent long hours working on. These weren't even cybersecurity related; some were on my Big Data analytics projects or Java OOP talks.
* The interview was very simple. There were few technical questions for the most part. Although the job description noted ""knowledge of PCI-DSS, SOX,...etc"" we never really talked about it. It was mostly a screening of how well I fit in, my personality, my experiences and motivations, why I wanted to work here, etc.
   * My answers were very specific to my experiences at my previous workplace and my involvement in the cybersecurity community (attending conferences etc.). I also mentioned that I was working on certifications such as Net+ and Sec+.
   * I was asked a question about my early experiences in IT. I spoke about how solving problems at home vs. at a corporate level are completely different due to regulations and protocols that must be followed, making some problems more challenging to troubleshoot w/ examples. They liked this answer a lot as it tied into the role of GRC.
* My hiring manager appreciated that I was very enthusiastic about the industry and have spent a lot of time learning about it on my own time. He said that my growth mindset and desire to learn was a huge plus- they wanted someone who meshed well with their team and was also passionate about their role.

Final notes and critical things I learned:

* Networking is massive. The best places to network in my experience has been at school or at in-person events. Online events were not as effective in creating ""real"" connections, and what I mean by that is:
   * Be genuinely interested in people. Figure out how they've gotten to where they are and what drove them to it. People love talking about themselves, so staying curious and taking good notes is extremely helpful. Then you ask about what opportunities they might know about or what path you should take to get to where they're at.
   * For example, it took me a single cybersecurity conference to bring in 50+ more connections on LinkedIn, and I know each person individually since I was a volunteer and spent time talking to them. I frequently message them on LI asking for career advice and how to get more exposure to the industry. I also met with people who were connected w/ my hiring manager on LinkedIn, which helped us connect that much easier.
* Companies are looking for students too. Being overqualified is a thing for these types of roles which can make it difficult to break into a certain role. I've been told that certain positions are held for students who are early in their career, such as 1st or 2nd year college students. The goal is to get them to intern each summer until they graduate so they can be hired on.
* I understand that I got lucky. I know students who have far more internships, certifications, higher GPA, and more. I believe my biggest strength was my ability to speak and communicate my ideas effectively. I didn't have to be the smartest student, just an individual who was passionate, confident, and ready to learn.

Hope that helps! Feel free to ask me anything."

I graduated with a master's degree in Project management and International cooperation. My goal was to work in NGO'S or related nonprofits organizations.

I graduated in the beginning of 2022 and still haven't started working. I was deeply depressed during my master's degree and it's been better since it ended. My internships during school did not go well at all. I didn't enjoy any of it. I felt inefficient and ineffective and I was always on guard because I really didn't want to have any bad review but at the same time it was hard to do the job because I wasn't enjoying it.

To get my master's internship I had to send maybe 70+ applications. That was very demotivating and made me doubt the appeal of my resume. 

My depression isolated me a lot and I no longer have friends. I don't do any social activities and I feel like I lost A LOT of my social abilities these last few years.

I graduated from a prestigious school so I'm afraid employers are gonna expect a lot from me because of that and the image associated with that school. I feel like I'm far from fitting to this image and this adds a lot of pressure.

The fact that I didn't enjoy my internships makes me question my career path and I know that I CAN'T do a job that I don't like and I feel so unsure about everything right now. 

I have so much reasons to be afraid of starting to work and I don't know how to overcome them."

**TLDR:** I just finished my second year studying CS. Last summer I had an IT Internship and this summer I will have a SWE Internship. Should I sacrifice next summer to study abroad and miss the opportunity of a junior summer internship? Are there any alternatives?

I really want to study abroad in the Netherlands for the Spring of my Junior year but the program I am looking at runs from February to July. Since this goes pretty deep into the summer, I would most likely lose the opportunity to have an internship for the summer of my junior year.

I am conflicted because I always hear about how the junior summer internship is super critical and it will be a good connection that most likely hires you once you graduate the following year. I don't want to miss out on having an easy time getting a job right after I graduate but I also don't want to miss out on studying abroad as I feel like it is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

In my freshman summer, I had an IT internship and for my sophomore summer, I will be having a SWE internship. Given that by the time I graduate I will have these two internships under my belt do you think it is okay for me to miss my junior summer internship to take the opportunity to study abroad? My main goal is to have an easy time getting a well-paying job after graduating and I am not sure if it is worth studying abroad to miss out on this.

It seems like all entry level jobs want people with experience in the industry but how am I suppose to get experience if companies don’t hire new graduates. Even internships want people with some sort of experience being a software engineer but like how is that suppose to be possible if I have been in school previously. So yeah I’m not sure how to go about this.

Hello my fellow Devs,

I fortunately received an offer to work with a really small startup in its initial stages as a FullStack Developer (this is like 10-20 people institution) via networking. Since it is a like a small startup in its grassroots levels with no published product, I was little hesitant to accept it. My family and friends are still encouraging to go out and apply there or just do my research with Uni and get other type of job with an established company (you know like cashier etc). However, I am kinda interested in the startup as I think its a once-in-lifetime experience that I can only afford at this point of life and can't take such risks later on when I am more firmly established (like a family person for example). Also, I get to be in the city of my Uni so I can do further work with my Uni (although my research can be remote too tho), and equity/better-leadership in the startup in the slim chance it succeeds. The office is in a big startup hub where I could form better connections with leading established entrepreneurs and learn more. In other words, with startup:-

Pros:-

Good full stack experience for developing a product from ground-up.

If succeeded, might get some form of equity/better-leadership in the startup.

The feel of startup and connections at reputed place.

Cons:-

Not an established company so can't market it as well of an experience like I could as a SWE Intern at other companies.

Not that much money.

Keep applying and hope to get something."

I'm a software engineer. I didn't start with a great foundational path, though. I got a ""Computer information systems technology"" from my community college that didn't teach shit about algorithms or anything, I did all of that myself. I participated in college wide and sometimes nation-wide competitions where again and again I proved to myself I was worth something. I got 2nd place in my entire college campus in C++ programming and top 200 in cybersecurity at NCL.  


I had an in with a friend to a defense company, I interviewed with them, totally new to any hard technical interviewing, and with no coding interview, I got an internship.  


My salary started at 75k. pretty good, for defense contracting, but I talked to an alumni from my college about my career, and I was told plain to my face: ""Why would you ever work there? You need to work at FANG. Everything else is a waste of time. Look at how much money I have, I have a tesla, I work with people who hack satellites, I hold conferences here and there and bla bla bla. I'm going to start my own company, I'm a millionare, I have insiders -"" and it was demoralizing, to say the least.  


After about a year and a half my company fell through, so I followed my old manager to a new company. Again, no coding interview, again, defense contracting - all the interview was was on passions, and past experience, and I got a position that required a few more months of experience than I realistically had, with a nice pay bump. 115k.  


115k is absolutely insane for defense contracting, at least from what I've been told, and I look online and apparently the average 7 year software engineer makes only 140k. Not that much more than what I have.  


here's the thing, what that alumni said to me, got under my skin. I look at Google, and they pay their employees absolutely clowning amounts. I watch these kids go through interviews after interviews, training on skills they'll never use in their work place. I'm lucky, I recognize how lucky I am, especially with how hard people are struggling with jobs. I'm so profoundly lucky to have a manager who is willing to put their reputation on the line for me after seeing how much I kicked ass at my last position on impressions alone. I was recognized. That feels good. But. . . I don't know.  


Sometimes I feel like I really am wasting my time. I enjoy what I do for work, I'd do it for free if I didn't have to pay bills, but I sometimes ask myself ""Should I be making more money than this? Am I not worth my salary? Why do they have to go through the stress of interviews while I get the mediocre route? Am I wasting my time?"" Sometimes I feel like I should jump ship, sometimes I feel like I oughta' just accept that I should program buttons at Google or Amazon and make more than what I have now. That being the top dog in the salary market is more important than my work. I haven't learned what it's like doing what I hate, I haven't learned what it's like not working remote.  


I'm prepared for people to throw insults my way for taking granted what I have, because honestly I'd even be open to comments like that. I just don't know honestly where I fall in line with other software engineers I guess, or how I'm doing career wise, and I find it hard to talk honestly about this with someone because I know they're going to support me and tell me I'm doing great, or I'm going to feel like I'm insulting my coworkers if I bring this up to them as well by implying that 115k doesn't impress me enough, and I'm looking for google pay at Goverment rates.  


I'm open to advice regarding this, how can I improve my confidence with where I'm at? Is money all there is?"

Hello everyone.

I’m currently in 6th sem (just started last week) in a tier-3 college. I want to become a full-stack developer (I’m more into frontend) because this interested me and also for the money. But seeing many comments on this subreddit saying there’s so much competetion in frontend, I’m very worried about my future. I’m pretty sure that if I work hard, I’ll be pretty talented in this role but seeing so many people applying, I don’t know if my resume will even get shortlisted when I apply in the future. I have started DSA (have done 40 till now) but I was focused more on my academics in the last 3-4 months (so I stopped). I’ll be doing a lot more DSA from now on. I’ll also focus on projects and dsa in this sem and will be applying for internships from 7th sem. I’ll put all my time trying to learn from the domain you guys suggest. My questions are:

&#x200B;

1. What jobs are available the most (frontend, backend, Devops, Cloud computing, ) and what tech stack should I focus on more (React, Java spring boot or NodeJS or Python etc)?
2. How are the salaries in these jobs?
3. What will the competetion and scope for these jobs in the future (in the next 5 to 10 years)?
4. What project should I do (e-commerce website)? and the tech stack (react and java spring boot) that I should use for my project in this sem (we have to do a mini project in 6th sem)
5. A lot of my friends are doing internships (paid courses) in Data Science. I also read in [Blind](https://us.teamblind.com/s/ntkpMz06) that AIML pays the highest. How is the situation here in India?
6. What are the things that will help me and useful no matter how the tech industry changes? (is it problem solving - dsa, networking and communication skills etc) and how to improve in those areas as well.

I’m still a kid but I’m serious and dedicated about my future. I’m open to hear anything (advices, suggestions, tips) so please share your valuable thoughts and opinions. I request the students in this subreddit not to comment and please let the experienced people speak. Please include your domain, yoe and salary if you’re comfortable sharing it :)"

C++ was the first programming language I learned (aside from some light python scripts for automation). Since then I've learned a plethora of languages, learned web technologies for frontend and backend, mobile-friendly languages like Dart and Kotlin, C# for Unity development etc.

but NOTHING scratches that itch in my brain like C++ programming does, which by itself isn't a big problem, everyone has favorite languages. The problem begins when I insist on using C++ in places where it has no business or has no practical benefit being.

Case in point, I have a Computer Networks project coming up in which we have to make a basic web server. Mostly CRUD operations with an auth layer, nothing special. I have a miraculous 3 day break from uni because Labor Day, and the logical thing to do would be to write a simple 100 line program in Node or Spring boot, and use the rest of my time making mini projects and practicing for an upcoming internship interview in June.

But for some reason, my brain insists on not using the skills I already have to make the app and instead implement the whole thing in C++, which from my seniors' insight and my own research is needlessly complicated and time consuming. I feel like this attitude will negatively impact my performance in the field, and I also don't want to become one of those C++ supremacists who #include<their morning coffee>.

TL;DR: I know that C++ is bad for some projects and shouldn't be used because better, easier alternatives exist and I want people to tell me that C++ is bad for some projects and shouldn't be used because better, easier alternatives exist."

With the combination of personal issues and that I'm about to serve NS very soon at 25, I am just lost right now, as a person who always strive for the best.

I'm 25 this year, never had a girlfriend and recently I am starting to feel the effects of loneliness, sexual frustration and I have just started to see women in a negative light and I just start to hate on them, treated them in an aggressive way and simply just not caring for their opinions at all, and this is just one of the few problems I'm having. The fact that I am at this point in life at 25 was because I was always constantly bullied back in secondary school, which was I skipped and skipped, played truancy and not showing up, they had to get the counselors come knocking in my door to force me and the freaking principal did nothing other than recommending me to switch schools.

During my time with ITE my internship was sabotaged by lousy managers who doesn't even care to mark my tasklist and I got a C for my industrial attachment, my groups mate sabotaged me because of a misunderstanding and all of them decided to give me negative peer reviews.. again dropping and sabotaging my grades because I'm the only guy in the group and we don't click.

Right now, I just feel like I'm stuck, I'm 25 right now and I just can't seem to find my way in life.. I'll be coming out of my national service at 27, restarting Higher Nitec and leaving at 29 and I'll be going into Poly by 30.. and I barely have got any work experiences at all other than part times in retail stores and I hate retail service and I hate people, I don't want to deal with them.

I'm right now just feeling all so destructive right now and I do not know what to do at this point in my life. Getting rejected by all 5 Polys was the last draw and I feel like taking whoever/whatever I can with me. "

CS Engineering from a Tier-2ish college. GPA: 7.9/10 (Above average, not top of class). Two internships, one summer school. Was active in organising tech-events at college. Founded the ACM-W chapter.

Yet to take the GRE, going by mocks expecting 165+ in Quants and 155+ in Verbal.

Work Experience:

* Few months in a fin-tech startup right after undergrad. (Not quite relevant)
* 1.5 Years Research Assistant at IISc.
* Bootstrapped our start-up with the same group at IISc. Still at the start-up, working with our collaborators from around the world.
* Started as a Software developer in a critical project. Now lead a team of experienced engineers. Will have a total of 4+ years experience at the time of application.

Research:

* One paper published in a top conference in systems, one under review.
* Three publications in co-located workshops/symposiums (One as first author with well-known people in the field as co-authors).
* Ran a hands-on workshop at a top conference.
* Invited as a PC member for a workshop.

Ideally I'd like to go to a school with more than one professor working in systems/PL design. I've narrowed down the following. I don't know what's safe and what's not safe anymore. Any insights on it appreciated. :)

&#x200B;

* University of Utah - Active research in compilers (LLVM, optimizations etc.) and memory management (have relevant experience in both)
* Indiana University - Many folks in PL
* University of Rochester - Active systems research group
* UBC - Many professors working in PL/Verification (I have some background in verification and willing to learn more. Though I suspect my GPA will be a problem here.)
* UMD - Same as above. Highly ambitious for my profile.
* Illinois Institute of Technology - Perhaps safe. Only one professor working in my area of interest. Though he seems to have funded all of his previous students.
* UC Riverside - An active group working in PL/Verification
* SUNY Buffalo - Maybe safe?
* Rutgers - Active systems/compilers group. Maybe ambitious?
* Tufts University
* University of Chicago - Ambitious?"

A is the more senior founder, B is more junior in comparison, in our office there's also C who is the founder of another company who is sharing our space, their involvement in this story will be explained later. Some background, i knew A for quite some time and decided to join their new startup as an intern, i began to notice that B was emulating A's behaviour which was odd, they emulated quite a bit of A's likes and dislikes and emulated everything down to A's way of eating, and due to how similar their likes and dislikes are i always found myself being left out somewhat. I noted that B depends on similarities to befriend others, they've always had to insist i was the same as them but i always rejected that due to my desire to retain my individuality. I had always been more comfortable with A because i could just be me and they could just be themselves but yet we get along very well, plus I've known A for 4 years now. All that aside, C is another longtime friend of A and B's however B dislikes C due to their rocky past and B has expressed that to me that they aren't actually friends with C and were just playing nice, and almost constantly insisting C hasn't changed anytime C reacted emotionally to circumstances relating to their company. I expressed all this to a friend outside of work due to how freaked out i was (let's call them D) and D expressed the possibility that B is unsure about their power and that is why they emulated A often, i thought why would they need to feel insecure and unsure if they are a co-founder? I kept this in mind and continued observing. I then remembered C's company was meeting lots of milestones and throughout that time B began to emulate C's way of joking despite their apparent dislike of C and their way of joking. The final straw for me was, just recently C scored a new and very influential connection and their company has began to gone on the rise, and suddenly B bought lots of ice cream for the office which is usually C's habit. I was just thoroughly shocked and it feels like I'm going crazy with anxiety for some reason, I'm just anxious like if they were truly insecure and unsure about power, what if this becomes jealousy and malice?

However, it is important to keep a positive mindset! There are many important things to remember:

1. For prospective teachers. If you haven’t heard anything yet or been given many interviews, this is completely normal. Districts begin with internal candidates and often hire those with experience when jobs first become available. While some new teachers do get jobs early, most aren’t hired until the second half of the summer. Just keep your head up and keep applying!

2. Your first year is often your most difficult year. Besides the curriculum, you’re getting used to your school policies, school culture, classroom management, etc. Even for veteran teachers, going to a new school may be challenging since no two schools are the same. However, this struggle is amplified for new teachers. This is completely normal! 

3. For new teachers, if you’ve been reading this page you’re likely petrified. However, while these stories are all true and should not be ignored, they also don’t represent all schools. Personally, I’ve never seen or experiences most of the stories I read on here. Before others start to cry out that it’s because I’m teaching in a private school, I also spent three years in public schools beforehand. I subbed as a TA for a year before grad school, then did a year-long internship, then did my student teaching in the fall of the next year. After completion of student teaching, I went back to subbing while I finished my grad program. In total, I subbed in two districts. One was suburban and affluent and the other was a city school district. Between these two districts, I’ve been in over 20 schools and haven’t seen the issues you read in here daily. As mentioned, I’m not discounting the experiences that many teachers face, but it’s also important to remember that many come here to vent, which makes these issues seem much more common than they actually are. 

4. Find out which school is best for you! There are so many options to choose from and there is no right or wrong choice. There are affluent schools, schools in poor neighborhoods, suburban schools, urban schools, rural schools, charter schools, magnet schools, religious schools, private schools, etc. For example, I work at a Catholic school and love it! However, being Catholic is a major factor for why I love my school so much, in addition to how close our school community is. However, there are many myths about private schools, many of which are untrue. For example, we must be certified, don’t kick kids out on a drop of a hat, do provide special services (counseling, special education, etc.), and hold teachers to high standards. Most of our families are also very friendly and outgoing and certainly aren’t snobs/elitists. While this obviously will vary school to school, the point is to always have open eyes. The same is true for urban/city schools. The reputation is that they’re violent and out of control, but I have friends working in many city districts who love it and say their schools don’t have as many of these issues compared to other city schools. 

5. Be careful with social media. Luckily, I live a non-controversial life since I don’t drink lol. However, stay away from any posts showing pictures being drunk on weekends. You never know how parents will view these. Most parents understand that teachers have lives, but it’s smart not to take chances. It also should be common sense, but avoid political posts. You will have families with all types of political beliefs, regardless of where you are. For example, I’m in a very blue part of the country, so most of our families are either democrat or moderate republicans, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t families with varying political beliefs. It is important that all students and their families feel comfortable with you.

Best of luck to everyone!"
133txfs,1,2023-04-30,Career vs Lifestyle,Desperate_Holiday777,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/133txfs/career_vs_lifestyle/,"Hello all, 

I am in a bit of a dilemma and wanted to ask for other people's perspectives. TLDR below. 

I'm (23 f) from the US and decided to live abroad for a bit after undergrad (Bachelor in Biomedical Sciences) teaching English in Europe. I'm of Hispanic descent so I chose Spain with the idea of improving my Spanish to be more marketable back home, and I wanted experience outside of my field before committing to a career. I've been here for 6 months. 

I originally wanted to enter the medical field but decided against it as I discovered I like lab work more. I briefly worked in an environmental science lab before moving abroad and had applied to medical lab science internships as the career is what I believe would be fulfilling to me. For context, I need to complete an internship or have work experience to be eligible to take the certification exam required to be able to work in the field. 

At the beginning of this year, I got accepted into a program in one of the best hospitals in the US to start in the fall, and I accepted thinking I'd be ready to go back home in the summer. Well, the time is almost here and I am struggling with the idea of leaving. I honestly wasn't expecting my life here to go as well as it has. I've made some amazing friends and I honestly feel happier here than back home. 

Of course, both places have their drawbacks. Although I do not like my home state, there are more job opportunities. By contrast, the job market here is a struggle. Jobs are difficult to secure and the pay of course is low compared to the US, however, you can argue that the quality of life makes up for what it lacks. I know money shouldn't be the main factor, but I want to at least live comfortably. 

Now, I'll explain the options I have. The first of course is to go back home as planned and complete my internship. I managed to graduate undergrad without debt but considering I have not made any significant amount of money here I know I'll have to take out loans to support my living expenses. However, I feel like, in having debt, it's unlikely I'll be able to come back here as I'll have to focus on paying back what I owe. Also, the issue with leaving and coming back is immigration. I am currently here on a student visa as the government sponsors the teaching program I'm in, so I'm not free to change jobs. Since I am already here in the country, I feel like it should be easier to switch to a working permit, but it has not necessarily been the case for me. As far as I know, I'd have to find a job willing to sponsor my working permit, and of course most jobs want people with existing permission to work. I don't know how much harder it would be with me outside of the country. 

The next option I have to continue with the job I have. I don't want to be an English teacher forever but renewing my position guarantees my permission to stay here. I've already requested a renewal but I probably won't get confirmation until next month. Continuing the position would buy me time to find another job but I feel like the issues would be the same as I'd have to find a job willing to work with me. Of course, this means I would have to renege my internship. I worked really hard for the position and I was fully committed at the time I accepted it, but this is life. I recognize the inconvenience it would be for the hospital and I know I won't be able to work with them in the future. I may be able complete a similar program someplace else but it probably won't be as good of an opportunity as this one. I also don't know how likely it would be for me to end up in the medical lab career here in Spain. The educational system is different and I would probably have to either study again or gain work experience. I basically don't know what I would end up doing here. 

This is where I want to hear what other people think. I know one of my flaws is being impulsive but I also overthink. Am I missing something? Is the decision clear? What would you all do in my position? 

I feel like no matter what decision I make, I will have regrets in some way. I just want to make the best decision. I know I should consider myself fortunate to be able to have options but at the same time I'm frustrated that I keep steering away from the path that seems laid out for me. I wish we could see how our lives play out with the different decisions we make and choose from there LOL. 

TLDR ; I don't know whether to stay in a foreign country where I'm happy but my career path is uncertain or go back home with a career laid out. 

Thank you for any insight/ advice/ perspectives you may have!"

I started to look for a first job (starting at 17th july), but I'm really struggling to get anything : because my current internship focus exclusively on spark dev, it seems like I have nothing to offer to a company which is not hiring a spark dev (for instance, I can see a lot of offers for a java dev, but obviously they require experience with hibernates, angular and such). What am I supposed to do ? I did some python and C++ in my studies, but I guess this is pointless compared to a professionnal experience, so I'm out of the competition for every jobs ... 

Otherwise, even for the spark offers I'm struggling to get results. Is it because I'm applying too early (2 months and a half before being available) ?

I have to say I'm really worried about this situation. I start to think that I chose my internship wrong and wasted my ""first experience"" in a stack nobody is asking for, while things would have been way easier with a java internship .."

133x0i9,47,2023-04-30,Windows stuck at bootup on my Acer laptop,Top-Row-6804,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/133x0i9/windows_stuck_at_bootup_on_my_acer_laptop/,"Hello,

I have an Acer Nitro 5 (AN515-43) laptop which is 2 years old. It is running a dual boot of Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 11 on an AMD Ryzen 5 processor. For the last few days, the Windows bootup gets stuck at the Acer loading screen and does not proceed further. On shutting down and restarting from there, the ""Preparing automatic repair"" screen pops up but gets stuck either there or at the ""Diagnosing.."" screen that follows. In short, Windows fails to boot up.

However, each time on restart the GNU GRUB comes up perfectly. On selecting Ubuntu from there, it boots up perfectly most of the time. Sometimes, like right now, it too gets stuck in the Acer screen and does not proceed further. I am able to visit the system utility screen by pressing the F2 button on start up, but I do not know enough to change anything there. I changed the bootup priority to keep Ubuntu above Windows.

The problem had started with Windows getting stuck while I was browsing on Chrome. I tried to force restart the laptop by power cycling it.. and it never started again.

I am listing down what I did some of the times Windows did boot up if that gives someone an idea of what might be happening:

1. I had initiated the Windows startup repair and Windows diagnosed itself and booted up by itself.
2. Once, I had removed recently installed quality updates from the Advanced diagnostic tool in the Windows troubleshooting screen that appears. That caused Windows to start up on the next power cycle but not after that. I suspected that the quality updates were the reason of the issue.. however, when the Windows did boot up that time, it installed the updates again automatically so I think it kind of reverted to that state. After that time I was never able to get to the Troubleshooting screen again.
3. I had once disabled the Fast Bootup option in the System Utility window and on restart, Windows booted up. However, the issue persisted on further restarts.

Update: I did a system restore. It booted up in Windows but froze right after that. I rebooted and it worked fine. However, Windows is terribly slow right now. I am backing up my C drive to an external hard disk currently. I will try removing a few apps and rebooting again to see if the issue persists. 

I have to travel to a different country for an internship in a few days so I am in a hurry to get this fixed. Also I have lot of important files and programs installed so it would be best if I don't have to reset the laptop. Any help would be greatly appreciated. TIA :)"

I've heard of MCA from NIT being a possible thing to pursue after ug but I'm confused because MCA isn't that quite as good as it was before. 

Moreover I'm actually doing my ug from a tier -2 college, whose placement cell panders more towards Arts and BMM jobs. We've never had a single IT related internship that has been brought by them. I feel so lost, where I've come to regret not choosing to do CSE in a tier -3 engineering college. I'm trying to sort of focus on updating my portfolio but I'm still unsure about everything. I haven't had any suitable luck with internships as well.

I've looked into all sorts of opportunities available including an MBA but it's particularly not something I lean towards. I fear I'd end up with no job since I already shot my foot by doing a degree that doesn't have a lot of opportunities over here. There's also this sad fact of not being able to apply for or being qualified for internships because of this. What are my possible options after this or what seems like an appropriate career choice ahead?"

She assured me i would still be accepted into the school's online masters in computer science, and this way I didn't have to pay for additional undergrad semesters.  I aced intro to C/C++, Data Structures and Operating Systems, Discrete Structures, Analytics Programming with python. I did some additional courses on codeacademy and the Harvardcs50 course to get familiar with alot of the concepts. 

I desperately wish I had started out as a comp sci major so I could've gotten an internship, or even just a few good projects to put on my resume. I'd really like to get some kind of internship or entry level job to have some work experience. I'm a hard worker and fast learner, willing to do whatever it takes, but I feel so lost on what to do next. I'd really appreciate if someone could give me some insight to these questions:

How should I list my individualized major on my resume?  I know it's a program unique to my school and technically puts me in the college of liberal studies, which I'm sure isn't ideal for a computer science resume. 

I have 0 tech work experience aside from a underclassman C++ tutor. I also listed my jobs as a patient care assistant and medical scribe, and tried to emphasize the data entry portion of the position. Should I maybe focus on applying for IT jobs until I get some graduate school under my belt?

I know the best thing I can do for myself is showcase my skills with projects and be active on github, but I just feel so directionless about it. I get really discouraged seeing how complex of a program other undergrad students have posted. 

If anyone has found themselves in a similar position, I'm eager to hear what you did to to land your first tech job."

I am a 23-year-old guy from Indore, Madhya Pradesh. I am the only child of my parents. When I was 11, I was diagnosed with a serious tumor which I survived after battling it for two years. However, the treatment process drained all our resources, and my father invested everything he could to save me. We ran into a lot of debt and eventually lost our house.

We had to move to a new place, and I had to change schools, leaving behind my two best friends who were like brothers to me. We settled in a rented place in a new society, It was good. I made some new friends there and they all were very good to me because I was quite mature for my age. Their parents also praised me, which was very motivating for me as I have always been an insecure guy  because I am conventionally not attractive, The positive attention was a welcome change for me.

In my new school, I was getting everyone's attention, perhaps because of my past. I was the smartest kid in my class, probably because I was the oldest. Everything was going well in my life, and I was happier than ever. One day, A new Girl arrived in my senior class (11th grade). Honestly, she was very pretty, but a loner. Her female classmates were all unfriendly towards her, as they were jealous of the attention she was receiving from boys. Everyone was in awe, including me but I knew she was out of my league.  One day, we met in the canteen, and I gathered my courage to talk to her. It felt good, so we met again, talked again and as time passed, we became close. I fell in love with her, but I kept my distance and treated her like a good friend only because I thought she felt the same way. Like Why would such a pretty girl would fall for me? But with time, she kept coming closer and closer to me. We kissed and confessed our feelings. We used to hang out after school, and I introduced her to my best friends from my previous school. Everything was going well until she graduated from school, and her behavior changed. I don't know what happened to her, but she started treating me differently. I found out that she was cheating on me with my best friend, whom I had introduced to her six months ago. He was like a brother to me, and she was my world and yet they broken my trust.

I was in 12th grade, preparing for the JEE exams when I found out about the cheating. Everything changed, and it turned dark. I became depressed and ended up passing 12th grade with only 54%. I was also preparing for the JEE, and my parents and school had high expectations of me. But on the day of the JEE mains, I was not even willing to go to my center.

You know what my father's reaction was when the board results were announced? Nothing. He said I did fine and hugged me. Even though the disappointment was clearly visible in his eyes, he didn't say a word to me. I remember the day when my 10th board results were announced. My father and I saw the results together, and I had scored 94%. He was overjoyed and started dancing with excitement. I saw the pride and tears in his eyes. However, this time, there were tears, but they were tears of disappointment.

I lost everyone's respect, including relatives, neighbors, friends, and teachers. They judged me, even though they didn't know my situation, and it broke my self-esteem, making me insecure again.

Time was passing by quickly, but my mental condition wasn't improving. The doctor suggested that I should engage with outside world and not stay at home all day, so after much counseling and discussion, my father admitted me to a nearby third-tier college to pursue a BCA degree. The college was going well, and I met some good people there, although I didn't fully trust any of them. I was slowly recovering, but then the lockdown happened. At first, it was fine, but as it kept getting extended, my condition started worsening again. My parents were trying everything to keep me sane, but the lockdown made things worse.

My two years of college went by in a blur. In the fifth semester, after many failures, I managed to secure an internship that helped me get back on track. Sixth semester started  and it was time for placements. Being a third-tier college, no good companies came to recruit from our college. Some startups arrived, offering up to 2 lakhs per year, and some companies offered call center jobs, but I didn't sit for any of their interviews. I decided to take a short break to decide what to do next. I was confident that I would do something on my own, at least something much better than their shitty offers.

It's been nine months, and I have found my passion. I am clearer than ever about my goals, but I don't know how to achieve them. My passion lies in Mechatronics and Robotics, but with this BCA degree, I don't see any way of pursuing it. I have studied AI/ML all by myself and now want to pursue a degree in robotics, but I don't know how to go about it. I have also discovered my passion for filmmaking and want to pursue it as a side hobby.

What I have not found is my way out from here. I feel stuck and don't know how to move forward. I have been pampered all my life, especially after my tumor diagnosis, and my parents are incredibly possessive of me, treat me like a five-year-old. Sometimes, I want them to hate me because I have done nothing except making them suffer all their life, I am a failure both as a Son and a person I don't have any brother and sister of my age to share my thoughts with, I don't have any good friends left. I am basically alone.

All the kids of my age in the society have gone somewhere to pursue their careers, I am the only one stuck here. I want to get out of this place for good 3-5 years and come back with pride. I want to live an independent life for some time. I can't endure the judgmental looks of my neighbors who see me as a failure since I have been stuck at home since the lockdown began.

The lockdown have gone to waste, and I realized how much I could have achieved during that time. This feeling of guilt haunts me constantly. Being stuck at home for so long has negatively impacted my confidence and communication skills. I struggle with finding the right words and often get lost in translation.

I am feeling helpless, I often get suicidal thoughts. However, I would never act on them as I know how much it would hurt my parents. I want to make them happy and achieve something for myself, but firstly, I need to get out of here.

I know it's silly to ask for guidance on the internet, but I can't tell my parents about this, and I don't have any good friends to talk to.

I am a 23-year-old guy from Indore, Madhya Pradesh. I am the only child of my parents. When I was 11, I was diagnosed with a serious tumor which I survived after battling it for two years. However, the treatment process drained all our resources, and my father invested everything he could to save me. We ran into a lot of debt and eventually lost our house.

We had to move to a new place, and I had to change schools, leaving behind my two best friends who were like brothers to me. We settled in a rented place in a new society, It was good. I made some new friends there and they all were very good to me because I was quite mature for my age. Their parents also praised me, which was very motivating for me as I have always been an insecure guy  because I am conventionally not attractive, The positive attention was a welcome change for me.

In my new school, I was getting everyone's attention, perhaps because of my past. I was the smartest kid in my class, probably because I was the oldest. Everything was going well in my life, and I was happier than ever. One day, A new Girl arrived in my senior class (11th grade). Honestly, she was very pretty, but a loner. Her female classmates were all unfriendly towards her, as they were jealous of the attention she was receiving from boys. Everyone was in awe, including me but I knew she was out of my league.  One day, we met in the canteen, and I gathered my courage to talk to her. It felt good, so we met again, talked again and as time passed, we became close. I fell in love with her, but I kept my distance and treated her like a good friend only because I thought she felt the same way. Like Why would such a pretty girl would fall for me? But with time, she kept coming closer and closer to me. We kissed and confessed our feelings. We used to hang out after school, and I introduced her to my best friends from my previous school. Everything was going well until she graduated from school, and her behavior changed. I don't know what happened to her, but she started treating me differently. I found out that she was cheating on me with my best friend, whom I had introduced to her six months ago. He was like a brother to me, and she was my world and yet they broken my trust.

I was in 12th grade, preparing for the JEE exams when I found out about the cheating. Everything changed, and it turned dark. I became depressed and ended up passing 12th grade with only 54%. I was also preparing for the JEE, and my parents and school had high expectations of me. But on the day of the JEE mains, I was not even willing to go to my center.

You know what my father's reaction was when the board results were announced? Nothing. He said I did fine and hugged me. Even though the disappointment was clearly visible in his eyes, he didn't say a word to me. I remember the day when my 10th board results were announced. My father and I saw the results together, and I had scored 94%. He was overjoyed and started dancing with excitement. I saw the pride and tears in his eyes. However, this time, there were tears, but they were tears of disappointment.

I lost everyone's respect, including relatives, neighbors, friends, and teachers. They judged me, even though they didn't know my situation, and it broke my self-esteem, making me insecure again.

Time was passing by quickly, but my mental condition wasn't improving. The doctor suggested that I should engage with outside world and not stay at home all day, so after much counseling and discussion, my father admitted me to a nearby third-tier college to pursue a BCA degree. The college was going well, and I met some good people there, although I didn't fully trust any of them. I was slowly recovering, but then the lockdown happened. At first, it was fine, but as it kept getting extended, my condition started worsening again. My parents were trying everything to keep me sane, but the lockdown made things worse.

My two years of college went by in a blur. In the fifth semester, after many failures, I managed to secure an internship that helped me get back on track. Sixth semester started  and it was time for placements. Being a third-tier college, no good companies came to recruit from our college. Some startups arrived, offering up to 2 lakhs per year, and some companies offered call center jobs, but I didn't sit for any of their interviews. I decided to take a short break to decide what to do next. I was confident that I would do something on my own, at least something much better than their shitty offers.

It's been nine months, and I have found my passion. I am clearer than ever about my goals, but I don't know how to achieve them. My passion lies in Mechatronics and Robotics, but with this BCA degree, I don't see any way of pursuing it. I have studied AI/ML all by myself and now want to pursue a degree in robotics, but I don't know how to go about it. I have also discovered my passion for filmmaking and want to pursue it as a side hobby.

What I have not found is my way out from here. I feel stuck and don't know how to move forward. I have been pampered all my life, especially after my tumor diagnosis, and my parents are incredibly possessive of me, treat me like a five-year-old. Sometimes, I want them to hate me because I have done nothing except making them suffer all their life, I am a failure both as a Son and a person I don't have any brother and sister of my age to share my thoughts with, I don't have any good friends left. I am basically alone.

All the kids of my age in the society have gone somewhere to pursue their careers, I am the only one stuck here. I want to get out of this place for good 3-5 years and come back with pride. I want to live an independent life for some time. I can't endure the judgmental looks of my neighbors who see me as a failure since I have been stuck at home since the lockdown began.

The lockdown have gone to waste, and I realized how much I could have achieved during that time. This feeling of guilt haunts me constantly. Being stuck at home for so long has negatively impacted my confidence and communication skills. I struggle with finding the right words and often get lost in translation.

I am feeling helpless, I often get suicidal thoughts. However, I would never act on them as I know how much it would hurt my parents. I want to make them happy and achieve something for myself, but firstly, I need to get out of here.

I know it's silly to ask for guidance on the internet, but I can't tell my parents about this, and I don't have any good friends to talk to. I chose Reddit because I don't use social media, but I've been using reddit for the last six months, and it has become my comfort zone. I find comfort in all of you who share your stories and guide and help others. Please guide me too, suggest me what should I do, show me a path.

1343sq0,2,2023-04-30,Redoing my resume after three years. This is a list of things I don't know if I should include or not any insight is greatly appreciated!,sighcantthinkofaname,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1343sq0/redoing_my_resume_after_three_years_this_is_a/,"Context: I'm officially a licenced therapist. Before now I've been a registered intern. In my state you have to be a registered intern for at least two years post masters before becoming licenced. So I've been able to do therapy, but with some limitations as an intern. Now that I'm licenced I have more job opportunities that will pay better, so I'm trying to get things in order. I know I will need to add my licence to my resume, but here's all the old stuff where I'm not sure to include it or drop it off.

Education: I have an honors AA, bachelors, and Masters. Should I continue to list all three of these, or drop off the AA?

Internships: I did three internships during my education, one for each degree I have. The first one was all the way back in 2016 and not as relevant to my current job as the other two, but it's also a place everyone knows from a glance (It's my state's department of children and families, I was helping people apply for social assistance). The second one was at a school and I plan to keep it on there because my supervisor was a licenced therapist who let me shadow her all day, so it's very relevant and I learned a lot. The third was at the company I currently work at, also shadowing therapy sessions.  

Jobs relevant to my licence: Just my current job. Once again it's the same company as my final internship, I've been there since 2019 doing in home, in school, and telehealth therapy.

Jobs not relevant to my licence: Kids birthday parties from like 2013-2016, build a bear from like 2015-2019

Other activities: I did three short term study abroads, which I mention because I might apply to work overseas. Plus people like talking about travel so it might be a benefit in the interview stage?

I also use to volunteer at a retirement home in college, alzheimers and dementia unit, but it's been a really long time, the only reason I would consider mentioning it is because it's a different population and would show I'm comfortable working with more than just kids. 

So, any ""Yes for sure include that"" or ""Absolutely leave that off no one cares"" would be helpful."

This fall is going to be my last semester and I still have not gotten one for the summer. I interviewed twice and didn't get accepted to one. 

What am I doing wrong? I feel like I did really well during my interviews like I prepared my questions, wore formal or casual depending on what they asked for the interview, and idk the conversation felt like it went really well


Edit: Thank you to everyone who gave such amazing suggestions, encouragements, and DMs to help me. I truly appreciate it, and I'm going to keep trying my best to get that internship 🙏"

My goal this cycle is to land FAANG/unicorn and maybe even quant. 

Currently, I've been grinding LC and stuff, learning OS/networking and making better projects. As school comes to an end, I will likely dedicate most of my time (outside internship) to doing the above. Assuming I apply with Spring '25 grad date, is this a good strategy to target FAANG/equivalent? I know nothing is guaranteed esp in this economy but I'm just wondering what else I should be doing to make the jump. Should I be looking for referrals? Learning system design? Any advice would be appreciated."
1346tq7,2,2023-04-30,I’m 18 and I don’t know what to do.,BeepBoopImAGoop,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1346tq7/im_18_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"As the title says, I don’t know what to do. Turning 19 in November and I’ve graduated last year. But, it feels like I’m somewhat of a failure. I find myself anxious about my situation, sad and even angry sometimes. I barely do anything, though I do work two days a week as an intern, cooking. Even when someone asks me to something, I get irritated, mostly inwardly. I do have some friends, but always only talk to them over social media or games. I have siblings, but they all are much older than me, they all have normal lives, a partner and a few kids each.

I’ve always been quiet or shyer growing up, but it started getting worse when I started getting my own devices back when I was young, which I eventually got basically addicted to, which I still am today with my pc. And when I get on the pc, it’s hard to get motivation do to anything but mindlessly surf the web, though I’m trying to get myself to do more things, like write and actually watch/read new series. I usually would watch/read things and almost hyperfixate on them, even if I hadn’t finished it. What mostly got me hooked was stuff like fan fiction which I still enjoy, not quite sure how I stumbled on it. My parents didn’t do anything to really stop it when I was a child, like taking it away from time to time, the most I can remember my mother doing is saying stuff every once in a while. So now it’s up to me to fix it since I am an adult.

So now I find myself struggle a lot socially, I think I talk strangely a lot, plus a lot of the time I just can’t think of anything at all to say, especially to people I haven’t met before. And I guess I’m a coward in taking initiative, even in still like asking people to hang out, which seems it would be basically nothing to a normal person. I suppose I can hold proper conversations every once in a while, especially over the game.

If I wanted to go to college or uni I would have to travel out at least to the nearest town, there is a college there but there isn’t anything I’d want to do there, so I’d have to travel even further, to a city. But I have some strange fear of doing that, I have fear and anxiety with a lot of new things if I’d have to do it alone. Plus, I’d miss my pets a lot, idk if that’s a silly reason.

I genuinely do not know what to do, taking online classes is an option, but it wouldn’t help with anything else. I can’t really go out and try anything new, or meet new people because I know everyone here, not closely but I don’t thing I’d like to hang around a lot of them. My mom told me that I am not a failure but perhaps that is because they live similarly, though they have done more during their years at my age, they basically stay home most the time too, excluding when they work. And they’re more productive.

As for writing, I usually get too distracted by other things on my pc which I use due to me posting the chapters online, I spend more time thinking of what I will write, rather Than writing it. Same with art.

All in all, I’m lost and unsure of like everything. And would like to improve sometime. If anyone has advice it would be very appreciated, sorry if this post was too long."
