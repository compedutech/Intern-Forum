A bit of context: I live in Seattle, Washington and I'm currently in my 2nd year of Computer Science (Bachelor Degree).   
My school offers 2 separate paths: A research project with a Professor, or an internship at a Software company.

I genuinely love math and research (specifically AI) and I want to pursue that in the long term. But my fear is that if I get into research too soon I won't be able to get a job because there are tons more jobs for Software Engineers than there are for researchers.

My question comes down to this:

**Should I be spending my time researching and learning advanced Mathematics to make myself a better researcher and contribute to the AI community?**   
**Or Should I be spending my time learning frameworks (Spring, Splunk, etc.) and languages to make myself a better Software Engineer?**

I have few questions on how to ace in college.

1) how should I study computer science in college? I have finished AP compsci A and recieved 5. Would AP CS at least give me the neccessary info that I need to start? 

2) Im self studying Python and C++ b4 I head to college. I will be working on projects with my friend using python or C++. I have some experience with front end development when I was a CS club front end leader. Would this be a great idea to prep for college?

3) On average how much do you study outside of class per 1 credit hour?

4) How to deal with being insecure? I started programming only a year and half ago and found interest in it. Is it possible for me to compete against those who started coding when they were 11 years old? Also, is it true that on average most cs majors started coding at 14 years old?

5) When to start for internship? Is is possible to work as a part time programmer while going to school?

I’ve made some extremely stupid mistakes and am concerned for my future.

PA CSA 3929(a)(1) Retail theft: 
1st offense valued at  $165 of food items from Walmart. They have security footage of me walking with a cart covered by my jacket past the registers.

PA CS 4914(A) False identification to law enforcement authorities (Misd.3):
Was flustered and gave incorrect info to the officer, corrected myself right after and provided my real information on the second attempt.

I have been approved for a PD but yet to have any contact with him/her. Planning on pleading NG. I am not a resident of PA and am from out of state.

I am a university student, 19 yrs old, with a prospective future, looking to apply to internships and jobs soon. I am extremely terrified that this will kill any chances of a career. I have no priors or ever had any trouble with the law. 

I believe I have a good character, never had intention of stealing, and dedicate my life to the service of others who are less fortunate.

Will this incident have an effect on my future? What are my options of getting this removed from my record if it remains? What are the usual consequences of this situation? 

I am absolutely terrified that I have just ruined my life by preventing me from finding a career in my major of study.

Please advise, thank you very much.

So, you can understand my predicament when I am getting **no interviews and only getting these challenges**. Here is why I am so hesitant:

1) I keep putting off doing them cuz executive dysfunction (no deadline + a lot of prep = no pressure to do it)

2) I know its gonna take me the full time limit to solve them. 

* I get extra time on exams, yet I still never finish
* It usually takes me 2.5x the time it would take a *regular person* to do an assignment. (that's with hyper-focus)
    
  If I end up taking the full time limit to approach the average person's answer, I will never get the interview.

You must be thinking I am some garbage student and don't even deserve the jobs, but after all the cramming and the scraping, I am sitting at a 3.0 at a fairly competitive school. Like all of you, I have my own struggles with ADHD but I really am trying to make something out of myself. 

I would **really appreciate** some advice on what to do. *I guess this is something I will struggle with on the technical interview.*

**TL;DR:** Knowing myself and my ADHD, I am doomed to take the full time limit to do the coding challenges and will never get an interview.

I'll try to keep it simple for that quick injection of positivity before you continue your browsing.

1. I grew up in rural, upstate NY (town population of around \~8k) and a median county income of \~$17k/year.
2. I dealt with mental health issues, was on and off atypical antipsychotics and in and out of hospitals basically my entire adolescence.
3. I was a violent, troubled little shit that got in constant fights and was kicked out of basically every school in my area.
4. Eventually landed in a ""correctional"" highschool with dress codes, security guards, metal detectors everywhere, obnoxious procedures.
5. Decided to go cold turkey on my meds (they made me a zombie), and refused to listen to docs.
6. After more violence and basically no education, decided to drop out of that highschool after repeating 9th grade.
7. Jobless WoW and Runescape addict for a couple years at mom's house. I had explored private servers and learned Java / some general scripting for this. Now interested in programming.
8. Found first job at a Rite-Aid for minimum wage, 20 hours a week.
9. Decided I wanted to pursue computers / programming. Figured I'd do IT. Ragequit the Rite-Aid job.
10. Found a part-time database technician (Microsoft Access) job. $10/hr.
11. Couldn't go to college without a G.E.D, so I went and got that.
12. Enrolled in Niagara County Community College for an Associates in CS with G.E.D.
13. Finished a 2 year degree in a little over 2 years, excellent grades in programming classes, shit grades elsewhere (3.1 GPA).
14. Decided I hated the weather in NY, moved to AZ and transferred to ASU. Credits didn't line up, so I lost a year. 
15. Landed first software dev job (internship) @ \~20/hr after a year in AZ. Enterprise Java &amp; AWS.
16. They offered to hire me as a full-time engineer @ 22/hr after 3 months. I accepted.
17. Finished BSCS with a 2.9 GPA in another 2 years. Repeated some classes, didn't really care about them much (since I was working full time as an engineer already).
18. With degree in hand now, in the middle of a pretty stressful but lucrative project, I said I'd leave unless I got a raise. They gave me one: $72.5k/yr salaried.
19. I decided I hated the heat, and returned to NY. Continued working remote 100%.
20. Laid off because I was remote. Found a new job in Buffalo: $75k/yr.
21. Volunteered for anything and everything. Embraced responsibility and learning new things. Started leading meetings as scrum master, and suggested a migration to AWS, which I also led. Promoted to Sr. Software Engineer in 8 months: bump to $82k.
22. Decided the $7k raise wasn't enough, started to see what else was out there.
23. Figured an AWS job would be neat, studied for Solution Architect - Associate cert. Finished that.
24. Landed a remote AWS Solution Architect / Senior Dev role for $138k annually.
25. Quit job, accepted remote AWS offer. Now 27.
26. Bought a Hellcat (because fuck normality), drove across the country back to AZ (I think I missed the cacti).
27. Still working remotely, with entrepreneurial pursuits on the side. I don't really want to work for other people anymore.
28. Posted my story on Reddit so people might not feel bummed about their situation."

alxy1a,0,2019-01-31,Some suggestions for incoming CS students,Neotoxin4365,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/alxy1a/some_suggestions_for_incoming_cs_students/,"1. CS240 is hellish with Jeff Turkstra. He has absolutely ridiculous coding standards and he LOOOOOVES to report you to the Dean of Students for some of the most trivial reasons. (Like speaking during the lecture, going to a section you're not registered for, or simply Googling) Anyone saying he's fair are either coding dummies or have Stockholm syndrome. ~~ECE264 counts towards CS240, so if there's no way to avoid him during your semester, talk to your advisor to see if you can take ECE264 instead.~~(update: according to  [captainpyotr](https://www.reddit.com/user/captainpyotr) ECE264 only transfer into your CS degree if you CODO from ECE to CS. Still talk to your advisor though)
2. If you’re not very confident about your coding skills, or if you just want to relax a bit during your first semester, go ahead with CS180. It’s a good class for newbies. Otherwise, for anyone having a decent amount of coding experience before coming to Purdue, CS180 is a waste of time. A 5 in AP CS is probably enough for you to bypass CS180 without any issues, but it'll be better if you have coding experiences outside the classroom. Talk to your advisor and they'll put you through a proficiency exam, which is pretty much the final exams from previous years. It's not hard, but you're unlikely to get over their cutoffs if you don't study for it. Don't take CS180 only as a GPA booster; there are so many other GPA boosters available to you in and out of the department. That includes EPICS and most of the CS39000 classes.
3. CS193, Tools, is basically an introductory class for Linux and Git. Here's everything you'll learn in this class: git add, git commit, git merge, git branch, git push, cd, ls, ssh, pwd, cp, mv, rm, Pull Requests. If you already know half of them, try to figure out a way to skip this class.
4. Use the credit you saved from CS193 on CS39000CP1, Competitive Programming. Highly Recommended. Probably the only class taught by TAs that doesn't suck. No coding standard, no bubble sheets, only actual codes and algorithms. Super beneficial to your technical interviews.
5. Another benefit of bypassing CS180 is that as long as you have credits for MA165, you get to take CS251 Data Structures in your second semester, which is super helpful for your internships.
6. Purdue's ECE program is in the College of Engineering; CS is in College of Science. For that reason, it's not that easy to transfer between the two programs. So if you're in CS but love hardware more, or if you're in ECE but finds coding quite enjoyable, please talk to your advisor. You can probably do a CS + ECE minor, or ECE + CS minor. Some of the courses in the two departments are duplicated, but the credit most likely does not count towards your degree. (You may also join [Purdue SCSE](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SCSEPURDUE) and embark on a 20-year unsuccessful journey of bringing the two departments together)
7. CS182 is Discrete Math, even though there's no way to know by simply looking at its title: The Foundation of Computer Science.
8. Ranjani Rao is the best academic advisor in the CS department, as far as I know. Most of the advisors would discourage you from doing anything beyond the standard plan of study, because statistically students who follows that have a higher chance of graduating in 4 years. However, I don't think anyone should trust statistics more than they trust themselves.
9. CS Honors is different from the Honors College. You don’t get honors housing or priority registration. I would only recommend it if you plan on doing grad school, or if for some other reasons it plays well with your degree planning. If you do end up in the CS Honors program, definitely take CS197 the honors seminar. It’s not a lot of work but it gives you an overview about the research topics in the department.

I have been so frustrated, so burnt out, and so temperamental lately with regards to my choice of career that these toxic emotions have prevented me from sleeping or eating regularly.  I've always had issues with anxiety and depression (probably since grade school), but being in CS has accelerated it over the past 2-3 years.  I'm one of *those people* only in CS for the money (because I can't make any off my actual passions), and yet somehow my whole life has been forced to revolve around it.  I just feel completely overwhelmed and unsatisfied with my current state of being.  

My program has \~6 mandatory math/engineering courses per term, and I am very limited in my choice of electives.  With assignments/labs/interviews on top of that, I feel constantly stuck doing something I never enjoyed to begin with.  I was willing to put up with it for the first four terms because there was always another 4 months of internships looming ahead with money and free weekends, but I never enjoyed those internships either.  I my peers being excited about their work and companies and the shit they were learning but I could never feel the same.  And I contributed *a lot* and learned *a lot* and did very different work each time and had some great evaluations from my coworkers and managers--yet everything always felt like a slog.  Even if there was free food and ping pong I still couldn't find any interest in it and always dreaded waking up for work every morning.  I've done some more menial work for free and felt better about it.  During my last internship I became so depressed that I started eating only once every one or two days (binge-eating every week or so) and often became unable to sleep.  I know that this is just a matter of me being spoiled and I should understand that the vast majority of people in the world have it way worse than me.  I can't help it.

What's worse, the skills I have in the things I do actually care about are starting to degrade because I haven't invested enough time in them.  I know better than many that I should be appreciative of the fact that I am headed for a career path that will grant me a stable job fresh out of school with a decently-high salary, but I am just completely burnt out and lost with what to do.  It's internship season at our school again and I should be preparing for interviews but the thought of them gives me so much anxiety that I can't.  Looking at Leetcode makes me want to throw up.  I haven't been paying attention in any of my classes because I have zero interest in them and I don't see the point anymore (can't wait to fail midterms).  I want nothing more than to take a semester off and re-organize my thoughts, but doing so will delay my graduation by a year.  Everyone assures me that everything will get better once I get a Big 4/Big N offer, but will it?

I am such a weak fucking bitch.  How do I learn to just suck it up?  Or is there a better way to handle things?"

I’m a current undergraduate junior and am choosing between two internship (“Company X” and “Company “Y”) offers for this coming summer.  I’ve never been great at making the hard decisions, and thought it’d be best to reach out to all of you for any input.

Company X is healthcare consulting and was thus early in the cycle, and offered me a position back around Thanksgiving.  I accepted, having no other alternative at the time.

Company Y is biotech sales and offered me a position last week.  I applied to both companies at the same time, but this one had a much longer interview process.  I decided to continue with it primarily to make connections.

Here is my dilemma:

“Y” is a large and reputable name (5000-10000 employees), is in my home US city, and has offered a wage 20% higher than “X”.  “X” is more of a niche firm (500-1000 employees), but is known within that niche and would involve relocating to one of the largest metropolitan centers in the US.  I think I like the culture and potential work at “X”, and especially being a STEM student and unable to travel abroad, this could be a very exciting experience to move away temporarily.  That said, I’m not sure if it is worth the 20% less wage coupled with rent in that expensive area, versus higher wage and no rent if living at home and commuting to “Y”.  Furthermore, I’m not sure how they’ll look different on my resume (going for some kind of healthcare/biopharma career) Also, I worry that leaving “X” after having committed 2 months ago will damage by reputation, integrity, and connections there.

What are some ways you all have developed to make informed decisions?  Could I postpone the “Y” internship until next summer (would not accepting and then reapplying hurt my chances next year?)?  Is the experience worth more than the money in the long run?  Are they looked out differently?  If going with “Y”, how do I tell “X”?

I appreciate all your help, and am happy to answer questions.  Thank you!"

I have worked in aviation maintenance and manufacturing maintenance since I was 17 (37 now). I have delayed finishing school for a long time because I was making good money and didn't really need a degree to progress. I finally got to the point where I have plateaued, and I need to use my education benefits from military service before I lose them, so I have gone back to school. If I keep on pace I will graduate with a B.S. in IT (Data Networking &amp; Security focus) May of 2020. I currently make around 90k/yr before overtime and have averaged 130k with overtime (not sustainable much longer). There is quite a bit of uncertainty in the industry I am in (manufacturing) as far as job security. Things don't look great at the moment, and the 5 year forecast isn't stellar either. Finishing my degree will hopefully help with my employability should the worse happen and my place of employment shuts down. My questions are the following:


-What can I do to make myself more attractive to employers in the IT sphere after I finish my degree? I plan on working on industry certs after I finish school. 


-What industry certs will be most beneficial to the largest audience of employers?


-How badly will my lack of having direct IT experience affect my prospects? I have a large amount of experience with computers in general, and experience troubleshooting network issues with specialized equipment of a large variety. I also in general excel at problem solving. 


-Any ideas on how to gain relevant experience while maintaining a full time job? I have a kind of chaotic work schedule and it would be hard to work an internship even part time.

I should note that my previous inability to find a position in my field was mainly based on my lack of CS skills, as I did most of my education in biochemistry before switching to bioinformatics in my Master's. Additionally, I am currently based in Switzerland, where the job market is very competitive.


While I have given a lot of thought to the PhD route, I have also found myself doubting whether I would really thrive in such an environment, or whether I really want to pursue the academia/industry careers after a PhD. As an alternative, I have also considered taking a second Master's, or some other academic program to try and build my skills within computer science (particularly within data science). An example of such a program would be: https://www.ethz.ch/content/associates/continuing-education/en/programme-und-kurse/angebot-nach-programmart/zertifikatsprogramme.html?polycourseId=1168


On the other hand, I have had some colleagues warn me that a second Master's or additional programs might not necessarily make me a stronger job candidate, as it would deprive me of work experience in a professional environment.


Would anybody recommend one pathway for another? I am open to hearing any advice at all.

am2x1u,142,2019-02-01,[Pizza Pie Friday] An update from your friend Analyst Kyle (and some advice),Silent_Packmule,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/am2x1u/pizza_pie_friday_an_update_from_your_friend/,"It’s been almost a year since I wrote that post about [Analyst Kyle and his absurd project manager](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/83zvnf/working_with_a_bizarre_project_manager_is_this/) so I thought I’d give everyone an update.

In the year since that post I have transferred to Mckinsey despite not knowing how to index match on Excel. Every day is a new hell as I try to navigate my professional world without anyone finding out. I actually will stay late after work sorting through values and matching them manually. Never been caught, refuse to change.

I also have a smoking hot BCG girlfriend who drives Mercedes G class. She picks me up after work and all my other analyst friends are jealous because they haven’t felt human affection in years.

I also learned a cool life hack from Mitt Romney from back when he was having an affair with my ex-wife, he told me that if you track the amount of time you poop in the office and then bank it, you basically use it as PTO. So far this year I’ve pooped for 7 hours in the office, I plan on taking a day off next week but now I won’t have to use any of my actual PTO.

\------------------

Ok so here’s the real update. Hello everyone, I am “Analyst Kyle” as some refer to me. I am a college student and my only real connection to the consulting world is 1 summer of Big 4 consulting. I have accepted an offer from an strategy boutique for next year so come this summer I will officially be an analyst.

I think a lot of college students use this subreddit as a way to get an insight into consulting and the recruiting process, so I am hoping I can provide a little advice to people like me who wanted to break in.

I decided on consulting my junior year after working two unpaid internships in politics. I met some great people at both, but the work made me miserable. Consulting seemed like an opportunity where I could actually use my brain so I pursued it.

As a junior, I didn’t have a lot of flexibility to switch majors and since I was a Political Science major, I didn’t have a lot of quantitative or business coursework under my belt. I also went to a non-target school and did not have an MBB qualifying GPA at the time. All these factors made me incredibly insecure so I tried to address them in ways that I could. I took more quant classes outside my major and did well in them and I networked as much as I could. Even with all this I still got rejected from 100+ internships as a junior. It wasn’t until a stroke of sheer luck that I landed an internship with a Big 4 firm. I wrote the Analyst Kyle post the same day I accepted the internship offer.

Like many college students, I got caught up in the prestige of it. I had no idea what being a consultant was like so I imagined this sexy lifestyle of living in New York and wearing suits that made me look like a douchebag and charging meals at Steven Starr restaurants to a company Amex. This was a stark contrast from my internship where the dress code was business casual and I was working in the basement of a government building in a flyover state. Nonetheless I enjoyed what I was doing because I had a high variability in what I was doing and the work itself was important.

When my internship ended, I ended up turning down the return offer. I started recruiting for college seniors which was an incredibly stressful process. The recruiting process definitely took a toll on my mental health. I would ace cases and bomb behaviorals. I would walk out of interviews thinking I nailed them and then get a rejection email the next morning. I helped friends that had never done a case before and they would get interviews at firms that never even looked my way. The girl I was dating got an offer from Oliver Wyman in the same week that we broke up. I got to the final round of three separate firms and then got rejected from all of them in the same week. In the end, I only had two offers.

There’s so much advice about casing and interview prep so saying anything about that would be redundant. Instead, I want to give some broader advice: Whatever the outcome of your consulting journey, even if you don’t get an offer, the process itself is largely worth it. I say this as a person that underwent an immense amount of stress and rejection, but through it all I can see the silver linings.

I realized shortly after the process that practicing case interviews helped me breakdown everyday problems in a more organized way. My ability to do mental math helped me while studying for the GRE and other classes. The rejections I received made me resilient and gave me direction for improvement. When I look at the people I helped with casing, they’re going to have an amazing future and I’m glad I got to play a role in that. Had it not been for interview prepping, I would have never met a girl who—while briefly—was an important part of my life.

I think when I internalized those lessons, I realized that I have a lot to show for the work I put in. I’m not working in MBB, but I have something to be proud of. I also know that whether I got an offer or didn’t, I’d be fine either way.

So in short, it’s easy to lose sight of things when you get caught up in salaries and prestige. Those things are important, but they’re far from being the most important thing in your life. If you think about your failures, you can often times find a direction towards success and appreciation. 

Hope this helped someone and may your next pizza pie Friday be filled with pepperoni and punctual deliverables.

Best,

Analyst Kyle

am38i7,2,2019-02-01,Emailing about a job that isn’t advertised?,luke_bob,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/am38i7/emailing_about_a_job_that_isnt_advertised/,"So I’ve been looking for internships for about a month now and I’ve submitted about 8 applications and haven’t heard anything back yet. I feel like I’m pretty qualified so I don’t think that’s the problem. I know a month of searching isn’t long but I’m super anxious to get out and get some real world experience.

But one of my friends who is two years older than me got an internship by emailing a local company and simply asking if they had any room for a sales intern, even though there were no jobs listed anywhere for any such position. They brought him in for an interview, liked him a lot, he’s worked there for awhile and now he is about to be hired full time when he graduates. 

Anyone have advice on emailing companies that don’t have jobs listed? Is this something that people do often or did my friend just get lucky?"
am3i2i,8,2019-02-01,Feeling stuck in IT support.. Advice?,LakesMN,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/am3i2i/feeling_stuck_in_it_support_advice/,"Currently I’m 27 years old with 9 years “employed” (internships included) working in support. I got a sociology BA in 2014 with a minor in Information Systems and continued to pursue IT after college (way easier to find a job). I landed a  support job right out of college that I worked for a year and then jumped to my current job (support for a law firm) for the 10k pay raise and better benefits. I’m coming up on my 3rd year here and now I feel stuck.

Like most company structures, we have two sides in our tech department, Support &amp; Netops.

Let me paint a picture for you –

I’m one of two Millennials in the entire IT structure at our law firm. It’s very old school and there is barely any turn over. Our law firm likes to fill gaps in the corporate structure through internal hiring (this is great, right?). Anyway, all my peers in the tech support team have been here for 10+ more years (not necessarily in the tech realm) except my millennial counterpart that sits behind me. They are “comfortable” per say because I think the firm gives them a sense of job security which is great, but a lot of them did not come from an IT background. So not only in my bullshit day to day do I have to work with lawyers with big ego’s (“I make 700 dollars an hour and this is the type of support I get..” etc.) I have to answer questions for many of the ten-yeared folks on my support team because they have become Bots that just ask others for the quick fix instead of wanting to learn how it is fixed or what they’re doing to fix it. (If you’re apart of an older generation, by all means, I’m looking for your advice and not harping on your generation as a whole.. Just my current situation!)

The firm has wonderful medical benefits, 401k matching, profit sharing (bigger piece of the pie w/ longevity), and bonuses for staff at the end of the year based on how well the firm does (again more with longevity), minimal turnover, inside hiring, you get the picture of why people are staying.

I have expressed to my boss that I would ideally like to move to the netops side literally doing anything, sysadmin, network, security, etc. The only problem is again, no turnover, and the people currently in Netops are late 30s/early 40s so they still have some time before they move up/retire which I believe decreases my chances to switch to the other side. I am at a standstill and do not want to become a robot in Tech support waiting for the opportunity to get over that next hurdle. I’ve been here for almost 3 years and literally 1 person has left in the entire tech department (someone in netops but they didn’t backfill, someone just absorbed their daily roles). Many people in Netops started out where I am but I am getting comfortable and that is a scary thought to me. It has already been 3 years w/ no movement and I’m not sure I should continue to sit and wait. I’m well aware that if the time comes where a job opens up on the Netops side, my name will be high up in the conversation but again I’d basically be waiting on someone elses fate for mine to change.

Has anyone been in a situation that is close to mine? What did you do to change? Does it pay off to wait? Should I look for a new job? Does only having a support background limit my chances of moving companies to do advanced work, sysadmin, networking, security? Have certifications helped you advance your career faster (after my 3rd year here the firm will pay for any certification I want) if so what certs etc..? Is there a direction you recommend to go down? Security/Network

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I realize i'm fortunate to have a job period the firm does take care of their employees. I'm merely seeking advancement advice!"

Last time on Smol Roadtrip:

•tragicbackstory.mp4

•Therapy sneks.

•Esshriss wants Dylan’s soy sauce.

•And maybe other sauces.

•I don’t judge.

—————

Leave it to the Americans to build a McDonalds in front one of greatest creations known to man. Given, there was also a massive parking garage and memorial plaque dedicated to the men and reptiles that died in Atlanta. But if there wasn’t a chain restaurant nearby the elevator, capitalism would have surely been abolished and the commies would’ve won.

Dylan parked on the second to top floor of the garage. After examining the area around them, he stepped out to Esshriss.

“We made it, milk snake.” A blue head popped out from the truck. “How’s your soy withdraw going?”

“[Still a bit shaky. Are you sure you don’t have any more?]”

“No, absolutely not.” He shook his head. “What matters now is that we get you up there as soon as possible.”

“[...About that. I… still can’t be seen, so…]” She paused, letting the implications be known.

“Do you honestly have no plan whatsoever?”

“[Neither do you!]”

“Because I’m not the one who-“ He rubbed his eyes. “Okay. Okay. So I took you 3,000 miles across state borders just so you could sit in my car and do nothing?”

“[I wouldn’t phrase it like that, but-]”

He groaned, wanting nothing more than to smash his head against a wall. “Great. Fine. Fantastic.” He fished inside for another beer. “Don’t you have a friend up there? Maybe he could do… something?”

“[Kr’tikz’? He’d want nothing more than to help, but I don’t see what he could do for us.]”

“You have a better idea?”

“[I…]”

“That’s what I thought. So here’s how we’re going to do this: I’m going to walk up there, ask for your feathered friend, and we’ll figure out something from there.”

“[What about me?]”

“You? You stay in here, stay warm, eat some snacks, and *don’t be seen*.”

She deflated slightly, but gave a soft nod. “[Be careful. They’ll arrest you too if they realize you’re smuggling me in.]”

“Relax. It’s a space elevator.” He grabbed the commbead. “How hard can it be?”


—————


“Sir, I’ve already told you. I’m not permitted to let you on the station without proper documentation.” The intern stared at him with tired eyes. He obviously had dealt with people like Dylan before.

Dylan, for his part, was not sympathetic. “Look, it can’t be that hard to let it slide. I just need to hop up there for a minute and I’ll be out of your hair. Do a guy a favor, yea?”

“Sir, if you continue to be noncompliant, I’ll have security escort you out.”

“Listen here you… I… I’ve got a friend up there. He’ll vouch for me. His name’s Kr’tikz’. Big red Karnakian. Can’t miss him.”

“I don’t think a Karnakian would have the authority to-“

“Just call them, okay? Do the one thing you’re hired to do.”

The intern reluctantly turned to a device behind his desk.

“Hello… Yeah, I’ve got a guy down here on ol’ terra firma, says he knows a Karnakian named Kr’tikz’... Dylan Richmond, he doesn’t have any of his papers on him… yes, I can hold for a moment...”

He glanced up at Dylan with eyes that said *‘I don’t care what you’re here for, I just want you out of my sight.’*

“Yes, Dylan Richmond. He’s got his driver’s license with him but not much else… really? But he… alright. I’ll send him up.”

“See? I told you.” He put on his most winning smile.

“Yes… apologies for the confusion. We still have to scan you for contraband, but afterwards you’ll be on your way up. Welcome to Zephyr Station 5. Enjoy your stay.”


—————


Esshriss, when the day dragged on and she had nothing better to do, often would hum to herself. Never a single tune, more a collection of notes and rhythms that held her focus.

“&lt;Hmmsssssssmmmhsss&gt;”

She was contemplating sliding into the front to grab a small meal when the echoes of a bipedal step met her ears. She reactively rushed underneath the cloth, only her eyes visible.

The [human] turned the corner, dressed unlike most she had ever seen. While typically they would wear light, colorful fabrics, or thicker ones in colder environments, this [human] was covered head to tail in metallic uniform. ‘Security Guard,’ She decided. A weapon was hung at his side, and he was donned with a pair strange, faintly glowing goggles. 

And he noticed her.

As he barked at her from across the floor, Esshriss had a moment to consider her predicament. The guard had seen her in through the blanket, which meant that something else had given her away. The goggles? That would make sense if they allowed their wielder to see thermal or other refractions of light. But if that was the case, it would also indicate that they were prepared for her. Looking for her. Had… had Dylan told them? Had he betrayed her?

This entire time, the [human] continued his tirade against the definitely not hidden Esshriss, his weapon now drawn.

“Ont moav! Iave bah kup onawai! Stai wehre yuore!

Why had she let Dylan take the commbead? Cursing inwardly, Esshriss rose from her hiding spot. Maybe she could reason with him?

“&lt;Hello! I am not a threat! Please calm down!&gt;” She made an attempt to carefully enunciate each of her words.

Unfortunately, the [human] either didn’t have his own commbead, or didn’t care what she had to say. Regardless, the man fired, narrowly missing Esshriss’ hood. She ducked down as he continued his assault, and considered her options. She could flee, but ranged weaponry made that solution worthless. Attacking the [human] wouldn’t be much better. If he got a clean shot off before she could reach him, she’d be dead. Maybe if she…

Her thoughts were interrupted as a small object flew into her bunker. Roughly the size of the [human]’s hand, the orb landed unceremoniously about half a [meter] in front of her. Esshriss recoiled, recognizing the standard LEDs of a suppression grena-

The sphere burst into a spiral of blinding lights. What would’ve been a mildly annoying display to any other species became a near-death experience to the unexpecting Jornissian. Vibrant flashes in every spectrum flooded her brain before it finally decided to give up on sight. Blinded by the pain and actual blindness, Esshriss curled into herself, hissing at the darkness. Vision was the world to a Jornissian, and without it, ancient, terrified parts of the mind screamed.

“&lt;Please no I’m sorry I can’t see why can’t I see I’m scared don’t hurt me please.&gt;” She whispered to no one in particular.

After a minute, the [human] calmly moved closer and placed the barrel of his firearm on her neck. Staring into nothingness, Esshriss lost hope. She went limp, knowing how close she had come to safety and yet how far. Would it be painless? Probably not, but anything would be better than the empty void that had swallowed her eyes. Bracing herself, she felt the metal pierce her scales...

...

...But she was still alive. Was this death? Did the world go on without her? Leaving her mind to the abyss? Behind her, the guard muttered something, and called other to two new sets of… footsteps.

“Ioter! Shesa fista on, ail gevherhat, bute yuosholbae saveh.”

Esshriss realized that she felt… very tired, as if she hadn’t slept for... the entire trip. Was this what the warm… cuddles felt like at… night? She… closed her eyes… just for a moment… and…… faded...


—————


Dylan couldn’t help but feel like something was about to go horribly wrong. It was completely irrational, right? His expedition’s end was behind this recently-replaced door, and then he could go home...

But it had been too easy.

Nonetheless, he knocked impatiently on the steel frame of the office door. Almost immediately, the door swung open, and his vision went red.

“[[Human]! Mrs. Pavlov tells me you have met Esshriss! Is she here? How did you find her? Thank you so much!]”

The Dylan from a week ago would’ve struggled with all his might to escape the Karnakian’s grasp. But now, after spending several days with another xeno, he met the alien physicality of the greeting unfazed. He simply let the raptor tire himself out.

After twenty seconds of Close Encounters of the Bird Kind, the joyous Karnakian dropped him. He never stopped chirping, though.

“[...and it must of been so stressful! I can’t thank you enough! How did you-]”

“Kr’tikz’!” The woman behind the desk snapped. “That’s plenty. Leave the man alone. We’ll both have plenty time to hear his story, but he needs to breathe first.”

Dylan pushed himself up, coughing up a plume. “I’m fine. Got a PhD in extra-terrestrial cuddles.”

‘Pavlov’ snorted. “Don’t we all?” She straightened up. “My name is Anna Pavlov, and I’m the Director of Zephyr Station 5. Quite honestly, I’m just as bewildered as the raptor. I thought you were dead.”

“I’m sorry, have we met before?”

“No, I… hmm.” She paused. “Let’s start from the very beginning. It seems we both have some explaining to do. I’d offer you a seat, but Kr’tikz’ shattered my only one.”

The Karnakian smiled.


—————


“So you left her in the back of your truck, in the middle of a parking garage, alone, and without a translator?”

“Well I couldn’t do much else, yeah? I’m sure you’d be a lot less civil if I had waltzed up front with a Jornissian in tow. ‘Hello ma’am, allow me to offer you a snake I found. I know I am breaking several inter-species laws and treaties but please allow me to do because the snake is very sorry for her actions.’”

“No, it’s not that! We thought Esshriss had harmed you or worse, so I added a couple extra precautions to my staff here and in Anchorage. And since she doesn’t have a-“ Anna was interrupted by a knock on the door. “This day keeps getting better… Kr’tikz’. Make yourself useful and let them in, will you?”

Kr’tikz’ nodded with the same enthusiasm of a toddler about to get ice cream, and took a single step to reach the handle.

*thump*

A scaled mass of blue flopped before the Karnakian, who, for the first time that day, lost his smile.

“[Esshriss?]”

*Fuck.*

Anna was met with a set of two and four eyes. Kr’tikz’s face was a mix of utter disbelief and betrayal, and would have been Anna’s focus if it wasn’t for the furious Dylan currently rampaging towards her.

“YOU BITCH! YOU KILLED HER! I BROUGHT HER THIS ENTIRE WAY AND YOU MURDERED HER! I’LL KILL YO-“ 

His tirade was cut off as his face drooped, and he collapsed onto her desk. A chromatic dart was prominently displayed on his neck.

She ignored the unconscious man on her desk, and faced the three men outside the room. “Was a Jornissian tranquilizer necessary?”

“Karnakian, actually. We assumed the raptor was going to be the problem.”

Anna rubbed her face. “Great. Bring him to the medical bay. If he dies from an overdose, I won’t hear the end of it. Put the snake somewhere too, and keep them there until they’re awake and civil.” She reached for her espresso, which miraculously had only spilt a tiny bit of liquid.

“[I don’t… Are they dead?]” Kr’tikz’ asked, trying to take up as little space as possible and failing miserably.

“Nope.” She took a sip. “Just unconscious. I’m sure they’ll have plenty to say in… oh, about twelve hours.”

“[I’m not sure if I should be grateful or upset…]”

“Grateful. It makes my job a lot easier if we don’t have to shoot you too.”


—————


Esshriss woke up. 

Well, that’s what she would’ve called if she could see. Instead, her conscious mind was only really good for thinking about the darkness around her and the cold, smooth surface underneath. You couldn’t really be awake if you couldn’t sense anything.

After stretching some sore muscles, she mustered a quiet plea.

“&lt;...hello? I-I don’t know where I am. Hello?&gt;”

The soft hum of an robotic speaker made itself known. “&lt; *Esshriss’rsk. Jornissian. Optical damage detected. Please remain motionless.* &gt;” 

Before she could protest, something flashed into her eyes. The sudden burst of light revealed the world in layers, first monochromatic, then colored, then everything else. Adjusting to the sudden, painful brightness, Esshriss was able to make out the square structure of her cell.

“&lt; *Optical functions restored. Optical nerves will be acutely sensitive for approximately 10-14 [hours]. Please use the provided equipment to reduce the risk of visual trauma. A station official will meet with you shortly.* &gt;” A black set of plastic dropped onto the ground, which she frantically placed onto her eyes. The room dimmed significantly, but it was better than a world of excruciatingly bright lights.

A door to her left hissed open, and a familiar figure stepped through.

“&lt;D-Director Pavlov! I’m sorry for-&gt;”

She raised a hand to silence Esshriss, and tossed her a new commbead. 

“[Is it working?]” The Director asked as Esshriss put on the device.

“&lt;Y-yes. Director, I’m begging you-&gt;”

“[Please, stop. I don’t want to explain my verdict twice. If you can move, I would appreciate it if you would follow me.]”

Esshriss nodded solemnly, and allowed herself to be escorted by the silent [human]. Turning a corner, they entered a room similar to the one she was just in, save for the obviously [human] proportions.

“[Esshriss!]” A blur of crimson tackled her as she entered the cell, knocking her onto the floor.

“&lt;Kr’tikz’?! By Sotek-who-circles-the-world, I never thought I’d see you again!&gt;”

Kr’tikz’ replied with a mixture of maybe-words and chirps, spreading his plumage everywhere. Behind the massive reptile, a small bed caught her eye.

“&lt;Is that… Dylan!&gt;” She struggled from underneath Kr’tikz’, and slid to the cot’s side.

“[As it turns out, [human] physiology is not the most receptive to Karnakian depressants.]” Pavlov spoke up from the entrance. “[We managed to get most of it out of his system, so he’ll live. He’s a little sporadic, though.]”

As if to illustrate her point, Dylan’s eyes fluttered open.

“&lt;Dylan!&gt;”

“[Heeeey Esshrisshhh…]” He replied, his speech slurred. “[Whyyy are you… weeearing [sunglaaassess]?]”

“&lt;I shouldn’t have thrown you into this mess. You didn’t deserve any of this.&gt;”

“[Thhhas a funny jooke. You… knohh why that chickhen crosses thah roooad?]”

A small hand appeared on Esshriss’ shoulder. “[I don’t mean to interrupt what is surely a heartfelt and emotional reunion, but there are legal matters I need to discuss. With *all* of you.]” Kr’tikz’ head sprung up, and he trotted over to Esshriss’s side.

“&lt;Whatever crimes we’ve been convicted of, I take full respons-&gt;”

“[**Stop.**]” Pavlov barked. “[Don’t interrupt me. Honestly, I would want nothing more than to turn you two over to the OIH and let them handle this garbage fire. Some part of me is still clinging onto the idea that they’ll charge through that door right now and arrest all of you.]”

Esshriss pushed inward on her ball of coils, and Kr’tikz’ looked like he was shrinking. Dylan continued to murmur incomprehensible things about [apple sauce] and the political turmoil in eastern [Pakistan].

“[*However*, doing would invoke a diplomatic [shitstorm] of an unprecedented scale, and I can’t exactly say I want to shatter [human]-xeno relations. So, I’ll give you two a choice. You can stay here and weather whatever hell the OIH has planned for you. Or, we can give you a ship, and you can go wherever you want, so long as it’s not Earth.]”

“[When could we come back?]” Kr’tikz’ asked.

“[Never. Too much of a liability. And if I did ever see you back on [Terran] territory, I’d report you directly to the OIH.]”

“&lt;...what about Dylan?&gt;” Dylan, in response, argued that plaid socks should not be allowed in a court of law.

“[He’d be fine either way. The OIH’d only charge him with failure to report a felony. Maybe being an accessory to a crime. A few years of jail time at most. And if you two left, he could head back to [Alaska] and live out the rest of his life free of Jornissian [hitchhikers].]”

Esshriss glanced at Dylan. She didn’t really have a choice, did she? Either pretend like nothing happened, or destroy three lives and possibly many more. It was obvious! But something still tugged at the edge of her mind...

“&lt;If we left, could he come with us?&gt;”

Director Pavlov seemed mildly amused. “[Dylan? I suppose that would save us the trouble of driving him back to [Anchorage]. We’d have to make adjustments to the ship, and it would ultimately depend on how he feels about the decision, but it would be feasible.]”

Kr’tikz’ was definitely on board with the idea. “[Our own [human]! We could take him Orbiting with us! And he could visit our families, and we could celebrate ?error: untranslated phrase: Karnakian seasonal festivity? together!]”

Director Pavlov ignored his ramblings. “[Though, I do have to wonder. Why do you want to take him with you?]”

“&lt;I’m not sure…&gt;” She stared at the drugged [human], who had fallen asleep again. “&lt;I just… I don’t want to leave him. He needs someone.&gt;”


—————


The last month had been full of new experiences. Several weeks ago, Dylan had nothing to look forward too. Living off savings and wondering if it was possible to sleep in forever. Then, a snake broke into his house and took him halfway across the country and into space.

Waking up on that same space station with a collective total of eight eyes looking down on him was also a novel concept. 

“...do I have something on my face?”

Several conversations and half a ton of paperwork later, Dylan was the official ‘Navigator’ of his own ship. Given, the ship functioned primarily through AI, but it was nice to have a title.

He was also allowed to download a large swath of (limited) human media onto the ship. He would’ve taken more Adam Sandler movies with him, but Esshriss insisted on a series of books on human psychology that he’d obviously never read.

After another week of calibrations, the newly christened *S.S. Auroraboros* was go for launch. Nodding to the nearby staff, he, a Jornissian, and a Karnakian walked into the hull.

“[Bye!]” Kr’tikz’ screeched.

Pavlov waved unenthusiastically. “Bye. Come back never.” 

The pressurized door hissed shut, and Dylan sat at his console.

“[*Calibrations are orange for launch. Warp Drive and power supply at 97% efficiency.*]” Esshriss spoke from a fresh, new commbead on his ear. He still had the old one, though. A souvenir of sorts.

“Navigation systems are orange too. Where do you want head first? Copy.”

“[*I’d like to show you and Kr’tikz’ my homeworld. You could use a little sunlight. Also, you don’t have to end every message with ‘copy’.*]”

“Understood. Setting destination to ‘Rashes and Hens’. Copy.”

There was a pause before Esshriss spoke up again. “[*Captain Kr’tikz’, give us a countdown.*]”

A series of roars and chirps made Dylan flinch before his translator kicked in. “[*Yes! The shuttle will launch in 5… 4…*]” The ship began to hum. “[*... 3… 2…*]” Outside, the station’s walls opened to the gaping void. “[*...1!*]”

A sudden burst of speed knocked Dylan out of his seat and onto the wall. The acceleration kept him pinned there, blood frozen in place. His body felt a hundred times heavier. From around the corner, Kr’tikz’ ran towards him, seemingly impervious to the high Gs. All of a sudden, the acceleration stopped, and he was flung towards the fluffy mass.

“Ufff… Thanks, Kr’tikz’.”

“[Are you unharmed, [human]? I almost wasn’t there to catch you in time!]”

Esshriss slithered into view, shaking her hood. “[He’s fine. Maybe that impact will knock some sense into him. Why weren’t you wearing your safety harness?]”

“Thought I was fine without it…” He managed. “...but spaceships have a bit more ‘oomph’ in them than my truck.”

“[I know how to help!]” Kr’tikz’ squeaked. “[A game! We have several [human] games onboard! [Checkers] or [Chess]?]”

“Let me take a breather first. Plus, I might want to try a Karnakian board game. We have any of those?”

Kr’tikz’ nodded, and scrambled elsewhere. Esshriss took this time to wrap her tail around Dylan legs, tripping him.

“Woah!” 

*thump*

“Thanks a lot, blue racer.” He rubbed his head.

She coiled around him and ‘hugged’, though it felt like he was being crushed. “[Thanks for coming with us.]”

After a moment, she let him go onto the floor. Gasping for breath, he coughed out a reply. “You’re… welcome…”

“[I bring the classic game of Tv’vik Tk’viv’!]” Kr’tikz’ yelled as he returned, carrying a crate larger than Dylan. It was practically overflowing with colored shards of steel and other strange materials.

“Wait, watch where you’re going!” Dylan cried, but it was too late. 

The Karnakian fell over him, dropping the box and it’s dubious contents onto Esshriss. She recoiled, flinging what looked to be giant thumb-tacks outwards. Dylan was luckily shielded by Kr’tikz’, who was vehemently apologizing to both of them.

In a moment of clarity, Dylan realized something. For the first time in many years, he felt genuinely... happy. A sliver of his mind still whispered dark thoughts, but it didn’t matter. He had a future to look forward to. He had horizons to explore, and stories to be told.

He wouldn’t be alone.

**END SMOL ROADTRIP ARC 1**

—————

And there we go. I might make a few oneshots or continue the story later, but for now I think this is good. Thanks for all the support, and I hope you enjoyed Esshriss and Dylan’s journey.

Also, no pancakes for Kr’tikz’. He’s not much of a breakfast guy.

am3wfm,0,2019-02-01,[SUCCESS STORY] From ~20K/year to 85K/year in 3 years,deathcat5,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/am3wfm/success_story_from_20kyear_to_85kyear_in_3_years/,"I just have to join bandwagon now. 

&amp;#x200B;

All my life I wanted to be a veterinarian and growing up my family was never financially stable. I had no college account waiting for me when I turned 18, nothing. After high school, I ended up going to community college because it was the only option I could afford. Ended up spending three years there because I had to work full time (\~13/hr) to pay my bills which only allowed me to go to school part-time. 

My last semester of community college I realized I did not want to be a veterinarian. My life was crushed. What the heck was I going to do now? I ended up messing around with photo alteration using Python and immediately fell in love with programming. It was then I decided to switch to computer science. I ended up getting an AA degree but still had to work full time when transferring to a university. 

From 2015-2016, I worked full time and began my computer science degree only part-time (still only making $13/hr). 

In 2016, I was presented with an opportunity to graduate sooner at an out-of-state university than at the in-state university I was attending. You bet I took the opportunity, and moved. 

Jan 2017 began my new semester, but this time I was able to go to school full-time and only work part-time. Living in the bay area, I found a job that paid \~14/hr. I was lucky enough that I did not have rent or hardly any bills out here to worry about. So for me, 14/hr was doable, although not desirable. 

In Feb. 2018, I landed an internship that was aimed at students who had little to no technical experience, still only making minimum income. I didn't mind though, because I was learning so much technology that the money didn't matter.  

Fast forward to Jan. 2019 where I was presented with an opportunity to apply for a junior software developer position. I did what I could to prepare for the interview, by reviewing the basics, because by this point it had been almost three years since my data structures class.   


Anyway, I did the interview and felt like I did pretty average, and thought that they had a better-suited candidate waiting for them. Yesterday morning, I received an email from the HR representative asking me to give her a call when I can. My heart sank. I was expecting rejection, but instead, she told me that I GOT THE JOB! I don't graduate until May, and they're willing to let me work there part-time while I finish my degree.   


I was expecting a 45-55K offer for a junior dev position with hardly any experience, but nope. They're offering me 85K. I'm still in disbelief. I feel like a changed person! Someone who can actually make a difference now. 

Guys, if I can do it. SO CAN YOU! It does get better, I promise! 

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: I went from a veterinary degree to a computer science degree, and in just 3 years I went from making 20K/yr to 85K/yr with no prior computer science knowledge other than what I've learned since switching majors.

am6ish,0,2019-02-01,December 2019 graduation - when should I start applying for full-time?,BassNet,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/am6ish/december_2019_graduation_when_should_i_start/,"I graduate with a BS in computer engineering in December 2019 (about 10 months from now) and I'm wondering when I should start applying for a full-time job. I'd prefer to start soon after I graduate, i.e. January or February 2020, and I'll be applying everywhere - FAANG, fortune 500, small local companies, etc. I have an SWE internship this summer at a good company that is known to give out offers to their interns at the end, so I'm a little conflicted - if I start applying now and get an offer before my internship, I may not be given enough time to consider an offer from my internship or any potential FAANG offers (they only give full-time offers in the fall afaik).

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I ask is that it seems recommended on this sub to start applying many months out. Also I usually start applying to internships in August, which is about 10 months before the start date.

So, should I start applying now or wait until August? Will companies let me push back my start date until I've graduated? Also, my school has a career fair next week - should I go?

Thanks for the help."

am769v,218,2019-02-01,I found the cure to growing older,poloniumpoisoning,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/am769v/i_found_the_cure_to_growing_older/,"What would you do if you held the secret every human being and every enterprise would do anything to put their hands on?

I was 22 and a novice at a huge biomedicine company. Everyone treated me pretty much like an intern; I was young and unimportant, a mere apprentice cleaning the big shot researchers’ Erlenmeyers and beakers.

But I loved my job; I stayed way past my shift every day. Working for free. Observing. Learning. Testing.

That’s how I came up with it. I noticed one of my colleagues was pretty close to achieving it, but had made a fundamental mistake. Everyone knew it was her obsession; she was 46 and working relentlessly in the cure to growing older for at least 15 years.

Her name was Valentina Esposito, and she was extremely respected in the field. She developed anti-age products for a lot of major beauty companies in the world. I don’t mean to brag or say I’m better than her. I thought her brilliant brain needed a little help and I could provide it, that’s all. So I had been secretly working for weeks on helping her.

Next day was Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day; Valentina wasn’t particularly nice to me, but I wanted to make her look good in front of her daughter anyway.

I stayed later than ever, working in one of the 3 samples she had been testing that day. I was so tired I was afraid to drive my car, and asked my father to come pick me up. 

“Sometimes I don’t know if I should spend my youth doing that”, I confided to him.

“You love it, Emily, don’t you?” he asked, and I nodded as enthusiastically as my worn-out body could. “Have a little more faith in yourself, girl”.

That night, I slept peacefully, knowing I was doing something big.

I bought huge coffees for everyone, knowing there would be running around and excited screaming from the kids. All my peers were middle-aged and had daughters and sons from 7 to older than me; I was the only one that didn’t bring my children because my only son was a dog.

“Hey, Valentina, why don’t we test the stuff you’ve been working on?” I suggested, at some point. I could barely restrain myself from smiling proudly. “You said it was ready for human tests”.

“Sure”, she said, in a dispirited tone. “I don’t know if it will be 100% though”.

“Of course it will, I’m sure!” I encouraged her. “Your work is brilliant and your daughter should see it”.

It seemed to cheer her up.

In the lab, we all knew her formula required a very special ingredient: DNA from a younger person. It was super simple to do it, we just needed a skin or hair sample, then it would be centrifuged to separate the DNA per se from the other parts, and added to the flask. The DNA needed to be fresh when you drink it so, at first, Valentina’s goal was to sell this product just to beauty clinics that could afford proper machinery to complete the formula.

Pretty much everything in your body has DNA, but in our lab we always opted for hair or skin when we could.

“Do you want to use a bit of my hair?” I offered.

“Your skin is so perfect, Emily” Valentina said in a dreamy tone, brushing her fingers on my cheek. “You look so good. But nothing compares to the freshness of a child’s youth, so I’m taking Danielle’s DNA”.

Danielle was Valentina’s daughter. She had indeed perfect skin, being a 10-years-old; still a couple of blessed years free from the adolescence’s oiliness.

I put on my gloves and grabbed a small pair of sterilized scissors. Getting on my knees to be her size, I talked to Danielle in a soft voice. “Your hair is beautiful, you know?” she happily giggled. “Be a dear and let me cut just a tiny bit for your mom? You’ll help her get prettier”.

She extended me the ends of her long hair in obedience. What a good kid, I thought. And her hair was indeed beautiful; she had auburn locks, just like her mother.

Cutting it and properly processing the DNA was simple enough, and soon Valentina was drinking the elixir. 

I couldn’t keep my eyes off of her; her skin slowly acquired more glow and the wrinkles soon started to soften. Valentina was still beautiful, but her age definitely showed. You could see in her face all the sleepless nights she spent developing her pride and joy cure to growing older. Most women in her field did everything they could to always look good, but Valentina refused to undergo plastic surgery, botox etc. She would get younger with her product and her product only, no matter how long it took to be finished.

It seemed to be working wonderfully, and her quick skin regeneration attracted attention from everyone in our small lab team. I was feeling proud and relaxed, watching her look like a woman in her mid-30s – 10 years younger at least.

“Mommy, what’s going on?” Danielle asked, and I averted my gaze from Valentina’s rejuvenated face. “I feel weird”.

When my eyes met Danielle’s, I screamed. Her face was all wrinkled; way more than Valentina’s used to be.

It was horrifying; Danielle got 80 years older but still had a kid’s body. Her face was aged, with sunken and dry skin, but her features were still those of a child. She looked like a midget witch, and her anguished face made it all the creepier. To paint you a word picture, she looked like Snow White’s Queen when she turns into an old hag.

*Fuck*, I thought to myself, *the DNA’s donor will get old in the user’s place. But at a way bigger rate. This is fucking bad.*

“Valentina, look at Danielle”, I said. “We can’t sell this. We need to work on this again”.

“We?” she replied, with ferocity. “What are you talking about, newbie? You have no place telling me what to do. Go clean some flask or whatever”.

A few of my peers laughed, and I felt my face burn with shame. Valentina couldn’t stop starring at the mirror. She didn’t even look at Danielle’s crying, desperate face. Nothing in the world would get between this woman and her vanity; no, between her and the job of her lifetime.

“The girl has a point, you know, Dr. Esposito?” Dave, the only other researcher that was on the same level as Valentina, spoke. “Your daughter’s face is a mess. She got like 8 years older for every year you got younger”.

“So what?” Valentina replied with eyes gleaming from fury. “She only needs to drink someone else’s DNA. Why don’t you give me one of your snotty boys so I can fix her?”

Just then, I noticed there was a putrid smell coming from Danielle. She smelled like really old people when they are about to die, but it was way stronger. Using that formula was inhumane, I thought. No one’s beauty is worth it.

“I want to get younger and bang hot girls too” Dr. Cesare, the older in our team, screamed, instantly starting to chase Valentina.

It was pure chaos; in the blink of an eye, people armed themselves with shards of glass and other dangerous stuff from the lab, attacking others. Some wanted to get the elixir, some wanted to get a kid they could dump their oldness on.

Everyone went berserk, chasing kids and young people, that ran away screaming bloody murder. Some of the kids were too young to understand what was happening, why their parent’s friends wanted to hurt them. There was a lot of crying and pleading. I only survived because I had a limber body, and was able to react very quickly. I locked myself in one of the offices and sat very quietly under a large desk for hours.

In our no-disclosure agreement, we were forbidden to call for external help, such as the police, ambulances, etc. When bad stuff happened at the lab, we were to wait for their special team. And I didn’t have their contact. I was completely helpless.

Every minute I spent there was excruciating. I thought about how hard I had studied my whole life to be there; working for this company was my childhood dream. While other kids were dreaming of being ballerinas, doctors and astronauts, I had a serious career plan, including the university I would attend. The one I ended up attending.

I sacrificed personal relationships, sleep and my mental health to be there. I was happy and deserved to have such important people as my peers. The only ones I was still to keep in my life were my father and my dog, both always loyal despite my distantness and constant complains of being tired.

I deserved to be there.

“Hello, Emily…” I heard Valentina through the door, talking in a very paused and deliberated tone. It made my hair stand on end. “I know you’re there, because I already found everyone else and this is the only closed door” she sung all the words like a creepy melody.

I didn’t move or say a word, doing my best to keep my teeth from chattering.

Valentina kept pounding on the door. She sounded out of her mind. “Let me take your youth, Emily… give it to me… you’re so beautiful” her voice was raspy and scary, on the verge of unreturnable madness.

I waited and waited and waited for long minutes, but Valentina wouldn’t go away.

She was about to bring the door down. I looked around the office, but there was nothing that could be used as a weapon. Stupid bureaucrats. So I had an idea that could be my last. I explained to her that her original formula had a mistake that I fixed.

Laughing maniacally, she asked if I actually said she made a mistake and a child with no experience fixed it.

“I swear. Try the other samples you were working yesterday. They are inert even if you add the right amount of DNA on them”.

I honestly don’t know why she believed me. Even I doubted myself for a moment. Maybe I just thought I had fixed it, but it was right all along. Maybe I’m the one who ruined it to the point where it takes away the DNA’s donor youth, instead of just copying it.

*Have a little more faith in you, girl*. Remembering my father’s words made me cry, thinking I would never see him again.

But Valentina grew quiet, and I knew she was trying the other samples. God bless the scientific mind. No matter if I was right or wrong, I had bought some time.

Not *some*. I had bought *enough* time.

As the special team arrived, Valentina decided to keep me alive and well because I was right.

The lab had a lot of trouble with the cover-up, but the story didn’t leak. Five children and two adults died that day, not to mention the youngsters that started rotting away alive like Danielle. They had to buy the silence of a lot of people and move them to another country in a hurry.

But Valentina was too important for them to lose her, and the cure to growing older was too amazing; I mean, despite the incident, it had potential. The company big wigs wanted the two of us to keep working together to improve it; they were eager to start selling it, but they knew it would wreak havoc and maybe even end the world.

For 25 years, I worked tirelessly on it. I made a lot of money, became as prestigious as my peer and had a lot of immensely qualified people working under me.

But we were never able to make the formula any better. The only way to cure oldness is sacrificing the young, and admitting this made me harden my heart.

This all happened in the early 90’s. I abandoned biomedicine and now direct an orphanage. We have a low adoption rate, but always have space available. The kids just complain about the smell. My skin is pretty as ever and still talk to Valentina often; she says I haven’t got a day older since we first met[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPoisoningTales/)"

I'm working on the ECS36 series this year, so by the end of the year I'd expect to have covered data structures in ECS36C, thus having a basic level of experience, but as this would be my first time working, how difficult are the intern jobs compared to homework for example? Will I be expected to know how to deal with all the tasks, or will there be some sort of mentor system to make sure I don't screw things up?

Even before that, as this is my first year, would even getting past the application stage be possible?, as I obviously would have a pretty small cv (did unrelated things in high-school) compared to 2nd years or higher. 

I looked at the sample sheet of internships, and the tasks look somewhat doable like writing test scenarios, but as they are all pretty general, it's hard to gauge the extent of depth the responsibilities will require.

I can afford the programme so cost is not a issue"
am7xex,2,2019-02-01,Should I Apply Elsewhere? -Currently an Intern in Networking,Volant76,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/am7xex/should_i_apply_elsewhere_currently_an_intern_in/,"Over a year ago, I got a position in the networking department at a local school district. I have 3 bosses, and they are great (except 1 of them, but I will get back on that). At first, I had imagined that I was gonna learn a lot of networking material higher than the CCNA level. I expected my bosses to mentor me on something, so I could apply it on another prospective job. Well. I guess I expected too much.One of my biggest gripes with being an intern in the networking department, is that I cannot connect to networking devices and fix an issue. I find it uncomfortable that there are times where I know how to solve an issue, and just because my boss doesn't know, I have to step out with my boss with the problem unresolved. If upper management were to see me with a terminal, I could land myself being unemployed. To make matters worse, there's no opportunity for me to move up in the company, since they don't hire interns (you'll understand when I explain about Boss-C). Even if I work in the networking department, I find myself working on maintaining inventory/ transferring APCs more than configuring switches.

Boss-A is responsible for interns and inventory, but she hardly has any knowledge on how networking devices work (switches and routers). I pretty much taught her, and even gave her a PDF I made, teaching her how to enable SSH and Telnet, but luckily, she has plenty of experience in troubleshooting APs with the WLC. Boss-B does the same things as my BOSS-B, with the addition on working on Servers and VoIP. They both rely on Google to fix their issues, but I have to admit that Boss-B has pretty great Googling skills. He gets the job done, and is also responsible. Under both of their supervision, I am allowed to check the switches.

*About Boss-C though…. He's just dead weight to our department.* The guy prides himself saying he's got his CCNA in Voice and R&amp;S, but the rest the entire Technology department doesn't think so. The guy gets paid over 50,000, just because upper management has his back. The guy doesn't know how to perform subnetting. He doesn't know how to configure a switch. He pretty much works his way copying configs from other devices in the network, to see if something sticks. Either that, or my other 2 bosses have to clean up his mess or do his work. No joke. For over 6 months, the guy kept on saying

    ""Oh there's a loop on the network! I have to go fix it at this school. Be right back!"" 

The guy went away for 2-3 hours. **Out of curiosity, one of those days I asked him:**

    ""Wait. So how is there a loop, when all of our switches in the network have STP?"" 

The guy stopped talking, removed his focus from my eyes, stepped out, and slammed the door. The next day, Boss-A received a **complaint** from upper management. He had complained saying that I shouldn't bring study material (""my comment about STP"") when he is already *a professional*.

Currently, he is responsible for moving a small branch to a new ISP. He said that he needed to configure ""Router on a Stick"", except that with our current topology at the branch…. we don't need to. We don't need to enable a trunk to the ISP. When he tried to get the job done, the guy brought down the branch network for 2 hours, and when I asked the other intern why it happened, he told me he was desperately copying the configs from other routers. I told my bosses I can do the job, but they keep on telling me that even if I do it, Boss-C will take all the credit. If they attempt to refute this, I could end up fired. It's been over 2 weeks, and the guy forced the rest of the department to help him out, just because management says that we have to help ""Mr.CCNP"".

I can write a whole book about this guy, but that's pretty much the tip of the iceberg. He's just the ""what not to do as a network tech"" guide.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to job to help me understand switches and routers better, but to be honest, I'm doing that on my free time reading CCNA books and packet tracer. I'm thinking of moving within 6 months. I currently have my CCENT, A+, and Net+, and I am close to taking both my CCNA and Sec+.

Should I apply elsewhere for a Networking tech/Computer Technician elsewhere soon?

Should I take my CCNA and Sec+ first, or should I look to apply with current credentials?"

I recenlty graduated in December of 2018 and have been applying everyday for entry level jobs as a help desk technician or desktop support technician. I have six months of IT experience with two companies in a corporate environment which I thought would help me get one of Desktop support technician positions because it relates to it. I have been applying on all of the top career posting websites like LinkedIn ,indeed, etc every day. I get about two interviews a week but that is how far I make it and never get a call back there is some much competition out there.

There are many of low paying jobs that do not require a Bachelor's degree that are contracted and are only paying 11-14 dollars and i know I'm better than that and that's not what I went back to school for. My main purpose to get my Bachelor's was so i can do something a love doing and to have a career that pays $25 an hour, pay off student loans and so I can move out of my mother's house because I am 32years old and I need my own place. I also have an associate's degree in web design that became useless. I am currently heavily depressed and I am starting to feel this was all for nothing. When i worked with both of my paid internships last year, I worked 40 hours a week and was a full full-time student also with a 3.7gpa. I thought that meant it but it doesn't. Both of the companies that I've worked for never hired me after the internship was over because there were no positions available but I knew a few interns that got spoon feed a position just because they had family members that works for these companies. All I received was letter of recommendations.

98% of all of my classmates that have graduated are working in IT and are at least working as a help desk technician ll or a desktop support technician ll with a decent salary accept me. A lot of them got lucky and got spoon feed positions with only a Bachelor's degree. I thought at least that I would have the upper hand over them with on the job experience but I was wrong. 

Also ,I'm starting to believe that there are some people that are selected for greatness and some are not and it's not about what you know and its about who you know. That has been one of my biggest weaknesses because I have no friends.Does anyone else feels this way that recently have graduated? Should I give up and should I cut off my emotions and keep fighting?"

I don't think I know anything.,zZentail,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/am8eeg/about_to_graduate_with_bs_in_cs_i_dont_think_i/,"I'm in an odd situation that I've been having trouble finding a good answer for. I'm attending a University and about one semester away from Graduation with my degree in Computer Science. Coming close to graduation, I feel like I should know how to do at least a decent amount of things in my field, but I don't feel like I know how to do anything--something I thought would be solved by attending school. I have basic programming concepts down (in C++). However, I go and look at a job listing and I have no idea what anything is without having to look any of it up. 

Here are some examples of things I see on listings that I do not know for Entry-Level positions (though Google would show me, obviously):

* Agile
* qTest
* Zephyr
* WCAG
* Scrum
* Waterfall
* Go
* Verilog
* Azure
* React (know of this one, never used it)
* Node (one of my classes touched on it but we didn't use it)

I've never even programmed something outside of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Notepad++) or C++ inside of emacs on a remote linux lab. Heck, I've never even opened an IDE like Visual Studio, XCode, or whatever other ones people use out there.

I feel like I should be approaching graduation knowing how to do something, but it feels as though I've mostly learned about concepts and that's it. I have 0 confidence in actually applying for a job as basically every listing works with APIs and I have not done that before. I try to fit in time when I can, but I'm working around 60 hours a week and attending school full-time (not even including marriage and kids) which has left very little room to learn on my own.

About the Internship, in case someone asks, I had mine waived. After applying to around 80 of them, I was invited to interviews for about 25, each of which started asking questions I didn't know how to answer. Being unable to get one and already having to work so much already just to provide for my family, throwing unpaid options out the window, my school was willing to waive it.

I have spent my whole life around technology and want to be involved, but it's hard to see light at the end of the tunnel right now. I know after graduation I'd have time to learn on my own finally, but part of me would rather just pick up more over-time hours and just make more that way, even though I'm not doing what I enjoy at all.

Is there any advice someone would have? Or possibly just a large list of projects I could do from Beginner-&gt;Intermediate-&gt;Hard in a variety of languages and using various APIs?"

I graduated in 2017 with a degree in education. By the time I graduated, I knew that I didn't want to become a traditional teacher. I had worked as a sales manager for three years in college, loved it, interned in a non-profit, loved it even more, and eventually, tutored a bunch of student athletes. I felt like I had a well-rounded college experience that set me up as an ideal candidate for adulting. Oh but what little did I know.

Two months after graduation, I am biding my time as a retail shift lead applying for an array of jobs related to education, training, and non-profit management, it takes six months for me to land a part time job ina museum. Finally, almost eight months after graduation, I am working for ten dollars an hour managing outreach in a museum while holding a second job. I thought ""dude, this is the move to make. I am proud of myself."" 

That is, until two months in. I quickly realized after a change in leadership that the ship was sinking. The museum closed after I had worked there for five months. I had anticipated the job to be a calculated career move, but it ended in nothing. 

I am now doing yet another survival job making less than 23,000 per year, and feeling increasingly depressed and hopeless. I tried so hard in college; I graduated in the top 5% of my class, I worked full-time for most of college, and volunteered on top of it, but since college things just haven't worked out. It's not like I don't have experience; I have worked since i was 16, did sales, the internship, wrote theses, the whole thing. 

I am really struggling to see a viable way out of underemployment. I can't afford graduate school. I am starting to volunteer at an organization that interests me, so hopefully that helps. If you have been underemployed, how did you get out of it? What encouragement or advice do you have for me? "

At the current moment, I should have around a 4.3 gpa (3.85 UW) by the time early decision comes and a 4.4 when regular decision comes.  I know my gpa is not the best, but the reason why my gpa is so low is because at my high school, some classes such as Spanish are factored into your gpa. During middle school, I took 3 high school classes and slacked off a bit as a result I entered freshman year with a 3.55 gpa. Ever since then I have worked hard and brought my grades up.

Some side notes: I had no internship experience, which I feel may have prevented me from getting my foot in the door for some companies. I double-majored in CS/Math. Had more of a theoretical bend than applied (see above previous goals of grad school). I've also interviewed with companies (see fidessa and like) where I absolutely aced every algorithmic question only to be denied with a boilerplate rejection letter. The moment I received my offer is the moment every other company seemed to come out of the wood work to pursue my application/resume.

&amp;#x200B;

Studying plan: Re-reading and working problems in ""introduction to algorithms"" by rivest, stein et al, and ""computer systems: a programmer's perspective"". Note I am good at lower-level system type work and have no skill in front-end things, and this influenced what I studied. I also did some basic hackerrank work, but really only enough to practice my C++. Some places want you be a damn savant in C++, and I'm not really an expert in move semantics or other finer things involved in the latest C++. ""What is your favorite part of the C++11 extension?""

Think like the middle of February. I'm still unemployed as of now for the summer, and with about 6-9 months of tech classes under my belt and three years into a politics degree I'm itching to actually get my feet in the door and some money in my pocket for work. I feel antsy, like I should be working over the summer not staying home.


Of course, at least through my school, the vast majority of positions are unpaid. I wasn't good enough to get into a big name school that funnels you into internships freshman year so I lucked out in that aspect. Otherwise I'm just trying to make the best of it. I'll literally be happy with any kind of work as long as it isn't lobster fishing or apple picking. I just want to put my skills to good use, ya know? Maybe I could get a job in hospitality working their computers or in a law office as an assistant (even though I hate law it's work god damnit I need money for food), or tech at a bank I dunno.

ameia5,16,2019-02-02,How do people deal with having their grades drop dramatically?,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ameia5/how_do_people_deal_with_having_their_grades_drop/,"Short story: Used to have big grades. Took a bad grade once in a while, but it was ok. Believed I don't care about grades. However, I was a full time student and I was present in every class, sometimes asking questions. Not to impress, but I cared to understand what was being said. Also, it helps maintaining your interest in even the most boring classes. 

&amp;#x200B;

One year later, I started having trouble staying awake and started missing classes to hang out with my bf (I never had a bf before and I rarely talked with any of my friends. I was extremely lonely. However, I've attacked myself a lot for ""dismissing the important stuff in life for someone that can run away. A diploma does not run away""). My grades dropped. Then I tried to find an internship for the summer and no one wanted me. My grades were still alright, I had projects and I was involved in volunteering and pretty much everything. It really hurt to go to 3 interviews a week and get nothing when people I saw as ""less deserving"" were already working for big companies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next year was better and I got myself back on track. However, around november I got my first job, and I really like it. Everyone is nice and the work is interesting - I really feel useful, despite being an 'apprentice'. But my first half of the semester was going great and the second... not so much. Now my father tries to convince me to give up my job because ""he can pay for my expenses, why do I need a job anyway. I should be focusing on college because that's what matters the most"". I'm again in a bad state of mind and I cry after every single exam thinking I've ruined my life. I have this bad habit of hitting my head on walls to punish myself when I do bad - and it used to be a private matter until I did it in public. Now everyone thinks I'm fucking nuts. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so I'm probably a bit worse than the majority, but I heard many people go through this - losing their good grades and the sense of identity and accomplishment given by them. I'm wondering how others cope with it and move their bad energy into productivity and success. I'm happy for any answers at all honestly, don't be afraid to call me out on being an entitled brat. "
amen73,0,2019-02-02,Considering Switching from Biology/Premed to CS in Junior Year. Lots of Questions. Any Advice would be Appreciated.,ViggyTalls,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/amen73/considering_switching_from_biologypremed_to_cs_in/," As the title says, I'm currently a second semester junior in college pursuing a Biology degree on the premed track, but my interest in medicine has gone down a lot over this past year. The day to day work of a doctor isn't as appealing to me as it first seemed and I'd rather not spend 5-6 years after college going to school and being financially dependent on my parents. As a result of this, I've been looking for an alternate career path to pursue, but I've found that I don't have any professional interests. My peers seem to have found career paths that they are passionate about with their hearts and souls, but I just want a job that pays decently and I can derive some sort of satisfaction from. I'd rather just be passionate about my stupid hobbies of video games and anime.

Since there's no career path that I feel particularly passionate about, I figured that I should instead find a skill that is in demand and work on learning that so that I can have something to leverage when searching for jobs. Programming and CS seemed like a perfect fit for such a skill because the demand for it is obvious and I remember taking and enjoying AP Computer Science back in high school. Of course I know that high school classes are completely different from college classes, but I am testing the waters by taking a Data Structures course this semester. (In case you were curious, my AP credit from AP Computer Science allowed me to skip the intro course at my school and go straight to Data Structures.) I have a lot of catching up to do because I skipped the intro course, but I've been reading the textbook for that course and it's been a great experience. Relearning the Java concepts and syntax I learned back in high school felt like it awoke some intellectual curiosity that had been dormant in me for a long time. Essentially, I looked into CS for purely practical reasons, but I do seem to have a slight interest in it. Bear in mind though that I haven't actually done any coding for this Data Structures class yet, so I don't know if this interest will be enough to get me through practical challenges.

Sorry for the long winded introduction, but I wanted to give some background on myself before I started asking for advice. As for those questions, I have quite a few:

1. Do you think CS is worth pursuing given my situation? It's pretty late in the game for such a drastic change, especially one I'm not so sure I'm interested in. However, if being premed for three years taught me anything, it's that I'm perfectly capable of working hard for something that I'm not totally interested in, and it does seem like I'll be able to tolerate CS at the very least.
2. Is it worth getting a Masters in CS given my situation? I'm on track to complete my biology degree in four years and I do want to graduate on time, so I don't want to mess that up by switching my major to CS and starting from scratch or trying to add a second CS major. However, if I like my Data Structures class, I would be able to add a CS minor without it affecting my graduation timeline, so that seems like my best plan. Given this, getting a Masters looks like the best way to get a formal CS certification, but I want to know if it is really worth it in my case?
3. As an offshoot of the second question, do universities have internship opportunities for Masters students? I know they do for undergrads, but I'm not sure if they do for grads? Getting an internship seems to be the best way to get my foot in the door, especially since I won't have much experience compared to someone who spent four years getting a CS degree, so this is very important to me.
4. How do you make personal projects? I see the importance of these emphasized everywhere, but a) I don't think I'm good enough at coding to make my own project yet and b) I'm not a very creative person so I don't know how I'd come up with project ideas on my own - the prospect of it just seems intimidating.
5. Do you think I'd be able to get an internship in my senior year of undergrad? Like if I decided to bust my ass learning during the summer and fall, would I reasonably be able to apply for internships that spring? And as a followup, what would be most pertinent for me to learn for internships?

That's all the questions I have. This post feels super disorganized, but it also feels cathartic to get all of my concerns out there like this. Please don't feel like you have to answer all of my questions; I'm just looking for as much advice as I can get. Thank you all in advance for your help."

My brother Jamie and I were born minutes apart.  I was the first out. That’s something I never let my brother forget. 

Like I imagine most twins probably are, we were inseparable. Not only that, we were the true definition of identical. From our looks, to our voices, even our attitudes were almost exactly the same. Even our own parents had troubles telling us apart. The only precise way to tell us apart is a birth mark I have on my left shoulder. It almost resembles a butterfly. 

Throughout school, Jamie and I never left each other’s side. We were somewhat popular among our class, but we only really needed each other. Our bond seemed unbreakable. That was until we reached college. 

Jamie wanted to be a doctor, but I had no interest in that career path whatsoever. In fact, I had no clue what I wanted to do at all. I picked business because it seemed easy enough.

As Jamie began taking more difficult classes, and eventually a full-time internship, we began to see each other less and less. Despite his busy schedule he even managed to find a girlfriend, Melissa. I had basically lost the one person I had always been able to rely on. After a while Jamie even got his own place with Melissa, and I was truly alone. 

I fell in to the wrong crowd. I ended up dropping out of college after a few years. My grades hadn’t been that great anyway. I felt I was just wasting my time. Soon enough I found myself working a minimum wage job, and living in the slums. 

My brother on the other hand ended up becoming a pediatrician. He eventually ended up marrying Melissa. Even though I was envious, I attended the ceremony. The part that hurt the most was that I wasn’t even asked to be the best man. Maybe I was a loser, but did the bond we once had mean nothing?

After the wedding I went in to an even worse downward spiral than I was already on. Not only did I become an alcoholic, I also began sampling every drug known to man. Looking back, I undoubtedly deserved what happened next. 

It was the middle of the night when I got a phone call. It was my dealer. He promised me something extra special if I got over to his place asap. The problem was that I had already had my fair share that night, but I couldn’t resist the urge. I got in my car and began to head to his place.

I didn’t even see the semi-truck as crumpled my car as if it was a toy. I’m sure I died on impact, at least I hope I did. I don’t remember if it was painful.

All I remember was the light. It sounds corny, since everyone talks about the light at the end of the tunnel, but it was real. I felt myself drifting in to it, and I was even able to accept that I was dead. Just before I reached it however, I was pulled back. Something ripped me from the approaching light, and the world filled with darkness.

I shot up in bed, covered in sweat. 

I was alive? Had it been a dream?

“Are you ok Honey, is something wrong?” A voice said beside me.

I turned to see who the voice was. It was Melissa, my brother’s wife. Why would she be in my bed? This wasn’t right. 

“What’s going on?  Why are you here?” I questioned her. 

“Oh you must have had a night terror. It’s ok you are awake now Jamie.” 

Jamie? Why had she just called me Jamie? Was I missing something here?

I turned and looked at the birth mark on my shoulder, or rather I looked where it should have been. There was nothing there. 

I immediately got out of the bed and went to the nearby bathroom. I looked in the mirror. I wasn’t looking at a dopehead dropout. I was looking at my brother. Except I was in control of his motions. This clearly wasn’t my house either. It was far too nice. Even the bathroom was probably more valuable than the dump I lived in.

Before I could even begin to question what had happened I heard something. It was a phone from the bedroom. As if on instincts I went and answered it. 

“Hello?” I answered.

“Hello, is this Jamie Smith?” The voice on the other end said.

“Uhhhh Yes, who is this?”

“I’m officer Towns, I’m sorry to inform you, but we believe your brother Seth was in an accident. We’d like you to come to the hospital to identify the body.”

So, I was dead. I wasn’t sure exactly what was happening, but the real me was dead. Somehow when I died I was placed in my brother’s body. Did that mean he took my place? Was Jamie dead?

I hung up the phone after agreeing to come identify the body, my body. 

“Who was that, is everything alright?”  Melissa said.

“Seth is dead.” That was all I could say. She didn’t need to hear more though. She understood.

It was odd seeing my own dead body. It was definitely mine though. The birth mark was there, and the toxicology report would later show the reason I ran head first in to my death. It was true that my life was meaningless, but I didn’t want to steal my brother’s life.

He had worked for this life. I had ruined mine. Why was I still here? Why couldn’t I have just gone to whatever afterlife awaited me. I would probably just ruin this life too.

I had to try though. I couldn’t let my brother’s hard work just go to waste. I was given time off from work for well, my funeral. How could I possibly be a pediatrician though? I hadn’t gone to school for this. I barely knew the difference between a cold and the flu. 

Still, on the first day my brother was expected back for work, I went. Surprisingly, it went much better than I expected. It was as if my brother’s experience had stayed in his body. Everything was like muscle memory. I had never done any of this before, but my body, or rather my brother’s body did it for me. Even when diagnosing the patients, the right words would simply come out of my mouth. I didn’t even know half of the things I diagnosed that day.

I returned to my brother’s home exhausted, but somewhat satisfied that night. Melissa was waiting for me as I walked in the door.

“Hey Honey! I know you’ve been down recently, and I understand why. So, I put together a surprise for you in the basement.” She said.

A surprise in the basement? I hadn’t been in my brother’s basement yet. I could only wonder what was down there. Was he in to some really weird stuff like BDSM? There was only one way to find out. I followed Melissa in to the basement. 

Of all the things I could have guessed, they would have all been wrong. 

When I reached the basement there were 5 other people already down there. They were all wearing animal masks. There was a bear, an owl, a bunny, a raccoon, and an elephant. 

“What’s going on?” I asked genuinely confused, and a bit frightened. 

“Like I said I knew you were feeling down, so I got the gang together. I know it’s a bit earlier than we usually do, but we knew you needed this.” After saying this Melissa put on a lioness mask.

The man in the bear mask approached me and handed me a wolf mask. I was beginning to think this was some kind of furry orgy, but then he also handed me a knife. I still had no clue what was going on, but I couldn’t control my movements anymore. My brother’s hands put on the wolf mask, and then grabbed the knife.

After this, the group of masked people stepped aside. Behind them was a small cage. Inside that cage was a small girl. Her mouth was taped shut, and her arms were tied behind her back. The woman in the bunny mask approached the cage, and opened it. 

The little girl used this moment as an attempt to escape. It was futile though. She couldn’t maintain her balance with her hands behind her back, and she found herself sliding on the floor. 

All I wanted to do was to help this girl escape, but my body, or my brother’s body wanted something else. I had no control over what happened next. 

I was a spectator as I watched my brother’s body approach the girl and begin to dismember her. The others joined in after a few moments. It only took a few minutes for the remains of the girl to become completely unrecognizable. There were parts of her body spread all over the basement. 

After everyone was finished Melissa turned to me.

“Go shower and get some sleep. We will take care of the cleanup this time as an extra gift. I know you had a long day at work, I really hope this cheered you up!”

That was that. 

I’m once again in control, but I don’t want to be. I don’t want this body. Perhaps I had been envious of my brother before, but no more. 

I already tried to call the police, but this body won’t let me. I’m not sure why it’s even letting me write this. I guess it doesn’t think that anyone will believe me, and why would they?

My brother and I are much more different than I ever knew. I did want to be closer to him, but this wasn’t what I had in mind. Now, I wish I could have just stayed dead. "

However as I go on, I think I want to specialize in micro electronics, especially in concepts like SS drives and related memory design. I think it’s fascinating. 

So my question here, what are some companies that involve the design and implementation of computer memory? It’s not a large sub discipline and I’m having trouble finding a route to take to potentially get into this field. Most companies that deal with memory also create tons of other devices. I just want to be somewhere I can work with computer electronics and also get into some HDD/SSD etc. work. Please recommend pertinent job titles, companies, advice or anything helpful. Thanks.

I’m a a biology major currently in my third year and I’m based in SE Asia. I have an important decision to make and would like to hear your opinions.

So I’ve got three active offers for an intern this summer, two in the UK and one in USA. I’ve already interned in Germany and Scotland during the past summers and have a really good personal relationship with both the professors that I have worked with, both of them have told me that they would be happy to have me as a grad student later and I too would be really happy to work with them again. The dilemma here is that I’ll be looking to finally settle in the European academia after my Phd and post docs. What I’ve heard the common consensus is that American Phd’s are longer and more intensive than their European counterparts, indicating that I’ll probably be publishing more papers during my Phd in the US. And because I’ll only be looking to do my Phd with a professor I have already worked with, I have to choose now whether I should start interning in the US or in Europe.

Which path is more likely to land me in a academic position in Europe? An American Phd or a European one?

Thanks!"
amixr9,0,2019-02-02,Questions about succeeding as an engineering intern in a refinery,burberburner,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/amixr9/questions_about_succeeding_as_an_engineering/," 

I am a sophomore chemE currently doing a co-op in an oil refinery- and I have a great boss/mentors. I have been trying to understand how everything works so I have been reading articles online and tracing(walking) the PFD/P&amp;IDs of the units related to my projects- just to have a basic idea of the process. The major problem I have had though is communicating- specifically with the operators. Prior to starting my internship, I read through this sub and a lot of you recommended getting to know the operators and asking them questions. I don't know if we got off on the wrong foot but they all seem to hate me. So here are my questions:

\- how did you build a relationship with them? From observing my mentor once, she will usually just drop in their office to let them she's going into the unit and that's all. Its hard to actually talk to them one on one and ask whatever questions you may have since they are usually scattered all over the room. I have heard it would be nice to bring food/snacks but it will be awkward to just show up with kolaches without even knowing them.

\- I will really like to learn from them about specific equipment and how they work- I have tried to ask questions about things like indicators and things like that but they give blank 2 word answers and that's it. I am aware they are very knowledgeable about their process and would like to tap into it but its just not happening as I had hoped. So what kinds of questions do you recommend asking since I think I might be asking the wrong questions hence the confusion.

\- On previous questions asked on this sub, I have heard a lot of people recommend just asking them if you can work with them and watching what they did, is that allowed cause I know there could be union issues?

\- this is a general question, but are there specific operators for specific equipment, for example is one operator in charge of crude oil distillation unit and another in charge of cat cracker? Cause this might help and I can know who to direct my specific question to instead of just talking to the entire room.

Just to mention- on my first day in there, we had a tour and my mentor introduced me as the new intern. Is there a way to let them(operators) know this is my first time actually working in a refinery- so I really don't know much and will love to learn. I really hope to build a good relationship with them before I have to start asking them to help with things( e.g pressure check, drawing samples and all) cause I know I cant operate the equipment so any advice would be appreciated. I'm just really nervous since this is my first internship and I really want to do well."

How can I improve/find new opportunities?,Logansrun93,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/amndtu/stuck_in_a_rut_how_can_i_improvefind_new/,"I graduated with a bachelor's degree in CS about 3 years ago, and I'm trying to decide where/what to do with my career.

During my time in college, I had an internship, which turned into a full-time position when I graduated. I have around 5 years of work experience. However, most of that experience has been working with ""older"" technologies (VB.NET, C#, ASP.NET, Access, etc). 

I'd really like to branch out to some newer types of development, such as web development with newer, more popular languages and frameworks. Angular, React, Python, Ruby/Rails interest me very much. However there are a couple of issues/concerns I have with this:

1. I have very little experience with modern web development and don't really know where to start. I've spent all of my time working with these older systems, because that's what my job demands. I tend to learn better through courses and teaching. Is there a master's I could pursue that would help catch me up on some of this?

2. In my area (southeast US), there's not many companies using these new technologies. Most of the larger companies (like the ones I've worked for) are still stuck in the early 2000s development wise. I down see that changing anytime soon.

3. The companies that do work with these newer languages are mostly startups. I've never worked for a startup before and don't really know what goes along with that. My impression is that they are mostly populated by younger people. That's fine for now (I'm 25), but what about for the future? When I'm older, will I be phased out of these types of companies?

TL;DR: Have been working with older languages for a few years. Want to get caught up and work with new web development tech. What do?"

I plan on joining an early-stage (around series-A) startup to start off, with the goal being to eventually build my own. Right now, I'm trying to figure out where I want to land after graduation (geographically).

I *know* that NYC is a disadvantage compared to the Bay Area when it comes to the tech startup environment. The number of Unicorns that have come out of the Bay Area is almost 4x the number that have come out of NYC in recent years. The reason why I'm considering NYC is because I dislike the bay area. I've been there every summer for internships, and I prefer not to live there (but am willing to sacrifice living preferences if thats what it takes to succeed).

What I want to know is *how much* of a disadvantage I would be at if I went to New York instead of the Bay Area in order to weigh my choices. I'm currently in Chicago, it seems close to impossible to start a successful tech startup here because the pool of talented software engineers is so small, and there are an extremely small number of influential founders and mentors.

What is the talent pool like in New York? Are there good mentors and serial founders that will offer me guidance and opportunities? How easy/hard is it to get connected with influential entrepreneurs in NY as opposed to the Bay Area? I consider myself to be a very good software engineer, would it be easier for me to get opportunities in NY due to the comparatively lower amount of talent there? Perhaps the most important question: will the NY ecosystem be a *limiting factor* in my ability to be successful in this space?

I will soon be graduating with a Bachelors (Hons) in Engineering, but unfortunately my interest lies in with the finance sector, and I will be pursuing a Finance related Masters at one of the target schools in the UK after I graduate this year.

Unfortunately, I have no internships at all on my resume. I have been trying very hard, and will continue to try to secure a summer internship before the Masters programme starts in September. I have been to 2 assessment centres for  IBD/PE related roles at BBs but unfortunately did not secure any offers.

My Masters will be 1 year. I'm not sure if I should defer my entry for a year and try to obtain 2 off-cycle internships (Fall &amp; Spring) in the meantime, or if I should just go ahead and complete my Masters. However, school starts during the hiring cycle of BBs, which means that my finance knowledge may not be much better than it is now, though I will most likely put some effort into it during the summer, internship or not.

I'm currently located in Singapore, and if anyone has any location specific advice, I'm definitely appreciative of it.

Cheers."

So I started to teach myself Javascript &amp; friends over the summer, and had a buddy who worked in this field who got me an interview for an internship at the company he works at. Interview went \*okay\*....the interviewer found some holes in my CSS knowledge, but I nailed the algorithm challenge and I ended up getting the internship. My friend told me that the interviewer asked him if I knew what the challenge was because I got it right away. Great! That's about as good as it gets for now.

&amp;#x200B;

So Friday marked the end of week 2,  and even for an intern I think I am doing a terrible job. I spent 6 months learning front end stuff (including React, which is one of the frameworks they use), but day one they tell me I'm actually going to be on the back end team. So after I get my computer set up, the first task they ask of me is to write some specs. I know now what that means and how to do it, but I had NO IDEA what that meant when they asked it of me.  I told my boss that I have no idea what to do, that I've never seen this before and she emailed me active record &amp; Rspec documentation and literally said ""See if you can figure it out"" I was finally able to figure it out after 2 days. 2 days man.  That was a 1-2 hour project.

&amp;#x200B;

Next task was to create a react component. Ok cool, I can do React! I got this.... Nope. I don't. The way they write their React code is like nothing I've ever seen.  Again, I was able to figure it out but holy crap I had to do ALOT of guessing until it worked. It felt a bit like throwing darts blindfolded.

&amp;#x200B;

This past Friday my manager sat down next to me and said she is putting me on a new team because I'm having trouble keeping up on hers. She was really, really nice about it though and said once I get caught up on the backend that I can come back to her team for another go.  First task was to create a greeting for a new page. Took me about 3 minutes to figure that out, got it approved to be merged,  but when I went to push it up to GitHub, I f\*\*\*ed up the push somehow and had to get a more senior dev to fix my mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

I am feeling extremely overwhelmed, like an absolute idiot ,and that I am making a fool of myself. This was a huge opportunity for me to break into web dev, and was told if I do well they might even take me on as a Jr dev, but I feel like I'm screwing it up big time and that I wasn't ready to take on even an internship.  I went from making silly things like a weather app, some games, and a few landing pages to trying to navigate an extremely complicated codebase in a language I don't know and I need to figure out what to do.

I don't know what to do, but I need to do something. I would really appreciate honest advice, and I'll be sure to pay it back with upvotes."

amqsyi,1,2019-02-03,Need Advice about summer internship,v2thegreat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/amqsyi/need_advice_about_summer_internship/,"Hey everyone! I wanted some advice for my upcoming summer internship.


This is my first semester applying for internships, and while I've been mainly searching for them from my university's coop program, I've been lucky enough to be ""offered"" two internships from friends and contacts that I'll list out below in a moment. While I have already decided to go for one, I want to know what you guys think to get a proper opinion from people who might be in the field. So here goes:

## A Popular Company:
I met the HR Rep. for this company a week ago at our local hackathon, and after recognizing that she's the same person who usually handles hiring students from our coop, she asked me to send her an email with my resume and the job postings that I was interested in. I instantly got a feeling that I'll have any job that I want from their job postings for this summer if I do that. She was friendly, and I'm sure that it'll be an easy job for the summer based on what I've heard from my peers who have applied for similar companies, and the pay is pretty decent too. I'm quite unsure if I'm already late for this one because it's been a week already since the hackathon (I've had some ""stuff"" going on that I don't want to bring up here as it's irrelevant. Let's just say that both my school life and personal life have been strained because of this), and I'm bound to come off as unprofessional at this point, but life is short so I should still inform her about all of this, but I *would appreciate any and all advice I can get on how to approach this or if it's even worth it or whatever.*

## The Startup:
This is an internship offer that I've gotten from a friend who hangs out at a local maker/hackerspace, and who was amazed when she saw my resume (is it obvious that I'm trying to brag a bit about myself?), and called me in for an interview the very next day to meet the team (of &lt;6 people). After an hour-long discussion, my friend informed me that the job was mine if I wanted. She said that it'll be cool if I took another job from my coop which had better benefits compared to this one. She later informed me that she if my school schedule allowed it, she also wanted me to work part-time before and after the internship, (about 8~9 months, 4 full-time, 4-5 part-time based on how my school was). I'm expected to do a lot of things and learn a shit ton and have been in almost regular contact with her every week where we just talk about stuff (about 2 hours per week). Most of the team is super friendly and I'm expected to help out with a lot of things. However, she's made it clear that since they're just a small startup that's been around for a relatively short amount of time, things can do down as they do at most startups. Luckily, they don't seem to have a lot of liabilities at the company, and some of the people there seem to have a stable revenue stream. This does lead me to believe that my internship can fall out midway, which would suck big time. 


So the big question is this guy: *Is it better to have the first internship be at a large stable job where I can learn a few skills and have a relatively easy and stable job or go for a startup that's starting to take off and is going to be busy and hectic and might be risky, which is also offering more experience.*


Feel free to ask me any more questions that I might've left out. It's 1 am here, so I might sleep and post this again tomorrow morning. "

amu2rp,1,2019-02-03,"Student working part time as admin/techsupport, wondering what to do now.",impune_pl,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/amu2rp/student_working_part_time_as_admintechsupport/,"Hi, I'm currently studying software engineering (1,5 year in, 2 years to go), and working part-time as admin/techsupport for a medium sized (\~300 users total, \~160 in main office, and rest in branch offices all over the country, much more people in country of origin and south america). I usually spend 8 or 12 hours per week in work, as a contractor I get paid per hour, around half of average hourly rate.  I probably could do more hours, but i prefer to have some time for myself.

I enjoy working with Linux servers, but I rarely get to do something related to them (my last task was to automate switching NAT port bindings, so that certbot could update SSL certs for internal google drive-like file sharing solution). It was an interesting assignment, but my usual tasks are dull and repetitive - prepare a laptop for new user, create AD account, resolve some issue (the 'broken' scanner was the best so far - user didn't notice it was disconnected).

Sice the IT department consists of me, my boss and a few people abroad, I can't ask to change my responsibilities.

My question is should i try to get an internship this summer in different company, maybe in some software house or as a Linux admin, or would it be better to just switch to full time for 2 months?

Also what's your opinion on this situation?

I *highly* doubt that any of these signifies leadership, a trait in which I've rarely felt the need exert but colleges drool over apparently! 

I'm in Georgia, and I think its safe to say internships for a HS junior interested in CS is hard to come by (I think?) I'm so lost and I don't want colleges to turn their nose up at my application for lack of impressive/school related ECs!"
amwh6b,4,2019-02-03,"I'm half way through my BSEE, but starting to feel frustrated with the program/EE. I feel capable of the coursework, I just don't know if it's right for me. Thoughts?",boydo579,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/amwh6b/im_half_way_through_my_bsee_but_starting_to_feel/,"TLDR: I don't know if I'm in the right field, due to losing interest in the material. My ultimate goal is to do non profit work, especially related to energy access for developing areas. So in that, I might be doing more than I need to. 

1. Most of the people that I know (from EE) that are in their first two years of full time job, and practically every internship; is CS or excel driven. I know there's advances in memory driven computing going on, but even with that it feels like the push is going towards CS/programming. I already did the tech position, I don't want to do it again. Am I wrong or am I just looking at things to minutely?

2. I thought that all 100's/entry level classes were grueling filters, but I've thoroughly enjoyed my CS classes. I can do my EE problems and work just fine, but it feels like a huge drag. At the end of the day I just want to build projects with arduinos and Raspis, and it feels like I'm doing way more than I need to for that. 

3. All of this is coming from a rushing feeling, I'm an adult learner so I feel like I'm super behind. At the same time i just really want to get back to work. Doing something that's actually productive and contributes to something. 

Notes: I do volunteering on the side and do what I can with student orgs to try to scratch the volunteerism itch, but this just isn't doing it for me. I don't know if I'm just feeling burnt out from doing so much schooling, or having the feeling like I'm just solving first world problems too much. 

I think part of this might just be because of where I'm living. I'm basically in the plains and there's like 10 trees on the way to school if I take the scenic route. I miss trees so fucking much. 

I have an internship this summer doing some (of course) programming and a little bit of signal analysis for a new GPS system. I'm hoping that I can get a feeling of actually doing something and kind of seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Though part of me feels like I'm just going to get that done and fuck off to an remote IT job for awhile. 

Any thoughts, questions, memes, or advice would be great. "

amxftt,2,2019-02-03,Trying to find a job with a Psych Degree after deciding not to go to Grad School,savortheirony13,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/amxftt/trying_to_find_a_job_with_a_psych_degree_after/,"Hi all,


I hope this is the right subreddit to be posting on about this, I also posted the same in r/careerguidance. Like most people, I'm feeling a bit (a lot) stuck on what career path I should be going down. Just to give you some context, I'm 24 and just graduated last year with a Psych degree and Bio minor. 


Starting off at community college right after high school, I was unsure with what I wanted to do. I knew I wanted to help people in some way. Once I transferred to a four year university, I decided on a Psych Major but was unsure still of what to do with it. I've always loved science and healthcare, but did not want to go down the path of med school or nursing. I discovered Genetic Counseling as a potential career choice and the more I researched it, I fell in love with the career.


I worked on my pre-reqs (hence the Bio minor) and graduated only needing Orgo Chem and Biochem before I could apply for a program. I enrolled myself in Orgo Chem at my community college and thought all was well. 


Just to back track a bit here, due to a toxic home life I had to move out right before transferring to my four-year college. I worked full-time while also doing full-time school in order to pay rent, groceries, living, etc. I unfortunately did not have the time for any internships or extracurricular with exception to a volunteer community psych research position I took on for a little less than a year. Due to this, I had to pay for my school with student loans, and also had to take out more than needed in order to help with rent during times when I wasn't able to work full time hours (worked retail job that was not consistent, also took up two more jobs along the way)


All this has brought me to my current state. I realized how much student loans I had racked up and due to having to take loans out in both my name and my parents' name (they wouldn't let me take everything out in my name), I am going to be having two separate loan payments since my parent is not going to pay for it. I realized also that I would have to take on even more debt to pay for Grad School and also living expenses since the Master's Program doesn't allow you to work full-time. I ended up quitting my Orgo Chem class and trashed my dreams of Genetic Counseling because I simply can't afford it. However, Pysch is one of those fields where you need a Master's to move forward, and I'm not qualified for any Biology jobs since I only minored. 


Currently I am on the job hunt for anything that I would be qualified with a Psych Degree and retail merchandising/marketing experience I've acquired over the past 6 years of working at the same company. I've been feeling very discouraged looking at job listings for HR-related jobs or Marketing Data Analyst related jobs wanting 3+ years of experience. I'm finding that I'm not excited to apply for these jobs, I'm honestly looking so that I can afford my loan payments which will be coming soon. I was wondering if anyone had any advice as to what types of careers I might have been overlooking that I could be qualified for?


Here are some things that I would be looking for in a career:

-Ability to grow or move up within a company

-I do work well with others; I collaborate creatively a lot with my current job and have had therapy/caretaker roles in the past with small children, but lately I have been feeling a bit burnt out by that and would prefer to work mostly alone

-I like to work on projects that I'm able to find a concrete solution for. I enjoy putting things together, working with numbers, and being creative with what I have, but with some guidance or direction as to how the end result should be. 

-I would like to go into the corporate route and stay away from counseling or social work careers.


Experience:

-6 years visual merchandising experience along with shipment processing and selling

-3+ years caretaker/babysitter to children with disabilities

-1 year Behavioral Therapist 

-General research experience during undergrad, making surveys, using SPSS and Excel 

-Volunteer research experience: cold calling, entering data in RedCap and Excel, screening participants 

Any advice would be helpful!"

I am an intern at a Malaysian start-up, we provide a door-to-door garment care online service. I need to find a solution in order to improve the safety of our cash collection process.

I work 2 part time minimum wage jobs and I use most of the money to pay for my tuition (still live with parents at 22yo). Only declared a CS major because I thought I would make money just by graduating.  Maybe I shouldn't have, i don't even play video games or watch netflix, so I'm not even that ""into"" tech like the other CS students around me are. 

But I'm here, I know I'm supposed to do projects, but I end up wasting my time looking up possible career paths, job listings, this subreddit, tutorials, and ""code"" youtubers. I don't even know what kind of projects to make. Paralysis by Analysis and all that. I'm supposed to stop being a coward and just code but I just get anxious. Doing the CTCI/Leetcode problems makes me more depressed, I don't even care for the Big 4 . Don't have friends or anything. I wish i could see programming as interesting as other CS majors do and the thought that I 'm competing with people that like this stuff makes it worse, feel like I don't belong here.  I shut myself at the school library with the intent to learn and have the time to improve but i end up doing nothing. I feel like I'm wasting my life. Failing to learn programming gives me suicidal thoughts. If I don't learn programming, what the hell will i do with myself? Almost every lecture I'm on the verge of tears and my head hurts. I'm a huge fuckup, I know I'm relatively young and can turn this around but I don't know where to go. All I want is to be interested in something and work on it. 

Webdev seems boring to me, but it's what everyone around me does and what's hiring. Mobile dev doesn't seem interesting since I barely use my phone lol. Computer Graphics seems somewhat interesting but it's math heavy and i only studied calc to pass the requirement(another regret). Anyone into this? How would someone go around to getting a job on this?  My programming with C and OS class were kind of interesting to me, so maybe i should do something like that, but I don't know if they are hiring for that or how to even practice that, the job listings say 5+ years experience. I haven't seen much content on that,  so should i just learn from books? What path to take with that? 

For the first time ever, I'm seeking help from other people by reaching out to the school's CS adviser. I have an appointment scheduled in two days. Should I tell him this? I was told to talk to him about internship opportunities, even with my empty resume, but is it a good idea to ask about this kind of stuff as well? 

Has anyone felt like this and recovered? How can I come back from this?

Should I just quit cs after wasting all this time and money? Sometimes I wish I had picked something more traditional like nursing. But if I failed to make something happen in this huge field, how the hell would i be successful in anything else in life? "
amxla6,8,2019-02-03,23M Software Developer possible career transition,BoredPandaReviews,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/amxla6/23m_software_developer_possible_career_transition/,"I apologize for the formatting in advance, I’m on mobile.

Just to give you a bit of detail on my current qualifications, I have a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Math. I have been working as an application developer for a couple of years and have held several part time IT positions as well as internships focused in Networking. 

To be honest, I absolutely dread going into work everyday. It’s not so much the people I work with or the management team, it’s more of the work itself. I have a strong disdain for programming and while I enjoy working with computers as a hobby have found that I hate doing it as a full time position. Whether it’s the programming aspect or the hardware aspect, it just doesn’t interest me past an entry level point. I make good money but don’t know if being miserable is worth it. 

I have no direction on what I would like to transition into either. I have found myself considering career paths in finance or real estate as I find both fascinating but I’m worried that either one would just be a more of a hobby interest and less of a full time employment interest just as computing was. I am also worried about both of these fields being more of a sales job than anything as many of the careers in these areas seem to either be low paying or commission based.

The trickiest part is I need to find a career with a relatively decent starting salary (I would need like 50K annually). I have several student loans and mortgage (I know, should have waited) that need to be covered leading me to be wary of many transition positions. 

Any help on how I should approach/think about this would be greatly appreciated! A direction to look towards or ideas for transition careers would be great too! 

Thanks for your help in advance!!!"

amy358,1,2019-02-03,Stuck in a rut. How can I improve/find new opportunities?,Logansrun93,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/amy358/stuck_in_a_rut_how_can_i_improvefind_new/,"I graduated with a bachelor's degree in CS about 3 years ago, and I'm trying to decide where/what to do with my career.

During my time in college, I had an internship, which turned into a full-time position when I graduated. I have around 5 years of work experience. However, most of that experience has been working with ""older"" technologies (VB.NET, C#, ASP.NET, Access, etc).

I'd really like to branch out to some newer types of development, such as web development with newer, more popular languages and frameworks. Angular, React, Python, Ruby/Rails interest me very much. However there are a couple of issues/concerns I have with this:

I have very little experience with modern web development and don't really know where to start. I've spent all of my time working with these older systems, because that's what my job demands. I tend to learn better through courses and teaching. Is there a master's I could pursue that would help catch me up on some of this?

In my area (southeast US), there's not many companies using these new technologies. Most of the larger companies (like the ones I've worked for) are still stuck in the early 2000s development wise. I down see that changing anytime soon.

The companies that do work with these newer languages are mostly startups. I've never worked for a startup before and don't really know what goes along with that. My impression is that they are mostly populated by younger people. That's fine for now (I'm 25), but what about for the future? When I'm older, will I be phased out of these types of companies?

How can I improve/find new opportunities?,Logansrun93,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/amy65c/stuck_in_a_rut_how_can_i_improvefind_new/,"I graduated with a bachelor's degree in CS about 3 years ago, and I'm trying to decide where/what to do with my career.

During my time in college, I had an internship, which turned into a full-time position when I graduated. I have around 5 years of work experience. However, most of that experience has been working with ""older"" technologies (VB.NET, C#, ASP.NET, Access, etc).

I'd really like to branch out to some newer types of development, such as web development with newer, more popular languages and frameworks. Angular, React, Python, Ruby/Rails interest me very much. However there are a couple of issues/concerns I have with this:

I have very little experience with modern web development and don't really know where to start. I've spent all of my time working with these older systems, because that's what my job demands. I tend to learn better through courses and teaching. Is there a master's I could pursue that would help catch me up on some of this?

In my area (southeast US), there's not many companies using these new technologies. Most of the larger companies (like the ones I've worked for) are still stuck in the early 2000s development wise. I down see that changing anytime soon.

The companies that do work with these newer languages are mostly startups. I've never worked for a startup before and don't really know what goes along with that. My impression is that they are mostly populated by younger people. That's fine for now (I'm 25), but what about for the future? When I'm older, will I be phased out of these types of companies?

I’m currently a senior in my last semester. I spent two years after high school working as a salesman, and then enrolled in college. While in college, I focused on taking the maximum number of credits per semester all the while working as a salesman. My college is pretty competitive, ranking top 20 for computer science programs in the USA. I have a pretty decent CGPA, it’s above average at 3.4.

Pros : Due to working throughout college and graduating in as few semesters as I could manage, I will graduate with zero debt, with some very minor financial assistance from my parents. 

Cons : Unfortunately, my goal of graduating ASAP with minimal debt left me with no working experience in computer science. I spent my summer semesters taking courses and working instead of pursuing internships, etc.

My motivations for trying out another country is personal. I am the child of first generation immigrants and honestly, I have never fallen in love with this country as they did. I’m would like to try out different options while I’m still young. Having said that, what are my chances of finding entry level jobs in computer science in the EU, with emphasis on countries like Germany ?

Thanks in advance for all suggestions and advice.

amynt2,3,2019-02-04,Sudden uncertainty,pleasestopmyheart,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/amynt2/sudden_uncertainty/,"Okay, so - some background. I went to a prestigious high school - Catholic, private, very obsessed with college prep (like they pushed it on us from the beginning and right before senior year we had to go to a meeting where they mapped out our entire lives). I've always kind of marched to the beat of my own drum, but I took a lot of things to heart - mainly because they pushed grad school right away, even though I was only 17. It was kind of a situation where they were like ""Well okay, I *guess* you can major in film and television, but then you should get your masters in psychology and go into advertising"" even though that clearly wasn't what I wanted. But, anyway - starting off on a great foot. 

Went to undergrad with the express purpose of wanting to get into television production, mainly camera operation and floor management. I dabbled with some other stuff - did a lot of news videography, professional photography, internship in online editorial, another one in social media management - but that was the main goal, all with the idea of ""and then after my body breaks down too much to carry equipment, I'll go back for grad and become a professor"". Job market was tough though, and after graduation I wound up in a marketing job. I didn't really like it, and while I was researching something else, I stumbled on a bit of film history and suddenly I was struck with inspiration. Archival. *That's* what I wanted. I had a purpose and I started to put stuff together - I talked to an adviser about skipping a Masters and going right to PhD, looked at a few programs. Then when I got laid off from my job, I started putting a little more effort into it, realizing that I wanted to do some kind of combination of academia and archival work, but I wasn't 100% sure on what I wanted to focus on. 

I found a newish MA program close to home and it's only a two year commitment, and pretty low cost, so I jumped at the opportunity and got in! Sweet! Cool! Progress! I'll focus on that, get my MA and then use that to figure out where I want to get my PhD, cool. I got through my first year pretty okay, our program is small so it's decently attentive and I pretty much know what my wheelhouse is at this point so I finished up thinking ""Alright, cool, so I'll finish this but wait until *next* November to apply for PhDs so I can have my thesis as a writing sample"". Now, here's the kicker. 

So around the end of August, I was sitting in the airport at like 4AM getting ready to fly out for a trip to a convention I take every year around Labor Day - it's also a liiitttle work related because I usually run a couple of panels while I'm there and one of the vendors sells a lot of dead formats. It's something I look forward to a lot since it's the only time of the year I get to see certain friends. I'm sitting on top of my suitcase in the bag check line, waiting for it to open and I think to myself ""Oh, I guess I won't really be able to do this trip for a while if I get into a doctoral program because it'll conflict if I have a class or something"" and I just felt really, overwhelmingly sad. 

And I know it's a stupid reason - but then a bunch of other things started hitting me at the same time. There's only three film PhD programs in my area, and they're all kind of hard to get into. The rest of them are kind of far away and I'm dreading the idea of moving far away because:

1. My mom is the only family I have left and she's not financially stable so no safety net for either of us,  
2. I don't know how to drive because I've always had good public transport, and 
3. I have friends in lots of different parts of the country, but only small pockets are close enough together. 

Along with that came other worries about my research and finding work afterwards, or wondering if maybe I should get an MLS/MLIS instead if I want to do archival (meanwhile I can't afford another Masters degree), and just overwhelming self doubt. I basically spent this whole semester on high anxiety and my work really suffered for it. 

Recently I decided that I'm going to maybe take a couple of years before I decide on another degree, but I'm wondering if I'm just letting myself down or setting myself up for more failure since I haven't worked in an actual media based job since 2014 (I had to go back to secretarial work and lemme tell you, the impostor syndrome is real). I tried to get an internship this semester but one was an archival position that only wanted MLS students, the other was like the equivalent of a part-time job but unpaid, and the last one wanted me but I couldn't fit in enough time around work and classes. I've also told myself that if I don't get into a program close to home, I'm just going to take it as a sign that it's not meant to be.  


**TL;DR: I thought I was going to get a PhD right away, but not wanting to completely uproot my life has left me in a state of ""wtf do I do now""** "
amz6cz,404,2019-02-04,I just started working on making a contribution to an Open Source project on GitHub and whoa!,Meeesh-,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/amz6cz/i_just_started_working_on_making_a_contribution/,"I always heard about contributing to projects on GitHub but I never got around to it. I worked on my own projects and did things on my own and that was really it. The last time I remember working with an actual big project was when I was modding minecraft 4 years ago when I was a freshman in high school. Since then it was all competitions and research.

Now that I'm in college I'm looking for programs and internships, I stumbled upon Google Summer of Code. With that I have a bit more incentive to make contributions (although now I realize I would want to do that regardless of GSOC since it's really a nice way to just refine my skills). There was an organization that I really really wanted to work with and so I basically put myself all in to that in the last few weeks. I might be stupid for this, but the project is in C++ which I don't have too much experience with. As a result I spent the last two weeks driving my way though Accelerated C++ and I'm beginning to start Effective Modern C++ so I can update myself for C++11 and 14. Again I might be stupid, but I have a pretty decent history of programming and CS principles and practice so I thought it might be possible.

Anyway, while I've been looking around the repository and reading up on their conventions and code practices, I only started to work on the actual code today. Getting everything to compile and beginning to actually look around in the code to solve some of the easier issues was a really great feeling.

I know part of the reason I shied away from trying to contribute was because I was scared of the large codebases. I had worked on big projects before with several other people, but I always worked on it from the beginning or close to the beginning and those were in languages I was a lot more comfortable with than 2 weeks of reading and small scale practice. I honestly didn't expect to get much done for a while, but it's surprisingly not too bad! Yes, there is a lot of code and it's definitely a process to even get it to compile the first time, but it's not all impossible. I might be lucky to have started with a project with a good codebase, but it's definitely still a big project and I'm sure many other projects are just as easy to get into!

In any case, I'd just like to say thank you for showing me (and the rest of r/learnprogramming) GSOC and pushing us to contribute to open source. It's really not as bad as it may seem! (Or maybe it might be worse than it may seem depending on your expectations haha)"

I’m backwards maybe?,SantaClaus3,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/amzw8d/job_vs_college_im_backwards_maybe/,"So most of what I ever here is that engineering college is super stressful.. and once you get out, work is so much better. But I’m scared that it will be the other way around

I’ve had two internships, and the first one was the most stressful experience of my life and the second one was, well not bad, kind of boring and a little too corporate-y (think a very large firm like Jacobs or aecom). I was really excited to be done and go back to school. 

Of course I do find school stressful and difficult, but I was happier in school, even during the tough math classes than I was at both of my internships. I guess I put this pressure on myself that I really wanted everyone I was working for to think I was the best intern.. but with school I pretty much just feel like I’m only competing with myself (It feels this way to me, but not saying my feelings are actually reality). 

Anyways. I’m scared of ending up with a third job after school, and feeling like, crap I worked so hard for four years to end up at this place? Filling out spreadsheets and drawing on the computer and going to meetings all day? And I feel like if I mess up everyone involved will be angry and disappointed with me, and I’ll get fired? 

Anyone else ever feel like this? It’s just.. I like school better.. because the only pressure I feel is that which I put on myself to succeed. And I have been succeeding. In school at least. "

After being rejected and ignored by lots of companies finally I got three offers for summer internships in Europe. Now, I am struggling to choose so I thought that maybe you could give me some advice.

The salary and perks are very similar and not really important for me so I am just deciding what Company would be better regarded to put in my CV if after I would like to apply to some top companies for Software Engineers. This would be my only internship. I do not consider return offers because I am going for a master.

* So Intel is Intel, I think that is well considered but perhaps is not so well regarded if I am applying for Software Engineer jobs.
* Amazon I guess that even if the job done there is not the most exciting I guess that is well considered from other companies.
* And the startup is about AI and has X0 millions in funding and some agreement with the government to develop some protoypes. Probably the enviroment for the internship would be really nice but I am afraid that it will help me less in my CV.

So if you could give your opinion about how would you rank the options (X &gt;= Y &gt;= Z) you would help me a lot.

Thanks!"

A company I was once interested interning with has now opened up a new internship titled “IT administrative intern”.

Currently, my financial situation has improved and I could afford the pay cut for the internship.

I’m in a weird spot as while my  FAFSA does have errors that my family and I are correcting, I honestly don’t expect to get too much aid once that’s finished with. I won’t share too many details, but let’s just say that I thought we were lower middle class, turns out we’re not, my parents are just horrible with money and have tons of debt. 

Right now I’m trying to make the decision between the two schools. While I know that both schools offer amazing CS programs, and that UMass might make more sense financially, I’m still seriously considering Northeastern for a number of reasons:

-	UMass doesn’t offer any design programs
-	Northeastern offers Co-Op (which means more experience at graduation and (correct me if I’m wrong on this) much less competition for internship [co-op] spots at FAANG-caliber companies)
-	A bunch of dumb personal considerations including the fact that I love Northeastern and that I love Boston 

Now, I don’t suspect that my family is willing to give me a ton for school despite their relatively high income, so now it’s a question of how much in loans I should be willing to take when making the decision. Are the reasons valid enough to justify going to Northeastern and taking on extra debt? As a CS major, how much in loans is too much? And bonus, what things can I do to reduce my debt out of college?

Thanks a ton. "

I need some advise on choosing my career path, especially in South SF - San Jose area. I'm in the middle of Software Engineer - Networking path, so kinda confuse on which path is the best.

&amp;#x200B;

**About me:**

* Graduated 2017, Bachelor Software Engineer. I can code and I have fun with coding. I worked during school as OpenStack Research Assistant with Arista gears, and got my IEEE paper accepted.
* My big passion is in Networking (my dad in the network industry for 20 years), hence during college I got my CCNA:Sec and CCNP: R&amp;S. Got my intern with a tier 1 networking company (Not Cisco), continue as a part time and fulltime. I got JNCIP: Sec and JNCIS: Cloud using my work experience.
* My role is in a Proof of Concept lab, mostly software with no hardware touch, about Cloud, SDN and Automation, working with Virtualization and private cloud/public cloud. I have many hand-on experience working with their router/switch/firewall and latest security software. I dont do pure coding dev, but more like scripting with Python and Ansible.
* After 1.5 years, got laid off 2 week ago due to company restructure. I've been pushing my study algorithm, OOP using both Java and Python.

**My Target:**

I want to  land a job in Software Engineer. Preferable code development on Network/Cloud/SDN, even Security but those requires tons of experience. I'm unsure about Test/QA role as I feel they are temporary and easy to be replaced.

I'm 23, married, and don't like job hoping so as long as compensation is good and above average, I'd stay for long term.

**My Question:**

1. Should I stick with applying for entry level (even New Grad) for getting experience, or aim for experienced role (not New Grad)? I'm applying both but those days hard to get a response... At least got recruiters reached out on Linkedin.
2. Should I aim for top companies or go with medium-large companies for Software Dev experience ?
3. How much my skillset is worth? I mean is it considered to be junior/no experience, or can be consider 2+ in dustry experience?
4. With my skillset, should I focus on software engineer roles for Cloud/Network/Sec/SDN, or shift to regular Software Dev instead?
5. I got an offer from a large size company (10000+) for a Test Automation (hybrid cloud related) role, title ""Sr Software Engineer"" with 86k. Is it decent or low ? My Friends and my wife got at least 95k being bachelor new grad with no experience, and Sr. title at least 120k....

Thanks for any advice guys.

&gt;A Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) is no doubt a valuable academic experience. However, it lacks the primary component of real world experience in a professional production environment, which is very different from an academic research environment. Consequently, it does not meet the acceptance criteria and we cannot accept the REU as a professional practice/internship.


I don't have any experience with an REU so I am not really in a position to question their decision. But I am wondering, in terms of grad school and jobs onwards, if they are considered differently.

Any clarification would be very helpful, thank you very much."

Backstory: I have a bachelors degree from university in an unrelated field that I found that I dislike[public health]. I am now attending a community college for programming and cyber security. I immediately went back to school after graduating univeristy.

I am pretty burnt out on school and living paycheck to paycheck. I live in western Massachusetts. The dilemma is, do I go to a four year school to finish a bachelors in CS or do I apply for jobs and certs? I have had an internship as a sysadmin and am soon to be starting a network security auditing internship. I am in my last semester of community college, and am really torn on what to do. It seems in my best interest to go to university again, but I really do not want to. I am tired of eating 2 meals a day so that I can pay my bills, so I would like to get a job, but I don't want to be overly hopeful and shoot my self in the foot by trying to opt for jobs and not getting anything.

Does anyone have advice? And suggestions on what I should do? Has anyone else been here before? I feel pretty lost and quite torn on what I think I want to do and what I think I should do."

I got an offer from an established company in Seattle versus a start up in Palo Alto. The problem is that for the established company, I got put on a team that doesn't really interest me within SWE. For the start up in Palo Alto, it's very much the work I want to be doing which is data science. The problem is that if I take the start up in Palo Alto, I'll be taking a massive pay cut. The salary is literally barely enough to survive in Palo Alto.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering what would be a better career move. The way I see it is if I work for the established company, I could get a return offer and maybe get placed on a team I like. If I work for the start up, I could get a return offer if they are still around but I doubt they would offer me much for a full time job given the intern pay is so little. I realize it's only 2 months but I was trying to think long term in what would be the better move."

It feels like my mind unnecessary finds problems to worry about and I cannot get away with it. I am always lost in them. Sometimes I cannot get myself to focus on important things in life, and I hate myself for it. I can never be productive enough to feel good about myself. I am passionate about so many things in life, but I have struggled to keep my focus on those things. 

I definitely have super high expectations from myself, and that's part of the problem. I worry that I wouldn't be able to achieve my goals. My goals are too unrealistic if I compare it to the amount of work I put in. Don't get me wrong though. I work hard!! I am in my senior year of college majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with a decent gpa, and I have already finished three internships with fortunate 100 companies. I also overcame the financial struggles of being a college student on my own, but I don't seem to think that I am focusing on the right things in life. Every minute I waste makes me frustrated, and I hate myself for it. I know loving myself is important in finding peace within myself but i feel like no matter how mature I am in terms of understanding what's wrong or right for me, I can't seem to be practical about it. 

I am also away from my family in another country to pursue my career. My Dad passed away when I was one year old, and mom did everything to raise me and my three other siblings on her own. Sometimes I feel guilty to be away from my family for too long even though my mom is happy like most moms are.
I also have problem keeping friends. I have never had like a best friend or good friend because I cannot stay in touch with people for long. I can't really say that I am an introvert because I love going out to different meetups, but sometimes I can't even consider myself extrovert due to not having enough friends to have that connection I would like. Also it feels like a lot of work these days to make friends because I feel like I am always tired of worrying too much.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be graduating in May and I feel really good about what I have been able to accomplish during my college years. I have a 4.0 GPA, I have had a summer internship in which we built an API for the company from the ground up and I loved that experience. I worked in go and did 95% of the front-end. I have been working on an Android app for the state of SC since July and it will be going live on the Google Play store sometime in May! Its a health app for lower income folks to easily find free clinics and locations that offer free health metric readings; and keep up with those! I made the UI, designed the buttons, icons, etc. It's doubling as my capstone project as we are getting a grant from the state and I was chosen to work on it. I am a humbled person, but as a friend told me the other day, I have locked myself away for the past few months working super hard so I need to get it out there. I've written some awesome code I'm so proud of.

&amp;#x200B;

I have worked my butt off since 2015 and have no debt. I am a very lucky person that wanted to make the absolute most out of my opportunities and my parents wanting me to have the best future possible! I love learning new things and have a minor in Math. I love math too..

&amp;#x200B;

I have always wanted to move away from rural SC. I have to drive an hour to campus daily and have always wanted to move ""somewhere,""  but I honestly don't know where to start looking. I don't know if I should find a location, scope out a place to live, then interview, or do the complete opposite process. I haven't begun interviewing or applying yet because I do not know where I want to go next in life. So..

Basically I want to live somewhere warm, but besides that I really just want to hear ideas! Where could I show my hard work ethic off the best? Would I make it in the valley after all or should I work first? Thank you guys very much and have a good night."

Here's a little bit of my background:

 - BA in Math w/ minor in Comp Sci
 - 2 month web dev internship
 - 1 year at current job as IT Technician
 - No certifications

When I first graduated college I was hoping to get into software engineering, but I didn't have much luck with that and my current job was the first offer I got and I needed money so I took it. I still enjoy programming and would like a job where I can make use of those skills as much as possible even if it's not really a software job.

So I'm really just trying to figure out what the next steps for my career should be. My two main questions are:

 - What areas of IT would make sense to pursue given my background?

 - Should I be trying to get certifications, and if so, which ones?"

&amp;#x200B;

From June to January, I completed a co-op with a Fortune 500 themed entertainment company.  Prior to starting this role I was very excited to begin working in this industry and this co-op helped re-affirm my interest in wanting to continue working in this industry.  Unfortunately, my boss didn't want to extend my co-op for another 6 months, but I networked my way throughout the company to find more opportunities I could transition to.  I took opportunities to work for other engineers on different teams so I could prove to them what I could do, and I thought it was going great.  Our interests were aligning, and they seemed to be pleased with the work I was doing.  Unfortunately, 2 teams I worked closely with said they just didn't have enough work to do an extension, so I left the company with no further job prospects in early January.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been actively applying for other roles in the same industry.  One was a contractor who specializes in animatronics took great interest in me, and was ready to send me an offer letter, only to back out last minute because one of their more senior engineers suddenly became free and there was no need for me anymore.  Recently, I interviewed for another position with the same company I did my internship at, and today I got the bad news that someone else ""with more project experience was chosen"".  Right now, 2019 just hasn't started off right and it's because I feel like navigating my way to my dream job just isn't working out in my favor.

&amp;#x200B;

The themed entertainment industry feels relatively small compared to other industries like aerospace and medical devices, and right now I feel like my hopes for continuing to work in my dream job are lost because opportunities are rare.  It's not that I don't think I can ever go back to themed entertainment, but for my next job I'm just not excited to be working in another industry that I don't have much interest in.  I'm looking into medical devices and aerospace since those opportunities are prevalent in my area, and I used to work in medical devices before my co-op started, but after finding my way to a dream job only to end up getting pushed out of it, I feel this anxiety about having to go back to something that doesn't interest me.

&amp;#x200B;

Liking what I do is of big importance to me, and moving forward I just can't help but feel despondent that I am not going to like my next opportunity.  I'm looking for advice from anyone who's dealt with these feelings, and how they moved forward, or even eventually found their way back into their dream job."

Background: I'm currently a senior who accepted a full time position somewhere, and I was in contact with this recruiter at this other company that I recently notified that I wouldn't be pursuing their openings. I've talked to this recruiter a bunch before at my school's career fairs, including for internships and full time. However, this company doesn't start the hiring process until later in the school year, so that's why I never got around to actually going through their interview process.

I'm basically wondering, even if I did turn down their opportunity, would it be acceptable for me to recommend my friends to this position, or is this strictly prohibited? Note again that I'm on good relations with this recruiter personally, and I cut off the opportunity amicably - the recruiter even replied that hopefully we can get in contact in the future.

This is for software engineering. There's no formal referral process I know (also because I won't be working for this company).

So,  the sparknotes of my situation. I am graduating with a 4-year  Bachelor's of Science at the end of April 2020, and am currently in 5  months into a 12 month paid full-time internship and will return  full-time to school in September. I am extremely fortunate in that my  parents are paying for my schooling, so I have zero debt right now and  when I graduate. On the downside, I have only ever been able to work  summers or part-time in high school for not verymuch (And went  unemployed last summer which ate my savings) and had to cover vehicle  costs over my degree and have consistently had very little liquid  assets.

My  goal is to have as much saved up by the end of the internship so I have  money to make it through my last school year and immediately after I  graduate and I inevitably struggle to find a job.

Going  into this internship I was beyond broke to the point where I had to  borrow $2000 from my parents just to get off my feet (It's a long nasty  story) and had $800 on my CC (Made it a priority to get that paid off  immediately). I currently reside in Canada, and my take-home for the  year post-taxes is about $22k CDN ($1900 a month).

My monthly expenses are as follows:

Rent - $650 (House with lots of roommates)

Utilities - $70 (We split evenly, old house with poor insulation so high heating bill)

Car  Insurance - $210 (Having an fender bender three years ago, and being an  under-25 male). Cheapest it can get, Third-party coverage only with a  special group rate with the company I work with.

Gas - $280 (Commute is about half an hour to work, vehicle is 25+ year old truck that is very poor on gas)

Phone - $80

Food  - $350 (It seems high, but I'm bulk buying couscous, chicken breasts,  spinach, and milk and never eat out. Alcohol budget is minimal, I rarely  drink and never at bars. Food is very expensive in my city (Edmonton)).  I struggled a very long time with health problems that left me nearly  dead. A lot of it involved my stomache and was left extremely  malnourished. I have made a full recovery, but eating lots and eating  well is a number one priority for me. I have a very high metabolism, so I  need to eat 2500+ calories just to maintain my already below-average  weight.

Internet - $23

Total:  $1663/month, leaving me $230 at the end of each month. But, things like  gas/food/utilities are sadly somewhat conservative estimates, and often  end up higher especially with such a cold winter. I usually clear $100  by the end of the month with random pop-up costs if I'm lucky.  Thankfully, I have no loan payments or credit card debt so I consider  myself lucky!

Life  is currently extremely tight. As we speak, I have about $400 to my name  after half my bills and I'll have to wait until my paycheck comes in to  pay the rest. This is how I've been living these last couple years and  frankly it's exhausting, but I don't see where I can cut costs much so I  can build savings. Moving in with my parents is a non-option until I  graduate, they live across the country and the car, while a money sink  is a necessity given public transit in my city would take over two hours  to get to work, and three to get home with rush hour traffic.

After a week, the recruiter got back to me and said that the marketing managers decided they didn't want a marketing intern anymore and wanted someone who would work full-time. I said thank you for your time, and she asked if I wanted to connect with her on LinkedIn. She even told me to reach out again in the future for other opportunities, possibly in the summer.

I left that alone for a good while and didn't think much of it, but today, on LinkedIn, one of my senior classmates at my university posted that she got a job at my company -- the same internship that I applied for. I was beyond shocked to see that as she was still going to school (not a full-time candidate) and that title triggered me.

2. Snowflake Computing - cloud based data warehouse company, the offer is software engineering internship in Berlin, with the salary of around 2500 euro after tax. The project will be related to query processing and optimization(more cs theory related).

The thing is I talked with team leads of the both companies, and the project at Snowflake seems more interesting and company is more reputable than the first one, however the pay is a bit lower, and I am MS in CS at one of the Swiss Federal Techs which makes me think twice because I must save some money while internship because of the high expenses for my second year in Switzerland.

for my final project at school, I have to make an Android app that has a real business use for the company I intern at.

The deadline to upload the documentation is labour day, May 1st 2019.  The project itself is supposed to take 60 hours, including documentation, so I have some time to study up before I start.

Assuming I know nothing about app development, just a little OOP in Java and JS, what route should I go? I'd love to learn cross platform straight out of the box, but I'm not sure just how much more work it is to learn.

Nobody in my company knows Kotlin yet, so I can chose between JS (React Native or Cordova, the latter of which I ruled out myself) and native Java. I liked JS more thus far, but Java is so ubiquitous in my country that it's hard to get around.

Are both paths realistic? Could a relatively new learner make a functional app with good documentation with either technology? Is there a substantial difference between those two?

So some background I’m a senior in high school attending the University of Cincinnati in the fall to major in IT. Summer 2018 I worked as a paid intern for a medium sized local company, just around the 55 million worth mark nothing huge.

Anyways I had a really positive experience with all of the staff there and they said they’d love to see me back. I learned a ton for sure and they appreciated the extra help, as they only have an IT department of one person. Is there anything I should include or say in particular when I go to contact them about possibly interning again this summer?

I have no certifications.

I am struggling to decide whether I want to start working now and pick up some certifications or get a master's either in analytics or cybersecurity right off the bat.

All my internships were more aligned with databases and although I have a greater understanding of techology now, it still might as well be witchcraft.  Hoping the certs would help that.

How should I proceed?  Would data science or cybersec benefit more from a masters?  Do I have to focus on one over the other?  Would I even benefit from a master's without certs and years of experience?

So I have been looking for an internship over the past few months and have had ZERO success. I’m not really sure why but I feel I am around average compared to others at my current level. I have applied to around 20 different businesses (both corporate and local) but no luck yet. So what are some things that are essentially required to have on your resume that makes you stand out?

Some background about me. I go to a rather small university that isn’t really known for the computer science department. I have around a 2.8 gpa (not stellar but I haven’t included it in my resume). I will be graduating hopefully in 2020 but the department is switching some things up so I may actually graduate in 2021 or around December in 2020 instead of May. I have taken the basic computer science courses as well as data structures. My school has only been using C++ and C in the introductory classes but this semester is heavily Python with a databases class using SQL (MySQL and NoSQL I believe) I have also completed a Criminal Justice minor with the idea or going into the Cyber Security field but I’m still torn between Software Development or Cyber Security. I have also achieved Eagle Scout which of course is on my resume.

Thanks!"

The idea behind that is to have consultant who represent the enterprise into another enterprise, to do a project. To develop the IT for the client.

If you have the English, I will gladly appreciate it, it will be easier for the next :)

So, my question is, how does it work in there, where you are starting the job.

I'm young, unsure of myself and afraid of being left alone with a big client and his big project, so even is the offers are attractive, how do you manage to start in there?

anidvg,1,2019-02-05,Looking for some direction,OfficerFuttBuck,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/anidvg/looking_for_some_direction/,"So I'm trying to figure out what my best bet is for my career, I'm kind of in an awkward spot but I have a fair amount of experience. 

I've been programming since the age of 15, and I'm almost 25 now. I'm a terrible student, but at work I consider myself exceptional. 

A brief history of me and my programming experience:

15-18 took every computer science class available at my high school, completed AP Computer Science with a 4 on the exam and an A for the class.

18-19 Went to Ohio State for Computer Science, dropped out due to lack of maturity and not taking it seriously.

19-20 Worked in retail, hoping it would help me gain some discipline, as I had never had a job before.

20-22 Enrolled at a community college for Software Engineering, performed well at computer science, database and math classes. Still struggled to be a good student in other courses or any online class, frequently withdrew from courses. Continued working retail.

23-24 Suffered a mental health break, stopped taking classes and fired from job. Diagnosed and medicated, re-enrolled at community college for summer semester.

1 week into the summer semester, I was offered a paid internship at a large corporation, which I promptly accepted. However, the community college refused to refund the classes I was registered for, even though it was standard for the school to fully refund dropped classes within the first week of the starting date. I continued to work at the internship throughout the summer and kept trying to get the classes refunded. 

At the end of the summer, I decided to bite the bullet for the refund and decided never to take a class from the college again. On the plus side, the company was impressed with me and extended my internship for another semester under a different manager. This extension went as well as my initial semester, with both my boss and his boss being impressed with my work. Unfortunately, there were no positions available for me at the end of the internship, though my manager wished there was so he could hire me.

Present: I had planned on declassifying/debranding the projects I had made while at my internship and making a portfolio website for them, but I've been struggling to stay on task with the amount of distractions there are. 

Languages that I know:
SQL, C#, C, VB, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, asp.NET

Languages/other stuff I want to learn:
GitHub, Node.js, mongoDB, data science, collaborative programming.

A little bit about the internship:
I was given full stack projects, where I made internal company tools. Each of these projects I wrote every line of code, designed the website, and built the necessary server schema and procedures. One of the projects I had to do extensive data cleaning and validation, as the existing tables were horrific and slow. 

I self taught myself essentially everything I didn't know coming into the internship, largely being asp and javascript. The only questions I asked my managers were company specific to their database. Additionally, my close friend was an intern there already (who's largely responsible for me getting hired there), and within the first two weeks, I was answering his questions he had about his projects. I was able to easily remain on task throughout the day and I feel like learned more from the 6 months I had worked there than anything I had learned at college, aside from SQL.

So this leaves me with the question, where do I go from here? 

I've considered coding bootcamps, but they seem to be overhyped, and I would prefer to go somewhere for people who already have programming skills, rather than totally new programmers. 

I'm hesitant about enrolling at a university since I know that I'm not a good student / I struggle with working from home.

Any advice would be appreciated!"

Since this is my second degree, I was only in the program for two years.

This is relevant because I don't feel like I'm cut out for this field. Within the two years, I've been having a hard time fitting in everything I need to learn, including all the courses I need to graduate, and then all the extra things that the school doesn't teach you. I haven't even done an algorithms course, so I'll also need to learn that. It's overwhelming how much I need to learn by the time I graduate, and it still won't be enough to get me ready.

Additionally, I'm not the smartest person. I'm quite slow with learning concepts - it took me last night and today to answer a question regarding bitwise operators, for example. And while my GPA is decently high, I feel like I got it from memorizing theory and just learning to get by on labs. I don't feel like I really learned anything. I'm nervous because if I take harder courses like Operating Systems and Algorithms, I won't survive because I'm so stupid and there's too much material in those courses. 

(Seriously - I feel like my brain has melted in the past year. I can't code as well, I can't find bugs as easily, and I can't come up with solutions to stuff like my lab questions as quickly. SQL queries should be easy for me, but for some reason, I'm really struggling.)

Additionally, I spend all day working on my assignments. I get home exhausted and not wanting to think about code. Is that normal?

I’m currently doing my law masters and my undergraduate was philosophy. I graduated with honours and I’m doing great right now which is great because law tends to be quite difficult. I also happen to have a part time job at a pharmaceutical company as an indirect tax advisor, previously I was working for a big four firm for 2 years as an indirect tax advisor ad well. My career curve looks impressive in my cv since (at least I think it does) because I was studying and working at the same time and I started there as a trainee and was promoted after two months to assistant then to senior assistant in a 6 months.

I have been to the US many times and I think it would help my career an awful lot if I could get an internship opportunity there. However I know that this could be a difficulty for me, since A) laws are completely dependant on countries and B) your indirect tax system is completely different than what we have here in the EU. Despite these facts I know that many big four firms and other top tier consulting firms have services related to the European Union, like business settlement or other tax related queries that may occur. Also while law tends to be very local, finances are getting more and more globalized and I think there’s a tendency of unification.

So my question is, what do you guys think would be the best idea for me to get this internship? Any tips? Am I fucked with my law masters? Please help, this would be a dream come true for me.

(or am I delusional?),xyz9100,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ankxru/how_do_i_text_an_ex_my_feelings_and_regret_of/,"I would extremely appreciate advice on this. I don't have anyone I can turn to for advice at the moment.

I put details of the break up at the bottom because its very long and personal (but i guess this question can only be answered depending on the context of the relationship??)

1 year ago from today my ex and I broke up. She's someone I genuinely love and is perfect for me in so many ways. I can't help but think how shitty my life was all of last year and how perfect it would've been had we stayed together. I want to message her how I regret my actions and breaking up with her was the worst decision I've ever made.

Is this a bad idea? If not, how do I express myself without sounding soo.....desperate? pitiful? (My vocabulary is not that extensive)

Background (This might be a little long, I'm sorry) :

I will start this prior to where I believe our relationship started to go down. Prior to this it was amazing and I had never been happier in my life.

Its August of 2018 and we have been dating for about 1yr&amp;3mo. She was in her home state for the summer working and I was working doing research at university. When I picked her up from the airport and saw her for the first time she told me she had to admit something to me. A few weeks ago this guy she knew (before we dated - also our classmate) was interning in the city by hers so they got together one night to hang and they ended up making out. Nothing more. I definitely believed her and was happy she didn't lie \*\*BUT\*\* unfortunately I am obsessively insecure about my social/sex life and she knows this and as much as I tried maintaining a clear head it bothered me to an extent and trust issues/jealousy were beginning to form.

However, I loved this woman and I kept thinking ""all they did was kiss it's not big deal"" and I did not want to lose her over a stupid drunken mistake that she made, feels absolutely terrible for, and told me first chance she got in person. She screwed up and handled in the best way possible i think. How else do you try to fix relationship when you screw up like that? Most lie and she didn't. I still loved her and wanted to date her and we did for that semester ( Fall 2018 at the time and were now seniors) however during that period I noticed trust issues being formed, me declining her for sex more often, and bringing ""him"" up sometimes in arguments not related. She even said she wished she never told me about ""him"" that how often we fought about this. It was a rocky semester and looking back I'm sure i was verbally abusive about it during my emotional phase.

Come last semester of senior year and ""he"" is back at school after 6mo internship. We got in a BIG fight that pretty much resulted in we need to stop these outrageous arguments or break up. She was right. I thought about it long and hard the next day and decided I was going to be a better boyfriend and make our relationship strong again. I no longer cared about insecurities of ""how I've only been with x number of woman"" (which is so stupid to think of even though it still bother me now) while my partner and others have had more experiences at my age.

You ever have those moments you just \*\*completely\*\* change your mindset? Mine was 100% for the better. I went over to my girlfriends house, we talked. I asked her if she was talking to him or texting him and she said no and I believed her. I wanted to believe her. I loved her so goddamn much and we have a very successful future together. We had amazing sex. After, while she was in the shower I was sitting there in bed SO SO SO HAPPY about my life and excited for the future. I had quit smoking weed too because a of job so that means I could go out even more with her!

\*\*THIS IS WHERE SHIT HITS THE FUCKING FAN AND I RUIN MY FUCKING LIFE\*\*

While im waiting for her to shower, I see her apple watch next to me. I was hesitant and part of me didn't want to touch it. I believed her and told her I was going to improve myself. No snooping. But (and fuck my life for this) to solidify this pure feeling of happiness I opened her watch and only scrolled to see if I'd find ""his"" name. I didn't read anything else. Immediately my heart sinks. My happiness is faded and an emotional tsunami overwhelms me. I see ""his"" name. I open the messages and it nothing a but her sending him a bunch of drunk texts at 2 am saying things like:

""hey"" , ""are we okay?"" , ""whats up??"" a bunch of times late at night when shes drunk and he almost never replies.

But what stuck out the most was ""Low key I miss you"".

Reading that destroyed me. I kept my cool when she got out of the shower, I went home, immediately went into a mental fiasco with myself as to what I should do. I was DEEPLY IN LOVE with this girl yet felt so BETRAYED. I still wanted to date her at the same time I felt like I'd be viewed as a pussy by others or don't respect myself well enough if I decided to stay with someone who is texting a guy she hooked up with that makes me feel shitty. Being alone with these thoughts was very dangerous and I pretty much drove myself to the ultimatum that she stops talking to ""him/ texting""him"" or we break up (more prepared to breakup i think) . I went over to her house furious and immediately started yelling how I found the messages (which she coincidentally deleted in the few hours I wasn't at her place) and gave her the ultimatum She said no. She said I can't control who she talks to and I cant force her not to talk/see him. In my rage I YELLED I WANT TO BREAK UP and left and all I hear is the loudest scream ever and crying behind me. I couldn't believe what I did i was still an emotional mess, crying, and had zero idea if what I did was right or not. I do know I yelled louder and harder than ever its the thing that I regret so much. I wish i put more thought and time into it. After that, we don't talk the whole weekend until Monday when I go over to talk and she breaks up with me. Since then my life has been depressing and reflecting back on 2018 it all could've been avoided had I not snooped or freaked out on her.

I love her so much. I want to marry her, have a family with her. She did things that I don't think anyone could do. I've never connected with anyone more. I want to tell her these feelings and I want to be with her \*\*BUT\*\* at the same time my insecurities multiplied when we broke up and since then my life has been depressing and I know (through a mutual friend) shes been going out and hooking up with guys. Getting back with her now would make it feel like we took a break from our relationship and during that break i did nothing while she ""explored"" and then we got back together. Makes me want to try and dating/""exploring"" before getting back with her even though I really want to (Or is this not normal and I'm being delusional)? I think i'm finally gonna try and start therapy about this and my other insecurities.

I guess I'm looking for a consensus/validation on if i royally fucked up or not.

I've never been so lost and could really use some help. This is my first ever relationship and she was my first for alot of things. Im 23M

Should I message her?

What can I do to improve myself as well?

Guess i should mention I'm also a sensitive guy that was bullied pretty hard b/t in middle/high school and its affects me still so please don't be dick but I guess i need a punch to the face from the hard truth.

Thank you for reading this all. I feel like i finally am able to post my thoughts clearly this and hope for some good advice and feedback."

I'm trying to see if a summer internship could help me get some experience and possibly help with the tiresome journey that is college.

I have applied at over a dozen different internships in my state and a few out of state, but have only heard back from Google - who said they declined.

I have a semester's experience with C++ and C, with a little bit in computer architecture and hardware.

Would an internship be right for me? I'm not sure I have enough experience yet to show I'm worth having around, but I really want to see what having my degree will be like.

First of all, your weather fucking sucked, who the fuck would choose to live in that climate?  But that's not the point, here's some feedback that I have that might help you guys in your quest to get a good internship or entry level position.

1.) **Show up early or late.**  Most of the companies there have interview rooms for OCIs (on campus interviews) the following day.  Early in the day (like right out the gate, as soon as the doors open), if you're competent, we're probably going to book you because we don't know what the day is going to be like.  Late in the day, we might have some empty interview slots that we don't want to go to waste.  I think I was the hard-ass at my booth, I booked the first 2 people I talked to, and the last person I talked to, primarily for those reasons.  Your priority at the fair is to book the OCI, plain and simple.

2.) **Have a strategy.**  What differentiates you?  This is super fucking important, I'm going to talk to people non stop from fair open to fair close, what will make me take note of you?  It could be a hackathon project you participated in, it could be a pet project or an internship you did earlier, it could be some creative/interesting questions that you ask me, but you need to stick out.  

3.) **If there's a wait to talk to recruiters for a company, do some research while you're waiting!** I have maybe 7 or 8 minutes to devote to you, do you really want me to spend 2 or 3 of those minutes talking about my company when you could be selling me on yourself?  

4.) **There are basic levels of normal, please fit within them.** I know I said you want to stick out, but stick out for the correct reasons.  Don't stick out because of poor hygiene and don't stick out because you don't have the most basic communication skills.  Don't wear shorts and a t-shirt, but for me and my company, I really don't give a fuck if you wear a suit, it's nice if you have one, but don't be discouraged if all you have is a polo shirt and slacks or something.

Bonus OCI tip:

5.) **If you book that OCI, know how to go against the grain. (stick out)**  The place that I was recruiting at all of their classes were done in C++, which means that they all had a similar way of solving the algorithm questions.  I'm used to an area where they primarily do Java/Python, and the candidates tend to go in a totally different direction with their answers.  Some of the candidates are completely unable to think in the other paradigm, either they are so used to having to write everything themselves (C++) or they are overly reliant on built in functions (java/python).

That's my feedback to you guys, I hope you guys do well.  Let me know if you have any questions."
annby0,11,2019-02-06,Do you feel like there are enough internship opportunities? (CS/CE/EE majors),Italian_Person,UCDavis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/annby0/do_you_feel_like_there_are_enough_internship/,"My TAG was accepted for Fall 2019 for Computer Science.

I fear that going to Davis might be a disadvantage in terms of internship opportunities due to its location. I guess I'm worried that I might be more likely to get an internship if I go to the other schools I applied to that are located in more populated areas and/or closer to tech hubs (UCSB, UCSC, and Cal Poly SLO). I'm making big assumptions here, so I figured I would ask you guys. Thanks!

Internships are something I have been focusing on lately, because I've only had two small internships in high school senior year (3 years ago at this point), that never really went anywhere and ended somewhat poorly. In retrospect, I really wished I focused on getting an internship prior to transfer instead of maintaining a high GPA. "

https://i.redd.it/bldfh1q7tve21.png

On 20th December 2018, the Cyber and Information Security Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued an order which authorises ten security and intelligence agencies to intercept, monitor and decrypt any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource.

We called to attention the risks this poses to our online privacy saying that it enables surveillance without any transparency or oversight. It lacks any meaningful safeguards. These arguments are at the centre of the [**case filed by IFF** ](https://internetfreedom.in/supreme-court-issues-notice-on-iffs-petition-for-survelliance-reform-saveourprivacy/)which is challenging the legality of the digital surveillance system before the Supreme Court of India.

In order to get to the bottom of this order and do something about it, IFF filed six RTIs seeking answers to the following rather basic questions:

1. How many times has the government used its powers for an interception?
2. How many agencies have been authorized to intercept, monitor or decrypt data?    
3. The names and the directions provided to the abovementioned agencies.
4. Date, time and duration of meetings conducted by the Review Committee.
5. How many times has the government received requests from different agencies seeking interception? Number of requests deniedNumber of requests approved
6. How many times has an order been issued to prevent any offence which affects the sovereignty, integrity, defence or security of the state? Number of times order issued to investigate into an offence

According to us, these are very reasonable queries. They can help us understand how surveillance works in India. How much does the state tap our smartphones? How many times does it ask for our personal data from online companies? Such disclosure can suggest broad operational trends and the implementation of safeguards. Such aggregate data would in no way impact national security.

Well to our disappointment all six RTIs were rejected. The grounds cited are sections 8(1)(a), 8(1)(g) and 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act 2005 on the grounds that ‘Disclosure of information related to lawful interception/phone tapping/monitor or decrypt is exempted’. This basically means that the government is unwilling to tell us who has access to all our private data and why they have access to it. If anything this reply confirmed was the complete secrecy and lack of oversight in digital surveillance by the Government of our personal data.

Next steps? We will be filing an appeal against this denial and pursuing these RTIs to their logical conclusion.

We would also like to indicate that RTI Activist, Mr. Venkatesh Nayak (Coordinator, Access to Information, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative) has filed similar RTIs and received a similar rejection. He has recently penned a legal analysis on it [**at the Leaflet**](https://theleaflet.in/computers-intercepted-transparency-interrupted-mhas-cpio-refuses-information-about-december-2018-authorisation-order-under-the-it-act)​.

ano0o5,1,2019-02-06,I have two more semesters after this current one before graduation. Should I take a supervisor role at my current job or hold out for a possible internship?,WhiteWolfofUtah,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ano0o5/i_have_two_more_semesters_after_this_current_one/,"So the title pretty much says it all - after two more semesters I'll be graduating with my bachelor's in CS. I currently have an opportunity to go for a supervisor position at my current job, which is not CS related in any way. It would be additional responsibilities, but it would also look better on a resume and have more benefits. I apply for as many internships/part time CS jobs as I can every week but have had no luck so far. 

My biggest concern is that outside of schoolwork, I have no 'portfolio' to speak of. I have done no personal projects and had no internships, and while those aren't required to land a job after graduation I've heard that they make it a bit easier to get one. I have no guarantee of an internship, but I would hate to apply for/accept a supervisor role, only to get an internship opportunity a few weeks after and have to choose. There's unfortunately a lot of variables (heh) here because so much is up in the air. 

I'm not sure if it's relevant, but I have no interest in the big popular companies where internships are ""required"" to get noticed. I don't really have a passion for CS (I don't do any coding in my personal time, which is a bit obvious seeing as I have no personal projects), I'm just doing it because it was the natural path for me to take. Given the industry and new grads, would it be better to hold out for a potential internship down the road? Or should I take a better, non-CS related job now and just focus on finishing school?"

I’m a boy.

We have a college WhatsApp group where registration links of Recruiting companies that visit our campus are posted. This is specially for final year students to find jobs. 

So in the last week, there was a message posted on this group which read as, ‘Diversity Referral Program’. It was the recruitment drive of one of the fortune 500 companies. I was damn excited for applying for it as the job profile completely matched my skill-set also they were offering a decent salary. 

I clicked on the google forms link and proceeded to enter my details. 
The recruitment process followed: 
1. Resume Screening
2. Coding Test
3. Interviews

I entered all my details and uploaded my fresh tailored resume for this role.

After two days I received an email mentioning that I had cleared the resume screening round and now I had to appear for the online coding test. I was very happy since resume screening is a mass rejection weapon and I had cleared it. Now I needed to clear the coding test, which I knew I would, because I had practiced that a lot! 

I appear for the coding test, and my programs pass all the test cases. 
I was sure that I’m at least getting an opportunity to interview since I had completed all the questions. 

Now I start preparing for the interviews. I checked up all the questions which were asked in the previous interviews for that position from the internet. I brush up all of my previous personal and internship projects. 
I get an email from that company’s recruiting team specifying that they would like to invite me for an interview.

The interview is scheduled on this Friday. 
Out of curiosity I checked up on LinkedIn for the employees of that company in my connections. Form there I found one of my friend who’s working in that company. So I messaged him asking for tips or suggestions for the interview. He asked me how did I apply for that company. So I told him that I had applied via the ‘Diversity Referral Program‘. 
He responded with tens of laughing emojis.
So I asked him, what’s wrong with my application via that program. 
He responds, “ This Program is to encourage diversity. And it is reserved specifically for Gays” 

I was so depressed after hearing that. 
I’m a straight guy, and I have an interview on this Friday. And now I have no clue about how I should behave or what I should say in front of the interviewer. 

Tl;dr: I applied for ‘Diversity Referral Recruitment Program’ of a fortune 500 company. Cleared initial 2 rounds and have interview scheduled on this Friday. And now I find out that this program is only reserved for Gay. And I’m a straight guy."

Yale, Stanford, Columbia, Upenn, Brown, Carnegie Mellon, UCLA, UCSB, NYU, Purdue, Stony Brook (SUNY) and Bentley.

Stats:

International student but a US permanent resident/greencard holder.

Asian (Indian) from Kenya.

Undergrad major: actuarial science or data science (for those of you who don't know, it's related to math/econ/computer science)

GPA: N/A (We don't use GPA)

Rank: 1

IB Diploma student (Math, Economics, ITGS at Higher level and Physics, English and Swahili at Standard level); predicted: 43/45

SAT: 1st attempt - 1440 (790M, 650R, Essay - 15/24); 2nd attempt - 1460 (790M, 670R, Essay - 16/24); 3rd attempt - 1470 (780M, 690R, Essay - 16/24); Superscore - 1480 (790M, 690R, Essay - 16/24)

Honors: Kenya Math Olympiad (semifinalist), ACA world competition (2 time national champ), National university level math competition winner, completed the ICDL (International Computer Driving Licence), and School topper for Computer science and global perspectives (IGCSE) and IB diploma topper for 1st year.

ECs: 3 UNPAID internships (2 at actuarial science firms, 1 at a hospital), Helped build a latrine for a rural secondary school, Climbed a mountain with the blind, planted trees (with the president), chess club president (1 or 2 years... not so sure), created 2 websites (one for IGCSE and one for IB), tutored young kids after school, participated in the East Africa Model UN, school's career committee website maintenance, and a Microsoft, web and graphic design specialist.

Recommendations: Pretty good.

So that's pretty much my application excluding the essays, which if you'd like to read and review them, you may PM me.

Oh, if you can, just let me know what unis, from the list above, are likely going to accept and/or reject me. BE HONEST!

We also learned how networks are working. Of course I also know how the different protocolls function. Security is also a big part in my education.

How Servers and Hardware works is an obvious part of my education. I know how the different operating systems work.   
 I work with a lot of enthusiasm and enjoyment on the all the different subjects. I can work in teams but I have no problem whatsoever working alone.

Members of the Rutgers Community:

Last summer Christopher Molloy was appointed interim chancellor of Rutgers–New Brunswick after nearly five years as Rutgers’ senior vice president for research and economic development. I am pleased to inform you today that, after consultation with the Boards and with members of the 2017 chancellor search committee, I am removing “interim” from his title and appointing Christopher Molloy as Chancellor of Rutgers University–New Brunswick.

Dr. Molloy is a strong and steady leader who brings a deep understanding of the institution to every discussion about its future. He has embraced the challenges of the chancellorship and has expressed a forward-looking vision that will, among other things, increase Rutgers–New Brunswick’s public prominence, provide a clear financial plan, and expand internships and related opportunities for students.

He has previously served with distinction as dean of the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, interim provost for biomedical and health sciences during the integration of the former UMDNJ into Rutgers, and interim chancellor of Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences. Dr. Molloy has been a part of the university community since his days as a pharmacy student here in the 1970s and holds an undergraduate and a professional degree from Rutgers.

ansb6u,4,2019-02-06,Freshman Program or Regular Internship?,beware_the_mullen,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ansb6u/freshman_program_or_regular_internship/,"Hey all!

Got an offer from Square for their SWE internship and I’m expecting Dropbox Launch. I’m scared that because launch program is for freshman, I’ll be put on a shitty frontend role or something else unimportant (not hating on frontend, just not my thing). The Square role, however, has a neat team + some cool backend work.

In terms of growth and learning, which one would be better? I know I’m kinda biased towards square given that I know the team, but if someone could pitch in on Dropbox, that would be great!

Thanks!"

The hiring manager reached out to me roughly two weeks later and asked if I was still interested and held any further questions. 

I told her that I was still very interested in the position and did not have any questions. She then followed up with offering an intern role before my full time start. I responded saying that I had an internship that was scheduled to finish in May, but I would be willing to leave prematurely if this position aligned with my course schedule. I am still in my undergrad and plan to graduate in May, so that is why this position is being mentioned.

After my response, I have yet to hear from her and it is now going on 5 days with no reply. I was recommend for the position by a friend of hers, so she trusts I am competent and even stated in the interview that ""the job is there if I want it""; still, I am becoming worried about her lateness to respond and beginning to question whether she got the email or if I misspoke in my email regarding the intern position.

Has anyone found themselves in this position or have any potential insight as to why she may be holding off on getting back with me?

I graduate in May with a B.S. in computer science and I am looking at two job offers:

* **Company A** is a traditional, entry-level, SDE for a mid-sized tech company headquartered in my hometown.  They have a few hundred employees but don't have stellar glassdoor reviews (not horrible, just enough of the same complaints to make me wonder).  The money is good.
* **Company B** is with a large tech company where I've been an intern for 2 years.  I write code in my current position, but not with the R&amp;D team.  I'm the only developer on my team and I spend most of my time automating reporting tools.  My team wants to hire me on as a project manager to engage with R&amp;D and Marketing.  They also would expect me to maintain the code base I've built in the last couple years.  The pay is the same as the first company.

I like my team at Company B, and I like the work that I do.  I think I would enjoy the new work they would be asking me to do.  I really enjoy development, I love my school projects, but I'm not sure how many years I would be able to handle coding sprint after sprint for Company A.  So I'm leaning toward company B.

I'm just worried about locking myself into a PM career track so early on.  What if I want to apply for a developer position after a couple years?  Would companies even consider me anymore, since I didn't have SDE as a job title with Company B?

Any thoughts and advice is greatly appreciated.  I talked to some friends at Company B R&amp;D and they are urging me to take it, though I think it's just because they want to work with me as the PM.  I also quickly talked to the CS Department Chair at my university and he advised against the offer from Company B because it's not technical.  Though I didn't mention to him that I would still be working on my own to automate reporting tools.

Thanks again,

Hi guys I want to get straight to the facts and important info but if I need to elaborate more on something specific  please ask as it will help you guys asses my situation even better


Ultimately I’m a junior right now in the bachelors for ME program and it has really been a rough ride, not in terms of academics but having to work while having to take a minimum of 12 credits to receive financial aid. I’ve had to work +40 hours a week since before my freshman year to be able to afford these classes and it obviously was detrimental to my academics, hence my situation now. I can’t really ask my family for help as we’re all dealing with a pretty shitty financial situation. Anyways, my gen ed courses are ones I have been flying by in but the engineering specific courses that require a little more time and practice (math/science +engineering core) were JUST good enough just to move on( 50% C’s, 40% B’s and occasional A’s)

Here is the embarrassing part: so the one course that is the absolute basis for mechanical engineering  (EGR 250: intro to thermal engineering) is the course that I struggled with the first time I took it and failed. Now, I had  sporadic test scores where I would do good on an exam (like 85+%) and then get a score like 40%. This large variation in test scores really just stems with how much time I had to devote to this course as opposed to another one.             -&gt;Basically, I failed this course 3 times which is absolutely embarrassing and I’m completely ashamed. &lt;-
[This one course has kept me from moving into the actual ME program classes, but I received conditional major standing since 250 would be the last course I needed to take before entering my actual ME courses. So, this way, I was able to take 2 ME courses (properties of materials and mechanics of materials which I got B’s in]

I petitioned to repeat the course one last time, also stating that this would be the only course I would take in winter semester just to prove that I am capable of succeeding in this program when I am not working and am capable of handling the challenges and focus that I am required to handle in the school of engineering ( stopped my engineering internship voluntarily and my retail job) 

When I received word that the Academic standing committee denied my petition (after fall 2018), they also stated that I am not allowed to further pursue engineering at Oakland. This decision was made at the end of December and I was absolutely destroyed and lost. Then I was dropped from the ME courses I would have been taking now, but can’t because of EGR 250. Now I am not taking any classes at OU or any other school because of one of two reasons: I couldn’t take anything at a community college at the time because classes were full/not worth the money or time OR it didn’t make sense taking another gen ed at OU if it didn’t count towards a degree if that makes sense. 

Fast forward to now: I got another mechanical engineering internship at the beginning of January and have been working my tail off trying to learn as much as I can. All of this is useless unless I have an actual degree. So, I applied to Wayne State mechanical engineering, got accepted for summer semester and am going to take differential equations just to prove to OU that I am capable of college level work. I may also take the engineering static’s course at Wayne. 



HERE IS MY MAIN QUESTION: 

Since the decision from the academic committee, I have been working on a re-admission application to OU.  The re-admission application wants an explanation of the circumstances under why I left OU( for a semester) and how I’ve used my time away. 
*******************************************
—&gt; Is there any chance they can consider me for re-admission? Any major things I can add to help convince them to give me one last chance?&lt;—
*******************************************
 If I didn’t care for this degree I would have switched my major after the committees decision, but EVEN after two months since the committees decision, extensive thinking on what else I can pursue, talking to advisors from other programs, talking to my parents, talking to engineering advisors, I really cannot see myself doing anything else. 

Notes:
- I am still in good standing within the program (2.8 GPA)
- I’ll admit it, coming out of high school my math skills were average and I did have to retake calc 3 at OU
-Commuting to Wayne M-F would really be a pain/ mess with my family’s work/school schedule unlike OU which is a 10 min drive from my house
-I have to submit my re-admission application to be considered for summer semester by March 1. If I decide to hold off, take the classes at Wayne over the summer, and then submit my re-admission app. to be considered for Fall 2019, then I also can prove with hard grades that I am capable of succeeding.
-I have been studying my thermodynamics textbook since December, just learning as much as I can for the course and practicing as many problems I can

SORRY FOR THE ALL CAPS BUT I NEED TO TO EMPHASIZE THIS POINT: STUDENTS THAT ARE CONVICTED OF CHEATING AT OAKLAND ARE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR PROGRAM IF ITS THEIR FIRST OFFENSE AS OPPOSED TO MYSELF WHO CANT CONTINUE BECAUSE I TRIED TO DO TOO MUCH (pay for my classes, hold internships, ACTUALLY TRY to learn as opposed to a student who just goes and cheats. This logic just doesn’t make sense and stings even more knowing that students who cheat can make it farther than me.

I really just want to finish at OU ultimately as my official degree process is 77%. If I have to finish at Wayne State, my transfer credits would put me at 36% progress towards completion of the ME degree= more time and money"

I am currently a college senior looking at applying to deferred admission programs, namely HBS 2+2, Booth Scholars, and Sloan. I took the GMAT yesterday and scored a 700 (44Q/41V). I took 4 of the official practice tests and scored between 760 and 790 on all of them, so I truly think I just had an off day, especially with the quant, and plan on getting some tutoring and retaking in the next 3 weeks to get my improved score before the application deadline.  


My question is do you think I would be better off cancelling the score if I almost 100% sure I will do better in a few weeks? Or is it better to keep it and show improvement?   


I'm including a mini profile if that affects any opinions/anyone wants to chance me:  
 

**Background**

* Work experience (all internships): Big 4 consulting (will be returning full-time), two summers of analyst positions at a Fortune 500, Software Engineer at a National Laboratory
* Extra-curriculars: Cycling Team Captain, Mentor/member in Computer Science Honors Society
* Undergrad school/major: Computer Science+Spanish with Econ minor at top 3 public school (UMich, Cal, UVA) - 3.59 GPA 
* Race/nationality: White, USA
* Sex: M

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA: network/position myself for MBB jobs
* Target schools: HBS 2+2, Booth Scholars, and Sloan. Maybe Columbia and GSB

I'm a first year CS major currently evaluating internship opportunities. I've interviewed with a number of companies for software engineering internship roles. Today I received an email regarding a position at a government lab doing work with AI/machine learning (developing a testbed to design, develop, and test algorithms). My goal is to get into ML, but an engineer at a career fair advised that it would be better for me to gain more general experience right now by working with different technologies, languages, and frameworks.

Based on glassdoor research, the government lab pays the lowest out of all of the positions I'm currently being considered for. To give you some perspective, the highest paying position is nearly 3x that of the government one. 

The way I see it, the government internship pays a lot less but really throws me into the ML world. The corporate internships pay more, but I would be doing software engineering/scripting. What should I prioritize? Should I look to build a solid SWE foundation before specializing? Or should I go ahead and throw myself into ML and sacrifice pay? 

In addition, all of the positions I'm considering are not near home, so I would have to worry about housing. 

I should mention that my uncle passed on my resume to the lab. He knew I was looking for an internship and wanted to help. Am I obligated to favor this position in anyway due to that?

anwqj8,17,2019-02-06,For anyone considering an internship placement program called Year Up,_terribad,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/anwqj8/for_anyone_considering_an_internship_placement/,"Hello everyone.

For those with no context of what this program is, it’s a yearlong workforce development program where the first 6 months participants are trained for relevant skills within their chosen track called learning &amp; development (l&amp;d) (think IT, Finance, Personal Banking) and the next 6 months interning at a corporate partner (Salesforce, Google, Blackrock, etc.). Interns are paid on a stipend basis bi-weekly and have pay deducted for any holidays, days absent, not turning in assignments on time, not adhering to core values, and generally, whenever the staff decide to be dicks and go on power trips (which is a lot of the time), commonly referred to as infractions. 

For those of you considering doing YearUp, let me tell you about it as an alumni who went through the program and got hired on a contract basis within a F500 financial services firm.

Year Up’s mission is commendable and something that anyone who has a empathetic/thoughtful heart will support. Year Up’s actions, however, lead me to believe it is a scam organization. I, along with many other alumni, disassociated ourselves from the program after completing it for being exploited, misled, and lied to for a year. I haven’t been able to find this information anywhere on the internet, and I believe this deserves to be seen by anyone considering taking time off from college to join this shitty program. Let’s begin (this is from a Year Up NY perspective):

1) During L&amp;D, you are paid $300 on a bi-weekly basis, for working from 8:30-3:30 (6 hours w/ 1 hour lunch) and early dismissals on Wednesday’s at 11:30 (3 hours) totaling up at 27 hours/week or 54 hours each pay cycle. Know how much in pay that is? $5.55 an hour. And that’s before getting pay deducted for holidays and infractions. It should be closer to $4 an hour. And you have to live like this for 6 months. Not only that, but they expect you to be a literal retard going into the program, “teaching” you things that are common sense and having half-assed instructors teach about things that either a) they don’t want to teach about or b) everyone who isn’t a retard and has some prerequisite knowledge of their track (which they should) knows. It was a waste of 6 months of my life, and I would have been better off if I’d been able to attend classes at my college instead of that joke of a program. But it doesn’t end there!

2) During Internship, you are paid $400 on a bi-weekly basis typically having to work an 8-5 or a 9-6 (8 hours of work w/ 1 hour lunch) totaling in for at least 40 hours a week or 80 hours each pay cycle, for a whopping $5 an hour. But many interns (myself included) feel like they have to go above and beyond and typically stay longer doing 8-6’s. And it’s even less $ than I’m suggesting because of mandatory holiday pay cuts and infractions. Let me put this into some perspective: I had a summer intern train me when I first came into the firm who made $25 an hour. I did literally everything he was doing, and had done even more and had more responsibility than him by the time my internship ended. But sure, go ahead and keep paying me less than 1/5th of his wage. This is very demoralizing. Especially when everyone around you in the office is able to survive on their own with the money they make, but Year Up gives you pennies in comparison. “For the experience” my ass. This is exploitation.

3) Referring back to the end of point 2, all Year Up is becoming, is a scaled organization for cheap, semi-skilled labor at slavery wages to exploit young adults to do repetitive, unfun tasks that you couldn’t force upon anyone with actual qualifications. And they market themselves as a “life-changing organization”, give me a fucking break. Sure they may be one or two outliers, where they truly get wonderful careers out of the program, but the overwhelming majority of participants get exploited for 6 months by corporations and Year Up. For those of you considering leaving college to do Year Up, you’re better off finishing your degree and getting a job that way. YU is an absolute joke of a program.

All in all, this organization is a scam. I hope anyone who considers this shitty program reads this before they join. Stay in school and work hard at it, that’ll pay off more than this scam does.

Edit: I forgot to mention that corporate partners pay $26,000 for each intern to Year Up to host them for 6 months, and Year Up receives donations from sponsors that end up paying for the rest of the student’s headcount, which is $34,000 per student. Doing the math, participants see less than half of that (way less if you count infractions). What happens to the money Year Up saves from giving out infractions? Who knows. From experience, I know the organization spends a ton of money on marketing itself to prey on other young adults and also a ton of money on catering food (literally had catered food at least once or twice a month). Is that really more important than paying your participants a livable wage? Yes? Cool.

Also wanted to mention that if you bring up any of these conditions to the staff, their go-to response is ""you should be grateful you're getting paid anything at all, we don't have to pay you!"" which is true, but would lead to your scam organization having no participants and seeing it for what it really is. But go ahead and keep masking yourself in a thin veil of ""opportunity"" and ""life-changing"" to keep tricking young adults into working for slavery wages.

anws29,1,2019-02-06,[New grad] Advice on getting my first raise,throwmeawaycoderman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/anws29/new_grad_advice_on_getting_my_first_raise/,"I have a rather unique circumstance so I'm not sure how to proceed with my first raise at my current company. I just recently graduated with a few internships and a C.S. degree from a good school. I landed my first job no problem, but I took a lower paying job over a higher paying one due to benefits, flexibility and other perks.

This job is far more laid back than the other options I had on the table at the time, and I value my free time so this was an easy choice for me. I was a little uncomfortable with the salary (60-70k a year) since it felt somewhat lower than the market rate for someone with my experience, personal projects and degree, but I accepted it anyways. I have no regrets about taking the job at this point six months in, but I am up for review soon and I want to know how I should approach getting a salary increase or if I should approach it at all.

The individual who recruited me and was my point of contact prior to my accepting of the position explained that he understood the salary was a little low, but indicated to me that if I came in and ""rocked the position"" that I could get a raise up to where I'd be more comfortable at around 75k a year by the time of my first review. With that in mind I have worked very hard to get acclimated to the new code base and excel in my position. Within the first four months I was contributing the same amount of value to each sprint as the other developers with minimal mistakes and issues. The rest of team is obviously more valuable due to their experience and knowledge of the company, but I have still contributed a lot and adjusted to new role very quickly. 

Now that review time is here I want to know what my options are here. I've never had a job like this so I don't know how raises are brought up, negotiated, etc. I also am unsure if a raise is even on the table since the recruiter is not my boss and I find it unlikely that he communicated the information about the raise to my boss before I was hired.

If there is no raise, since I have only been here for six months, I think I would understand. I just feel a little underpaid considering the value that I bring to the team. Should I broach this topic with my boss at the review or should I just let things fall where they may and evaluate my salary and position further down the road at the 1yr/2yr mark?"

I’m a bit hesitant to go to Tech’s because I’ve heard they weren’t the most helpful. Plus, I’m not a student atm because I’m doing an internship, but I still live near Tech. 

I’ve never been to a therapist, but I think I need to. We all need them and I’m finally admitting that. 

Any advice would be very appreciated! :)

anyyfx,60,2019-02-06,"Just listened to talk from a Google Photos Front-End SE, she doesn't even look at portfolios for entry level SE positions (as opposed to UI/Design positions)",babbagack,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/anyyfx/just_listened_to_talk_from_a_google_photos/,"thought this was interesting and thought I'd share.  Anu Mupparthi, a front-end software engineer at Google Photos, discussed how, frankly, she/her team looks at resumes for 30 seconds and goes from there.  When it comes to interviews for coding jobs, she doesn't even look at portfolios.  Unless it's a UI/design position then yes for sure she/they do, but she doesn't for a general entry SE position.  They want to know you can code and have some knowledge - don't have to know everything - and that you have aptitude.  And well, be a good person.  

She's pretty amazing, from what I understand/recollected from her talk: finished a CS degree as a single mother and would have her kids sleeping in the lab while she was coding during the night - if I understand right she didn't even have a laptop.  And then 6am or so, kids would get up and she'd take care of them, and then go back on to her day.   She'd have professors watch her kids while she took quizzes - would tell the professor to just give the kids a paper and pen.  Just sounds really incredible.  When asked about her motivation she said frankly, she didn't want to flip burgers and no offense to those who are.  And part of what kept her working so hard was a good support structure and professors at school.

Oh, and regarding having a CS degree, her senior VP doesn’t have an undergrad.  CS is not required.  She has worked with and for multiple people who don’t even have an undergrad, much less a CS degree.  you don’t need a CS degree to learn how to Code or be a software engineer, not necessarily.  irrc, the person who sits next to her perhaps only finished high school.  Obviously, she has a CS degree herself, but there are more ways than one is the message and reality I guess.   Pretty amazing.

Just some bits about her from an email about the talk:

&gt; Join us as we delight in her rich story where she will talk about her journey from single-parent computer newbie, to software engineer at Google Photos.

&gt;From her degree in Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego, to her internship at Amazon in Seattle, and her current role as front-end developer at Google -- Anu Mupparthi has a lot of stories to share with the tech community.

anz0en,2,2019-02-06,I'm extremely upset by the fact that I didn't get a bonus. Considering leaving after ~1.5 years.,flyingpickles21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/anz0en/im_extremely_upset_by_the_fact_that_i_didnt_get_a/,"I currently work as a commercial insurance underwriter in the suburbs of a large city in the northeast US. I started with the company as an intern between my sophomore and junior year of college and have now been full time since June 2017 when I graduated. They have a very established, robust training program for the role, so I accepted the job at the beginning of my senior year after successfully negotiating a small salary increase. Since I have a Risk Management degree, I've got a decent amount of market intel and know that my salary, benefits, PTO etc is just average relative to competitors' similar positions. However, the quick job offer and willingness to negotiate with a recent grad made me feel valued.

&amp;#x200B;

I was able to attend the home office portions of said training faster than anyone in my region at the recommendation of local management. Upon return, I was given two large brokers to handle on my own. Before me, everyone was in underwriting teams. I am the first to only be working with my boss to manage a book of business. Everything was great - still felt valued and in a good position for future success. 2018 was the first year i was bonus eligible since it was my first full year as a producing underwriter. I demolished every single one of my production metrics 2-3x over goal and well above both my region and countrywide performance. At every check in with my manager, I was commended for good performance. I asked if there was anything I could be doing better, and for additional opportunities within the company (suggested special projects, community involvement, etc) and was told to keep performing, nothing extra was available at that time yada yada. I was a little disappointed at the lack of ""extracurricular"" opportunities but didn't really think much of it as these can be hard to get as a new employee. I was also covering for someone on maternity leave for a good chunk of the year and completing a huge project with her teammate for one of their agents. The first time I was truly upset was being excluded from a dinner/discussion last month about advancing women into higher level management roles. I expressed that briefly but let it go.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonuses are absolutely standard practice in this industry, all of my coworkers who are older are definitely getting them despite some not even meeting production goals. The way my boss explained it, the bonuses are allocated by position countrywide, and I didn't make the cut (BS). There's no one else in my department that holds my position as they are all 6+ years older. But I have friends in similar positions at competitors making $5k - $15k bonuses just for meeting their goals.

&amp;#x200B;

During my compensation discussion today, I was told that in order to ""facilitate my growth"" I would be given another 15 agents and brokers from our Centralized Underwriting Facility. This is a blatant set up for failure as the only way an agency gets to the CUF in the first place is by continuously being a bad partner to the underwriter. I feel like I have already been pigeonholed into the ""not a favorite"" category for no reason, and its only now hitting me how much favoritism has impacted some of my coworkers over the years, favorably and unfavorably. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I would fit in much better at a company that values performance over tenure and favoritism. I feel extremely resentful of my company's decision making processes. But at the same time, I'm concerned that leaving so quickly will look bad in the eyes of other companies that I apply to. While my lack of filter has actually helped a lot in developing relationships externally, it's not so great for interviewing. I don't know how I would explain wanting to leave so soon, especially after interning there for two summers. It would also completely destroy my chances of rehire at this very stable company (only insurer locally that didn't lay off underwriters during the financial crisis, and almost never does layoffs at all) as they look down upon people that jump ship quickly since they invest so much into the training. 

&amp;#x200B;

Life-wise, it would be a decent time to leave as my lease is up in a few months and I would be willing to relocate since my parents are moving south and I have no responsibilities here. Career advancement is extremely important to me - every decision I've made so far was made with the intention of getting into high power job and I would like to continue on that path.

&amp;#x200B;

So, r/careeradvice, should I stay or should I go? "
anz87o,3,2019-02-06,Need advice on how to get into a good CS grad program,____okay,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/anz87o/need_advice_on_how_to_get_into_a_good_cs_grad/,"Hello all,

I am a senior applied mathematics student at a state university. I’m very interested into getting into machine learning, yet many jobs require an MS or PhD in CS. I wouldn’t mind getting into my schools masters CS program; however, I want to aim higher for maybe Top 25 universities (Cornell Tech or Yale for MS in CS if I’m lucky). I transferred from a community college with a 2.7 cumulative GPA and in my first semester in my junior year I did a decent job (3.46 specifically). I was on track and making very good leaps with my GPA until last semester. I took 4 upper division math classes + a data structures class, I worked and was pledging for a professional fraternity. Not a very good idea and as a result I had gotten an embarrassing 2.0 GPA. Long story short CS department didn’t accept my withdraw request for my data structures so that I can focus on my major, and passed all of my upper div math classes. So now my GPA is back to 2.7...

Anyways I’m planning to get my GPA back up past 3.0 by the end of this summer by retaking my data structures class and hopefully at ~3.2 GPA when I graduate. Once I’ve graduated I plan on doing some internships and doing some side projects. Then study the GREs hard to get a stellar score. My question is should I stay in school to retake my math classes which I’ve received C’s in? And also is there any hope for me still if my GPA is at 3.2. What else can I do to stand out? My only research experience was being a part of an honors interdisciplinary study program at my community college and a year-long current senior research project with one of the professors at the math department. 

Thanks Reddit!

I'm an ECE grad student ( international ) at Pitt and just received an offer for an internship position after graduation from Dolby Digital. It's for the role of a platform Dev engineer with the possibility of conversion to a full time position. The duration of the internship is of six months .

However: due to certain medical conditions ( read sciatica ) in the spring semester I was unable to perform upto standards and hence dropped below the required gpa of 3 and hence would require another semester to pull those grades up. ( AKA project or class work in summer semester ).

My question is : How do I put this forward to the company? They have already gone ahead with the formalisation of the offer and would call me tomorrow to discuss about a possible joining date.
I'm pretty sure they would rescind the offer. However before I move forward I'm trying to gather every bit of information possible. 

Thanks for reading and possibly providing some valuable inputs.

I’m a junior in highschool and I’m looking at colleges. Ideally, I’m hoping to get into investment banking target schools (Stern, Wharton, etc.) but I doubt I’m a very competitive applicant for those top-tier schools. Anyhow, am I competitive for top 20 or 50 schools? Other than the schools I already mentioned, I’m looking at UT Austin, Carnegie Mellon, and SUNY Bing for right now. 

Desired Major: 
Finance/Economics, maybe Mathematics

Hooks: 
I am autistic, and it has affected my ability to function effectively in the past. I also have parental legacy at UT Austin. 

Location: 
NYC 

My stats:

ACT: 30+ is predicted, I will probably get something around a 33 or 34. Haven’t taken it yet though. 
GPA: 3.9 UW. My school doesn’t offer any AP classes, but I’m taking the most advanced classes possible for my grade. 
Class Rank: I’m not exactly sure but I think I’m in the top 10%. 
I haven’t been able to take any subject tests or AP tests yet. Would that be too much of a detriment?

My extracurriculars (Listed in order of importance)
*Some of them are planned for senior year, but they should all be done come application time. 

Boy Scouts (9-12)
I’m a first class scout and a member of my troop for 5 years now. I have been a patrol leader for 2 years now, and I’m on track to being senior patrol leader by senior year. I’ve lead many camping trips, outings, and events. 

Martial arts (9-12)
I am a yellow belt in Hapkido and a junior black belt in karate (mediocre I know, I hope to be at least a blue by the time applications roll around though.) I’ve been training for eight years now. 

Student Council (11-12)
I’m currently a class representative. While this is not too strong of a position, I have a good chance of being elected class president when senior year begins. 

College Application Club (“Next Step Club”) (11-12)
This club has not been started yet, but I find it reasonably likely that it will pan out. If negotiations with a possible adult leader pan out, I stand a good chance of being the founder/President of this club. It’ll help people navigate the application process more smoothly. 

Newspaper Club (11-12)
I am currently in the process of launching a newspaper within my school. I am the editor-in-chief as it currently stands, but this newspaper is in its infancy. 

NHS (12)
My school only inducts seniors for NHS, but my grades/ECs leave me an extremely good chance of getting inducted when senior year comes. 

My work experience:

Small plant nursery (9)
Responsibilities included basic warehouse duties, including stocking and pricing. Just basic retail work. 

Prominent law firm (10)
Worked as an intern in the most prestigious law firm in NYC. Responsibilities included sorting mail and using specialized software to locate mail recipients. 

AMNH (11)
I currently work at the American Museum of Natural History, where I teach school groups and passerby about key concepts related to geology. 

Investment firm (12)
I hope to get an internship at an investment firm when I reach senior year. This will let me learn the ins and outs of investment banking, along with exercising my passion. 

Summer activities (9-11)

Explo at Yale
Spent three weeks per year studying at Explo at Yale, in financial and medical classes. 

Adelphi/Hospital Fellowship Program (9)
Studied at Adelphi university and at a hospital, exploring how key science concepts relate to medicine. 

That’s all I have (and hopefully will have) under my resume as of senior year. Would this be competitive for top 50 or even top 20 schools for finance? Also, Is there anything I can do to bolster my application? I know that top-tier schools are super competitive so anything I can do helps. 

Thanks for reading!

IM SO EXCITED.",meeeowt,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/anzng4/ive_been_an_software_engineering_intern_for_a/,"UPDATED — I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but whoever is learning programming don’t give up. There IS A LIGHT at the end of the tunnel. It will pay off. I’m so happy I could cry. Not sure if I’ll get the job, but I am beyond grateful that I’m even being considered. 

A year ago, I barely knew how to articulate into words my questions that I was stuck on in programming . No clue what a variable was, data structures anything honestly, I hit my head against the wall many weeks being stuck on code. I’ still have a long way to go. I stuck with it even though there were days where I question my entire career. 

I believe in you. Don’t give up. 



UPDATE: Thank you for all the love and good vibes. It really helped me be brave in my interview today. If you're stuck don't quit! I'm still learning, and will ALWAYS be learning, my bosses and mentors are also still learning after 20 years. I practiced a lot, worked side weekender gigs to maintain my life. I gave up having a car, so I wouldn't have to worry about a car payment, or insurance. I figured if I'm going to grind, I better REALLY grind. I was very lucky to have a SO that supported my dreams and understood me, and was okay on nights that I had to study and work and never got mad. 

I had days where I really read the same thing like 5 times no idea what it was, I had to go back and read a lot and rewrite code many times different way too, until it just clicked, I felt like the hugest imposter many times. I STILL feel this way. It's normal, but some days things just click, and you hang on to those times and you give yourself a pat on the back. 

I went to the interview and it was really scary, moments leading up to it I sat down and thought about how far I've come since I've started. I gave this my all and regardless of what happened at the end of the day I knew I gave it my 100%.

First off, I met with a couple people on the engineering team, and the VP of engineering, they asked me  about how I started why I decided to pursue software developing etc. Why is this my passion? Then they went into technical abilities where they asked me key words in programming; how I would approach fixing a specific problem; what steps do I take when I am stuck. They asked about my internship; what I learned from that; briefed me on new projects they are building. 
They also told me that taking me on as junior developer means that they're not expecting me to know everything, but that they wanted to know that I was willing to work hard and take constructive criticism well. They want to make sure that their investment into my salary will pay off and that I won't just run off the moment I become more valuable. 

Overall it was almost a 2 hour interview. There were lots of questions and lots of notes taken. I don't how it went on their end, but I got a lot of positive vibes from them. I'll have to update you guys in a couple days to see if I get a job offer. 

Lots of love for you guys. Continue on this path, it will pay off. Be confident, YOU GOT THIS.

ao1j6r,3,2019-02-07,Intern broke props and emailed management asking for a threesome,NurseMaisie,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/ao1j6r/intern_broke_props_and_emailed_management_asking/,"So I work in a big tourist town. So I plan on posting a lot of great stories here.

When I was in high school, I worked at a magic show! It was my second summer with the show and I was the sole box office attendant. A retired woman who worked my days off for fun.
A woman from a big music college in Chicago used to vacation to my town with her family and wanted to intern here. My boss was eager to get an intern in from this college. 
She wanted to be on stage, but she had a very awkward presence and was very klutzy, so they put her in box office with me. Our first issue was she ended up trying to train me. 
She made up rules and would tell me how my boss said these were always the rules. For example, someone asked what our dress code was, she informed them to dress like they were coming to prom. I corrected her that it’s casual, and she ignored me. A week later a couple comes in a full suit and prom dress while everyone else is wearing cheesy, tourist trap t-shirts and jeans. 
All our props started to break simultaneously. Nothing big, but doors wouldn’t collapse so the other person couldn’t hide, so we couldn’t reveal the inside of a trick anymore and the pretty decorations were falling off. I came into work for my check one day and heard something heavy fall from in the theater. I walked in to find the intern walking back from the bathroom hallway. “Oh. It’s just you,” she muttered and then stalked me till I left.
Okay. So she definitely wasn’t coming from back stage. Maybe she fell. Maybe that was the bathroom door somehow? Not sure. Well, every time I came to the theater when it was just her, there was that noise.
Maybe a week later I’m at the box office and my manager jumps down from back stage (there was a trap door a good 3 ft high into the wall you usually jumped down from that brought you into the bathroom hall). “That’s it!!” I yelled. My manager looked at me odd, but we found out the intern was sneaking back stage and getting into the props while everyone was gone, and because she wasn’t trained, breaking them.
Back to how she was always correcting me.  She ended up emailing our theater and though she was talking to the owner (manager and owner are dating). Well, obviously the manager is going to respond to the emails in most cases. That’s not what the intern thought.
The intern was emailing the theater, thought she was emailing the owner, expressing her love for him and how much she hated the manager and I. He should fire the two of us and she’d replace us. 
The stage manager emailed back that she was the one who responded to the emails and talked to her about it.
Well, that didn’t stop these emails. 
They were all very odd. But, the manager and I agreed it looked to be her sense of therapy. She was writing out all her thoughts and dreams and just venting. So the manager just let the emails came in, she read them, and would not respond. Even thought she now knew that the manager read all the emails, on her last day, after work, she emailed “the owner” how she really wanted to have a threesome with the owner and manager.

I’ve seen her occasionally working at retail stores in the summer in the area. I hope her mental health got better and she found a sense of home with someone that accepts her. 
She did try to be a nice person. But, man, I hope she isn’t sending emails to work asking to have threesomes anymore.

actually in a internship, my job is to create a DevOps environment for Angular/.Net.

since my compagny has a gitlab server, i went ahead and used gitlab CI to for the testing/building.

For the Delievery part, i simply use ssh (rsync) to transfer every files i need into my docker container for local production or the actual production server.

i have lot of questions in my mind: is jenkins better than gitlab CI ? is using ansible better to tranfers files and create a High Availbility environment? what other tool could i use to make it better ? and so on.

I've gotten an offer from UCC for their masters in data science and analytics program. I completed my bachelor's in computer applications last year and started an internship last month as an analyst but isn't very related to the field. Before this internship I was learning and doing projects at home. 

I have some questions, firstly, how hard would it be for me to get a job after the degree? I'd have loans to pay back as well so it's a pretty big commitment. The student visa lets me stay back for 2 years after graduating. After that, would companies be willing to sponsor me for a work visa? I'd need to stay there for at least 5 years because an Indian salary would not be enough to handle the loans.

If at all I don't go to Ireland for a master's and pursue one from here, what can I do to be eligible for jobs there in the future?

I've asked about this in r/Ireland and r/DeveleIre as well but I want to be extremely sure because the loan repayment and the work visa post 2 years scares me.

I really wouldn't mind brutal responses because then I can finally make up my mind. I have started preparing for entrances here for masters so I do have a backup if the Ireland plan doesn't seem like a good plan.

Options or thoughts?",Adaxes_x,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/ao381h/have_bachelors_in_geography_focusing_on_gis/,"I got my bachelors in geography/GIS 2 years ago, had a good GIS analyst internship and got a gis analyst contract that is coming to an end soon.

I want to be able to get into software dev career paths, and am thinking about going back to school for computer science. I am wondering if pairing a GIS degree with CS would be fruitful or worth it?

I know people are going to tell me there are a lot of free online resources I can use to learn programming myself, but that isn't something I will do unfortunately. 

Here are the options I am thinking of:

Cost - ~$30k - 2nd Bachelors in CS from the same school I got my first BS in (I see a lot of folks get their 2nd BS degree in CS from OSU's online program which is $30k, but that is the same price I would be paying I calculated at my same school but being able to physically attend classes which is better for me).  

Cost: - ?? Coding bootcamp I hear these are intense and much shorter than college degrees but more focused. Im not sure I want to focus my entire bootcamp on one language, I honestly feel like for me I would prefer to get the 2nd degree. 

Cost: $7k - Online masters in CS from http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/ I hear good things about this program but need to research it more.

Does anyone have any advice? Has anyone here gone from GIS to CS? Or a 2nd BS in CS after getting GIS? "

What are some ins-and-outs of the custody battle process, and what are my odds of winning?",metaphorthealright,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ao4lz4/ex_is_demonstrably_unstable_creating_shaky_and/,"Okay, so first things first: a big thanks to anyone who responds to help me out with this, and of course a disclaimer that I am being intentionally vague in some points as this is all still going on. Also, sorry about length. 

tl;dr: Ex is unstable, son is unhappy with her, I have text evidence to prove all of this. Now considering a fight for full custody of my son, what should I know/do? How much good will text evidence and the child's testimony do?

I am 26, male. I separated from my son's mother about 8-12 months ago. She had been sleeping around. The separation until very recently has been mostly amicable. Talking only about the kid (8), and only when we need to communicate to each other (school, medical issues, scheduling.) 

When the separation started she was not around for our son, who had a very hard time with it. She would see him one or two nights a week, saying ""he didn't like it at her house"" or ""she had plans with friends"", things like that. I stepped up as a father and have been very open, honest, and communicative with our son. We have come to rely on each other for support, and he is very comfortable in my home. 

When she left, she took the reliable vehicle (we had two, one was good and one was bad), her clothes, and essentially nothing else, leaving me to pack all our things and move out of our home of 5 years by myself. She is also enrolled in college where she has a paid internship, so she gets large chunks of money on a fairly reliable basis. This is all pertinent because, while I do work, the moving process essentially bankrupted me, and I have found myself on HUD and food stamps to make ends meet. The old vehicle died around the same time that I was moving, and with money being short I have had a hard time finding a reliable vehicle. During all of this, I let the divorce paperwork lapse as I had more important things to handle, and now have to reopen the case. 

About 6 weeks after I told her that I would be filing for a divorce, she moved into a new house with a man who was 10-15 years older than her, who was unemployed. The living arrangement we had come to at this point was that our son would spend two weeks at a time in each house, with a weekend trip to the other on the first Saturday of that period. He was understandably uncomfortable living in a new house, with a stranger essentially, and his relationship with his mother has not recovered from it, even though not surprisingly, that relationship failed and the man has since moved out. I have text evidence of me offering to help her make my son feel more at home at her house, and saying ""I have no interest in seeing our boy drift away from his mother.""

For the sake of amicability, I decided this week that it would be a good time to tell her that I was planning on moving away from my home town. The idea was that we would have ample time to work out a situation that made everyone happy, and to do it in the least ugly way possible. I stressed that my biggest concern was civility, and that I did not intend to go the route of a custody battle. I wanted to work out a solution between us that would work for everyone. She made it very clear that there would be no discussion, and if I was to move away she would ""fight like it was a war"" to take my parental rights away. In the texts, she explodes, hurls insults and threats and ""f\*\*\* you's."" She also says that my sons stability is not her highest concern, she is more worried about him ""losing a parent,"" which only she was talking about. She also says ""let's be honest here, you are his comfort"" and ""don't hurt him more than I already have."" In the course of the barrage I stayed very cool and calm, and did my best to calm her down. I did not respond with any negativity, and only tried to convey the point that this didn't need to get ugly. 

Then, yesterday, something completely different in the texts. My son had a doctors appointment out of town which we both wanted to attend, so we ended up spending the majority of the day together. It was good, we got along. During the day she mentioned that her parents think she's on drugs (don't ask me why she mentioned that, by all accounts it doesn't make sense.) At the end of the day though, she was dropping him off with me due to a scheduling conflict on her part, and all hell broke loose. As she walked my son up to my door, he screamed at her something along the lines of ""I'm done with you, I don't want to be around you anymore."" There was a big emotional breakdown, after which she tore off like a bat out of hell. 

My son cried and vented, saying he never wanted to see her again, etc. When I checked my phone I saw that she had texted ""I'm a shitty parent and I can't win. I don't know why I'm fighting this so hard. Just take him with you."" She said ""Just take him"" multiple times. Again, I was calm and collected. I said ""You don't mean that, you're just upset."" I have had a demonstrably calmer and more rational head about me during our interactions.

My plans to leave have not changed, other than the fact that now I know I need to take my son with me. She is mentally and realistically unstable, with her mind state and living situation constantly in flux. If asked I am certain that my son would say he would rather be with me, and I can demonstrate that being with me is the healthier thing for him. I have backups and screenshots of all text conversations we've had. However, my money and vehicle situations are not in as good a state as hers, and I live in a state that tends to favor mothers in custody cases.

With all this being said, what are my odds of winning a case? What should I do, beyond the obvious ""lawyer up?"" Also, how do I find a lawyer when I'm on such a strict budget? How much good will my text evidence and my sons testimony do? Is the best move to go for full custody, or is it better just to fight to make sure I don't lose my parental rights? What are some of the risks involved with this process? Is she actually capable of taking my parental rights away because I want to move a few hours away? 

I give a sincere thanks to anyone who made it through that wall of text and who has any helpful information for me. I just wanted to gain a clearer image of what it is I am about to go through.

Edit: I live in NM, USA. As per location bots request."

They both seem very nice, but I would prefer an internship at Company B. But I may not receive the offer until next week, past the acceptance deadline from company A.

Hello all,

Just wanted to ask the community: how would you *manually*  root a device? The reason I ask is I am looking to intern for a big N  company and their push at the moment is android-based devices in the  industrial world. My task specifically is based around the security of  these devices. They extended me an offer to ""attack"" what they currently  have and what they are planning on implementing. That being said, how  would you go about this?

I  do not have details on whether a direct adb connection can be used. I  did mention to them that I have created malicious apps before (never  handed out, only for learning) and they said they have signature  verification so unknown apps could not be installed. Their focus is the  integrity of the wireless communication. There will be a range of  android versions used.

The  challenge is as open and vague as that. Essentially attack these any  way possible but their biggest concern is wireless. How would you guys  go about this?"

I'm 27 and I'm struggling to get a career going. I've been looking into getting a CCENT which is entry level networking via Cisco because a government agency for the disabled said they could help get me an internship afterwards as long as I passed an entrance exam into CCENT training ran by a different government agency. I passed but was stonewalled by ANOTHER agency that funds the program (basically my disability career counselor)

 So now I have to do this without the help of a training program specifically made for people with various disabilities. This means I need to figure out training through programs for neurotypical  people. But I'm realizing that although I could handle the material, the fact remains that my memory is essentially non-existent. The exam would of course require usage of memory in one way or another. 

My family and career counselor have told me I won't be able to do it and that just makes me want it more. They're right but only if I'm forced to study the way everyone else does. I can't really organize myself to self study and Cisco only offers training for a few days. I don't even really care that much about networking but this agency wants to help get  a career started for me and so I'm kind of stuck in this place where I know I could handle the material but at the same time I can't because of constraints made by the neurotypical approach that I'm forced to remain within. My career counselor (from a government ran disability agency) basically wants me to settle with simple data entry jobs but I find that horribly boring and also depressing because I know I can handle something more but I just can't seem to get the right approach.

I know I need to prioritize stuff but it’s just hard when you need a good gpa ... so my question is how can i really improve my skills  with coding, should I start the CS50 course during summer for example... i feel so bad with coding ,making me even feel ashamed to get an internship....

I met with a counselor who said I would need to finish my degree as soon as possible. That means four classes/quarter until Fall/Winter of next year, including Summer sessions. The reason being, the committee dealing with ECP appeals would not approve a more reasonable course load per quarter. The caveat of this being that I have a good reason for being so behind, which I would write in my ECP appeal letter.  

I spoke to another counselor about a year ago about extending my stay to squeeze in internships before I graduate. They told me this was viable, but I would need to appeal. At the time it seemed like something I could do easily, stress-free. But now, after meeting with a counselor recently, it sounds like only under extraordinary circumstances do these appeals for extending ones stay more than they need to get approved. 

I plan on writing in my appeal the other reasons for my slow progress, including mental health and family related issues. Im worried that if I try to appeal for a 3 classes per quarter rate of progress, it'll get denied, and I'd have to reappeal and possibly be unable to clear my ECP hold in time for enrollment in Spring quarter.

Does anybody have experience with ECP appeals? I would love to hear about your experience and any advice you may offer.

I’m roughly 3.5 years through my mechatronic engineering/physics degree and have spent the vast majority of this time working 2-3 days a week for an engineering/technical consultancy company. My university has 2 compulsory 6 month internships that I have been able to get an exemption from seeing as I’ve covered more than enough hours of relevant and recent workplace experience. 

However, I know many students seek out shorter stints with internships in various fields to bolster their resumes for when the time comes to find a job.

My question is, is it more attractive to an employer to have one long engineering workplace experience (5 years or so) or several short experiences at different places (like the two 6 month internships or other shorter ones during the gaps between semesters). 

I should also note that the work I do is varied (structural analysis and design, programming, business process automation etc), so I’m not just stuck with experience in only one very specific thing.

I also find myself being much more drawn to the abstract details of CS like creating languages and how kernels work if that gives any insight into me.

I also currently work as a Quality Assurance Specialist (intern) at a software development company.

I’m not sure exactly what I’m asking for, but has anyone had this experience? And what were the steps you took to overcome the feeling of facing such a huge industry with somewhat little experience.

Internship A is at my top company. I’d love to get my foot in the door there to try and turn the internship into a full time opportunity.

So I’d still be able to get the position I’m looking for. However, key word if.

Internships B/C are more along the lines of what I want to do, but are both at companies I don’t particularly care for. They aren’t horrible, though, but I wouldn’t want to work there after graduation. 

Internship A pays a lot more, but that’s not really my biggest concern, but is a factor. I love the company and want to work there after graduation, but if they don’t offer me a full time position..then I’m stuck with awkward experience that’s half related and half unrelated.

I graduated college in May 2018. I majored in an engineering discipline with a GPA of 3.0 (3.1 major) from a good school and didn't have any internships, but did have a great senior project.

A couple of months later I got a contract position at an R&amp;D/S&amp;T center. My title is engineer, but my job has to do with data science and programming. I don't think I can make further progress on the project I was hired to work on and I think an entire team is needed. So, I would like to start searching for jobs again.

My concerns are that
* I have been at my current job for only 7 months. However, it *is* a contract position, and my pay is not that great.
* I probably cannot use my current boss as a reference if I want to start a job search. But, I could ask a professor and volunteering supervisor.

Is it a good idea to restart my job search, considering these two points? I would appreciate any advice. Thanks!"

I am a (second?) year comp-sci/engineering student who transferred in after completing my pre-requisite classes—or at least that's what I thought. I had taken college physics I &amp; II instead of the required, calculus based university physics I &amp; II. (was premed/biology for my freshman year so I'm somewhat behind schedule). 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm retaking physics I this semester (otherwise would have started EECS 300s). Additional classes include differential equations, calc III, data structures &amp; algorithms.  

&amp;#x200B;

I am only just now starting to get involved with engineering-related clubs. 

I have yet to take actual engineering courses. Right now I am more of a comp sci major than engineering. Marketable courses include: 

Object oriented programming (Java) 

Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (this semester) 

CSS/HTML/entry-level Java Script web-development course

&amp;#x200B;

I have no projects to put on my resume aside from one (AI-driven, Lego sorting conveyor machine) that is still in the infancy of its development. 

&amp;#x200B;

My GPA is pretty meh at 3.1 

I consider myself to be pretty meh at Java. I don't code for fun or anything;  just competent when it comes to completing class assignments.

I know a little bit of Python (enough to get by) and am currently trying to learn C. 

I'm also proficient with CSS/HTML but web-development is not what I'm aiming for.  

&amp;#x200B;

Pros: 

I have work experience in the medical field 

I tend to do okay with professionalism (did mock trial so interview/speaking skills aren't bad)

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons why I don't want to go to the fair in a few weeks: 

\- I'm a bit of a perfectionist and feel as though my lackluster track-record in addition to me still having not taken EECS classes will make me look bad/uninteresting to employers (I have that ""all or nothing"" approach to applying). I don't want them to remember me the second time I apply for an internship as mediocre.  

\- As dumb as this may sound, I need a new suit but am strapped for cash atm. The best I can do is black dress pants, white shirt and tie. I have a non-tailored blazer, but it is ill-fitting IMO. 

&amp;#x200B;

Otherwise, I already have my summer classes scheduled so I can play catch-up with the rest of my class.

I'm having a hard time choosing between a SWE internship offer (networking team) from Cisco in their San Jose office and a SEC Strats summer analyst offer (Equities desk strat team) from Goldman Sachs in their NYC office. Cisco's comp is roughly $70K/year with a $6K housing stipend, and GS $100K/year with a $1.5K housing stipend, but I've heard that GS interns also work a lot more (on average 60 hrs/week??), so the hourly wages are probably pretty similar. I'm not swinging one way or another; I have my reservations about both:

For Cisco, my primary concern is that I might not be working with the newest technologies and that the work overall would not be super relevant in the future. One of the things I want to get out of this summer internship is acquiring more marketable skills, as currently I only know as much as my school has taught me (and a bit that I've taught myself). Furthermore, I've heard some worrisome things about their management; in particular, my friends have told me that they weren't assigned clear projects and were offered little guidance in the duration of the internship.

As for GS, would taking a Strats position pigeonhole future career opportunities? I'm graduating within the next two semesters, and I don't want to be stuck in finance in the chance that I don't enjoy the work over the summer. Furthermore, can anyone attest to the work-life balance of an intern at a financial firm (especially Goldman Sachs)? While I have nothing against hard work, I would prefer to have some free time as I'd never really been to New York--but a 60 hour work week essentially leaves no time for anything outside of work.

If anyone could offer any experience or advice, I'd be forever grateful.

UPDATE: Went with Goldman!"

Looking to apply to the early admit programs in a few years. 

Target 2+2 programs: HBS, Stanford GSB, Chicago Booth, MIT Sloan, Yale Silver Scholars

About me:

- Computer Science Major

- Filipino-American male, grew up in the Philippines but born in the US

- Small California State University with a 3.5 GPA

- Internship at Fortune 500 in high school and interning for another Fortune 500 this Summer

- Founded a Hackathon at my school, and working towards getting it as a Major League Hacking Event

- Fluent in English, Tagalog and Spanish and currently learning Hebrew and High Valyrian

- Working with local leaders to start non-profit focused on revitalizing use of Dead languages such as Navajo and Hawaiian 


I know that the early admission programs are extremely competitive and admissions stats aren’t easily accessible except for Harvard 2+2, but I’m still wanting to shoot my shot.

I know that the reputation of my undergrad institution will not give me a boost in the prestige department so I’m looking to maximize the other parts of my application.

Plan so far:

- Go through Manhattan Prep guides to work on GMAT
- Intern for a upper-echelon Tech firm within the next 1.5-2 years (FAANG, Palantir, LinkedIn, Microsoft, etc)
- Get my GPA up to atleast 3.7 before applying
- Keep building Hackathon and dead language non-profit 
- Study Mandarin as sole language after getting somewhat decent at Hebrew and High Valyrian (about a year from now)
- Go to networking events put on by the above schools
- Take some MBA / business classes (HBX Core/ MIT Sloan edX courses)
- Attend some undergrad pre-MBA programs (ex. Peak Weekend / SVMP for HBS, Summer Session for Chicago Booth)
- Think about what story I can craft for my essays

The above is what I’ve put together after lurking the sub and P&amp;Q.

Wondering what else I can do within the next few years to give me a leg up in admissions and wanted some of the advice from this subreddit.

Thanks and cheers!"

For me, it was the same feeling like asking kids these days if they wanted to go to Disney Land. USA seemed that way to me when you're from a developing country.

&amp;#x200B;

There were many times I just wanted to drop out because of a lot of unfairness in the education system. I was always a slow learner and being a mandatory full-time student in Engineering didn't play out quite well in the beginning. Tuition fees: 4x the amount of US nationals and I wasn't allowed to drop a class (else I wouldn't be in full-time status and my ass would get deported in 3 weeks, lol), so yea, definitely got some F's, and there went my GPA. With that went any internship opportunity, although still being optimistic, I continued on.

&amp;#x200B;

Graduated first week of May, 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering with a cumulative GPA of 2.76, two months prior to that day, I was told by my graduate adviser that I couldn't get into the Masters Program because I wasn't a US Citizen. So the US Government gives all international students with the opportunity for working for a year after graduation (also known as OPT, a $410 application) as long as the work is in my **field of major**.

&amp;#x200B;

9 months, 600+ job applications and two dozen interviews later, no job, not even a Bestbuy store associate job (that doesn't require a Bachelors, lol). The amount of times that I've heard during an interview that I have all the qualifications and what not, but I'm not a US Citizen, so I'm automatically disqualified. Either that or my first name (which I don't even go by) ""Muhammad"" is just too famous for anyone's blood.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing what I do now, should've I come to this country several years ago? The logical answer would be a simple 'no'. But I can't turn back time and I've met some pretty cool people along the way, along with professors, traveled to some beautiful places, bought an incredible car from Japan through Bitcoin, seen tons of movies (latest being: Battle Angel Alita), dated one crazy girl.

&amp;#x200B;

I may have a month or two before my time is up, and I'll take all the experiences and memories with me, and I'm not coming back because I never was a US Citizen, nor would I ever want to be one.

Things in University I learned and worked with so far:

* Java (decent knowledge)
* OpenGL (java)
* indepth lectures about computergraphics
* OpenCV (java)
* indepth lectures about imageprocessing
* indepth math lectures (numerical mathematics, curves, etc.)
* UX
* HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP
* CAD (Maya, Alias, Solidworks)
* Adobe Illustrator / Photoshop / Indesign

Im highly interested in computergrahics and generell 3D software development and want to specialize in it later and therefore get an internship in that field.

Regarding my Situation I have a few questions right now:

* Since I've been learning so many different things right now which resulted in less time focusing on actual programming: Am I even qualified for an internship in that field?
* Are there even companies needing someone who combines knowledge about computergraphics and design?
* What would be some specific company-types I could be searching for?
* Would you advise me to search for something else instead?
* General advice for internships in Software-development?

I hope you can answer me at least some of my questions since, right now, I am actually a bit overwhelmed and I don't know what to expect and look out for."

* 7.5% 401K
* 3K stock program
* Iffy: 0-6K bonus

Startup - Los Angeles

They're Pre-IPO or whatever. The founders shoesring budgeted it. Blew the fuck up. Hundreds of million in revenue. \~100M funding round recently. Engineering team is exploding. E-commerce, not a software company.

Website runs off wordpress right now, so my time spent there was PHP. They're doing stuff in Java Microservices or whatever, so I was given the chance to switch teams. There's some great engineers with great history there. One of them dev'd for Bittorrent for example. There's definitely a weird offshore contractor thing going on where a lot of these contractors built everything, so knowledge is offshore. YMMV though - Java stuff is new so not that problem.

Additionally, I got along great with everyone and a few higher ups really liked me.

* 90K Base
* X thousand ""shares"" - Should get more info on this later like what % of company or whatever, but given they're Pre-IPO I assume this is worthless..?
* Unlimited PTO + 2 weeks off at winter office is closed for
* Liberal WFH policy/Great WLB. Tons of people seemed to show up at 10:30 and leave at 5.
* $50/week lunch budget you can expense plus all the startup-y snacks and shit you can dream of
* That's basically it. Their 401K match is supposed to start this year. Don't know %. That 90K is **super negotiable** though. They'd be willing to bump it up/commitment bonus to help relocate or whatever. I talked to an internal recruiter and she was basically saying this is their first offer. I'm sure with the C1 offer to compete I could get a bit more, but...

I'm not even sure what the right move here is. I've dev'd at a ton of startups as an intern and it always seemed like a real mentor wasn't a real thing. Will I find that at C1? Will I learn ""best practices?""

I'm being given the chance to join a rapidly growing startup in LA where there's a good startup tech scene. The engineers are totally valued, but it is still e-commerce and its a WP shop initially. There's obviously plans to get off WP, but that's gunna take fucking forever. Years? I don't think I'd be doing PHP 100%, as I know I could try to get into one of those Java Microservices teams, but yeah. That's a fear of mine.

Even as an intern (in php which this subreddit makes me feel like is the devil) I got to do big impact work. Does that exist at Capital One? Am I going to get stuck doing bullshit and regretting it and my career will suffer? Is the code quality and my learning going to be better/worse at C1?

To sum this up, my heart is in DC. I'm from LA and I want to leave home. I want to grow up, get out, explore a new city, go to yoga classes, take the metro to work, etc.

Am I throwing something away? Will my career dead-end in DC? Are there tech companies out there? Is it easy to come back to LA if I want to in a few years? Is there anything I'm not considering?

&amp;#x200B;

I realize I'm asking a lot of questions, but this is a huge life decision. Serious thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR:**

LA Startup vs Capital One in DC - What's the better career move? "

So I’m currently a computer science student in the U.S. I recently switched this semester and I’m loving it. I’m taking Python, Java, a technical writing class, calculus 1, and a class about how tech has affected society. Taking two languages at once is killing me though. I won’t have to do that again with the rest of my classes as I can spread out languages, there was just no other way to go full time without taking two languages. 



I was a pre-med nursing major, then pre-med bio, then back to regular nursing and now computer science. I wanted to be a surgeon but not go to school for another decade... so I dropped to nurse and decided I honestly didn’t care enough for people to be a good nurse. I’ve always been interested in computers and with a little push from some friends and the head of the CS dept, I switched. 



Anyway, so I have all my gen-ed’s done. I just basically have a couple math classes and then all CS core classes left. I’ve shoved everything into two years with the new banded tuition rates so I can at least get a few free credits every semester. 



The problem is, I won’t have time to do any internships before I graduate. I also am looking into doing a business and/or math minor. I am very interested in starting my own business myself or with a friend. My friend doesn’t have a business major or anything of the like and he’s graduated already so I would have to do that...



I also kinda wanna take a chill pill with classes. I’m always studying and it’s really stressful. I just wanna take a few classes a semester and do well in those and really master the concepts but I also want to get out of college and start building my life and making money. I’ve found the person I want and I don’t want to be forced to wait when it comes to things of a romantic sense because of schooling. I’m really trying to be patient but I’ve already been in school for two years and now it’s another two guaranteed and I just am tired of it. 



Long story short, I don’t know what to do. My future depends on what I do with schooling. I could really use advice from those who didn’t do internships, those who have a math or business degree, those who took a little longer in college, and those who sped it up. 



Thanks in advance!!!"

So I’m currently conditionally admitted to a masters program, and as long as I pass my prerequisite classes I’ll be allowed to continue with the program.  I’m currently in a graduate level CS 101 (Java) type class, and my Bachelors is in Mechanical Engineering.  I’ve been a Mechanical Engineer for approximately 1.5 years.

Next week there is a career fair at my college with a lot of companies looking for CS majors for internships and full time roles.  If I go, what type of role, if any, should I expect to be considered for? I currently work full time making ~70k in Chicago so a part time or low paying internship would be quite the lifestyle change for me.  I’m just wondering if it’s too soon, or I’m too inexperienced to attempt to make the switch to software engineering.

I was fortunate to receive a lyft internship for the upcoming summer, but I am unsure which location (SF/NY/Seattle) I prefer.

It seems that my location choice would define the set of project opportunities I have. I'm mainly torn between SF and NY.

SF: 
- more diversity of projects, main office
- nicer weather

NY:
- within bus distance of my home/family (big)
- more cultural events/opportunities?

If anyone has any info on what goes on at the lyft satellite offices, that would be amazing. I just don't want to pigeonhole myself to a less important project by choosing NY.

I chose this position for a few reasons: It's not a bad commute, it's a really good salary for entry level in Ohio (55k), and the people around me seem nice and helpful. However, I've been getting an uneasy feeling. 

My boss and the guy I work under don't micromanage. They leave it up to you to get done what needs done and meet your KPI's. That part is fine, but in my role, there just doesn't seem like there is enough to do. Sure there are things that you have to manage daily, but it also relies on responses from suppliers and kind of depends on them. Other daily things just depend on if these discrepancies come in. Some take 5 minutes, some take longer due to waiting on responses from other parties. Basically, from my experience so far, it could all be done in a morning at most. 

Of course there are things that come up that need to be handled, but I haven't experienced any that take a ton of time. This is kind of disappointing because I was told by the guy I was replacing and others in the position that you just can't get everything done in a day. Truth is, I've been stretching my work out daily to last. This won't fly for long, since I won't be new forever, but I don't want to sit there and do nothing, I don't want to have to be pretend busy. 

There are things I could do to improve my KPI's, but I can't think of anything to help fill my 40 hour work week. Some other people in my position don't even work 40 hours, they work until 4:30 when coming in at 8am. 

How can I approach this? I am leaving on business today, and I get back in the office next Friday. I don't want to come back and be anxious about this.

---


I just joined an internship, haven't started developing yet because they have me learning frameworks for the first few weeks, at the moment learning react. What I noticed is that there's a lot of knowledge around frameworks, it will be knowledge that seems useful only while using the framework but it's a lot of knowledge and some of it is kind of abstract, like good programming patterns. I worry about two scenarios, first one is that on the job I could become someone that can finish their work but does so poorly, and while the boss won't care because it will work, I might be hindering myself by not being aware that there's better ways to program, and if this continues indefinitely then I might code like a junior forever even though I can get things done. The second scenario that worries me is domain knowledge, there seems to be \*so much\* knowledge that's very specific to every tool and that is ever changing, I feel like I have to invest significant time to say I know React, but how do I know if what I'm learning is worth it? What if no one uses react in the next 3 years and yet I had become an expert at it during that time? now I'm just as good as a junior that doesn't know any specific technologies!

aok4aj,174,2019-02-08,Nothing Good Comes Easy: A Case Study,echu_ollathir,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/aok4aj/nothing_good_comes_easy_a_case_study/,"Matt Damon is known to tell people who ask him advice about acting that they should quit. The reason being, if you’re going to succeed in that business you’re going to be told “no” many more times than anyone will tell you “yes”. You might find more encouragement  in trying to start a company, but you’re still going to face a lot of rejection, bad news, and unexpected downturns that you’ll need to overcome if you’re going to succeed. 

I wanted to give a case study based on my experiences, as a real example is always better than a hypothetical. My company makes a gummy bear, based on clinical science, that helps boost your body’s response to alcohol. The idea was born not, as you might guess, because I was a drinker who got hungover a lot. Instead it came about from a major illness, which was initially blamed (as it turns out, erroneously) on alcohol. I wasn’t much of a drinker so I started researching how alcohol interacts with your body, and found a number of fascinating recent studies about how that damage (not just long term, but even hangovers) could be prevented with a number of naturally occurring compounds.

**Enter rejection #1:** I asked my doctors about the studies I was reading, and basically got blank stares in response. When I reached out to the authors of those studies, most of them ignored me. If I was going to go from reading clinical studies to some kind of product or business, I was going to have to do it on my own.

Instead of just dropping the idea, I decided to double down instead and do some testing of my own. After I got healthy I started a MBA program, so I had a large pool of people who went out regularly. Many of the compounds I’d read about were fairly common supplements, so I started buying them and asked people to try them before they went out.

**Enter rejection #2:** As it turns out, convincing people to take strange pills before they go out drinking is a challenge, even when you know them personally. Even though a lot of people were sketched out and wouldn’t try them, I found that the international crowd in my program was much more willing to try what I was offering.

With trial and error, I was able to develop a formula that seemed really effective. Problem was, even with people vouching for it, the fact it was pills still scared off people. So I took that rejection, and turned it into inspiration: if people don’t want pills, maybe they’ll try something in a different format? So I started mixing my formula into liquid and having people try that. 

**Enter rejection #3:** While people were more willing to try a shot, it smelled and tasted positively horrifying. I got samples from flavor houses, talked to food scientists, tried a dozen different ways to get the taste down...nothing worked. Then things got worse.

**Enter rejection #4:** My MBA program offered a variety of programs and services for startups that students were working on, and I applied for almost all of them. Funding? Applied for. Summer accelerator? Applied for. Pretty much across the board, I got turned down. I had one advocate in my corner, who led part of the school’s accelerator, and she confided that the “powers that be” had basically vetoed supporting my business because of its ties to alcohol.

At this point, it would’ve been really easy to throw in the towel. Costs were building up from buying all the testing materials, and without any funding or support, it was either give up and get an internship, or debt finance the company...and put post-MBA job prospects in peril if the company didn’t work. Still, I knew my formula worked, and I knew people would want what I was making if I could make it in a form that wasn’t completely horrifying. So, I kept at it.

As I entered the second year of my MBA, I gave up for the first time. No matter how many varieties I tried, no drink worked. But rather than give up entirely, I started experimenting with other ways I could make it.

**Enter lucky break #1:** Another supporter of mine at my school was able to get me a free ticket to a conference at which a number of pharma and supplement companies would be present. While I was there, I saw how a number of them were marketing gummy vitamins and other gummy products. And that sparked an idea.

When I got home, I bought some jello, some gelatin, and tossed my formula into the mix. Just like that, I went from god awful smelling and tasting drinks, to a gummy that actually tasted pretty decent! And the difference was night and day compared to the pills and drinks I had before. Whereas previously I’d had to convince people to try my formula, everyone loved the gummies. At this point I knew I definitely had something, but I also realized I couldn’t make a scalable company mixing my formula into jello in my kitchen, so I started looking into what it would take to do it at scale.

**Enter rejection #5:** To sell a supplement, not only would it have to be made by a FDA registered manufacturer, but those manufacturers required massive minimum orders. Hundreds of thousands if not millions of gummies. I had already been financing the company through credit card debt for the better part of a year, but it would take multiple times what I’d already put in just to order the minimum. Still, it only cost a couple of thousand to run a small R&amp;D trial to prove the concept, so once again I bit the bullet and kept digging.

R&amp;D proved successful, and were were able to make a gummy bear that the manufacturer could mass produce. At this point, my MBA program was just about over, but I had a product that people were really liking, and a pathway to bringing it to market. I just needed the funds to do it.

**Enter rejection #6:** Ultimately, I decided to run a crowdfunding campaign. I spent the better of two months preparing, but still was trying to get the campaign ready for graduation. It was a disaster. The entire thing was rushed beyond belief, I had virtually no gummies to show, I hadn’t even finished the basic packaging design so I had no demos to show, and while I had a group of backers from my MBA program, it was entirely too self contained and overlapping an audience to work. So, for the second time I quit, and cancelled the campaign when it became apparent it wasn’t going to work.

At this point, I was totally stuck. I didn’t have the funds to bring my product to market, nor could I legally make it myself in order to start slow and build up an customer base. So I started doing more fundraising. I’d met a few angels and VCs in the course of business school, and I met with as many as I could. I sat in on pitches, and gave pitches of my own. But, things were going slowly.

**Enter lucky break #2:** while my crowdfunding campaign hadn’t worked out, it had received some positive attention from my friends and family network. Even after I cancelled it, a number expressed interest in the idea and the company, and I was ultimately able to raise an initial seed round that would allow me to make deposits on a first batch of gummies. But I still needed to raise more if I really wanted to be able to launch.

**Enter rejection #7:** I spent most of the summer and early fall fundraising. It was a slog. Lots of conversations that went nowhere, and lots of “keep us updated”. I had some backing, but not enough if I wanted to aim for the kind of growth I was aiming for. I had bootstrapped a company with minimal funds once before so I knew exactly how much of a tooth and nail battle that was, and it was one I really wanted to avoid if I could. But I might not have a choice.

**Enter lucky break #3:** One of the biggest parts of raising funds is networking. You never know who can make the right introduction, and in my case, that introduction came from an entirely unexpected source. Throughout my time working on the gummies, I’d had a number of CPG professionals inquire and basically pitch their services in launching the company; my background was in tech, so working with someone with more industry experience was something I had interest in. One firm in particular seemed like a good match, but it was definitely going to require me to raise more funds. As it turned out, that firm had its own VC network, and so an introduction was made. Less than a month later, I had a term sheet. Of course, things are never quite that easy. It took another two months and lots of back and forth with attorneys to go from offer sheet to signed deal.

Of course, even now the journey is far from over. We have a great product, strong team, and high quality support, but curveballs still come from unexpected places, and there’s still plenty of ups and downs. But we’ll keep figuring out how to make things work, because if you’ve read this whole post, you know there are a lot of times I could’ve easily quit, but instead steady work (and a little good fortune) has conquered those obstacles. Problems of all shapes and sizes will come up. But building a quality product and a quality company means enduring through those problems.

**TL; DR:** Starting a company requires facing a lot of challenges that can seem insurmountable, but with perseverance and creativity they can be overcome. Nothing good comes easy."

I have recently got an offer for a software development internship that I am going to accept. The job is a little bit of front end and mostly back end, I'm very excited to finally get experience in industry. However, I am also somewhat nervous. I have taken a few first year computer science courses, and have done some basic side projects on my own, but I have absolutely no idea what to expect and worry there may be some things they expect me to know which I don't. For one particular example, I've never really worked with any libraries before, and I don't know if its typical of interns to know about some of the big libraries. Does anyone have any general advice on what I could do to feel more prepared, or have insight you learned through a similar first internship? Thanks!"

I have 4 years experience of retail and just quit my last job which was in retail.

Haven't really learned much either than the basic stuff people do and how I am supposed to sell myself with this experience to for example a bank consultant?

About to finish my bachelor and later do a masters but honestly my grade's are very average. Its a average D. Haven't done any internships or searched because I was too lazy and comfortable. Honestly I want to make it big in life and have thought a lot these days that I must stop being so damn lazy. Reason for my poor grade's? I procrastinate every test and exam and start studying when there is like one month left till exam.

But honestly..enough of being a lazy crap. I want to do better, good job and good cash. Next year will be a year where I will take up subjects and improve my grade's.

I want advice on how I should use my time in order to make it bigger later. I have 2 friend's and they work in a bank in which they work as and they asked me if they should recommend me to a job there. I said yes but honestly very afraid and nervous at the thought of a completely new environment and going through my second interview of my whole life. basically none experience in interviewing.

Any advice on what I should regarding my school and job so that it will help me later in the future for big positions?"

I'm making twice my father's annual salary over the course of my current internship (very low income family), which makes me feel really depressed for some reason.

The courses that I have completed that are related to my major are the first and second semester circuit analysis, logic design, and c++ programming. Next quarter as of now I plan on taking embedded systems and software construction. I feel slightly insecure about the process of showing up to the interview finding that my knowledge does not meet the expectations of the company, or that I would lack contribution during the internship.

So what exactly do employers expect from an intern and what skillsets outside of just courses are required? (Excel, pspice, Matlab, CAD, etc etc etc)

I emailed professors to ask research assistant position, but almost none of them replied me back, and some of them said that they don't have a plan to work with me.

I applied SURE program, and even though the decision has not officially come out yet, the graduate students at labs that I have applied sent me rejection letter.

I don't know what I am doing that wrong. I edited my resume several times after talking to career center, have done some web-development and Unity game-development projects on my resume.

More frustrating thing is that I am not even getting part-time web-developer position on campus. Rejection letter again...

It is annoying that I am not getting even screening interview for internship, and getting all rejection from research assistant positions on campus. What should I do?

aom06t,2,2019-02-08,Awkward position,zp30,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aom06t/awkward_position/,"Hi, 

So I'm in a bit of an awkward position right now. For some background (buckle in), I'm currently a third year and about to graduate this June. I accepted a job offer at a small data analytics company in November, working in one of their new divisions as a SWE. I specifically chose the company because of how much I enjoyed the interview process, the team and the work I'd be doing over some higher offers I had, though this company does have a generous offer (disproportionate to its size).  I'm excited to work there and I've been to various events they held and went out for lunch with my future team and really enjoy the atmosphere and work there.

&amp;#x200B;

However, over the course of the past few months, I've had some companies continue their process with me, months after I'd sent in my application (looking at you Amazon...) and I've mostly just emailed back saying that I'd like to withdraw. However, I did get invited to interview at a one of the big investment firms (think GS/JPM/etc...) down in London and I decided to take it so I'd get a free trip to London and meet some friends and suffer through the 1.5 hour interview. I showed up to the interview in pretty scruffy clothes and didn't really care about the outcome. Pretty sure I got rejected, but I didn't mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Surprisingly enough, the very next day I get a call saying that they'd be extending me an offer. The offer the recruiter communicated was actually just a little lower than the current one (in base salary, but higher in terms of base + bonus). I half-heartedly tried to negotiate to see how I could get, but the recruiter shut me down fairly quickly and scheduled a call with the manager of the team I'd be recruited  for to talk more about the role. I agreed to this because it felt awkward declining the offer right there -- the day after I went to interview... I toughed out the call (and actually thought the work  they were doing was quite cool), waited a day or two then sent in an email declining the offer.

&amp;#x200B;

I get a short reply from the recruiter saying thanks for letting her know and that's that, except... A few days later, I get an email from someone there asking to set up a call to discuss why I'd declined the offer. Looking them up on LinkedIn, I realise they're actually scarily senior (a level or two away from the CEO). This call lasts for an hour, with them increasing the offer considerably over the course of the phone call every time I said that I didn't think I'd be a good fit, asking me what it'd take for me to renege my current contract and emphasising how much they want me and what career progression was like there. It ended with them looking into offering me an individual internship (rather than through the summer internship program) on an off-cycle date so I can ""get a taste for working at \[...\]"".  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm rather conflicted as to how I feel and what I should do. Ideally, I'd like to take the internship and earn some money and  get some more experience, but I'm not sure whether I'm even allowed to do that whilst being scheduled to  start working elsewhere in June. The contract I signed does have a non-compete clause and I've already been paid my sign-on bonus, but I don't know if that's enough to count me as an 'employee' yet. So, I guess:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Does anyone know if it's okay to do an internship before starting work full-time? I know it'll vary from place to place, but I'd appreciate anybody offering experience of whether they've been able to do it or not. I've considered emailing the recruiter at the place I'm due to start (I do still keep in touch to coordinate attending various events) but that makes me feel rather awkward/anxious .

\- Any advice about what to do here? What would you do in my shoes? Would you do the internship? Would you renege and take up the new offer? I really do enjoy the work I'd be doing at my 'current' place and my team mates, but I don't know if I'm being monumentally stupid with all of this or not.

At the end of Sophomore year, I had a GPA of 2.95 (2.65 UW). Really no other reason besides poor time management and lack of drive. This year I had some shit happen and now I'm expecting to finish with a 4.7 (4.1 UW (4.0+ scale)) for the year, making my GPA a 3.53 (3.1 UW) after this year. If I keep the same pace for my senior year, I'm going to leave high school with a 3.8 (3.4 UW).

Only school-related ECs I'll have after senior year is 2 years of football and 4 (maybe 3, if I find an internship or job, then I'll take that instead) years of wrestling. I am in a magnet program for Computer Science; I'd be part of the first graduating class though, so I don't really have much prestige for the program backing me up. I also plan on getting security+ in the next couple months and a personal website (where I plan on linking my side projects), if colleges even care about career-oriented stuff like that.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I've already accepted that by the time I'm a senior, I won't be qualified for any great CS programs. I doubt I'll be able to convince colleges that I actually have academic ability and didn't just have a lucky year. So I already started dual enrolling community college classes and should finish my associate's degree (in Engineering, and CS) the summer after my senior year. I honestly believe I could pull a 4.0 for CC. I have my courseload planned out so that I'll qualify for guaranteed admissions to Virginia Tech and UVA, as well as the transfer requirements for Cornell CS. Tech and UVA are great schools, but I want to make it into a top 10 program; the problem is that these programs don't accept too many transfer students.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is:

Do I have a chance at being one of the few transfers for a program like Cornell or MIT? If the slightest chance is there, what can I do over the next couple years to boost that chance and stand out as much as I can?"

The issue I've been running into is staying motivated to spend a bunch of time doing programming outside of school just for its own sake or just to put it on a resume.

I always feel like that time is better spent doing something that makes me money since I fully support myself financially in an area with a high cost of living.

I'm currently looking for an internship for the summer but in the short term I'm trying to figure out a side-hustle type deal I can do while school's in session to make money while improving my programming skills.

Are sites like Fiverr worth a try for freelance work? Is there anywhere with a good bug bounty program I should look into?

I had to renege an offer after accepting because the internship start date just didn't work out with my last day of final exams and they were not willing to have me start late. I really thought I was done with the entire job search and interview process for this summer. I have been applying to a lot of positions again to only hear nothing or straight up rejections. I'm a computer science major and I'm getting desperate to the point where I even started applying to sales internships lol 😩

If nothing works out for me this summer, what would you recommend I do that will prepare me  in looking for full time positions as a rising senior (or even how to prepare for that!) or any types projects I could work out to build my resume? Unfortunately my university does not offer research grants to work on a personal project. What are you thoughts on finding  research opportunities instead?

I know it's not the end of the world if I don't get an internship for the summer after junior year, but wouldn't that look bad on my resume? I really wanted to find an internship for the summer to get the opportunity to see what it's like in an software engineer position and see if this is what I want to continue pursuing after graduating.

Decent resume which I’ve had reviewed a few times by our career center and I have been getting call backs recently.
I have been applying to a mix of jobs from Cybersecurity related positions to Junior SWE positions.

However, I am a bit rusty on actual programming at the moment and I received my first real Junior SWE call back for the technical questions and Im realizing I am completely unprepared for the technical part on Data Structures/Algorithms. Going to start reviewing my coding and doing leetcode/hackerrank problems now but at the same time I can’t really afford to not have a job for the next 2-3 months while I prepare.

Should I keep looking for jobs that possibly won’t require the intense technical questions, such as the entry-level IT/Cybersecurity/Public State IT positions, while I continue to practice leetcode/hackerrank? Will it be difficult to switch to a SWE position once I do feel ready for the technical DS/Alg questions if they see Im in not in a SWE position now?

I would like to give a little bit of a background.

**Background:**

I earned an AS in Business Administration and BBA in Computer Information Systems. During my senior year I decided go towards server administration and networking, after graduation I interned as a sys admin. intern, couldn't get any jobs after because I wasn't qualified but at the same time I didn't like the field but decided to push through. I earned a CompTIA A+ cert 6 months ago and a Red Hat Linux cert 3 months ago. I've been working as a IT service Technician for the past year.  
However, I always wanted to do something that involved a balance of business and IT, just didn't it was possible mainly due to me ignorance and lack of research. After watching some informative videos on IT Business Intelligence/Data Analysist/Business Analytics and at some point my dream of being a successful entrepreneur, I want to work in this field.

**What to do:** 

I think it would be best for me from a earning a job perspective to earn an MCSA in either SQL 2016 BI Development or BI Reporting. There are many entry level job openings with these certifications. SQL seems the more technical route, I could be wrong but it doesn't really matter. I know BI reporting concentrates on PowerBI. I'm having a tough time deciding, they both seem like great choices. I do, at least at the moment want to get both MCSAs at some point.   


*What are you suggestions?*

 *Which one should I go for first?*

 *Are there any certifications outside of Microsoft that I should explore?*   


Thank you for your time. "
aotss4,33,2019-02-09,"Why is that whenever someone thinks of doing a Ph.D. in comp science, there are too many people who discourage them from it.",throwback656,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aotss4/why_is_that_whenever_someone_thinks_of_doing_a/,"So, a little bit about my background. I did a masters in computer science from Rutgers. I have been working at a famous firm for 2 years now. Think top 10 software development firm. My masters GPA is between 3.0 and 3.5. I did my bachelors from India from a virtually unknown college. Now there were some financial problems because of which I couldn't focus on my masters properly. I have a decent GRE score 166 + 156 which will expire this year.

I have enough savings now and I don't think I would need a TA-ship to support myself. Although I do require a financial grant. I don't think I can pay for 4 years of Ph.D. tuition. I am thinking of a Ph.D. in either machine learning or something related to Compilers or Computer graphics. Three things that interest me the most in Computer science.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here are the things that I hear most from current Ph.D. students, people with Ph.D.s academicians, professors etc.,

* You have a comfy well paying job, you might not get one after the Ph.D. program: Pretty much half of the people with Ph.D. from Rutgers have offers from both Google and Facebook. One guy I know is pursuing a postdoc at Facebook, I did not know that it was possible. Almost every one of them intern at a Big4 in the summer.
* You learn more in the industry: I am not learning researching skills or the kind of problem-solving skills or critical thinking ability that you learn while doing a Ph.D
* Research is hard: I never worked on a research project nor did I publish any papers. But there was a Computer Networks class and I had to read one or two research papers each week and I had a quiz on them every week. For that course alone I read 50 papers. I am confident that if I can do that for 4 weeks. I can do the same for 4 years and come up with a genuinely interesting thesis and a project that would have a real-world impact.
* You will lose about 600,000$ in salaries: CTO's make 600,000$ a year at least and almost all of the famous companies CTO's have a Ph.D. Even if I shoot for the stars, I might end up on the moon.
* Do you even know why you want to do a Ph.D: Well, I see Ph.D. as education. I want to learn researching skills, problem-solving and critical thinking. I have read several papers in the areas I am interested in. More or less, I have an idea of the state of the art of technology in that area and I know what the famous problems are in that area. I want to try and push the boundaries of science a little bit in those areas.

I think pretty much, there is no way I can get into the Ph.D. program at Rutgers. What can I do to enhance my chances of getting into a Ph.D. program in like a top 20 or top 25 programs (Rutgers used to be a top 20 program, a lot of the professors in the department died recently)?

Also, anyone who is currently pursuing a Ph.D. What is your take on it?"

aow7ud,3,2019-02-09,"Scared/stressed I might lose access to medication when moving from the US to the UK next month: any advice, tips, comforting comments?",euhler,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/aow7ud/scaredstressed_i_might_lose_access_to_medication/,"Hi all, 

So a little background, I got diagnosed really late. Teachers and even other parents commented for years, but my parents never really believed in ADD/ADHD. Even in college, I was miserable dealing my inability to do tasks that took more than ~15 minutes, but I still managed to get good grades by sacrificing my sleep and developing some unhealthy coping mechanisms. I also think it helped my major happened to require short bursts of intense creativity rather than long-term focus. 


I struggled throughout a PhD program, where the coursework required more dedicated long-term focus. Unfortunately, I waited so long to talk to someone that I ended up failing my qualifying exams and couldn't get a PhD. When I finally did (at the urging of a classmate whose mother has ADHD), it was like a switch turned on in my career and even life. 



Since getting on medication, I've held down a great job for about a year that is now  moving me to the UK for 3-6 months. I fly out in just under a month, which is very exciting! I've been on medicine with this job since I started as an intern (part of the reason I think I got a return offer and got asked to move abroad). 



My doctor here agreed to give me 90 days of medication (vyvanse) while abroad, but I recently learned that for the length of stay I'll need a license to bring my medication: https://www.gov.uk/travelling-controlled-drugs. It looks like I may have just made the deadline (submitted yesterday and fly out March 7th), but I'm overseas so we'll see what happens. I'm trying to figure out contingencies if the worst is to happen and the license doesn't arrive or it gets denied. 



1.) Is there a way for me to quickly get a doctor in the UK that will write the prescription? 

2.) Has anyone had experience with a non-controlled substance like Wellbutrin? I'd hate to switch medications from something that works for me, especially before a big life-changing trip like this, but it's a possible alternative.

3.) Any recommended coping mechanisms for dealing with ADHD without medication? Personally, I've enjoyed meditation and exercise. The problem I've found is that without medication, if I even briefly ""fall off the wagon"" and start dieting poorly/forgetting to meditate/stop exercising, then it becomes a viscous cycle where my symptoms get worse and it's even harder to reorganize my life. When on medication, it's much easier for me to reform the habits of meditation/exercise and these habits become exponentially more beneficial. 



For what it's worth, my company is *very* supportive of mental health issues and in general they take very good care of me. I'm sure they'd help with arrangements where possible. They also have a UK branch (maybe I could have the license mailed there and they could pay to express ship it to the USA). 



Any general advice would be appreciated. In the future, I had goals to move to Europe for school to take a second shot at my PhD anyway (with the benefit of starting on medication), so learning how to make that happen with medication or learning how to function without it would be incredibly helpful. From what I've researched, ADHD (particularly adult ADHD)  and the medication is more stigmatized in Europe. 



On a tangential note/rant, this whole process has been quite scary. Traveling abroad for so long by itself is somewhat stressful/scary (and exciting, I don't want to sound ungrateful). Even when traveling for a shorter term last year, getting early refills from my pharmacist was so difficult (god forbid what happens when I ask for 90 days supply in a few weeks), and my insurance still never covered it even after I fought with them. Part of me wants to be comforted by the fact I did successfully graduate with a bachelors fully without medication, but I've now reached this point in my career, secured this job, and been asked to move abroad *because* of how much better I function with medicine. The bar is higher. I'd hate to think of how horribly it could go if I end up abroad without my team and without my medication. I wish this wasn't so stigmatized. i just want my medication. It doesn't even give me a sense of ""high"" or euphoria anymore! It just helps me do my freaking job.    



tl;dr: Moving to UK for 3 months, might have applied for a license late and be unable to bring my medication (vyvanse) abroad. What are good non-medicinal coping mechanisms? Any experience with medications that aren't controlled substances like Wellbutrin? Someone tell me it's going to be alright, please! "

I just had my first week of independent teaching for my internship, and it went horribly. My CT became so frustrated with me - poor planning, lack of knowledge of the kids, inability to enforce really basic rules- that she called a meeting with the principal and my district supervisor to try and get me back on track. I couldn't do it. (My CT is right- I've had poor planning, I still can't get all of the kids' names right, much less tell you anything about them, and they'll do things like remove their IDs in class or not sign the bathroom log- simple things that happen right under my nose that I keep missing.) My independent teaching is now on hold for two weeks, when I can start over.

I can't figure out how to form relationships with students. I know, read the Ruby Payne and Harry Wong books- but I don't have a lot of relationships in my personal life and I don't know if I want 150 student relationships. That's the thing- I don't know if I want to form those relationships. I'm introverted, shy, I have anxiety that I thought was under control but is kicking my ass right now. Everyone says you have to care about them, but I don't think I can even fake that. It's not that I don't like them, it's more that I don't have the emotional capacity to care about 150 people.

I'm overwhelmed by all the things I have to get done- grading, creating assignments, lesson planning, keeping up with discipline, forming relationships... Most of the posts on this sub keep saying ""that stuff comes with time and practice,"" but it feels like I'm expected to get it all right, right now. Every time I make a mistake, I'm called on it. Even when I thought the lesson went well, or at least better than the day before, I'm given a list of five more things I missed or that I need to do.

I'm afraid that I got into this for the wrong reasons, and that the students (many of whom need a good teacher to motivate them or they'll just fail, because there's no one at home who's going to motivate them) are going to suffer because I can't do this. Grades are due next week and half of the students (I'm not even exaggerating) are failing because they haven't turned in work.

I'm stressed, overwhelmed, depressed, I'm having trouble sleeping, I've been eating so little that I've lost weight, and it's only been a week.

I'm not here looking for encouragement. I'm looking for an honest opinion about whether I should be a teacher, or if I would be better suited for another profession. Please don't be cruel, I feel shitty enough already, but if you think I'm not suited, please be honest.

Edit: I really appreciate the responses- the ones saying I should stick it out and see how I feel, and the ones who say I shouldn't be a teacher. I still haven't decided, but it helps to know that others had lousy student teaching experiences and went on to have good careers.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: I talked with my district supervisor, and we're going to try a new school, grade level, and mentor teacher. I still don't know if teaching's right for me, but I'm going to try and stick it out- I'm so close to certification and all that jazz. I really appreciate all the support and advice I received. "

   I was wondering if anyone could give me any advice or some words of encouragement for taking a computer engineering course over the summer. The dilemma is that I wasn't able to enroll in said engineering course (COMPE 271 at SDSU) due to scheduling conflicts and not being offered at the community college I'm at right now. So now I either have to try taking it over the summer, 6 weeks, online or, next semester in the fall. I have it on good authority that the course is a pretty difficult due to it being about Assembly language and that in the past, the class average is usually around 75% with a curve. I'm hoping to do internships in the summer and don't want to be bogged down all year with school, but at the same time I don't want to extend the time I have to spend in college if I don't have that class as a pre-requisite for another class down the line. Maybe over-thinking things a bit but I would just like to hear from other students or electrical engineers who may have been in the same shituation. Much appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR- Risk staying in college a semester longer or bite bullet and take hard ass programming class online over summer. "
ap3ogu,2,2019-02-10,Tired of Feeling Stuck at the Bottom,bttrflyr,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ap3ogu/tired_of_feeling_stuck_at_the_bottom/,"Writing this during a study break while in grad school, so i've already taking steps for growth.

I am having a hard time moving on from the frustration, anger and resentment i've grown that has defined my career since graduating with my Bachelor's 6 years ago. Like every other Millennial, I was pushed into college with the promise that getting a Bachelor's degree would set me up with success in the future. Well, in the 6 years since then I've tried to start my own fitness business which has failed, and i've worked for numerous gyms, swimming pools and fitness centers. Busting my ass to train clients, teach classes, promote and market myself and the gym, sell, all that b.s. Yet, every time I tried to ""grow"" I feel like I just get pushed back down.

When I got a job as a lifeguard at the pool, I had the intention of working myself up the ladder to become a manager. I got high scores on all my evaluations and I learned everything about working there, teaching fitness classes, swim lessons, coaching the swim team, training other lifeguards, etc. Yet, after 5 years I never got a raise and I never got a promotion. My boss couldn't even come up with an excuse and skirted around the issue everytime I brought it up. I realized I had no future there when he started nitpicking me on little things, but then asked why I seemed to have ""lost my energy"" and when I asked him to tell me something positive I was doing. He stumbled, so I quit.

I got a job teaching group fitness classes at a University rec center with the hopes of getting my foot in the door, again to work myself up the ladder. This facility was known to have a high turnover rate for management because the university administration micromanaged the hell out of it. I went through 5 bosses in 3 years, yet despite a new one every 9 months, I felt like I was on a blacklist. Every time I expressed my desire to teach more classes, do personal training, coach swim teams, even with the support of the facility members and the swim team coach, they would brush me off. Hell, one day I tried to introduce myself to the latest manager, and in our first interaction, he brushed me off. I also once went to a strength and conditioning coaches clinic at the university and asked a legitimate question to the head S&amp;C coach, who was in idiot because not only did not know the answer to my question, but tried to challenge me on an irrelevant part of it and then again, brushed me off.

My biggest job was working as a personal trainer at a local, independent gym that was owned by a Billy MacFarland type, it was a good deal because I could train my own clients there without paying a facility fee (so I got to keep the money). Yet, I also taught classes for them, trained their clients and also did marketing for them. I did not ask for any kind of raises (it was independent contract work) and I knew there would be no promotions. I was there to pick up the slack when their other employees no called no showed, got fired or quit (because the manager/owner was shitty, treated employees like crap and had low standards of hiring.)

Yet, they wanted me to attend a USA Weightlifting clinic but refused to help me pay the $500 fee because ""it was not good for the business."" which I took as that I was not important enough to them as an employee. That gym was so horribly managed anyway, but at that time I really stopped giving a shit about it, especially in a meeting when they ripped into us for not hitting our sales goals (during the month of december which is the worst month of sales for gyms) and they essentially told us we were all expendable. Despite that their management style was so shitty, their current staff at the time was not expendable since we were the only ones who lasted more than 3 months.

I picked up another job at a newly opened rec center teaching aqua fitness classes for them. Eventually, I came to run their whole aqua fitness program. The job posting said that base pay was $20, yet I discovered I would only get the lifeguard rate at $10 an hour, because I didn't have some obscure certification (but I did have a bachelor's degree, general certifications and 8 years experience.) They were happy that I had the skills, knowledge and experience to run their entire program, but decided that I wasn't worth base rate they advertised in the job posting. I had to fight with them for 2 months just to get a pay raise that was still $2/hour less than what they advertised. When I left the previous pool job (see above) I was getting $13/hour to teach their fitness classes, so it was a real burn to have gone through so much hard work and training, just to get the same job but doing more, for less.

The last year, I wanted to break into the field of Strength and Conditioning for athletes, I busted my ass to get the proper certifications (which cost me a lot of $$$) and to polish my resume, cover letter and applied to over 100 different places. Most of which I got no responses, the responses I did get, the best thing they could offer were unpaid internships. I took an offer from the only place I would have bothered with an unpaid, no credit, internship. Which was a pain in the ass to get to, but I made it work. Until it was not so subtly hinted that my ""personality"" (context- i'm gay) needed to be ""toned down"" in addition, the facility worked with MMA fighters, and one of them mentioned off the cuff that I looked like one of his opponents and that every time he saw me ""he had to catch himself before beating me up."" I've also had similar, uncomfortable experiences when I coached several summer league youth swim teams.

I see many of my friends, old classmates and colleagues who have gone on to have success in their careers. And everybody has shitty experiences, works with shitty ass managers/ jobs, etc. However, for me it feels like a compounding and ever increasing issue, that makes me question if it's myself. Yet, I bust my ass and put in my 100% best effort, I know my shit and I do a good job. Nobody questions me when I do a good job, and they appreciate my energy that I bring in. But when I stop bringing that energy in, they started to wonder what's wrong with me, despite giving me no recognition, appreciation, promotion or fair pay for the skillset, hard work and energy I bring in as an employee. At this point in my career, I feel like I should be much further along, I see so many of my colleagues who are moving way ahead of me, yet I can barely get an unpaid internship. My self confidence has taken a strong hit, I am losing my passion for this field, and I am questioning, what the fuck is wrong with me.

Is it so much just to get a fucking pat on the back or an appreciation for busting my ass? No matter how much training, and experience I have, why the fuck do I always have to start at the bottom again? The fitness coaching industry is constantly pushing to get new certifications and continuing education, they want me to pay more and more money for career development. Yet, no matter how much I pay, my fucking career is a joke. If i didn't know any better, I'd think I was part of a pyramid scheme.

I am 31 years old, I got so fed up that I quit, packed my stuff and left town to pursue grad school. I am finishing up my first semester of grad school for my Master's in Psychology of Sports and Exercise, which I am hoping will help me get a better job and put my career on a path where I am not having to fight my bosses every week just to get paid what they told me I would.

On the plus side, when I left the gym, most of my clients left and their entire fitness program collapsed, last I checked the owner was trying to sell the gym because he didn't want to deal with the burden of it. Clearly, they overestimated just how ""expendable"" i was. Maybe they should have just paid for the stupid clinic.

But, my self confidence and self efficacy is still so low, after 6 years of trying and getting pushed back down, not just failing, but actively pushed back down by so many shitty ass bosses and managers. That I am having a hard time recovering, feeling optimistic about myself, thinking ahead, or really just giving a shit anymore.

**TL;DR- A long winded story about working for a bunch of shitty ass people, making me feel stuck at the bottom.**

In that time I managed a team of (now 3) other IT pros and was their technical lead for all things IT. I also founded a consultancy practice within the company for offering penetration testing services to clients, as a fun extra. 

As time went by, I became more and more passionate about security and less so about internal IT. I recently was presented with an amazing opportunity to work as a security researcher for a massive financial institution. It was so tough to decide that I would leave my old company to go work for a corporation, abandoning my server babies and the network that I've built nearly entirely by myself. However, it became evident this was the right choice. Friday was my last day. They had a going away party for me and everything, which was really touching. 

Tomorrow is my first day without a job in 10 years (I'm starting later this week at the new place). I am no longer responsible for servers, tickets, outages, general IT questions, etc. It feels like a huge weight is lifted off of my shoulders, but also surreal thinking that when the clock hit time for me to leave, it all was just over. Anyway, I had a great run as a sysadmin and owe a lot of what I learned over the years to this sub. I will continue to visit, so keep the good technical posts coming!

I'm currently about to start the last semester and am looking to pursue a master's degree in computer science at NUS.

I spent the past few hours searching for more information on the school's website and on Google, but haven't been able to find any answers that I'm looking for.

Are there any specific GPA requirements for NUS? Only the GRE/TOEFL scores are mentioned on the website along with ""good candidates must have honorable degree.""

I'm currently graduating from Korea University in Seoul. My GPA isn't the best (3.1-3.2/4.0) because I switched majors to computer science in the middle of my undergraduate career, and my GRE is 163V/169Q/5.5AW.

I don't have any research experience but I do have internship experience.

How would my prospects look, and what advice would anybody have for me?

ap4dck,2,2019-02-10,Signs an interview went well?,revolutions96,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/ap4dck/signs_an_interview_went_well/,"So obviously I know no one can say if I got the job or not. However I can describe some of the things that went down during my interview and y’all can tell me if you think I have a shot at this job.

1-My interview was long at almost an hour. During the interview, the people interviewing me had a list of like 10 questions I had to answer. They were mostly run of the mill, do you know how to do this? What experience do you have with this? Etc. etc. I could have answered all of these questions in probably under 30 minutes but almost every time I gave an answer, I and the interviwers ended up talking more about my answer and other random topics, see below. 

2- The interview definitely felt more causal. After answering some of their questions, the conversation would then turn to another topic Ie like our favorite sports team, talking about hobbies, etc. 

3-They seemed to like that I already have experience with a similar software system to what they use. It’s not exactly the same, but while I was explaining the software I use to do my current job, they said that is sounds incredibly similar to their system. They also liked that I mentioned I used flowcharts to figure out processes. (In the job description for this position, it didn’t mention anything about desiring skills with this specific software or familiarity with flowcharts, so it wasn’t like I was specificity mentioning things listed in job duties/requirements to try and get the job, it was purely random) 

4- They were nodding there heads a lot and seemed engaged when they spoke to me and they were very nice. At some point they also said “I like that answer” to some of my responses. 

5-They talked about possible future of this position and the career path. Apparently this is a new position they just created and they’re hoping that after a 2 years the person hired into this position can be promoted into a manger position as the current manager will be retiring in 2021. 

6-They told me not to worry if I haven’t heard back from them in less than 2 weeks. They told me that they have to go through a lot of paperwork before they can hire anyone since it is a government agency.

7- When walking to the interview it was a random intern taking me back. After the interview, one of the interviewers walked me out and was asking me where I lived (it’s a small town and I happened to mention where I grew up and apparently the one interviewer lives in that same area and we were talking about the area and where I went to high school). 

8-I think I am the last person they interviewed. When I got the offer to interview, they only asked if I could do Thursday and gave me the option of 8:30 or 10:00am. When I signed in at the office I noticed that there were 3 other people signed in from Wednesday and Thursday saying their purpose for visiting was an interview for this position. So I think including myself only 4 people were interviewed and if I was the last one, maybe they’ll remember me the most?

9-The one interviewer really liked that I had volunteer and organizational experience in my resume. And she mentioned that their organization is getting their younger employees involved in a young professionals group and that they are also starting their own women’s group in the company. 

I really want this job and I think I have a good shot. But then again, I’ve had similar hopes with other jobs and have not gotten hired. However, none of those interviews went as well as this one.

 I meet the necessary degree requirements and practical experience. As I said before, this position is in my hometown and not a lot of people in this rural area have college degrees, so I’m hoping maybe I’m the only one who interviewed that had a bachelors degree. I’m just afraid that they may have interviewed someone who already has 10-20 years of experience and may decide to go with them. Since they’re eventually wanting the person in this position to step up after someone else retires, I’m hoping they maybe they’ll like my age and want to go with me because I’m younger. I’m 22, a recent college grad, with almost of year of real full time work experience under my belt, in addition to the 3 internships I had while in college.

I want to get better with C and C++. I 'learned' how to use them as a sophomore when I took one of the programming fundamentals courses at my university. Later down the line, we used C++ exclusively for Data Structures and Algorithms. Unfortunately, we never really left the terminal until our final project. When the final project came around, one of the guys in my group was *extremely* comfortable with C++ and wrote our entire project in &lt; 5 days. I know I should have stopped him, and insisted we each take on our fair share of the workload for the sake of education and ethics. But, hey, I was a sophomore and was much more interested in dope smokin' than developing a text editor with C++.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, I've done a good amount of development, landed internships, etc. I can build and deploy interesting webapps, work with databases, scrape the web, crunch numbers, generate graphics, tell you the time complexity of quick sort etc. But I'm pretty tied up with higher level languages full of packages and libraries that do the heavy lifting for you. I keep telling myself I'll go back and try to learn C and C++, but I keep running into the same issue:

WTF do you make with C and C++? I feel kind of tied down to the terminal and I don't really know how to move forward."
ap4qck,31,2019-02-10,A rant from an engineering student in TN,bluewings14,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/ap4qck/a_rant_from_an_engineering_student_in_tn/,"TL;DR, HOW ANNA UNIVERSITY* RUINS LIFE (NOT CLICKBAIT)

So i aint that good with posting topics, but I'd like to say a few things based on my experience. I present myself as a ""victim"" of the current educational system~

So I'm an engineering student (most of y'all might've guessed that xD), and I feel the entire system is too corrupted that people who're in charge no longer care about both students' career/knowledge and theirs, I mean, they have to update their skillset and knowledge, right?

Phase 1:

I joined school like everyone else, teachers made me cram up stuff. Was made to choose the branch in higher secondary based on marks and not skillset.

School ended, and I opted for engineering, not just because everyone else takes that or it's hyped or whatever. I've been truly passionate about studying computer science since childhood, as I spent a lot of time with the PC and all.

Phase 2:

My parents couldn't afford to admit me in a ""very good"" private institution, so ""they"" opted for a local college affliated with guess what, Anna university. Yep, that's right. Welcome me to the &lt;oof gotta censor&gt; peeps~

(Rants inbound)
1) No regard for actually learning stuff
2) Doesn't care a bit about infrastructure, although it's ""affliated"" with the Univ.
3) Spends ton of money to bribe university officials, but doesn't spend them in improving the quality of lab equipments.
4) Theory, theory, more theory. And we're supposed to cram them. No questions asked.
5) Tries to curb curiosity starting from the first semester.
6) Gets caught in a scam, makes media believe it's the fault of students.
7) ""Companies"" no longer visit the campus to hire ""engineers"" (whatta joke)
8) -1762717271 practical knowledge gained (yeah, they make us forget those that we already knew xD)
9) ""Encourages"" students to find internships and companies to invite for campus interviews, but NOT EVEN A SINGLE FRICKIN STAFF takes any measure for that, and as a result, the students are sent back to the sheithole again
10) Poor student-to-staff ratio
11) Extremely outdated syllabus
12) Corrupted university staff that evaluates papers based on the amount they're bribed


As a result, not even a single frickin student I say, can't write a single piece of code or rough out a logic for a problem as simple as implementing a data structure like a stack. And I'm including the 3rd and final year students as well. Doesn't know what an actual engineer does, the market demand, and extreme lack of confidence and communication skills (they can't even explain an easy topic in their native tongue coz they cram stuff so you could only expect the intellect of a 16 year old)

Phewww... so ig that's just a day of an engineering student in an anonymous random college in tamizh nadu for ya~

Cheers~!

*= anna univ affliated colleges

P.S: Correct me if I'm wrong, open to suggestions. And as I said, it's just my experience."

Hi there! I've been considering upgrading my current PC for a long time and after poking around, I decided that building a new one from scratch would be better since my current processor is an i5-4690.

My budget for the PC is roughly SGD$2000 (USD$1500). I will be using the PC primarily for gaming (WoW, Anthem, AC Odyssey, Division 2, etc.), with potential photo and video editing in the future depending on my internship or job that I land in the future.

Originally, I was going with an i5-8600 but I was considering the near future and decided an i7-8700 with hyperthreading might be better instead.

If there's any suggestions or changes you think I could make to my build, please do let me know :) I'm not really an expert - I just asked a friend to help me build around an RTX2070 build and he came up with this.

I will be playing in 1080p on a 60hz monitor. Currently have no plans to upgrade to a monitor with a higher refresh rate yet as I don't feel I need all the extra hz that comes with it as my main game is WoW.

I also do not plan to OC.

I'm interested in theoretical CS/algorithms and I want to go to grad school just because it's something that I am actually interested in. Everyone says that to go to grad school the most important thing you need to have is research, both to show schools that you can do it and also just to try it out (because TCS research really isn't for everyone, which I definitely understand). However, I'm really confused about how to even get it. For reference, I go to a top 10 CS school and have a pretty good gpa (3.9) I have a software engineering internship for the summer at a Big 4 company. In terms of coursework, I've done programming, data structures, algorithms, discrete math, and probability. But I've been rejected from every research position/program that I've applied to.

I will be applying for REUs next summer, although I've heard that they are really hard to get into and I don't want to bank on it. People say that you should just ask professors, but I'm really intimidated because I feel like at this point as a sophomore, I don't even have close to the level of knowledge to be able to contribute meaningfully to anything. I asked one professor for advice and he told me that the vast majority of undergrads can't do any meaningful research just because a lot of problems are very specific/super niche, unless they've already specialized a lot in an area. 

For those of you who did find research as undergrads, how did you do it? What advice do you have for someone in my situation? Thank you!"

So I switched my major over to CS and my minor to business administration. 
I'm still a little behind on my programming, but I'm studying and practicing as much as I can. My advisor (also the head of the department) has been most helpful. She got me an internship as a social media analyst for forensics research, which helped me realize my dream career to be a data analyst (basically my intership but on the business side rather than the forensics side). I have taken classes on data structures on data structures and Python programming. I am currently taking a class on cyber security and a class on C, Java, and more Python.

I recently accepted an internship for a large company that produces machines. The 8 month long co-op starts in a few months.

About a week ago I encountered a problem, and soon after, I came of with a pretty awesome solution for that problem (imo). It happens to relate to exactly what my company does, and I wouldn’t doubt that it’s something they could be interested in. 

My question is, how should I go about this? It’s not a groundbreaking idea, but it is something that I’ve never seen or heard of before that could benefit them.

If you were in my situation, would you file a patent? Give them the idea once working for them? 

I’m absolutely willing to give them this idea, but I’m wondering would could come from it? A good reference? Something else?

Thanks!"

I have been applying for internships everywhere in my place, hoping to get one for summer 2019.  Not only have i been applying for one locally but also abroad as well.

However, there’s this stuff happening and I’m not sure if it’s a thing or not. I applied for this one company over 20 days ago and my application status is still Under Review. Yet I saw that company posted the job posting for the exact same position I applied to 2 days ago on another job hunt platform. Specifically, the first time I applied was through the company’s website (I had a referral there as well), and the newest job posting I saw they posted is currently on Glassdoor. They have not responded to my current application (it’s over 20 days ago and still under review) but still already uploaded the same job posting as their newest post? Are they simply ghosting me? Or does this just mean nothing?


I wonder if this stuff also applies to anyone else looking for internship.

I work with Salt, Ansible, VMware,  Jenkins, vRA. CI/CD Pipeline is not matured, doesn't have versioning yet. Everything is on-prem, but there are talks about going to the cloud (Azure). Also, there are talks of containerizing with Docker/ Kubernetes. A lot of politics and somewhat toxic culture. Very traditional and late adopters to new tech and culture. The company has a large env and 10,000+ employees. Full- time role and decent comp.

Would work for a very big name in the tech industry (i.e. something like FB, Google, Microsoft). I would work with Hashi corp tools, Ansible and on-prem but mostly on AWS env. Things are containerized there and they have a great CI/CD pipeline. Would work with a huge env (Petabytes of data) and only 3,000 employees.  The internship is only a couple of months and does not guarantee a full-time offer at the end. Comp is substantially better and free housing + free meals.

I am in a bit a predicament and I am in need of advice from people with more experience. Due to confidentiality, I cannot disclose the companies or identifying information, but I hope at least you will get a picture of what's going on.

So here's my situation:

I did my first internship at Company A, which I really enjoyed since it was in a niche industry that I am passionate about. I am currently studying software engineering but I also happen to have another undergrad degree directly related to the niche industry company A makes software for. I did really well, and apparently I was an intern who shipped more real software features than any other intern in the past few years (according to the feedback I received). Despite the success of the internship, I did sometimes feel relatively underpaid considering the amount of work I did. Amongst my software intern friends, I was by far the lowest paid. However, I really liked the company culture and got along well with my team. I like it so much that before I left, I asked them to come back for another internship, but this time taking on a slightly different role more in line with my long term career goals. They informed me that it could be a possibility if I passed a technical interview. 

Fast forward a few months later, not being sure what would happen with company A, I started applying for other internships. To my surprise, I ended being a very popular candidate and landed interviews with 12 different companies. I have already received offers from 6 of these companies. During this crazy period of interviewing, I was contacted by company A for my technical interview. I ended up really impressing them at the technical interview and was given a return offer. However, to my disappointment when I asked about compensation, they only offered the same rate they initially paid me. 

So here's the thing, out of those 6 job offers, there are only really 2 of them that really interest me. They are both huge players in their industry (these 2 companies are direct competitors) and both are offering much better compensation. This other industry is also very interesting and sought after, so I am wondering if I should take the plunge and switch companies. However, Company A still remains the only company  within  the niche industry that I want to break in to. So my question is, given the position I am in, is it appropriate to try and negotiate the salary with company A?

I heard before that interns negotiating pay is frowned upon, but at the same time given my good track record with the company, my high GPA, and my previous experience I think that maybe it wouldn't be so inappropriate. If I do decide to ask for more money, how do I go about it? I am concerned that maybe they will think that I only care about the pay, which is not the case. 

A lot of my friends also have return offers to the companies they did their first internships at, but with salary increases. I also feel that if I just accept such a low wage, that I may be setting the wrong precedent for potential permanent opportunities with company A.

If anyone here has insight or general advice it would be greatly appreciated. I only have 3 days to make my decision. "
apcnir,2,2019-02-10,What city should I move to? New York City vs San Francisco/Bay Area?,dan0543,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/apcnir/what_city_should_i_move_to_new_york_city_vs_san/,"Hello everyone,

Not sure if this is the right sub for this but I'm confused between attending a university in the Bay Area vs NYC. I'm hoping to land internships while in school and will most likely live in the area I graduate from for at least a few years. That's why I feel like CS Career Questions is a great place for me to ask this question. This will probably be lengthy, so I apologize in advance. For those of you short on time or patience I'll include a TL;DR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I am 21 years old, currently Active Duty Military stationed in Florida. My contract ends in less than a year and I will be applying to schools very soon. I'm attending a local community college and will have my AA degree complete prior to transferring. I currently hold a 4.0 so I believe I will have a good shot at getting accepted at most of the schools I apply to.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm originally from NYC; born and raised in Brooklyn and went to high school in the city. It was a great time and I loved it. However, after living in Florida and getting my drivers license/car and my own apartment, I've visited NYC a couple of times. I didn't mind the public transportation/MTA before I got my car, but now it frustrates me so much. Constant delays, re-routes, skipped stations, etc. And driving is just infuriating, especially in Manhattan. That, paired with the nasty winters makes me hesitant to attend school and work there. I love everything else about NYC though; the people, the culture, the architecture, the efficiency, being able to walk everywhere, etc.

Since I'll be moving after I finish my AA degree in Florida anyway, I  want to use that to my advantage and apply to schools in the Bay Area such as SFSU, SJSU, CSUEB, etc, and I would be lying if I said it wasn't for the Software scene/opportunities. I'm also planning on applying to NYC CUNY's as well. I'd get the GI Bill which would pay for school and rent, so I'm kind of in a position where I'm free to go wherever I'd like. 

Part of the reason I'd want to move to the Bay Area now is because I'm pretty shy and reserved and have trouble making friends. I feel like if I go to school there, it'll be easier for me to make friends compared to moving there a few years into my career. If I hate it, I can always move back home to NYC and I'll always have my friends and family there.

But the other half of me tells me to just go back home. I've read a lot of posts where people complain about the Bay Area and say it sucks, its dirty, its small/boring, it isn't what it used to be, and that it's hard to land an entry-level position. People also say that NYC is one-of-a-kind, and theres nothing like it, and that most people from NYC end up moving back anyway.

So I'm kind of at a cross roads here, and feel lost when trying to decide where I want to work/live.

Also, I've never been to the West Coast. The furthest West I've ever been is Louisiana (lol). However I am visiting California for a week in about 80 days or so, just to see if I like it, but since I'm starting in SF and making my way towards LA during the trip, spending a day or two in different cities along the coast, I doubt I'd have enough time to really get a feel for everything.

What would you do in my position? 

Has anyone here lived in both areas for a decent length of time? Where do you prefer?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I have the opportunity to move anywhere thanks to the GI Bill. I've narrowed it down to moving back home to NYC, or moving to the Bay Area for tech opportunities. I'd be able to easily afford both as long as I live with roomates. I love NYC but I hate the winters and the public transport/driving there. The Bay Area sounds promising career-wise and the weather is a lot better, but a lot of people on here say they hate it. What would you recommend I do? Which city have you liked more?"
apcp5s,1,2019-02-10,"Salary negotiation, can I do better?",tomtam2334,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/apcp5s/salary_negotiation_can_i_do_better/,"Background, M24 1 year professional experience as a sysadmin/devops engineer, 1 1/2 with internships. Working in NOVA.

Interviewed with a company on Friday, recieved an offer the same day. During the interview process I mentioned my range was 85-89k. At my actual interview I told the recruiter I was seeing salaries closer to 95k (sure, I'm *seeing* them, but the average salary for someone with my experience is closer to 85k). They came back with an offer for 89k.

Extras:
8-15% performance bonus

4% 401k match 

3k training stipend 

Decent benifets 

UPTO (really 4-5 weeks)

The recruiter factored in my bonus to get me a TC closer to 95k which I thought was kind of funny. It's a performance bonus! 

So basically I gave them a higher number in the interview and they came back at the top of my range. The company is a private sector management consulting firm starting a tech practice from the ground up. I would be one of the first SWE on the team. They're very AWS/Cloud focused which I have zero experience in, so I'm not a perfect applicant. I think they're mostly hiring because they need people now and I'm a good culture fit. They didn't ask any technical questions in the interview, reinforcing my position they're looking for someone to say yes

What's my negotiation position here like? Let the chicken out of the henhouse a bit by giving away a target, but I think 85-89k is exactly their range for 1 1/2 years experience. I'm going to ask for 2 day WFH before I accept, which does not seem like a reach (they mentioned they're cool with remote work). 

I currently make 73k TC so this is a solid raise. Should I ask for more, and if so how much?

I am an international student who studies math and computer science in the US. I am looking for applying for a cloud engineering Intern. It is not my first time to apply for an internship, I have applied for some internships before and none of them go well. So this time I plan to treat this very seriously. I would like to ask several questions about applying for an internship and hopefully, I could get some feedback from you guys.

1. Do I need a recommendation letter for an internship? I know if I am going to apply for a graduate school or higher level organization I need to have several recommendation letters. But do I have to get a recommendation letter for internships? I do have a cover letter for myself.
2. Will they go check my previous working company? My cloud engineering experiences are from two ""internships"" I did last spring and summer. The reason I put a quotation mark on it is because I don't know if they are even counted as internships. For those two internships, the first one was a fraud, I was worked with a group of engineers and our boss did not have money to pay us so we disband after 3 months. And the rest of the engineers form another startup company and invite me to join them. So I continued working for another 4 months. I mean, I did my work nicely and I learned a lot from those two internships. But I am worried if they know my previous two companies are startups and one of them even do not have a webpage, they will remove me from the list. I don't know how to insert Image so I will put a link down here. And could someone give me some advice about my resume?
3. Did anybody use Montage for interviewing before? Is that a real-time video calling tool? Or it also has a coding part on it?
4. My last question will be, what sort of interview question should I do to prepare for a cloud engineering intern? I have done some coding practice on LeetCode and reviewing some algorithms. But I have no idea how to prepare for a cloud engineering internship.

I'm not in any school clubs because edgy freshman self decided to not do anything. Perhaps to make up for that, I make my own club?

I'm currently a high school junior looking to learn. I have \~5 years of experience in Java and about a year in Python &amp;&amp; Web Dev (HTML/CSS/Django/JS). I guess I've branched out of the self-learning/projects phase and want to actually experience hands-on work. All of the internships I've looked at are very demanding and/or require applicants to be undergrad level. I live in the Silicon Valley, so looking for opportunities shouldn't be hard, per se. But I guess my question is whether or not companies/startups would be down to allow a high schooler to intern for them? I'm honestly willing to do it for no pay, I guess the actual experience matters more for me. How should I go about this?"

My friends are always talking about how many APs they're doing, or if they got a internship at some tech company over the summer, or about the new Android app they're building. I'm a freshman.

I feel like I'm drowning. My school is in a upper middle class suburb of Silicon Valley. It's majority Asian. All of my friend's parents work at some sort of tech company. One of my friend's parents work at Apple. Another at Microsoft. Another at Google. To say that the academic pressure is pretty damn intense would be an understatement. It's the type of school where kids sometimes flat out kill themselves due to the stress, the kind you hear about in the news. In my school there's this unspoken rule that you have to major in CompSci if you ""want to amount to anything""

The Asian parent stereotype is true. Every single part of it. I don't want to say anything more.

Im pulling a 4.0 right now but I literally cannot afford to get a single B. I would kill myself if that happened, and it probably will.

Sometimes I'm just sitting in Spanish class and I start to think about how much easier it would be just to hang myself instead of doing Algebra II homework. I just want the stress to end. I just want to not have to get up every morning at 5:30, and trudge through the California cold (it's legit cold in the morning, shut up) to go to school literally before the sun even rises. Slowly but surely my life is going out of control.

I haven't done SAT prep in a few months now, and I need to raise my sat by about a hundred points if I want any hope of getting into a decent UC, I have a science Olympiad meeting tomorrow morning for like 4 hours and it's 2:30 am so I guess I'm not getting any sleep. I have to register the club that I run at a fundraising event, and fill out the paperwork for that. My coding projects are all behind schedule, and I'm so fucking depressed that my most recent project was a Python script called ""areyoustillalive.py"".and still need to learn Java to try to prepare for AP CompSci next year.

Kill me now kill me.please

I would probably be dead already if it wasn't for the fact that one of my classmates killed himself at my school back in October. He sat in front of me in class. that was a hard week.

Thanks for listening to my rant. I need to sleep now."

I am currently looking for a job as a software engineer in N. America. (I am from Romania)

After taking in account the cost of living and the problems with the visa, I've decided to forget about Seattle and focus only on Canada. 

I've done a lot of research on various websites regarding the pay in Toronto and Vancouver but the results seem to be all over the place. The most professional source I could find was the Robert Half salary guide which states a 73k-140k range for all level (Vancouver).

I was wondering if you guys could give me more info about the salary ranges (excluding Amazon, Microsoft etc.) and which city is the best pick. According to Numbeo Vancouver seems to me more affordable.

About myself  (to give you a better idea):

\- Graduated from an engineering university summer 2018 ( computer science major/ 4 years).

\- Starting the end of my 3rd year I've done a 3 month internship and continued to work as a Junior software engineer for the same Global company during my 4th year.

\-  After graduation I've changed the company for a mid level position which I still have right now.

\-  In June I'll have 2 years of work experience excluding projects done during Uni.

Hope this gives you a better idea and I can't wait to hear from you :D

How bad is it to going to look?",dogmom1993,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/apgt8u/id_like_to_start_looking_at_other_jobs_but_ive/,"A little background: I graduated in May 2018. Prior to graduating I worked the “typical” jobs -retail, a restaurant, an internship, and then in sales. None of these have lasted particularly long due to needing to change (school schedule, finding something better, etc.). I know this isn’t great for my resume but I had some odd circumstances medically that made the retail and serving jobs impossible, and then the sales job was a hostile work environment so I left after 9 months. 

Worked a temporary position at a nonprofit and before that ended, took the job I’m working now. I’m underpaid, my responsibilities have totally changed, and I’m just not happy in the role anymore. I’ve only been in it about 6 months. I’m struggling to make ends meet and have taken on a part time job to help. No savings, no benefits (despite working increasingly more hours weekly), no PTO. Just the same hourly wage I made working retail in college, but with a degree and way more responsibility &amp; stress. 

Do I even have a shot at getting another job if I’m already trying to leave this one? I wanted to stay for a year for sure but it’s going to be difficult. Do I just deal and stay another 6 months or would it be okay to begin looking? Thanks! "

IT Internship | My High School | \~7 months in 2015-2016

$8/hr.

Most people knew I was very good with computers, so I was asked if I was interested. I really did not get to put my hands on a lot in this internship. I did not have admin rights, I did not have access to the ticketing system, or much at all honestly. Most of my support was resolving user-error or upgrading classroom projectors, replacing bulbs, etc. I got paid $8/hr for this internship.  I lied about this later when looking for a help desk position and said I had basic Active Directory experience, as well as experience using ticketing systems.&gt;!I dual enrolled in high school, so I took college classes during high school (I have 1 year completed -- free of cost). I spent 2 class periods doing this internship after my college courses, then I would go home at around 1 PM, then usually clock in at work at 4 PM and work until 11-12 at night.     !&lt;

&gt;!I started having tendon problems in my ankle while working at Fast-Casual Food Franchise at 19. I did not have any insurance, and I worked on it for a long time as the pain never got severe. Until one day I could barely hold my weight on it at work. I spent $500 going to clinics. The first clinic I paid $300 and they diagnosed me wrong. Gave me a steroid shot, sent me home...2 days later it was hurting just as bad again. Went to another clinic paid $200 (this was nearly 2 weeks of pay for me). I started doing stretches since they diagnosed it was damage to my tendon, which helped, I still had some problems but it never got to the excruciating level of pain again.   This is why I started looking for an IT job.  !&lt;

Help Desk Analyst | Contract @ Fortune 500 Company | July 2017-February 2018

$14.90/hr.

My first real IT job.

All the other techs were very comfortable, spending free time between calls on Netflix/Hulu/whatever. Our management didn't care at all -- as long as you did a good job on the phone. &gt;!Coming from an understaffed food joint where I typically skipped my 15 minute paid lunch break, I was dumbfounded with how much free time there was (even if its just in 5-10 minute intervals).       !&lt;I tried to spend all my free time constructively. I studied to get certifications (which they would pay for when hired on), I learned some basic PowerShell scripting to automate some stuff (automated the install of a manually installed app, there was an Office patch that got pushed that removed Office desktop shortcuts - I made a script that recreated them and managed to get 65 calls logged that day). I literally read their KBs in my free time. After 3-4 months, the guy that had even been there 6 years would check with me before escalating stuff to desktop support.Then, they outsourced their help desk. I got an offer at the MSP they outsourced to for $33k a year (negotiated to $36k), but that fell through.

Windows 10 Migration Technician | Contract @ 2nd Fortune 500 Company | March 2018 - Present

$18/hr.

My Accomplishments here that I believe lead me to get the senior desktop support position:Identified and resolved issues with network adapter script and scheduled task which affected a lot of users’ WiFi capability. My changes were pushed to the enterprise.

Automated application installation for flagged manual install apps.  

Created a script that could identify if a remote PC is on any of the 3 docking stations we use and on an Ethernet connection. This helped us identify if computers were in the ready state before their Win10 deployment over night.  

Created script that remotely reinstalls SCCM client using PsExec.  

Learned how to read/identify problems in task sequence logs.  

Identified OneNote registry key that stores opened notebook paths.  

  

Worked with engineers any time possible to get a higher level understanding of processes, and give input/help if at all possible. This really goes a long way.

I also had people brag on me constantly.. I think on average every 2 weeks someone would reach out to my manager and brag on me.  The position I landed was under the same manager and team I was already working in as a contractor.

This is going to be a long one, which I apologize for in advance. I seriously appreciate anyone who can offer advice.

Best summary I can give: My job is destroying my mental health, social life, and to a certain extent physically damaging. I’ve been thinking about quitting ever since I started. But I’m worried that might be the wrong thing to do because what if it’s just me? What if can’t handle any job, or ever find one that I am content with, and by quitting this one I’ll be accomplishing nothing?

Explanation: I interned with the company when I was still in college. For an internship, it was all right, but I knew the work wasn’t something I enjoyed. Fast forward to them offering me a position.  I hesitated and asked for time to think about it. When I mentioned it to my family, they told me I’d be a fool if I didn’t take it because it was $14.50 an hour. So I took it.

Right off the bat I had a baaad time. I started having anxiety attacks where my chest would feel so tight I had to force myself to breathe and constantly feeling on edge. One night, about a month after I started, I left the building in a very bad state and hyperventilated in my car until I felt dizzy. Knowing I couldn’t keep going like that, I googled as much self-help as possible. I’ve found ways to cope with the stress. I’m still frequently on edge, but I’m doing a lot better. (I've never been diagnosed with any anxiety/mental illnesses, FYI.)

Actually, let me make a quick list of the pros/cons of the actual job so you don’t have to read for hours:

Pros:

\-almost all of my coworkers are friendly

\-management is good, and my superiors are easy to talk to

\-I’m good at the work

\-they are very accommodating for appointments and illnesses

\-fantastic benefits

\-again, $14.50 an hour is NICE

\-no dress code

\-lenient about arriving/leaving late

\-it’s a job. Having a job is better than not having one at all

\-I don’t have to deal with customers

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\-there are no opportunities for promotions

\-I’m constantly worn out, so my time for hobbies and social life has decreased drastically

\-due to how hectic work is, I only have time to eat snacks when I’m there (which is not good considering I’m underweight as is)

\-I don’t enjoy the work

\-frequent stress

\-frequent wrist/hand pain (I’m prone to tendonitis, and most of my work is clicking a mouse. I wear a wrist brace at night, do stretches, use an ergonomic mouse, and carry a compression glove in case it gets really bad.)

\-I’ve realized I don’t mesh well with the hours. I work 1:45 to midnight for four days a week. Since I worry about falling asleep driving the forty minutes to my house, I stay at my parents’ house a lot. Sometimes I’ll go three days without being at my house.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah. My family keeps telling me to suck it up, all jobs have issues, and that I'm just thinking like a spoiled brat. Could they be right? I'm also worried that if I quit, I'll be seen as a job hopper since I've only had this job for four months, and my previous job I only stayed two. But god, I am just not happy with my job life right now.  Any advice? And thank you so much for reading this novel I wrote!"

apjwlt,11,2019-02-11,Stay at IBM or accept new offer or neither?,decisionsarehard69,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/apjwlt/stay_at_ibm_or_accept_new_offer_or_neither/,"Hi,

I'm in the Spring semester of my junior year for a CS degree. This morning I got an offer letter from an oil and gas company for a Summer Analyst Intern position. They're offering me $23/hour with a one time payment of $2500 for relocation (I live in commuting distance of their office so this would go straight to my pocket). On top of money, I like this company because I would be able to live with my current roommate and girlfriend through the Summer and they have an awesome campus with things like free lunch and a free gym.

There are a couple issues though. I currently work as a Support Engineer at IBM making $22.50/hour part time from home. For this job I work 40 hours per week during the Summer and 20 hours per week while I'm at school, so it's a pretty good deal. I also get a raise at the start of each Summer so I'll probably be making more here anyway. I do need to move each Summer for this job though.

The second issue is I'm in the middle of the interview process with a couple of companies, including Amazon(I did really well on both of the technical interviews, and I'm waiting to hear back about doing a final phone interview). Obviously if I land Amazon I'm taking it, but the offer letter I received today only gives me until Thursday of this week to make a decision.

I'm not sure what I should do here. My rough plan now is to ask the oil and gas company for more money and for more time to make a decision. I also have a preference for an internship in software engineering even though neither of my current guaranteed options are that. I've never been in this spot before. What do I do?"

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, if I am already having an internship in a start-up (but it is unpaid) and I want to look for a paid one this upcoming summer, should I talk to the recruiters honestly about that? That I gained a lot of experiences through my current internship but it is unpaid, so I would love to be able to get paid in my second internship. That therefore I hope to apply for any internship positions available in their company provided that it is a paid one? Do you have any advices for me about what should I say and do to heighten my chances of getting an interview at least, and not leaving a bad impression on the recruiters there?

My mom keeps pushing for me to apply for internships and *I am*, but I can't help but feel that it's a lost cause because a lot of places have minimum requirements for GPA and they won't even give me a chance for an interview.

However, I am having a really difficult time selecting which school to go. My future goal is to tech entrepeneurship, and for internship I want to seek either tech or finance. Here are the pros and cons of each school:

**Wharton Pro:**

* Huge brand prestige, I really want to add something onto my resume that can instantly bring that ""wow"" factor
* Better quality classmates and alumni base
* Top 3 ranking
* Better in finance, and maybe equal to Haas in terms of tech

**Wharton Cons**:

* Don't like to live in a cold eastern city
* I am not a super alpha-personality type of person, I am more of an introvert, so don't know how well I would fit in at Wharton
* No brand dilution from part-time programs
* Not a diverse city (I am Asian)

**Haas Pros:**

* Bay area weather, which is a huge plus for me
* Great parent institution brand name
* Maybe better for entrepreneurship due to its location and parent university
* Diverse city, right beside San Francisco which would be alot of fun
* I feel the culture at Haas is less intense and intimidating

**Haas Cons:**

* Obviously the business school is not ranked as high, nor is it well known internationally
* Based on what I heard, doesn't place well in finance 
* I am a moderate conservative, I am not sure how well I would enjoy living in a hyper-liberal environment (I feel Berkeley is waaaay more liberal than the average liberal university)
* Part-time MBA brand dilution

Those of you in CS;

1. BA or BS?

2. Professors or classes to avoid or look out for? Which professors should I take and which should I avoid? Were there any classes or professors that were notoriously bad but still required?
3. Any helpful or general tips from people who've experienced success or failure because of specific habits, etc

so i've been lucky enough to work for different games as a developer in the last 3 years (Carcassone, Catan Universe, Albion Online) and it has always been Internships or Junior dev jobs. And I recently had a 1on1 with my Techlead who asked me where I want to go, what my weaknesses are in my opinion and what he should put me upt to for the next months.

Now, I read quite a few books (Clean Code, Gaming Design Patterns...) although to be honest I rarely ""finish"" them but rather read the sections I'm interested in. Also I bought a lot of courses on udemy, lnyda, pluralsight and so on.

I'm in the last semesters of computer science and I think I have a fair knowledge of object oriented programming, architecture, patterns and all that stuff. The question by my tech lead got me thinking:

What are my problems? Where do I see my weaknesses? I certainly do have some of them! I constantly need to remind me to 

* check that I'm in the right place before extending a class
* check if the method or data I'm planning to get is already provided somewhere else
* check that, before asking a colleague, I really understood and can explain what my problem is.

But I got these problems in check - so far, so good. Still, my main two issues remain:

1. Although knowing about stuff like delegates, promise chains, Design Patterns whatsoever: I rarely see the opportunities of using them in my own code. Reading about them and seeing them in examples makes total sense to my, I just don't see the right spots for them when I am working or refactoring at work or on private projects. It happened to me countless times that someone pointed out to me that he / she or even I used a certain fancy named technique without me realizing it.
2. Wrapping my head around new projects. Whenever I get sent to a total new project (this can also be a change request or any other feature) I get confused easily by the given code and therefor insecure and frustrated. I begin at a certain method and F12 my way all the way through the rabbit hole - but often stuff appears that I need to understand, which distracts me, and I end up missing the right spots which I should hook upon to to finish my task.

I think these are my two big obstacles that I need to overcome, and I wondered if any of you guys could share some help or ideas with me. Maybe a good book or course, maybe some stories of your own career... any help is appreciated!"

Current Status: Abroad for the semester taking gen. ed. requirements, plenty of free time. 

Courses Taken: Calc series through multivariate, Linear Algebra I and II, Java courses up through data structure &amp; introductory algorithms, intro to computer engineering. Also biology, chemistry and physics basics.

Scheduled to take: Advanced Probability, Analysis I and II, Intro Stochastic Processes, Intro to AI, &amp; one more CS class of my choosing.

Weak Spots: only really proficient in Java, terrible at technical interview questions, lack of side-projects.

Plan so far: I've just bought 'Cracking the Coding Interview', and an online course in python, planning to work my way through those while abroad. I'd also like to work on some sort of project to build my portfolio but I don't know where to start. I've been applying to summer internships, but honestly don't feel all that qualified.

So I called the boss and he says I was always late, always refused to work, Was shit at everthing we did there. And I asked, why did you wanted me to work for you after the Internship? He says I offerd you an oportunity, but you are stupid, you don't to do nothing in life, you are rascal.   
What can I do? If companies keep calling him and he keeps telling them lies?"

apv4c2,13,2019-02-12,A Public Apology and a Private Hell,TurningtheHeaton,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/apv4c2/a_public_apology_and_a_private_hell/,"Look, I know as I write this from my luxurious penthouse office space that no one truly cares if I die, but please… I need someone to at least hear my confession. I’ve helped kill more men than every murderer combined, but I swear I’m not as bad as I seem. Yes, I work for Big Tobacco and yes, I would have saved lives had I stayed at Philip Morris, but beyond that I am a goddamn human! Please, just for the life of me, keep reading!  
 

I hear it wheezing on the other side of the door and I fear nothing short of absolution will free me of this curse. The wheezing grows louder too, when I quit scribbling; it only quiets as I write. I don’t know what that thing is, exactly, but I do know one thing…  
 

I now understand how an advertising student could land such a sweet job within his first week of interning.  
 

I thought someone saw real potential in me, back then. It all felt like a Cinderella story, only written in smoke. There I was, just standing by the water cooler, trying to be invisible since I was nothing more than a lowly intern. I was simply a fly on the wall and my nonexistent paycheck reflected that fact. Somehow, though, I still got noticed.  
 

“Come on, Kid. Give us your opinion on the matter. How you feel about Philip Morris shooting for a smoke-free future? You know, with all this alternative garbage they’re producing now?”  
 

The old man looked at me expectantly and I gulped because I hadn’t even noticed him. Grizz had one of those faces that looked like it had never been hydrated and, even though my trainer was friendly enough, Grizz didn’t seem the type to be sociable to a degree that required a watering hole.  
 

Of course, he had come searching for his trainees as it turned out, but his attempt at workplace banter is what ultimately led to me being promoted far above someone at his pay grade. For that, I should have thanked him, but now I am suddenly realizing he’s also the reason I’m in this mess. Also, shit… I nearly forgot about the whole situation as I pondered. There was an acrid scent to the air for a moment, but it’s gone again. The wheezing remains, but it is low again and stays that way so long as I keep participating in word vomit.  
 

Sorry if I miss any key details to this confession, but hopefully once it’s out there for the world to see, I’ll be safe and I might answer any questions you have. As it is, I refuse to die like my predecessors. I’m the goddamn CEO of a company too exclusive for the Fortune 500, for Chrissake… but then again, I guess that in itself is the only reason why I find myself haunted. Hunted?  
 

Whatever…  
 

Anyway, point of the confession is to get it all out, so I’ll admit it: I never actually meant to author the line that launched me into the stratosphere. No, quite the opposite. Grizz asked me for an opinion and I simply gave him one. I told the old man that there were simply two types of people in the world.  
 

“People should either stop smoking or they should start.”  
 

Grizz had found my flippant remark hilarious and some of the suits at the water cooler frowned at us when he started laughing, like we were a lone pair of nihilists crashing a Pollyanna convention. I can’t swear that my former boss flew that zinger up the flagpole, but I can’t claim he didn’t either. Regardless of how it happened, though, my words made it all the way up the corporate food chain.  
 

Things got a little crazy from that point onwards.  
 

Firstly, I was fired from my unpaid internship with Philip Morris. They were trying to foster an environment where the belief was in a healthy tomorrow, despite the fact that they sold products that killed people. I guess I’m still a little salty about how they handled such a benign situation, but damn it… if I never left Philip Morris I probably never would have gotten poached by the company I am now working for. If I had just stayed quiet I never would have become an executive, sure, but I’d still be alive come morning too.  
 

As it stands, I’ve come to find out I’m the twenty-seventh Chief Executive Officer of a cigarette company that makes a product so lethal it can’t even be sold to the public. Yes, I know what you’re thinking and I get that this position isn’t part of the most morally stringent path to success, but it doesn’t mean I deserve to die anymore than the twenty-six that came before. It just means those that died smoking our cigarettes knew the risks. It’s not that I don’t mourn their deaths, either. I just do it in my own way, with a lot of alcohol consumption and pharmaceutical assistance.  
 

No, they knew that the strongest cigarette in existence had to be that much more dangerous. Hell, it was the whole point of my tag line I never meant to say. People SHOULD stop smoking. It’s not my fault that a lot of those people sought out something stronger to take their former cigarettes’ place.  
 

What began with HR meetings evolved into interviews for Advertising Executive and before I knew it I was neck deep in responsibility. Reports flew by our desks like they were written with invisible ink. Everyone in the company ignored the death tolls as our investigators updated them. We were all truly to blame, looking back, but in order for shit to roll downhill, I guess it has to start at the top first.  
 

Sorry if this next part gets a little harder to read by the way. I’ve left notes with my assistant telling him that I need a digital transcription of this letter made so that it might be uploaded for a mass audience, but I understand if Grizz has a hard time with it. I originally hired my old boss at double his former pay, despite his lack of relevant soft skills, because he reminded me of how fortunate I was. Now that I might actually need his help, I’m even more glad he’s here… because whether through guilt or gold, I’ve got his loyalty.  
 

If you’re the one having to write this, Gerald, I don’t blame you. My wrist is hurting something fierce and that thing that killed all the other executives has started gnashing its teeth on the other side of my office door. It’s like the creature wants vengeance more than it wants my admission; the sound of its teeth scraping assails my senses with the sound of a million lighters not quite catching a spark. I blame no one for this but myself, however.  
 

I didn’t have to answer your question, after all… and anyone can turn down a job for the right reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Grizz, I’m sorry I got you involved in this. For all I know, I’ll succeed in finishing this confession and you won’t even have to read this, but just know that I really didn’t mean to put you in harm’s way. Sure, I hired you after the first CEO had died, but it had been ruled a suicide. I didn’t gain the authority to access all of our restricted files until I had taken his office and as you know, that was many bodies later.  
 

Oh, and to whatever malignant cosmic force out there that’s doing this to me? Fuck you! I know I should feel guilty and I’ll take that burning shame with me into the grave, but that thing… that amalgamation of what appears to be cigarette butts and wet ash? I refuse to go out like that. Even as it stares at me, with sockets open as wide and as empty as I wished my doorway was now, I refuse to admit my fate.  
 

I’m responsible for the deaths of all those poor souls now trapped inside this hell beast. The smell of their lungs burning is this thing’s rancid breath and I am eternally sorry for their loved ones’ losses. The creature is so close now that I can read the brand names on the filters that compose its flesh, but still it doesn’t attack. I fear it senses my intent, but so long as I continue to admit my own culpability there still remains time enough.  
 

I knew it would eventually get into my office. The handgun is in the top drawer already. The bullets are loaded. Please post this, Gerald… Grizz, if I can be so informal a boss, here at the end of my reign. I’m taking blame for everything, but my death won’t be a cover up for something so much worse.  
 

If they offer you my job, Grizz, pass it up. If you discover the security logs I had pulled, have them destroyed. You were one of the best bosses and assistants a guy could ever "

apvhof,15,2019-02-12,Haven't heard from the company that gave me an offer for over a month. Is this normal?,saltshakercat,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/apvhof/havent_heard_from_the_company_that_gave_me_an/,"Hi everyone!

I'm gonna preface this with I am naturally a super anxious person. So it's probably nothing to worry about but of course I want to make sure. 

I got an internship offer from this company in December. Just before Christmas they sent me an enrollment certificate to fill out and asked for a copy of my passport. They also gave me the general company HR email and said ""feel free to reach out with any questions"". School was obviously closed over Christmas and I got the certificate signed in early January. Turns out my passport also expired in early January (that was definitely my bad). So I sent them an email saying I was waiting on my passport and I'd update them. 

Around 2 weeks later I send them another email since my school has asked for an official offer letter. I send an email saying I'm still waiting on the passport, give them a rough timeline and ask how long it will take to get an official letter after they receive my paperwork.

Fast forward to yesterday (like 3 weeks since my last email), I finally get my passport and send them everything. I say in my email to reply to make sure they didn't overlook it, and I also CC'd the normal HR email (I've been sending everything to the HR rep that was part of my interview).

I'm sure they've just been really busy and haven't been able to respond to my ""sorry I'm still working on the paperwork"" emails. I figure I should give them a little more time with my latest email, but I'm worried if I wait too long that I won't be able to get a visa and everything in time. If they don't respond still, I was thinking of trying to call the HR rep (I have her number) or the office location where I got the offer. I don't know if this is appropriate or how long to wait, though. Worth noting I'm in the US and they're in Germany, so I would have to use my parents landline to call so I don't get insane call charges. So that's kind of my last resort.

TLDR: Company that gave me offer has been totally silent since December. I'm worried if they're missing my emails I won't get a visa in time. What should I do?

UPDATE: As usual, I was freaking out over nothing. The HR rep replied today and said she'd update me when my contract was ready. So it worked out! Seems like they were just really busy. Thanks so much to everyone who answered :)"

In last year’s June I graduated from high school in the Netherlands and since then I am taking a gap year until I enroll in college September 2019. Currently I am doing volunteering work, learning Spanish and traveling through South America. I’ll come back in April which provides me with 5 months of spare time in which I’d love to do an internship or course, preferably in the United States.  

My passions include politics and economics (ideally the two disciplines combined). That’s why I would love to do an internship in an international organization or venture during my gap year, but I’m not sure if I’m eligible as I’m not enrolled in an academic institution yet. I know United Nations only takes university students, but I’m doubting to just cold-email them and show them my motivation. 

Does anyone maybe have any tips on where to search for an educating internship for a few months of my gap year, where I’ll learn more about the political/economical world and policymaking? Maybe tips on websites, organizations, what to do etc... All recommendations are welcome! I’m not sure what to do.

Thank you so much in advance! "

Basivally I have almost no CompSci EC but Japanese culture linked EC I put a lot of time in. Will this help or hurt me? What do yall think? I mentioned I got into a coding bootcamp but included no evidence of it though. Did not even put it in my EC list. That prob would have helped me lol.

I've applied to what feels like hundreds of internship applications and in reality I never expected to hear back from anyone. Surprisingly I am getting a few phone internship requests. However looking back at the descriptions of some of these financial analyst internships (corporate finance) I feel that I am laughably underqualified. I have basic knowledge of finance concepts (my school isn't all that great in terms of quality) and basic skills in excel (I'm a hands on learner so I won't get better unless I get real world experience). Should I still go through with a phone interview? I don't want to do so bad that I get blacklisted or anything like that.

I feel that if they start asking me technical questions, I won't be able to answer the majority of them."

Every time I've been at a company, programming has been over 90% frustrating, impossible, anxiety inducing. I never know what I'm doing, I rarely solve problems on my own, and if I do, I do it in at least 3x the amount of time I feel like it should take. I start avoiding my boss and coworkers, withdrawing, trying to pretend I'm fine and I'm learning but I just feel like I'm not cut out for it. I can't focus, I go home early, come in late, drink, take off sick, work from home, anything to avoid thinking about how I can't do the work I loved in school.

Any other programmers feel like this and overcome it? Am I incompetent or normal? What do I do?"

It's mid-february now and nothing has come.

Given that I've already contacted them, I don't want to seem pushy emailing them again about it. After I accepted their verbal offer I turned down 5+ telephone interviews and 3 final-round interviews. I thought the internship search was done.

apzpkf,2,2019-02-12,I recommended a friend to job I should've applied for.,myj147,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/apzpkf/i_recommended_a_friend_to_job_i_shouldve_applied/," 

I'm a junior in University studying  Mechanical Engineering. Engineering students live and die by their  internships, trying to get a full time position without one can be  terribly difficult. I have prepared and have been fortunate enough to  accept an internship for summer 2019.

During  my time as a student I came into contact with a smaller company's CEO.  After I explained my desire to land an internship he tried to help me by  giving me notices of various openings at his company. For a variety of  reasons, things never aligned and I never worked for his company.

Our  university career fair was this past week and my CEO friend was there. I  said hello and told him of my success of landing an internship with  another company for the summer. He was happy for me and said, ""too bad,  because we have a problem that a mechanical engineer could help us  with."" He asked for a recommendation and I gave him the resumee of one  of my friends.

After  speaking with said friend, it is a part time position that they are  looking to fill right now. Maybe I misunderstood and thought it was a  position for the coming summer. Maybe I'm just an idiot for not grabbing  the opportunity while it was in front of me. It has occurred to me that  maybe they wanted someone to work from now until the end of summer or  any other time.

Could it damage my relationship with the CEO if I email or call to say I'm interested even after I recommended somebody else? This would be a BIG deal for me. Should I try to roll the dice and get the position?"

&amp;#x200B;

Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

After living in the US for over 20 years, it seems very unlikely that I will ever have a chance to be an American citizen (I have tried for quite a while and paid a lot in lawyers already). I have studied everything from elementary school to getting a college degree in the US. I have a degree in Information Systems and I have studied a bit of computer science (on/off self study) so I understand the basics of programming.  I have done 2 internships (1 related to my field of study) and I have another 3 years of experience working in my field at 2 different companies w/ recommendations if needed from my colleagues.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been applying for jobs in various parts of the world but I haven't had too much luck unfortunately. Part of the reason could be that my name is hard to pronounce / people making assumptions that I wouldn't be able to speak properly. I would be very grateful to hear some advice / suggestions on things I can change / learn so recruiters may at least contact me to discuss potential opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

My citizenship/passport is from India, tho it is hard for me to call anything besides America home since I have literally lived here for most of my life. I am currently allowed to stay in the US but my case is a bit complicated. I am not here illegally if people are curious.

Thank you

aq0l76,3,2019-02-12,Is it normal to rely on copying code?,Rjhusein3,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/aq0l76/is_it_normal_to_rely_on_copying_code/,"I don't mean with everything, obviously, but with some things? I've been learning programming via online tutorials for two years while I get a degree in Computer Information Systems. I've recently started focusing on Java, specifically Web Development with Spring. I needed to sort a LinkedHashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt; in descending order by the value. 

The solution I came up with was moving the values to two arrays, and as I sorted the Integer array, I would change the same elements in the String array. I knew this was a terrible solution, so I googled an answer and found this solution from Javacodegeeks.com:

        Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; sortedMap = unsortedMap
            .entrySet()
            .stream()
            .sorted(comparingByValue())

                    LinkedHashMap::new));

I can read this, and after reading the explanation I understand how it works and what exactly is happening, but I'm concerned that I would never come up with a solution like this. I don't even know that I could copy it from memory.

I've recently started looking for internships and entry level jobs, so I've been reflecting on my skill level recently. Is this type of code normally what people can come up with off the top of their heads?"

——————————

$400,000.

After all of the letters were sorted and opened, that was the total sum of money sent in.  All checks, $1000 each, from various banks around California.

We also had roughly six pounds of flayed human skin.

The police took everything, of course; the obvious assumption was whoever sent us the packages committed mass murders and robbery, but that didn’t feel right to me.  It wouldn’t make sense that there were virtually no reports of murders or bank accounts being drained leading up to this point.  While it’s true that it had only been a few days since the broadcast, surely at least one body would have been discovered? 

I’m sort of ashamed to admit this, but I was quite resentful towards the police for taking all that money.  I understand it was evidence, but it could have saved me from my financial situation.  Judging by the morale around the office in the days following the mail incident, I was far from the only one harboring these feelings.  That money would have been more than enough for Rick to pay for his son’s medical bills, not to mention a lot of the other employees who were in a tight spot.

Regardless, the atmosphere at the station returned to what can almost be described as normalcy.  The network President issued a statement to the media claiming the broadcast was some indie horror flick who’s signal accidentally mixed in with ours, which explained how we wound up on channel 12.  An obvious lie to those on the inside, but the general public seemed to eat it up for the most part.  

That all changed when the medical reports started occurring.

I arrived at the station on Thursday before Rick, which was quite unusual.  The only time that tended to happen was if his son needed to be driven into the doctor to deal with his heart problem.  I made a mental note to check in on them later in the day, and went to oversee the taping of episode #6 of “Wow, They Juggle That?”, which had to have been one of the worst talent shows to ever violate the airwaves.  It’s no wonder we were out of money.  

Regardless, taping was going smoothly until I got pulled away by my secretary, a college intern named Brendan.  Brendan was a smart kid, studying to go into television writing.  He never interrupted me on set unless it was important.  Apparently I had a phone call regarding an urgent matter.  Curious, I took the cell phone being offered to me and stepped out of the sound stage.  

Rick was on the other end.

He sounded frantic, as though he was out of breath.  He told me that he had to bring his kid into the doctor this morning, but found something peculiar upon arriving.  The waiting room was filled with such a large quantity of people that one could barely walk to the reception desk, let alone hear their name being called.  What was strange is that everyone seemed to be there for the same reason:

People were missing chunks of their skin.

Rick was able to ask some of the people what was going on.  Allegedly, all the reports are the same.  Everyone woke up on Friday morning, went about their day, and fell asleep in front of their television.  While all of the patients claimed that, from then on, they slept through the night like normal, the family and friends with some of the people had a different story to tell.  Apparently, the patients did not fall asleep at all, but, upon watching “some weird horror show”, proceeded to locate the nearest knife, pair of scissors, box cutter, razor blade, or sharp object of any sort, and methodically remove a small chunk of their own skin before isolating themselves in the closest confined space.  Apparently, not one single person made any sort of noise while cutting themselves.  The following morning, the patients were acting as though nothing had happened.

I can still remember nearly every word of Rick’s account.  The notion that an individual would willingly do that to themselves sent a shiver down my spine, until an even more sinister thought left me frozen to the ground where I stood:

Tomorrow would mark one week since the premier of “The Gifts of the Masses”, meaning that episode two was allegedly airing sometime in the next 24 hours.  I explained my anxiety to Rick, who was certain that the president was going to make sure ClearGlimpse airwaves were secure, but, to be frank, I had my doubts.  Since Rick’s son was going to be with a friend tomorrow, the two of us decided to meet up and watch for any rogue broadcasts together after work.  Don’t ask me what we were trying to accomplish.  If I’m being honest, I just wanted someone I could trust nearby to ease my fear.  

Friday was fairly uneventful at the station.  I found myself catching up on paperwork for most of the morning.  Truth is, I was struggling to focus on anything substantial, as I couldn’t stop thinking about the possibility of another episode of “The Gifts of the Masses”.

Yes, I knew that the network president assured that it was not going to happen.

I knew the police were in deep with their investigation.

But what if that wasn’t enough?

As soon as work was over, Rick and I headed back to my apartment.  We both cracked open beers that neither of us really wanted, and sat in silence switching between Channel 67 and Channel 12.  We didn’t come across anything odd, and I guess all of the worrying I had been doing that week had made me tired as I quickly fell asleep.  

It was dark outside when I woke up.  Looking at the clock, I saw that two hours had passed.  Rick was asleep on the couch, and the television was turned to some sappy sitcom on Channel 12.  I decided to let Rick sleep, but went to change the channel to something watchable.  As soon as I bent down to pick up the remote, I got a text on my phone from a coworker.  The message was short, yet still managed to make all of my hair stand up on end:

 “Check Channel 8”

Without missing a beat, I frantically switched the channel to 8, and was greeted with a title card for “The Gifts of the Masses”.  It looked as though we had missed the intro.  I nudged Rick awake, who instantly jumped up upon seeing what was on the TV set.  We decided to take notes on the broadcast to see if we could puzzle something together, so I frantically got us both pens and paper before sitting back down.

The title card faded to black, and a distorted version of the Claire de Luna began to faintly play in the background, as though the mic was accidentally recording a radio.  The background looked to be some sort of dilapidated warehouse, as a whole manner of broken machinery was strewn about the floor.  A figure in a bright red and yellow clown suit walked into center frame, and turned to face the camera.  It became apparent that the clown wasn’t actually wearing makeup, but a mask in addition to the costume; likely an attempt to hide their identity.  The music cut out, and the clown began to speak:

“Welcome to tonight’s episode! My name is Lucky the Clown, and I like to juggle!!”

The clown pulled out three large knives from pockets on his costume, and began to juggle them with ease.  The camera slowly zoomed in on him until just his face was visible.  He then asked the viewers a question; one that still gives me chills just thinking about it:

“Do you wanna see what else I can do with these knives?”

The camera zoomed back out, and the clown exited to the left of the frame.  Nothing happened for around 15 seconds or so, except for the audio seemingly cutting in and out.  Eventually, the clown came back into frame, dragging a young man with him.  The man’s hands and feet were bound, and duct tape was covering his mouth.   He wasn’t wearing any clothes, and was visibly bruised on his torso.   The Clown threw him into an old rickety metal chair that was lying in the background, and turned to the camera.

“Now old Lucky here is gonna show all you good little boys and girls at home a magic trick! This right here is my assistant, Jamie! Everyone say hi to Jamie! Now, I want everyone to watch me very closely, because I’m going to make Jamie’s skin disappear!”

Jamie let out a cry as the clown began to laugh.  The bastard took one of the knives, and began to slowly cut into Jamie’s ankle. 

Even with the duct tape, the screams were chilling.

Eventually, the Clown moved the knife to Jamie’s genitalia.  The Claire de Luna began to play again as the Clown proceeded to flay his victim’s skin.  This sickening event lasted for around a minute.

Eventually, the clown stood up, and threw Jamie onto the ground.  The clown turned to the camera and took a dramatic bow.

“Thank you for watching Lucky the Clown! Remember to tune in next week, and send your fan mail to the following address!”

The bastard gave out the ClearGlimpse station address.

The clown bent down over Jamie, brandishing the knife one last time.  We could still hear his screams as the broadcast feed cut out.

I didn’t sleep well that night.

I got a call from Rick around 8:00am the following morning.  He seemed oddly hyper, and I asked him if he was alright.  

He told me that, apparently, he was able to find pictures of the warehouse from last night’s broadcast based on the background of the episode.  He had dug around online with a friend of his, and they came up with the filming location.  

Rick told me that he wanted to go check it out.    

I told him that we should just call the police, but he told me that he wanted us to see it for ourselves before we told anyone about it.  I tried to ask him why, but he wasn’t giving me any information.  All I knew was, if he was going to go, I wanted to tag along to make sure nothing happened to him.  

I asked him when he felt like heading over.  He responded with a ferocity I had never heard in him before:

“Tonight.  Bring a gun.” "

I am currently in a conundrum with my job. I have been an intern with my current employer since Summer 2017, and just recently got hired full-time in October. To give a quick overview of what my issue is, here is a numbered list of pros/cons:

**Pros**

- Pay is average or slightly above average for my area.
- The employer is a Fortune 500 company.
- They have great benefits, including a 401k match and they pay for roughly 95% of graduate-school tuition expenses, which I am currently taking advantage of having recently started in an MBA program.
- My superiors, despite not listening to my feedback and concerns, are very nice people that I get along well with

**Cons**

- From day one, I have had little to no work to do on a day-to-day basis. Some days I literally sit at my desk on my phone all day, even after constantly asking for work to do.
- When I do get work, it is mind-numbingly pointless (ie, copy/pasting between spreadsheets for hours at a time)
- Despite my constant prying, I keep getting placed in the wrong department (this company uses a system where you rotate departments every so often until you reach several years at the company). My major can most closely be described as a “Research Analyst” / “Qualitative Analyst”, and yet for every single rotation I’ve done they’ve thrown me into IT departments that force me to do more IT work than the previous assignment. I did not go to school for IT, nor do I have any interest in working in the field.
- When I bring up my concerns (which have gotten very blunt as of late), my superiors brush it off by saying “we don’t want you to feel like that, why don’t you like IT if you’ve been in it the entire time?” This is essentially the response that I’ve gotten for every single one-on-one.

Now you may be asking, “Why did you take the job in October if this has been going on for so long?” The reason is that I couldn’t find a job anywhere else. I put out roughly 50 applications. Only three of them ever replied to me, and they all rejected me at the final step of the interview process.

I guess what I’m trying to ask is, what would you do in this situation? The work itself leaves me miserable almost every day, but I’m torn on what to do because not many employers would pay 95% of my tuition. That, and because I don’t know if I’d be able to find a job elsewhere. And I don’t have a lot of time to decide what to do as my lease is up in May, and with my boyfriend and I both in jobs that we despise I don’t know if we’d be able to stand it for another year.

Hypothetically speaking if I were to stay for another year and complete 90% of the MBA program, and then left, how bad would the consequences potentially be? I am not obligated contractually to stay after the completion of the degree.

Like seemingly every college student in 2019, I'm interested in machine learning and robotics, and the biggest reason I applied was because a PhD student I had wanted to work with at my former school recently became an assistant professor here.

I personally do like the Math major and its flexible curriculum, but I am concerned that a Math degree would adversely affect my prospects of graduate school admissions or finding internships. I did take data structures and computer architecture at my former school, and do hope for the opportunity to take algorithms, operating systems, and maybe a databases course if I do attend UIUC.

Perhaps this is an irrational concern, but can any Math majors interested in computing/software/related fields who aren't CS+Math comment on what challenges, if any, I might expect to face if I don't have CS in the name of my degree?

Thanks in advance."

Come mid-january I heard nothing so I contacted them to follow up and they said they hope to have the start dates and employment docs confirmed early feburary. It's mid-february now and i've heard nothing.

Given that I've already contacted  them, I don't want to seem pushy emailing them again about it. After I  accepted their verbal offer I turned down 5+ telephone interviews and 3  final-round interviews. I thought the internship search was done. I was  happy because it meant I didn't have to pay more travel expenses for  traveling to companies for interviews. But now it seems like it was a  foolish move.

Is this a sign that I'm going to get ghosted/offer withdrawn?"

I've been in the process of breaking into machine learning engineering for a little over a year. Grad work went deeply into representation theory and geometric analysis, so I know plenty of linear algebra. Taught stats at a couple of colleges during the PhD, so that's taken care of. I've peeked at a couple of standard ML books like Bishop, Hastie, and so forth. Learning ML from them will not be difficult, but learning it to a mathematician's standards will take months.

I came into this with no coding experience. By practicing on LeetCode and HackerRank, I got comfortable enough with Python to code up a U-Net style architecture in PyTorch, train it on GPUs on an EC2 instance, and get decent performance metrics for a rapidly prototyped pipeline.

I've learned enough about programming to see why software engineering is hard. I still haven't learned design patterns, distributed system design, production level code for deployment, or understanding how code works at the hardware level.

My understanding is that ML engineers are supposed to be part software engineer, part mathematician/statistician, part data engineer. However, I'm getting conflicting signals from companies, friends, and the internet about an employable skillset.

(1) What is an actual employable skillset for an ML engineer? If you're an ML engineer, why were you hired?

(2) Where should I look to break in? Should I intern somewhere? Should I get an entry-level programming position and look for software dev experience? Or should I go back to school for a Master's in CS?"

My graduating GPA is 3.3 and I’m fully aware I am not and will never be the best programmer in any room with smart programmers.  My only internship is from a local company building their website and a few other small programming tasks. I currently have a job offer and I am not sure if I should take it or try and aspire for more. I should also mention I have wrestled with mental illness thought my time in college and that is a major factor in my confidence in being able to secure and keep a good programming job. Lastly, I don’t have the most urgent need to start making money, but it’s still necessary I start making money soon.

The offer only pays 70k and has a reputation for working their employees very hard. According to some online, 45-50 hours a week is the unofficial expected minimum and the workload can reach into the weekends too during high workload periods. In addition to the poor pay to hourly work ratio, I worry the long hours will not leave me much time to apply to other jobs, attend interviews etc. It’s also in a location that I don’t care for.  

I have been grinding Leetcode on and off for about 6 months and have solved a little over 100 questions. I recently had a set of unsuccessful final round interviews with a Big N company and the experience has shown my current skill level would be something like “can get the job if lucky with the technical questions.” I had asked other applicants the questions they got and was able to solve most of them even if it was my first time seeing them. Unfortunately the questions I got during the interview were more obtuse and difficult and I couldn’t crack them well enough. Despite this, this experience has partially left me thinking I could objectively do better than the offer I currently have.   

With all of the above said my questions are-

Is it worth it to start a first job with subpar pay, long hours, where I probably won’t be happy just to get experience? I’m also curious, how much work experience does it take before you are no longer considered for entry level jobs? I worry that if I stay, for example, a year at this job and then start applying to others I will be considered for roles which require more experience and will face tougher standards and interviews effectively lowering my chances at getting a job I really want.  

Is it worth grinding Leetcode for another couple of months while applying to places so that I land an offer that I am actually happy with and will put me on the career trajectory I actually want to be on?

Is it true that starting salary at one company will have an effect on how much other companies offer me?

Finally, given what I described about myself specifically, do I have the right to demand more? Are my abilities and capacities in line with someone who should command a 100k+ salary for a first job? I worry if I don’t accept this job, I will be setting myself up for a long string of rejections and I will end up regretting not taking the offer I currently have.  "

Currently my responsibilities are very low and I'm not learning any skills that I can transfer over to another job.

I'm now starting to realize that it is hard to look for something better while already working. Every interview process starts with a phone call usually 30 min to an hour which I would have to take during work. Then after the phone calls rounds come interviews, which would require me to take off half a day at least, but I've had interviews that literally last 5 hours, jumping around getting interviewed by each member of the team. Then some application require references, but I can't really use my current employer because that'd tip them off I'm looking to move out.

&amp;#x200B;

So I applied for a software development engineer internship this summer at FANG (facebook, amazon, netflix, google, etc). I went through the interview process, etc and was made an offer. I see that the offer is contingent on ""the successful completion of a background check."" My question is for those of you who have worked in HR at a top tech company, or handled hiring in a software related discipline (not sure if the practices are different across disciplines, that's why I specify software). What are the chances of the company rescinding my offer based on the following? I'm expecting the background check to return a disorderly conduct (plead down from something else), underage possession of alcohol, and misdemeanor theft (plead down from something else). All of these will be 4ish years old at the time of the check.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really like to work at this company, but I don't want to accept the offer and then find out a month before I start that they don't want me. I have an offer from another smaller company that won't do a check, but I'd prefer the first company. Would it be a mistake to, before I accept their offer, setup a call with the first company and inform them of my background and ask if they're still interested in hiring me?

I've worked really hard to get my life together and to get where I am now, and I really don't want my past to ruin this opportunity for me. I appreciate everyone's input/advice!"

Like the title says, I graduated school in May 2018 and have been really struggling to get any footing with agencies since then. Unfortunately I wasn’t aware of how important internships were so as a result I don’t have much experience outside of on campus opportunities and in class projects. Initially I was applying to graduate internships and general internships in the hope of filling that experience gap before moving back to Chicago, but I was unsuccessful with those applications. As time went on I just moved to applying for normal entry level jobs in account services and media roles, but most of the entry level positions usually say 1-3 or 3-5 years experience. Which is a bit wild if you ask me. 

I have sent cover letters, tailored my resume to jobs, and also done a couple pretty big resume revamps throughout my search, and I feel like it looks really good for my current lack of experience, but I still barely get any calls back for interviews and most of my applications go unanswered. 

I have done a lot to get my name out there as well, like messaging recruiters on linked and asking friends and family to introduce me to people they know. Unfortunately these interactions tend to go nowhere and most of the messages and emails I send out are ignored. 

I have been reading a lot on here as well as /r/advertising and have been more proactive with applying early and often to jobs and companies I am passionate about with little success. 

In addition the only jobs I’m being contacted for is sales and direct marketing which ends up translating to an entrepreneurial door to door role that honestly sounds miserable. 

I guess my questions at this point are what else can I do to get my name out there and potentially get noticed? Is it time to just give up and say this industry isn’t for me? I really want to be in account services and I know I’d do a great job, it’s just so hard to get in the door at most places. Thanks in advance for reading and any advice you guys can give. "

I have created a reddit account to find help in my job reaching quest. I am asking you to upvote this post – to attract attention to this post because finding job has become more than a goal to me. I am a bit confused here – but I will try to set out my case as clear as it is possible. Currently I live in Russia and I am willing to move to any English-speaking country. I am mostly looking for job opportunities within the Atlantic Immigration Pilot program but honestly any other job offers outside of Russia are welcomed. There is a limitation though – I have an elderly cat (who is ready for transportation and have all the required documents) and that is why I can’t participate if we have to part. We spend too much lifetime together, so looking for new owners for my cat will feel like treason.

 Why am I so eager to find job outside of Russia? I am almost 30 and here it means constant pressure from the people that surround me and are endlessly bothered by the fact of me not having any children of husband. For some reason not having husband is a huge issue here. I am bisexual and my relationships with girls tend to end on their need “to create a normal family”. So homophobia and heteronormativity are sharing the number one place in my imagined list of why do I need to leave. That is exactly why I am using the new email here – so I wouldn’t ad more pressure and judgment on myself. I like working – I enjoy challenges and I have been promoted multiple times. Sometimes I have multiple jobs at the same time since my paying rate as a female in this country usually is smaller than the male worker in the similar position. Even though I work hard and bring positive results I am always considered to be liability – because women are expected to go on maternity leave. I love the idea of having children but I am not planning to become a parent at least within the nearest 5 years, and besides, children are not considered like some sort of kryptonite outside of Russia. And then there are those”little things” like the economics that is just getting worse unless you are already super-rich or being unable to speak freely all this tiny little details that matters. As you might notice – I can’t be considered a refugee. At least right now and honestly I hope to leave before anything that terrible is going to happen. But that is not the only reason. I can work and I want to find a job. I am actually good at working hard and reaching goals. I have recommendations from all of my previous workplaces. If you need more details and more information about my motivation about why it is so important for me to leave this place I can answer you through email. I can send my CV and certificates to all the interested parties. I keep on sending my CV through linked in even though it haven’t brought me any positive result.

 /My rating is not enough to show a screenshot of job vacancies in linkedin, but I can send it to you personally. I sent more than 900 applications./

I have been sending my CV emails to various Canadian companies –so if you are from Canada you might have already received some of them (since there were more than 300 hundred of this letters). According to Atlantic Immigration Pilot program requirements – I may search for an HR position, but this doesn’t mean that I am not able to do other duties. Unfortunately my current English level B1-B2 is not enough to teach English, though my experience shows that language environment significantly increases my progress. I am ready to work in any field as long as my duties are legitimate. Work with the documents as an HR and then help you as a personal assistant or babysit your kids after that? No problem. Work for 12 hours every day with a whole bunch of additional duties and tasks on the minimum wage – I can handle it. I am not the genius programmer or an amazing surgeon but I am not afraid of hard work. I promise to do my best and become your model employee if you are willing to take me in I can prove it and prepared to develop the minimum level of required skill within 2-3 weeks. If you know some company or somebody who might need my service, or perhaps some long term internships and other programs that allows my pet to come with me I would be very grateful. It doesn’t have to be strictly Canada and nothing else - EVERY English speaking country will do. I promise to work hard and be the best. Here is my email:  [iwanttogetajob27@gmail.com](mailto:iwanttogetajob27@gmail.com)Thank you for reading this."

I've noticed working out more and getting more sleep helps a lot - but it's been a struggle keeping track of all that in addition to being a full time student with two internships and a job.

Secondly, at some point they must expect me to know something. I figure theyd presume I'd be able to figure it all out on my own and wonder why they even hired me if I seem to need to be told what or how to do it.

I had an internship before with a former teacher, and he wanted me to learn the whole physical network of the sites he worked at, along with a lab environment.

Was wondering what people thought of this, if it is do-able or not.  I heard the 53 with the new teacher is a lot of work, and I took 178 with Ihler it was very do-able, but this class looks a little more complex subject wise.  I don't know what to expect from Singh's 175 at all in terms of workload/difficulty.

I'm also quite worried that I won't have time to study for interviews in the summer b/c of internship and this spring schedule will not allow me much time for interview prep either, so all the sudden sept is going to roll around and I have been busy with other stuff and not prepping leetcode the last 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

I am graduating from a computer engineering program in June. I have the opportunity to work at C1 at the Plano office. I am also interviewing for internship programs, and some full time at some Big N companies.

&amp;#x200B;

My eventual goal is to work in graphics (all of my technical electives, as well as some graduate classes and research have been into graphics) and specifically in video games. I know C1 has nothing to do with this, but it seems like it might be a good place to work at while I'm in the master's program, compared to 60 hours/week at a lot of the big companies.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is will this end up biting me later to not work at some place doing graphics/C++ development now (if I can even get into one as it seems like game companies aren't hiring new grads really), or should I just try and find something a little bit more related to graphics or systems programming instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"

However, it seems that doing well in school (several publications, multiple internships and research assistantships, good GPA, etc.) isn't helping me much to get that first position.  People seem to prefer hiring either new graduates, or candidates with 5-10 years experience.

Having not had much recent experience, I'm aiming for a junior dev position somewhere where I can work with a lead or team who I can bounce questions off of while I get up to speed.

I'm working on getting psyched up to hit leetcode and hacker rank, or take some courses on udacity, or start a github account and work on any of a few different projects I have in mind to get fresh experience.  I haven't used nearly any industry tools mentioned in job posts, just the languages.

I send out resumes through indeed on occasion that seem to fall into an abyss, but nowhere near the hundreds I hear people in /r/cscareerquestions are sending.

I've starting lurking this subreddit for hope and for ideas.  I'm trying to network more at local meetup events.  So far my only interview came from giving my resume to a stranger I met selling PC parts on craigslist.  They liked me but gave the job to more experienced candidates.

I'm currently a freshman in my university and I'm in my second semester. I came into my university with a lot of AP credits and after some careful scheduling, I realized that I can graduate in three years as a computer science major. However, if I choose to minor in math as well, I would have to spend another year and graduate in four years. Thus, I was wondering if the math minor is even worth it. I'm paying about 15k a year at my university. Does the math minor justify the cost? Does it justify the extra time I'll sacrifice? Is it even useful in the industry?

Some things about me:

\-I'm not sure exactly which field in CS I want to go into . I've been pretty interested in the field of bioinformatics.

\-I hate exams with a passion but I'm a great self-learner.

\-I finished Calc 1, Calc 2, Discrete Math 1, and Intro Linear Algebra (I kind of enjoyed all except Calc 2)

\-I didn't get an internship for this summer. I think I'll be able to land one next summer.

\-I participated in four hackathons and created some interesting projects at them. One of which won an award.

I know typically math overlaps with CS but the CS requirements and the math minor requirements are pretty large to begin with here. Some math electives I was planning on taking for the math minor were Combinatorics, Graph Theory, Linear Optimization, and Discrete and Probabilistic Models in Biology. I already and am currently taking the CS department's discrete math courses which cover basic combinatorics, basic graph theory, basic probability, etc.

Another option I considered was to spend the fourth year taking graduate courses in CS and some bs classes for fun.

So what do you all suggest I do?"

\- It will be harder for me to get hired at a competitive/""more cultured"" company now that I'm no longer a fresh grad, because they don't want to have to pay me higher due to my experience (from what I've heard).

Like what each neighbourhood is? Or link me to something? Im trying to figure out the city before hand so I can figure where to look for a place to live, somewhere not too far from my work. Ill be working on Science Park Road. so I think the green line and orange MRT lines go through there, but then there is still some walking to do. To live, I have been looking at areas like Bukit Merah, Buona Vista and in between that general area as I have been told that quite central.

My budget for rent is pretty low: about S$1000. Can I find a room at least with this budget? In a condo maybe?

    IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE!
    
    Importing the multiarray numpy extension module failed.  Most
    likely you are trying to import a failed build of numpy.
    Here is how to proceed:
    - If you're working with a numpy git repository, try `git clean -xdf`
      (removes all files not under version control) and rebuild numpy.
    - If you are simply trying to use the numpy version that you have installed:
      your installation is broken - please reinstall numpy.
    - If you have already reinstalled and that did not fix the problem, then:
      1. Check that you are using the Python you expect (you're using C:\Users\VU\Anaconda2\envs\ronviz\python.exe),
         and that you have no directories in your PATH or PYTHONPATH that can
         interfere with the Python and numpy versions you're trying to use.
      2. If (1) looks fine, you can open a new issue at
         https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues.  Please include details on:
         - how you installed Python
         - how you installed numpy
         - your operating system
         - whether or not you have multiple versions of Python installed
         - if you built from source, your compiler versions and ideally a build log
    
         Note: this error has many possible causes, so please don't comment on
         an existing issue about this - open a new one instead.
    
    Original error was: DLL load failed: Kan opgegeven module niet vinden.

I've been trying to fix this myself to further my understanding and improving my problemsolving skills, but it has been two days of trial and error without results (previously numpy was working in the environment, but now it doesn't). To give you an idea of my Python knowledge: I'm a novice level python programmer and just completed some introductory courses on python basics, matplotlib, pandas, seeborn and have taught myself some interesting things along the way.

So I decided to come to the Reddit community cause I know you are the fastest community in solving any question I throw at you. Also this is my first time on the r/learnpython sub, hope you guys don't bite!

First, let me fill everyone in on my education/work back-story leading up to today. I’m a 27/M, with an AS (associate in science degree) in Computer Networking, which I received back in 2012. After completing my 2 –year college degree, I was feeling burnt out, and my passion for IT dwindled compared to when I first began my education. This brings me to seeking something different job-wise, however, after college I still needed to find a job, and asap. Fast forward to today, and I have a background in the hospitality industry. It’s in high demand in the Miami area, wherein I have resided for a majority of my life, so picking up a job was easy. I’ve been working 5+ years as a bellhop particularly. Now as you can see, I got too comfortable in my job. I never thoroughly considered my future, and as a result, lost track of myself and time. Granted, I’ve dealt with some motivational/life issues along the way which were holding me back mentally, but I’m not here to make excuses. Simply put, I’m taking a rejuvenated approach and want to take my career and life more serious. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here we stand today. Going back into the IT field is still my desire, although I’m no longer interested in the network administrator path. In fact, I would love to go back to school and pursue a BA in Computer Science, and this is exactly what I believe should be my next step. After extensive thought and research, I’m legitimately interested in pursuing a career in Web Design. I believe it falls more in line within my interests, and personality. Ideally though, I would like to pick up an IT job immediately. It can be entry level, internship, volunteer, anything is better than nothing. Essentially I put myself in a tough spot though because, my work experience is very narrow, not to mention, in a completely different field. On top of that, it’s been almost 7 years since I completed my degree, and since then, I have yet to obtain any real work experience in IT. It also doesn’t help that my resume shows that I’ve settled for an entry level position (Bellman) for an extended period of time with no advancement. So this brings me here, I need help and would appreciate any feedback. I also have a couple follow-up questions…

&amp;#x200B;

1. Assuming I land a job interview, how would I best explain this period of stagnation in my work history?

2. Should I even attempt pursuing an entry level IT job in my current state, or is it best to focus on finishing my education?

3. Are there any extra steps or recommendations you would recommend me to do?

I do recognize that  I am slightly behind the group that was able to apply for work before graduation, however I was in an abnormal living situation and had no idea where I was going to be after graduating. 

Within these past few months I’ve put in over forty applications and I’ve only received 2 responses which showed interest that ended up being Muli-Level Marketing bait and switch schemes. 

During my college education, two of the classes allowed me to take real life businesses and consult for their online presence, including their social media and website. This adds up to about a year of experience, that isn’t exactly work level experience, but it is more than not having the experience at all. Something I do notice is the “1-2 years of experience required” for almost anything including some internships (which I have also been applying for.)

I like the idea of strategy management (and a couple other business specialties) because of the opportunity to apply for jobs right out of college with 40-60k starting salary, having senior friends who are applying for such jobs. At the same time the job seems enjoyable with diversity in where I could work and what I could work on. There is also the option to get a masters which would still only take an additional two or three years. I love the idea of being able to start my life of being financially independent as well as my career sooner. The other option I’m considering is becoming a clinical psychologist/neuropsychologist. This would require 4 years of grad school or psyD school minimum plus an internship and even then supervised hours are required before I could even think about applying for any jobs. And grad school would also put me in some debt, not much, but some and I would not be making much money at all, possibly 20k for that time with stipends and a possible TA job. And the stress of grad school also seems terrible, from completing a thesis to odd hours in a lab (with research being something I enjoy but am not passionate about). The reason I would still consider this is because I would love to be a clinical psychologist. I love what I am learning as a neuro major and want to learn more. I also love the idea of helping people who are struggling with mental illness which is something I believe I would be passionate about and enjoy doing. Not to mention I would enjoy being called “Doctor” (it is not a major reason I like this career path, just a nicety). I believe I would command more respect in this position, but the road to get there scares me and it will take a very long time. Another down side of this career path is I don’t know how much I could make. I would like to make enough to live a comfortable life wherever I want and while I realize I would not be poor by any means as a clinical psychologist, I’m not sure if it would be enough so that financial concerns aren’t always a major stressor on my life. I realize this is an odd question, but if anyone has had a similar experience or can share any insight I would be very appreciative since I have been struggling with this choice for a while."

After I graduated they are willing to offer me full time offer, but since I have no experience I am getting paid 35k+10k bonus per year. 

Meanwhile my uncle has an offer for me in company y where I will be essentially putting up 3-4 years if fake experience and working. He claims that since most of the people working there are his friends they will help me out even though 4 years of experience is expected. Since it's a higher position they pay is 60-65k per year. 

I am really really worried if I should for y or x. My parents say I should just go for the higher pay job and not worry about the shady stuff since my uncle will take care of it. Me being the pathetic young adult that I am I have no idea how to decide. Any form of help will be much appreciated. "
aqmd4p,3,2019-02-14,CS - King's vs Manchester vs Warwick,OfficialHR,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/aqmd4p/cs_kings_vs_manchester_vs_warwick/,"Hi.

I am planning to study Computer Science next year. I have received conditional offers and am unsure on which university to choose as my firm.

|University|Maths|Physics|
|:-|:-|:-|
|King's College London|A|A|
|University of Manchester|A\*|A|
|University of Warwick|A|A|
|University of Queen Mary|B|B|

All the universities require a Distinction/Distinction\* for IT (BTEC Subsidiary Diploma), which I have received.

I am thinking of making my insurance **Queen Mary** (but if you suggest otherwise I am willing to listen).

Between the 3 main choices, which is the best for Computer Science? Using [the complete university guide league table](https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?s=Computer+Science) I see that the rankings are:

|Rank|University|
|:-|:-|
|5th|University of Warwick|
|9th|University of Manchester|
|20th|King's College London|

Using just this table **Warwick** would be the best choice. But I have been constantly told by my parents and sister that I **King's** is the best option but I currently like **Manchester** the most.

I recently went on a visiting day to **Manchester** and really like the university. I like the atmosphere there, the societies they have and the area it is located. I am going on a visiting day to **Warwick** next month so I should have probably waited until then to make this post but I need the help right now. I am pretty confused for **King's** because [here](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/visit/undergraduate-open-days/index.aspx) it says that bookings open March 2019 but [here](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/visit/undergraduate-open-days/which-open-day.aspx) it says the open days are in June and September. I get that it might mean the ability to book for an open day is in March 2019 but the actual open days are later so for now I am just going to assume they start in June, which is past the UCAS deadline for choosing a firm and insurance.

I definitely want to live in accommodation for **at least** the first year. From my limited research I can see that **King's** is the most expensive in terms of the cost of living since it is in London. Both **Warwick** and **Manchester** seem to have a decent cost of living. **Manchester** is the best for the location of accommodation. **Warwick** and **King's** aren't as desirable in terms of location. **Manchester** and **King's** are both around or near populated areas whereas **Warwick** seems isolated.

In terms of scholarships &amp; bursaries, **King's** seems to be the best, with **Warwick** in second place and **Manchester** in third place. **King's** seems to have the most opportunities for scholarships.

**Manchester** is currently my favourite but **King's** and **Warwick** are apparently more well known and are looked at as better than **Manchester** from an employers point of view, which is much more important in the long term than saving some money in the short term.

I would appreciate any and all information you can give. What do you think is my best choice?

Also, if anyone could give me some information about placement years and internships etc, I would be very grateful."

First IT job. After 5 months, they informed us that they would be closing down the program and that we interns would get 1st pick if we applied to the full-time, tier 2 position. I got the full-time position, be here almost 3 months. In total, it's been almost 8 months

I feel like I was thrown into the fire, both as an intern and full-time. We have a lot of proprietary systems and issues that certs and finding on Google is impossible. Our training was a joke, not enough time to go over the systems. So, in turn, I ask questions, maybe 1-3 a day because it seems like it's always something new happening. 

I feel like a burden when I have to ask questions and can't solve issues on my own

Is this normal for the given length in time?"
aqn5ky,5,2019-02-14,Worth it?,-_disabled_-,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/aqn5ky/worth_it/,"Alright. So I'm a high school junior. Decent grades, decent GPA, crazy competitive school. Recently I've had a lot of people telling me that I'm not going to ever get into my top pick schools, especially with the major I want to go into (Computer Science/ Biomedical Engineering/ Software Engineering). I'm starting to wonder if it's even worth it to apply considering my standing within my class, which is by no means bad, but not great for my school's size either. Should I apply to those schools during my senior year? Or should I start aiming lower and finding schools that I would actually definitively get into? (Examples of colleges I'm looking at: University of Texas, Texas A&amp;M (I realize this one isn’t near as competitive as the others, but still more competitive than Texas State and other colleges like that), Vanderbilt, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, etc.) 

Edit: I’m working on getting registered for the ACT and have already taken the SAT (1390), but I’m taking another and practicing for it this time, so that should help. My GPA is currently a 4.56, and I’m fairly close to top 10% (we are a small private school with only 30 kids per grade, so it’s easy to get knocked out of the top spots). We don’t do class rank at our school besides the top 2 in the grade. I’ve also been working on internships, and have STEM leadership roles, such as robotics team captain. "
aqn79k,4,2019-02-14,I hate cheaters,ResidentWeenie,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/aqn79k/i_hate_cheaters/,"Today was my second day at work. The place I work at is relatively small so when someone saw I was new they came into the room I was in and started talking to me (and the two other people in the room). They introduced themselves and got on the topic of Valentine's day quickly. He spoke about his wife and how she had cancer, and that he loved her and thought she was perfect because of all the things she did for him but that he wasn't in love with her and that's why he fell in love with another woman. 

This sounds crazy but if you could see how he behaves it might make sense. It was still jarring to hear him openly speak like that about his wife. I wasn't sure if he was venting or boasting. 

The other two people in the lab didn't berate him or anything, they sort of just tried to change the subject or would say things like ""love is life a plan you need to water it to help it grow"" or at one point the other guy in the room said he should be ""a man of his house"" which I guess means he shouldn't be searching elsewhere. 

He said a bunch of other things that are definitely safety hazards and go against SOP's like not wearing gloves when dealing with waste because he ""was so used to dealing with shit"" (I work at a water treatment facility as an intern) and not wearing a mask to cover his nose.

Since I wasn't laughing or smiling he said I was too serious and asked me how old I was. 


Anyway it made me very angry that 1) that's what he chose to introduce himself as bc it seems like he's proud of it and 2) that he's doing that in the first place. 

It's fine if he falls out of love with someone but everything else makes me think he's trash. 

I hate that someone like him exists. "
aqniqa,28,2019-02-14,Just graduated with a CS degree and no practical experience.

My resume is bare, and I have no practical experience coding outside of the assignments we would get in school.

I have the most experience with Java, but we never used any UI tools. It was all command line stuff, and it was pretty basic too. I'd really like to become a better Java developer so I can start adding projects to my resume, but I have absolutely no clue where to start, what frameworks are most relevant, what type of projects to create, if I'm even on the right track, etc. 

Really looking for any kind of advice here. Definitely don't expect someone to lay everything out for me, I just need a point in the right direction. I just want to get to the point where I have enough on my resume to start getting interviews *anywhere*. I'm not picky, just quite anxious that I've screwed myself by not getting internships/getting involved in coding clubs.

EDIT: I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/aqmaat/i_taught_myself_how_to_code_in_4_months_and_just/) which really laid out the groundwork for how to get started in web app development with little to no experience.

aqnv3h,0,2019-02-14,Reneging vs Staying - Tough Decision,throwawaycscareeeer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aqnv3h/reneging_vs_staying_tough_decision/,"Hi guys. So I am a sophomore at a top 15 CS University with an excellent GPA whose only prior experience was unpaid work at an unknown startup, and I have received two internship offers for the summer - both at tier 2 companies. I accepted one of these in December as there was a stringent deadline and it was my only offer at that point (I was doubtful I'd get another). This first one was acquired in a somewhat cheese manner through a personal connection, and it will be more hardware focused, which frankly, I am not too interested about right now, as I haven't done any hardware projects or coursework yet. However, it does have alright pay and I do not need to relocate at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I just received the second offer, which is for a full stack position, which has potential to be quite a lot more interesting due to the company's recent growth in the area of my internship's work. I am far more interested in full stack work, and I have a lot of personal projects to back up this interest. I would have to renege on the first offer, and I would have to relocate and would receive slightly lower pay. However, I would be able to get my foot in the door at Big 4 etc (which I almost did this year, as I reached the final stages of interviews for many of them) better, due to, well, full stack work, which I really enjoy doing.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering what you guys thought of this. IMO, while everything else appears slightly worse at company 2 (relocation, pay), as well as having to renege, company 2's work will complement my resume far better. Would you guys think that the specifically full stack work will help me with better internships down the road, or would any technical internship suffice (in which case I would stick with company 1)?"
aqouny,249,2019-02-14,For all the boys I've killed before,sortof_haunted,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/aqouny/for_all_the_boys_ive_killed_before/," Valentine’s day is a big day for serial killers. I mean think about it: everyone is either stupidly happy or sad and mopey. Serial killers generally find themselves in the latter. It’s depressing; it’s so hard these days to find someone who’s comfortable with your murderous compulsions. 

That’s the conclusion I came to, anyway. What can I say? I’m a thirty-year-old woman, and once again, I’m alone on Valentine’s day. All my friends are getting married, having huge blow-out weddings and insane bachelorette parties where they basically gloat about how much great sex they’re having. Ugh. Always a killer bridesmaid and never a killer bride.

Anyway, Valentine’s night I put on my best blood-red dress and a long black coat, complete with black stilettos. I painted my lips black did a delicate dark smoky eye. My dark hair is down tonight, done in gentle curls. I fluffed my hair, checked to make sure the severed head on my mantelpiece over the fireplace was set straight, and went out the door, locking it securely behind me. I walked down the sidewalk, lit by streetlamps, my heels clicking satisfyingly against the concrete. 

It was quiet out tonight, despite the occasional drunk person wandering around sadly. I avoided them expertly, keeping to the shadows. I have a very specific destination in mind. I knew my next victim would be there, I had manipulated events to make it so. I had chosen my victim a month or so ago, upon hearing some very interesting news about him. Despite his sins, he had excellent taste in bars. 

I saw the bar down the street, warm light and soft music permeating the air around it. I stood outside, looking into the windows. I saw him there, right on time. There was one problem though: there was a woman there already talking to him. Shit. 

I breezed through the door, twisting my red lips into an enchanting smile. I sat at a stool close by to my victim, but not too close. I had to get rid of this other woman. I ordered a whiskey, developing a plan. 

My victims name is Seth Bates, an executive of some company I couldn’t be bothered to remember the name of. Bates had an unfortunate habit of forcing interns to suck his penis. He’s a generally all-around slimy guy, which made him a particularly easy kill. My plan had been to seduce him, get him into a hotel room and spend the night torturing and killing him. This woman here, however, was throwing a wrench into my plan. 

Admittedly, she’s a beautiful woman. She had short red hair cut into a bob and was wearing a short dress with red flowers on it. She had a nice laugh, admittedly, and it sounded like bells. She was drinking a glass of chardonnay and laughing at Bates’s pitiful jokes. Eventually, she excused herself to the bathroom. I watched as Bates slid a roofie into her drink. That’s when I made my move. 

“Excuse me,” I said, sliding past him gracefully, pretending I was getting the bartender’s attention. 

“Well, hello there,” said Melvin in his nasally voice. I accidentally-on-purpose knocked over the red-headed woman’s drink. 

“Oh, god,” I giggled. “Whoops, I knocked over your date’s drink.”

“Oh, she’s not my date, we just met,” said, raking his eyes over me. “Why don’t you sit down? I’ll buy you a drink.”

“Why thank you, Mr.—”

“Bates, Seth Bates,” he said smoothly, waving to the bartender to get me a drink. Bile started rising in my throat, but I swallowed it down. 

“Vanessa,” I said, shaking his hand. 

I sat down and flirted with him, and the red-headed woman returned. 

“Now who’s this?” She said, voice strained slightly. 

“Courtney, this is Vanessa,” Bates said, gesturing to me. “She wants to have some fun too.”

Courtney smiled at me with daggers in her eyes. I returned the look. The three of us sat and talked, Bates slowly getting drunker and drunker. 

“Hey, you ladies want to come up to my room?” He slurred. I nodded, and to my dismay, so did Courtney. Fuck, I really don’t want to have to kill this girl. She seems nice, too nice for this fuckwad. 

Either way, the three of us went giggling up to Bates’s suite, the making out occasionally. We got to the room and Bates fumbled with his keycard, eventually swiping us in. 

“Alright, ladies, just gotta take a piss and then I can get down to business,” He slurred, stumbling into the bathroom. I quickly turned to Courtney. 

“Listen, Courtney, you need to get out of here,”

“Why the hell should I? You seemed pretty ready for a threesome down at the bar.” She said, stepping out of her heels. 

“Look, this guy Bates is a really bad guy,” I said, getting increasingly desperate. 

“Obviously,” Courtney said, reaching back and unzipping her dress. I swallowed hard. “If he’s so bad, why are you here anyway? Planning to kill him or something?”

“Of course not,” I said, turning my back on Courtney. I silently pulled a wicked hunting knife from a sheath strapped to my leg. I turned around, but Courtney was already there, holding a pillowcase like she was about to strangle me. I blinked, unsure of what was happening. Courtney stopped in her tracks, staring at my knife. 

“Wait,” she said, stepping back. “Are you…”

“Well, when I said I wasn’t here to kill him, I may have been lying,” I said, lowering my knife. 

“Oh my god, girl, I’m here to kill him too,” Courtney said, grinning. 

“Oh my god,” I said, thinking. “So, do you like…want to kill him together?”

Courtney blushed. “I’d love to.”

A couple seconds later, Bates came stumbling out of the bathroom. “Alright ladiessss,” he said, grinning stupidly. “Let’s get to it.” He started unbuckling his belt, and Courtney snuck up behind him and wrapped the pillowcase she was holding around his neck, tightening it cruelly. 

“What the fuck,” Bates garbled. 

“See you in hell, Valentine.” I jammed my knife into his stomach and wrenched it up, spilling his steaming guts all over the floor. Courtney laughed, tying the pillowcase around Bate’s neck like a massive bow tie. 

“Damn, you go right for it,” She said, kneeling down and running her hands through the bloody viscera. 

“I guess I do,” I blushed. “Hey, uh, want to go get dinner?” 

Courtney smiled, standing up, blood dripping from her hands. She absently stuck a finger in her mouth and sucked on it. “Sure.”

Anyway, Happy Valentine's Day"

These relate to both my SO and myself, who are students in university, in BC, and made approx. $40k each during internships in 2018;

* Moving Provinces

I am originally from QC, moved to BC in 2015 for university. I did not update my address since I still returned home in the summer and continued to have summer jobs in QC in 2016 and 2017. I am now graduating so I would like to change my address to BC. Further, in 2018 I worked in BC for the summer instead of going home and made no income in QC. What should i put as the moving date?

* Declaring Common Law

Both my SO and I are students in BC. In Sept 2018 we reached one year of cohabitation - the CRA definition of common law. My understanding is that it is required to update our marital status to common law, which may cause GST/HST claw backs. Is there anything different about our situation since we are students?

* Inheritance from the US

My SO is a dual citizen CAN/USA, and recieved $10k in inheritance in USD. This has been desposited in a USD account held by a canadian bank. What tax implications will this cause for canadian and US filings?

Links to general resources regarding salary negotiation are welcome.

[EDIT]:  Just found [salary and negotiation part of the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/index#wiki_salary_and_negotiation)

I’ve been developing data science and bioinformatics software at a world-renowned genomics lab as an intern for three years.  For two years prior to that, I developed image processing tools for ecology research.  I came into my current position knowing only the bare-bones basics of programming and Linux.  Three years later, I am a decent python developer with solid skills in git, HPC, Linux, the scientific python stack and knowledge specific to research software such as reproducibility.  I am ready to be paid much more than the measly  $11.50/hour I am currently making.  I don’t have a degree, but I am guessing that my abilities are somewhat comparable to a new CS grad.  I’m sure I have major gaps in knowledge without formal education, but I hope that my on the job experience mostly makes up for that.

I am making roughly $16,500 and am not sure what I am worth.  I hope I am worth at least $45K - $65K/year. Is it weird to ask for a raise or promotion that is 3-4 times what I currently make?  Is it that unusual for somebody like me to get promoted from intern to full-time?  I know this is not uncommon for a situation in which an intern gets their degree and is then promoted to faculty as a matter of course.  I have been unable to finish school for financial reasons.

There is one thing I feel complicates the situation.  Since I’ve worked here, I’ve been a part-time temporary employee.  This means that I’ve been allowed to work full-time for only half the year.  The other half of the year, I’ve been limited to 20 hours/week.  I think this has affected my supervisor’s perspective on my performance because my productivity as a part-time employee is not equal to half my productivity as a full-time employee.  I am much less productive in working part-time.  (I think this would be true of most people.  I can explain why this is the case if anybody is interested.)  Therefore, I think my supervisor probably has a much lower opinion of me than he would had I been working full-time for the past year.  Right now, I have the opportunity to work full-time.  My plan is to try to impress him with my productivity as a full-time employee for a month, and then ask for a performance review and promotion.  Does this sound like a good plan or am I being naive?  I’m just looking for advice on how best to proceed.  I submitted an application to hired.com, so ideally I may be able to tell him I have other offers.  Sometimes I think maybe it would be best to just look for another opportunity and move on.  I do have a good relationship with my boss and I think he is a reasonable individual and a good person.  Therefore, I have also considered being 100% transparent with him and simply explaining all of the above to him.  Something like,

&gt;I feel my performance as a part-time employee doesn't reflect what I'm capable of. 
 Would you consider a promotion and, if so, can we do a performance review a month from now and then have a talk about it?

aqq89l,122,2019-02-14,What's the best way to break out of an endless loop of entry-level and filler jobs?,TheY2KBug,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/aqq89l/whats_the_best_way_to_break_out_of_an_endless/,"Since I graduated college in 2011, I've been feeling trapped in an endless loop of entry-level and ""filler"" jobs.  My degree is in construction management, and due to the recession among other factors, I was unable to find an internship while in school.  From there, I've done a month in road flagging, a summer in soil/concrete testing for construction, 2 years of running as a valet, a month at a factory, 2 more years doing entry-level permits work for a homebuilder, and I'm coming up on 2 years of building maintenance/housekeeping work for a hotel...interspersed with a few months here and there of unemployment.

I'm actively applying and interviewing for work, but at age 31, most people I interview with are looking for much more consistent experience than I can offer.  Any construction experience I have is bizarrely specific, and not super desirable for a GC/CM/PM role.  My current role as ""facilities care coordinator,"" offers nothing in the way of personal or professional development, and we're an odd facility in that we're not associated with any major brands, and my previous supervisor willfully kept information from me in order to stifle my progress (and I do have evidence of this).

I absolutely love the problem-solving and fact-finding aspects of my previous jobs.  I love helping people out on a personal level, when they're actively seeking assistance from me, but I simply don't thrive in a high-volume customer-service setting like you'd see in retail or sales.  45-50 hours a week is great for me, it's comfortable and I've always felt like I've done my best effort in that time constraint, but I don't do well in anything greater than 10-11 hours a day for 5, 6, or 7 days a week.

What do I need to do to break myself out of this seemingly endless loop of filler jobs?  I completely accept the fact that most of my problems are internal, but I want to approach my current job hunt with the best attitude, and find myself the best job for my given situation."

 The questions started out simple, but even on questions like ""why investment banking"" after giving an answer that has resonated well with others in the firm I had talked to, they both began strongly pushing back against all the things I listed in my story that pointed me to apply and basically kept asking ""why"" to every answer I gave to the point of me having to explain why someone in my family would discuss their company being purchased  by a private equity firm with me.  

Then came the technicals.  They began with softballs, talking about a decrease in depreciation being reflected on financial statements, valuation methods, etc, but after about 3 minutes they started to throw questions at me that I can say I was not prepared for.  Questions such as ""how would you calculate the implied share price of a publicly traded company given its comps have an EV/EBITDA of 10x"" and others along those lines.  Is that normal for an internship interview? They threw me for a loop and kind of had me stumbling for the last portion of the interview. 

Here's what i'm most unsure of though, 1 VP did almost all of the technical grilling, but the other VP was completely silent until the last few minutes.  At the end they sounded very upbeat and were asking about other recruitments / what my schedule would be in the near future because of the possibility of a superday.  

Is it standard procedure to do a 180 like this in an interview?

TL:DR: got grilled on technicals others have told me are too advanced for an internship interview, one VP seemed unimpressed while the other discussed continuing the interview process and my upcoming schedule.  Is this good or bad?"

Choice one: take summer classes and double major in statistics. I would have to probably pass on an internship if I get one. Will help me with become an actuary for sure and give me a strong mathematical background.

Last year I completed a bachelor's degree in Computer Networking and managed to get an internship and now part time job at a Cyber Security MSP as T1 Tech Support. 

Since I've started working at the MSP I began reading different sources of information such as r/sysadmin and also listening to the experience of my seniors at this MSP I realized I have a lot of critical gaps in my knowledge. 

I don't know what exactly is an Active Directory, typical network topologies for business, basic monitoring tools, scripting, experience with Windows Server, Linux distros and many other things. None of those topics were covered in my University (regarded as the ""best"" university of my country in IT knowledge) nor I was given guidelines of which topics should be covered in a given course (so I could study by my own if I desired). 

I don't know where to start to fix all the knowledge gaps I have, I did try to self study but most of the time I began a topic, another concept or topic was mentioned of which I had no idea what it was and had to then learn it and go back to the topic where I started meaning it was a mess of self study with no order. By requirements of the MSP I had to certify myself in a Privileged Account Solution which involved a lot of Active Directory and I kind of just brute force my way through the cert, I do know how to handle the software but I'm unsure of how to properly adapt it to an existent Active Directory since I don't know all the repercussions it will have. 

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to be on a Network Engineer job, I definitely not going to stay on the MSP, I realized I don't like CyberSecurity but at least I want to get 1 year of experience on my resume. I've searched a lot for entry level opportunities for network positions in my country but they all requiere at least 2-3 years of experience and several certs, have found no internship offers and there are no volunteer activities related to IT in my area. 

The main question is: should I focus on getting an entry level job in computer networking or getting certs or any other suggestion?

If self study is the answer then which topics are ""essential"" for a network engineer and/or for today IT needs? Or at least some good online resources where I can take classes. Which certifications could help me on my career? I started styudying Cisco CCNA this year.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have read until this point you have my sincerest thanks, sorry if it comes across as a rant/vent but I really want to get my life together.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes it's hard to pick the right day because $BOSS can flip a switch and become cold real quick. I want a graceful exit. I'm not going to print a platter of cookies out of my butt to say thank you but I want it to be professional, non-awkward, hope-I-dont-piss-$BOSS-off to where $BOSS's bad days for the final two weeks will hamper my ability to remain mentally stable trying to service my company with the Desktop Support that they need.

&amp;#x200B;

I've learned to burn a bridge as a last resort. Today I wanted to give $BOSS the ""you are the number one,"" but I sat back and reflected on my past. Should always keep the link state as ""no shutdown,"" so that if paths cross again, they won't be awkward or worse, $BOSS is at another place down the road in 20 years that wants to hire me. I don't think $BOSS always deserves the flying bird, only sometimes.

* 2017: Made ~20k CAD, filed Canadian taxes
* 2018: Made ~20k USD between two internships (lived in America from Jan to Aug), made no CAD.
* 2019: Reside in Canada right now

So from my searches on this subreddit it seems as though I'll be in some trouble for not filing American taxes the years I made money in Canada.

Semi related: I'm moving to America for fulltime work starting this fall. After I file 2019 Canadian taxes, I'm free from filing them in the future unless I move back to Canada right?

Can you go back to being dev after working in dev ops?,ptsai_o_mine,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aqty0q/is_it_wise_for_a_dev_to_switch_to_a_devops_role/,"The stress is killing me and I need some advice. So here it goes.

Quick recap of my situation.

 I'm a recent college graduate with a master's degree in software engineer

A company X is paying me a decent amount of money in the Bay area to be a Dev. I've been working there for 3 weeks and what I've come to realize is that the company does manual labor type coding making excessively dirty messed up code so long as it gets the job done. What's worse is I don't get along with the company culture at all (even get the feeling a lot of them don't like me). Not to mention they had a reorg the DAY I JOINED and now I don't report to the person who hired me. However I've already fixed one really critical issue nobody caught and management thinks I'm smart - so there's probably potential to grow.

Enter company Y. They pay a good 20% more to be a Dev ops person in the Bay area. My title still remains software engineer but I write limited code. They made that clear. Also they want to hire me for a lower position than I'm currently working at. I'm SE 2  they're hiring me as an SE 1 equivalent (associate member of technical staff).

I like Docker and Kubernetes. I do want to diversify and grow in horizontally so that eventually I can rise vertically up ranks. I learnt during my internship at a Big N company that people who get to really high up levels have a lot of different domains under their belt.


TL;DR:
I'm concerned about a couple of things:

1. Will I be judged for  quitting a job 3-4 weeks after joining?

2. Will I be able to come back to being a Dev at some point (if I want to) after doing Dev ops?

3. Should I give up a decent paying developer job at a company with a good reputation for a 20% hike in pay as a Dev ops engineer at a big N company?"

I was actually in neuroscience for my first 2 years, had some unresolved mental health-related issues rear it’s ugly head during my second year that eventually got me hospitalized for a few days. I tried to continue the semester a week after, couldn’t do it, and didn’t come back for a year. I got much better, got readmitted into CS, and am set to graduate in 2020. 

So you see, I’m already a year behind my peers, which gives me some strange inferiority complex. Right now, I’m applying to summer internships and having absolutely zero luck. Not even a single interview after applying to 40+ places, including going to my school’s tech fair. It’s also my fault that I didn’t start applying sooner,  but I got my transfer approved just last summer, so I’m new to this field and how things work. 

So worse comes to worst I’ll have to work somewhere non-CS-related this summer. 

My career advisor did suggest looking for internships for the fall. But that would require me to postpone my 4th-year courses, so based on scheduling issues I might end up graduating 1.5 or even 2 years later than planned, making my undergrad degree take 6 years. I’ve been so antsy to graduate after my mental health stuff so 6 years kinda freaks me out, financial implications aside. 

What do you think? To an employer, does an internship outweigh the fact that I took 5.5-6 years to do an undergrad? Have any of you been in the same position? 

tl;dr
Is graduating 1.5-2 years late (versus only 1 year late) better than graduating with no internship experience? "

The majority of my applications were formal internship postings, but I did cold-contact quite a few companies as well. I had connections to two companies (Symantec and Google), but neither offered anything past a very brief phone conversation. 

-----

My stats:

Junior (although I switched from mechanical engineering to CS after my freshman year so I'm essentially a sophomore in-major) at a non-target medium/low ranked ( ~100th according to USNews ) state school on the East Coast

3.62 GPA

GitHub with multiple personal projects (mostly Python research projects)

Currently do research at my university developing Python software for analysis of NASA spacecraft data

Team lead for a private-equity investment group at my university 

Awards for Outstanding Student in CS for 2018-2019 (given to two students in the department), 2nd place at a very large business-pitch/startup-accelerator competition at my university, 2nd place at a Hackathon at my university (which was low-key a total joke, but I don't say that on my resume obviously)

-----

Aside from my two personal connections at companies, I wasn't able to find anything through networking. Unfortunately, my school is very poorly recruited for CS (the largest ""tech"" company at our career fair is Liberty Mutual), although I imagine I would have been able to find an offer at a company more local to my university (I really just wanted to return home for the summer). 

At this point, I'm going to start reaching out to connections I have  for potential leads. 

This is all almost moot, though, since I've been seriously interested in pursuing med school instead of a career in CS. Regardless, I'm hoping to do research over the summer at a university at home (preferably where I can combine my interest in biomedical science and programming).

Anyways, just thought I'd share my story. I don't mean to get anyone down who's applying for internships or still holding out hope on offers. I'm sure there was something I was doing wrong or something on my resume that made me unhireable. I hope you all fare better :)"

I have no research experience but I have 1 internship and I am doing another at Big M this summer.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a sophomore (junior by credit) mechanical engineering major and computer science minor student. I know I have a pretty high GPA (3.8), and I worked hard and have good work ethics to get that GPA, too. I am also an undergraduate research assistant in an engineering research lab, an undergraduate UTF for a mechanical engineering class, and have a part-time job as a tutor.

I have been going to the career fair since my freshmen year, and I had applied to a lot of internships through the career fair, company website, and career4engineer. Luckily, I have been able to get a couple of interviews so far, but I never got an internship landed. I told myself that is because the companies don't hire sophomores, but last night, I found one of my friend, computer engineering major who has a similar GPA and extracurricular, got a paid summer internship. I am really happy for her, she works really hard, so I know she deserves it. But it makes me kind of sad that with similar GPA and extracurricular and the same class year, she landed an internship for the summer and I am not. What am I doing wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

Could it be it is because I am not a citizen but a green card holder? Someone I talked to said the companies just don't wanna hire green card holders when they can hire citizens because they don't want to give ""good jobs"" to non-citizens. I am not sure how credible is it, but is it really because I have a green card?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am an intern at an IT consulting / MSP that has been tasked with configuring a secure, native to Linux SFTP server for government partners from other countries. I also have to come up with a secure FTPS solution, but that's for another topic.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Anyway, I have followed the steps at the link above, but my directory is /srv/sftp/uploads instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

I created a user (sftp\_demo) and added to wheel group to do all the configuring. The user I made for the partner (partner1) is not a member of the wheel group, and is in what I believe is a chroot jail? Is that what this tutorial is doing is called?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I think this is secure because if we do the SFTP server as a VM on the physical server, plus limiting access to the one directory, plus having the account be non-privileged, it should be safe? Still, I am a total newb to Linux and need help speaking with 'authority' on why this is safe.

I was wondering if you guys could give me opinions/suggestions on this topic (about the company, about the job). My short-term goal is to get an internship from a top company (e.g. Google, Salesforce, etc.) for my 3rd work term. Will the \[working at BB\] experience be helpful for me when I try again later with bigger company? 

If any of you guys have experience working there or if you know some useful information/facts and will to share, I'd really appreciate it.

ar0l0a,1,2019-02-15,How is an engineering degree structued in the United States.,Blank_Planet_Fear,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ar0l0a/how_is_an_engineering_degree_structued_in_the/,"I'm a European, soon to graduate, and I was wondering how things look in the US and what your opinion is about it.

So let me explain where I'm coming from. In Europe if you apply to uni you almost always apply for a specific degree e.g. electrical engineering or material science or medicine. From day one you know you are going to be educated towards that career and all your modules are aligned to give you all the necessary skills. As an engineer, or really any STEM student, you're not going to take any class in literature or philosophy, maybe 1 or 2 in business related subjects.

Now my understanding of the US system is that you apply to a university and once you're in you can end up with pretty much any career you imagine. You're free to choose any set of classes.

So here comes my question: how do you converge on a specific career? How come an American engineer compares to a European if he was potentially taking multiple irrelevant classes? I can already see a difference between people taking ""general engineering"" courses, that allow later specialisation, never mind if you start by doing sociology in year one.

* So, what are the rules in class selection?
* How do you know which classes lead to what? 
* Are they suggestions form one to another or suggested ""routes""?
* What is the structure of a single ""class""? How any do you take in a year?
* Do you do and (maybe optional)  ""a year in industry"" or longer apprenticships?
* How important and popular is a summer internship?

I am exclusively interested in answers on STEM, especially engineering and tech: from electrical to mech, from chemical to civil, from biomedical to computer science.

Thank you for you answers!!! I chose this subreddit, cause it's pretty large and I hope for a variety of answers :)"

He squirmed and writhed in agony, little shrieks from pained, bloody teeth. His long tail wrapped around my index finger while he clutched tight to threads of life. Beady eyes bled crimson down white fur.

“It’s ok, little buddy. It’s ok,” I said, stroking his head gently.

Unblinking, I returned the rat to his plastic box. I couldn’t stand to see him like this; no living thing should ever have to experience such torment. Clutching the edge of the counter with white knuckles, I whispered, “I’m so sorry.”

The poor creature rasped once, then lay still.

“No. Not again!” I slammed my fist on the counter, again and again, until it was bruised and bloody. Papers jumped with each thump, falling onto the floor; the notes of all my failures rained down in piles around me.

The treatment was experimental. Revolutionary, really. Nothing like it had ever been attempted before—the first use of nanites to successfully kill cancer cells. My creation, my magnum opus, all wasted on countless failures.

I reached into my pocket, grasping the edges of my wallet with shaking hands. The black leather faded to brown, sun bleached and well-worn. Sniffling, I removed her picture. Torn in places, tattered, the ink smudged and blurred with fingerprints, I could barely make out her smile. My legs lost their strength; I slumped down against the counter and the cold concrete.

I grasped the edges of the photograph, moving them to my wet lips. I could still remember the touch of her lips on mine. I promised to love her, through sickness and health, till death do us part. But the truth was that I loved her long after she left this world. I never stopped loving her.

“I’m so sorry. I'm trying—so hard—for both of you,” I whispered.

I let the picture fall idly on my lap. Holding my head in my hands, I wept openly. In the corner of my wallet, peeking out from a different photograph, my daughter stared up with the same blue eyes of her mother. I couldn’t save her. I couldn’t save either of them.

A gentle knock on the laboratory door stirred me from my melancholy. Rachel still wore her hospital gown and badge from earlier. She looked a hot mess. “Jacob, are you alright?”

“I—just give me a minute,” I said.

I stood and stared at my girlfriend with bloodshot eyes. I didn’t try to hide the tears, and she didn’t speak of them. She didn’t need to. A lump caught in my throat. “It didn’t work.”

She looked down with damp eyes. “You tried your best. I’m headed home, I need to sleep for a bit. Come home with me? Please—you need to sleep.”

“Rachel, you know I can’t,” I said, leaning back against the counter, “I can’t leave Lucy alone.”

She nodded and lifted up a bright pink backpack. “I know. Just—try and rest—ok?  I brought you a fresh change of clothes, and there’s some leftover casserole in here too.”

*Casserole.* There was a time when Lucy and I lived alone. She grew so distant from me, and I think in a way she blamed me for mother’s death. I know she hated Rachel at first, but it was Rachel’s casserole that got her smiling again. Casserole was the glue that kept our family together.

I pulled Rachel close. I wanted to tell her how thankful I was for her, or how much I loved her, or how much she meant to me and Lucy, but all I could say was simply, “Thank you.”

She gently took my hands in hers, studying the cuts with a frown. “Lucy fell asleep before I left her. Try to be quiet?”

“Of course,” I said.

Rachel lifted up my bruised hands, kissed them once, and let them fall back to my side. She walked away; her heels echoed down the dim hallway. I took one look back at my workstation, thinking of all the tests I needed to run. I decided to leave it all for tomorrow. It wasn’t going anywhere.

Instead, I rode the nearby elevator in solace, entering the cancer ward with a gentle ding. The whole floor smelled like sterile hopelessness. The night nurse eyed me wearily, and opened her mouth as if to speak, but closed it, thinking better.

Maybe she saw the weakness in my eyes, or maybe she saw the drops of blood from my battered hands. Whatever the reason, I entered Lucy’s room undisturbed, tiptoeing as best I could in my lab gown. Lucy woke regardless. She looked pale and fragile lying in the hospital bed, like a wilting flower cut from its roots. She cracked an eye open, her voice a frail warble. “Daddy, you’re back.”

“Of course, sweetie. I’m going to sleep here again, is that ok?”

She nodded, and turned aside, closing her eyes once more. I spread out on the pull-out couch. Wrapping myself in weak, cold hospital sheets, I prayed to every god I didn’t believe in. I begged them for a miracle.

It wasn’t long before the morning light filtered through the cracks in the blinds, and I woke to a gentle knock on the door. The nurse from before poked her head in. “Jacob, can I see you outside for a moment?”

I held back a groan, slipped out of the sheets like a ghost, and walked the door. The nurse wasn’t alone; Dr. Malcolm stood by her, holding a clipboard behind his tired eyes. Chills ran down my spine before he even opened his mouth. He spoke four words: “I have bad news.”

My heart caught in my chest. “It’s progressed, hasn’t it.”

Dr. Malcom nodded. He handed me the clipboard, and I saw the results of the last CT scan. I wish I hadn’t. “I thought you said she had a few more weeks?”

“I’m sorry. I really thought she had more time, but you know as well as anyone just how unpredictable this can be,” he paused, then looked at me with honest eyes, and I saw for a moment the stoic doctor break down. He became mortal again, filled with weakness. Wet regret started in his eyes. “Jacob—I’m sorry. I truly am. I—”

“It’s ok. It’s going to be ok,” I lied, then added, “you did everything you could,” and that was the truth. We tried every treatment, save for one, now swimming in the blood of a dead mouse ten floors down.

“I need to get back to my lab,” I said, rubbing the gunk from my eyes.

“Can I get you anything before you go?” the nurse asked.

I rubbed my forehead for a moment. “Coffee, actually. Black—no sugar. You *do* have coffee up here, right?”

“Of course,” she beamed, and walked back to her workroom.

I grabbed a change of clothes and used Lucy’s shower to freshen up. The nurse came back to the room, and with new resolve, I grabbed the coffee, letting the dark aroma lead me to a more conscious, thoughtful state of mind. I had a two-minute commute down the elevator, and in no time at all I was back in my laboratory.

Something was wrong.

The papers I had strewn across the floor were neatly stacked on the table. The floor was mopped clean, and the rat was nowhere to be found. Instead, on the desk, was a single white rose, and slinking in the corner was a young intern, tan skin, clean shaven, young at spirit. I recognized him from Rachel’s department.

He grinned sheepishly. “Dr. Parker sent me to clean up your lab, so I organized your notes for you, and cleaned up the mess and sorted some files, and just cleaned the place a bit. She figured you could use it.”

*Rachel.* She did this, bless her heart. “Thank you, Dr….?”

“Ashish Racchawar, sir. I’m not a doctor yet, still in school,” he said, grinning up from ambitious brown eyes.

I nodded. “Sure, sure. What did you do with the lab rat? It was laying in the plastic tub.”

He stuttered for a moment, then looked confused. “There wasn’t a rat. The tub was empty.”

Chills ran down my spine. “What do you mean?”

“The tub is over there,” he said, nodding towards the bin on the counter. “It was clean, so I put it back.”

“It wasn’t clean. It was covered in blood, and there was a dead rat in it!” I said, exasperated.

We stared at eachother for a long second. I took a sip of coffee to clear my thoughts. When I looked back, he had the same confused look, and I just couldn’t believe my shit luck. “You’re telling me you didn’t see the rat, or the drops of blood?”

“Sir—there wasn’t a drop of blood here—Sir. I am not certified to clean bodily fluid spills, so if I saw anything, I would surely report it”

“Ok, stay here a minute,” I said, walking to my desk. It had been a long time since I accessed the lab security cameras, so it took me a second to find the right application on my old computer. When I did, I scanned the footage, and couldn’t believe my eyes.

One hour after I had left the lab, the rat twitched.

“Sir, was the rat alive?” Ashish asked. His voice dripped with concern.

I took another sip of coffee. “I’m not sure, I don’t think so.”

On the security feed, the rat started to bulge and shake. Something poked its skin from the inside. The rat flopped and spasmed, twitching. Blood started dripping from its eyes, running down its fur and into the plastic bin. An involuntarily shiver ran down my spine.

“That’s not supposed to happen,” I whispered. Somehow the treatment had lost control. The nanites must have malfunctioned, somehow moving in sync with one another…

The blood pooled and beaded together. Then, like some ravenous beast, the blood lashed out toward the rat. Ashish shouted, jumping back. I gripped the edge of my desk, my eyes sunk back and frozen on the screen.

Blood surrounded the corpse of the rat like a blanket of crimson. Then the nanites ripped the dead creature’s cells apart. The rat opened with a can opener, spilling its innards into the tub.

“Sir, I think I need a second—” Ashish said, running towards the waste bin near the emergency showers. He didn’t make it. His breakfast spewed all over the freshly mopped floor. I choked back bile.

I sat in my chair, frozen, as I watched the nanites consume the entire rat—skin, flesh, fur, and bones. Soon there was nothing left but a crimson puddle, with veins of black nanites coursing throughout, supporting the amalgam by keeping the pooled blood together.

How could this have happened? I programmed the nanites to self-replicate using available cancerous cells, so with the cancerous rat, they would have no trouble doubling or tripling their numbers. That much was normal, even expected. But this?

This was something else entirely.

Blood sloshed out onto the desk like a sapient wave. The creature crawled slowly, assimilating the bloodstains from my hands. Then it splashed on the floor. I watched It absorb every single drop of blood, leaving nothing behind.

It flowed into the drain and disappeared from the video feed.

I became suddenly aware of the air around me. It pressed down on my skin like a weight, and I looked towards the laboratory exit. Ashish knelt by the door, hunched over the trash can, still emptying the contents of his stomach. Above him—the emergency shower, and below him—the drain. Hair stood on the nape of my neck. My voice shook. “Ashish, don’t move.”

His eyes lowered, suddenly transfixed on the drain beneath him.

“Oh god—what is it?”

The red ichor started out of the drain and coursed upwards onto his boots, creeping, crawling. Ashish looked up in terror, whimpering. He hunched forward as the blood wave flowed around the edges of his boots, up the frocks of his tan pants and down his black socks.

His whole body started to shake and twitch.

Tears streamed down his face, and he looked up at me with pained eyes—begging—pleading.

I spent the last year at an internship where I was doing front end web development, and really enjoyed it. I'm not in a strictly computer science program (there are programming elements to it as well, but it's a little all over the place), but at this point I'd like to pursue a career as a developer and I'm looking to get the most out of my last summer opportunity before I graduate. 

I've been offered a job working with a development team where I'd be coding Selenium UI tests for their web application. I was told I'd be working with both the front and back end teams, but that the position itself is a QA position, and not a developer position. There are a few things I'm wondering about that are a little awkward to directly ask my employer, so here goes. Will I hate my life if all I'm doing is writing UI tests every day? Would this be a useful opportunity if I'd eventually like to see myself in a full time developer position? Should I be looking elsewhere for a summer position?

I'm willing to provide more details if necessary, but I'm mostly looking for some more opinions. Since my program isn't pure CS, I'm definitely not the best coder out there at this point, so part of me is hoping that exposure to another area could be useful, but some of the people I've talked to about this opportunity have made me hesitant. Either way I'm still going to have to put in a lot of work to get to where I want to be, but I'd like to be confident that this position would be time well spent instead of something that may not actually help me down the road.

This means as a senior manager, I do the same basic role as the intern, just more of it.

&amp;#x200B;

The money is average but the industry is what I wanted to work in when I was a teenager, so it's always had a pull on me. But I'm in my 30s now and what I want is different - more money, more fun/freedom/creativity, less stress/negativity. What that means in a practical sense, I'm not sure?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my job is sapping my confidence and I'm wasting my career here. My skillset is not improving and it's pretty soul destroying going in every day. The work itself is 95% process driven, which is incredibly dull and repetitive. The atmosphere in the room is set by my boss and it's grumpy, grouchy and curt. We all sit in silence with headphones on and crack on with the job until it's time to go home. My when questioned by myself and the other senior manager in the team, my boss thinks everything is fine. We disagree.

&amp;#x200B;

I go through bursts of calling recruiters and job hunting but it feels like slim pickings. I have found a couple of jobs I was invited to interview for - the feedback I got was 'good, but lacking experience' because my skillset is not growing with the industry. My next job might have to be a sideways or downwards step. FML. Screw it, as long as it gets me moving forward again, I don't care.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm asking for is, have you been in this kind of predicament, where you're trapped in a role that isn't doing it for you but moving feels terrifying? Tell me about your great escape! + I'm willing to take any advice you may have.

I’d been cold-emailing people for summer research internships for a while, and hadn’t got any luck. I was so intimidated by his success, and he seemed so incredibly qualified (CV is 48 pages. Has a PhD, JD, LLM, 3 MA’s, and a BA). It seemed impossible that I’d get anything more than a rejection from him. Why would he take on a high schooler for research? He must have tons of undergrads vying to work with him, or so I thought. 

I emailed him on a whim, and offered a position straight away. We just called today. 

I posted yesterday about being terrified for my talk with him, but it went fantastically! He was incredibly nice about it.

He was so open to my working with him. Not only that, but he seemed *excited* to work together; he *wanted* to work with me, and I with him. 

He even offered to pay!

Moral of the story: 

Take the shot you are scared of. You never know what can happen. 

I was terrified of emailing him. He seemed too amazing, too qualified, too fantastic. I was terrified of talking to him. Me, a simple high schooler, and him, an accomplished professor. I’d been a nervous wreck all day, waiting for his call. But it was all worth it. 

Take the shots you don’t think you’ll make. Take the shots you are scared of taking. It’s all worth it, in the end.

She recently graduated with a Computer Engineering degree after years of hard work. I'm super proud of her and had been talking to her about moving out of my parents' house. She seemed to be on board, even though she was worried about not being able to get a ""nice"" apartment on her entry level salary.

Recently, she told me that my mom wants to borrow some of her savings, so that she could put it into her IRA and lessen her tax burden this year. Her terms were that she would pay my sister a 4% per year interest rate. However, repayment would take place whenever my sister decided she needed the money (i.e. there were no firm terms of repayment).

My mom phrased this ask as ""hey, i have to borrow money to max my IRA anyway, so instead of taking out a mortgage loan, I'll borrow from you and pay you instead while you live at home and save money!""

While this may sound good on paper, i have several problems with this arrangement. The main one being that it completely enmeshes my parents with my 25-year-old sister. Sure, I don't know what her personal plans are with her life, whether she wants to get married, whether she wants to have kids, but whatever her plans are, becoming financially enmeshed with your parents at 25 just doesn't seem like a good idea. Instead of actively encouraging her to leave the nest, they're continuing to perpetuate the ""the world is scary and you can only trust your parents"" lie they've been trying to indoctrinate us with since we were born.

I can just imagine my parents, giddy that they finally have a child who will let them control her money, giddy that they have an adult daughter who ""chooses"" to live at home. All too happy to continue to infantilize my sister and rob her of her own life and her freedom. Fuck my fucking selfish APs.

This makes me so very sad tonight."

what do?

(other than doing something that we'll get him to write a crappy reference that is)

As much as taking a nailgun to his spine would be satisfying I need him alive and in tact to make the job reference.

im just not sure how to approach this because he may have accidentally given me legal recourse to go after him

because apparently he's leaving his company in a month and not telling anyone

and he asked me to keep it quiet

even though

1)- he's offered me no incentive to keep this quiet, like giving me my damn reference.

and

2)- even if he was leaving the company it would have no bearing on his ability to give me reference, as he was 
my supervisor and as such qualifies to be a reference

I think he might be banking on the fact that im autistic for me to not to notice that he's trying to fuck me over

I would learn the whatever language at the time for the class and go ok on tests etc but found no motivation to keep programming for fun / on personal projects so it kind of just fades away over time.

I started out with C, then Java, C++ and Python. I’d say I’d be an intermediate probably, but am rusty for the reasons mentioned above.

I’m currently doing an internship in Marketing/Design mostly for the money and bc it’s something I’m quite good at but want to get a CompSci-related internship for this summer.

So there’s this plus of knowing Design well at least...

I’m learning Web Dev right now — want to create a website for a company I’m gonna start with a friend, and a Chrome extension for personal use mostly.

I think that what happens is like, I understand the topics, the theory, but when I need to code I see my mind stuck. Probably I haven’t really developed the programmer’s skill of just doing stuff, getting it wrong, and debugging / growing from there?

Oh and I’m an international student in the US, so I kind of need the internship this Summer to be able to get a job after graduation &amp; stay in America...

Any tips on how I should proceed? 

Should I quit the current internship &amp; focus on learning? (My contract is until May though) Should I just start building stuff?

I’d really appreciate any feedback, tip, direction, anything really"

&amp;#x200B;

Hey! Just happened to stumble upon this subreddit. I'm a semester and a half away from graduating as an undergrad, with a dual degree in CS and Economics, from a private university which is rank 200-ish worldwide (it's the best option in the region). I would like some insight regarding my application to CS grad school, which I plan to attend starting next Spring (I'll be graduating next Fall). Below you can find an overview of my accomplishments:

\- GPA: 4.0/4.0

\- Vice President of my university's CS society

\- Participant in a worldwide team programming competition, which places me among the top 1,000/50,000 participants worldwide (those 50,000 participants are picked from their respective institutions judging by their academic standings, I presume most of them are in the top 10% of their classes). This kind of goes under research, as I spend hours a day reading things to better my programming ability. The competition is renowned worldwide and the universities I'm planning to apply to frequently have their teams finish in the top 10.

\- Volunteered as a CS tutor in my university, and participated in the renovation of a public school in my area.

&amp;#x200B;

You can probably tell that I do not really have anything significant going for me apart from my grades, and that's because I crammed myself to finish 2 degrees along with a minor in 3 years and a half (also note that I was a math major in my sophomore year which set me further back); I have taken summers to speed up the process. I'll be doing my first internship in a renowned software company this summer (which is my senior year summer, quite late I know) as a developer. I plan on doing miscellaneous volunteering tasks throughout this semester but I'm not sure how effective that'll be in helping my cause.

I'm interested in the following universities:

\- US: Stanford, Caltech

\- UK: Cambridge, Oxford

I know that getting into any of those colleges is probably a stretch, especially given that I'm an international student, but I would be interested in knowing my odds, since you folks seem to be quite knowledgeable here. If there is anything that I have omitted, please do let me know. Thank you in advance for your input!

(Note: if you have any reputable universities that you deem to be a match for my qualifications, please do not hesitate to let me know!)"

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I'm unsure what to do as a summer internship before I graduate. Ideally, after graduating, I'd like to do something quant related or tech venture capital (which may be ambitious). I have offers from one of the big four (in risk), a blue chip asset management firm ( in tech), as well as one of the top 3 insurance brokers (risk and broking). Which one would be considered more prestigious/ a better base for what I want to go into? 

&amp;#x200B;

Asset management pays better than the others but I have heard people say the business is quite flat, so there's not much room for progression. The big four is obviously a household name but I feel like its hard to get out of the big four once you're in there?

I am a physics major, so I'm quite good at programming and math, but I don't know too much about financial careers... I just want a career where I'm constantly challenged, and develop new skills. I don't care about hours, I just need somewhere which allows for a lot of personal development.

I have completed the video interview this week. I want to switch internships because:

1.  Interns are not offered full-time positions after the internship ends

2.  The pay is 5x at the other internship

3. Cash Equities is a dying business

4. GS/JPM/MS &gt; BAML/Citi/CS on a resume

Specifically, the realistic qualifications needed to land a job, programming in Python language. I'm currently about 50% finished with the Python course over at CodeAcademy. And over at CodeAcademy, they say that if you finish their course, which includes tests and projects,  that you will then be prepared to take the official Python certification test. And be capable of passing it. Which is what I plan to do, to get that certification.   
 

But once I do that, will I be able to find a  job? Is that enough? Or will I need to go and pay a college $35k for a  computer science degree? Surely a certificate from the Official Python organization would be enough to land me an entry level programming job, right? Or wrong? I'll be a fresh faced newb at that point, with little to no experience. But you hear things about programmers that got hired with absolutely no qualifications. They got hired, because they could program. Is this still true? Do you think I'd be able to find a job with only a Python certificate?  I do not mind if I have to do internships. "

I was less stressed and paid better at the corporate job, but was not learning anything IT related like network trouble shooting, or user or device management. At the MSP I've learned so much in such a small amount of time like AD, Google Admin, and basic network troubleshooting, but it has also been stressful at times.  I recently was offered a position at another corporate office where I will get paid more, more flexible hours which would allow me to get an internship during the summer, and their office is located conveniently in downtown and I would not have to travel from client to client like I sometimes have to at my current job (they don't pay mileage).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do. The MSP has more cons, but I'm learning a ton. I would probably have to leave after I graduate college since they rarely have fulltime positions available (small company). The corporate job pays better, but I won't learn ""IT"" stuff like I am now.

MSP Pros: Getting my hands on of different tech and gaining a lot of experience.

MSP Cons: Travel from site to site within a work day and am not paid mileage, no prospect of full time after graduation. Lower pay vs corporate gig. Stressful. Sometimes have to work and respond to tickets on my days off. Not a flexible schedule. Sometime work goes home with me without pay

&amp;#x200B;

Corporate Pros: Less stress, better pay, tuition assistance, flexible schedule which could allow me to intern somewhere else. No travel time. Office located downtown. Slightly higher chance of full time after graduation (person I'm replacing was a student and they did not have a full time spot available so he left).  Better work/life balance, work stays at work.

&amp;#x200B;

Corporate Cons: No IT experience other than their own software and hardware.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm weighing the learning experience pretty heavily. Looking for some opinions from those who've made similar choices before.

Two years ago I divorced my husband for a abusive relationship, I was struggling at the time and so was my mother trying to raise my three sisters on her own so I returned home after 7 years of pretty much no contact. I helped out with bills, food, and raising my sister's since their dad wasn't in the picture and not paying any child support. She decided that she wanted to move across the country to be closer to her best friend and I agreed to come along too because I wanted to keep that relationship with my sister's that I had lost seven years on. I buy all their school supplies, pay for their equipment for sports and clubs, drive them wherever they need to go, take care of doctor's appointments, buy groceries and take care of the house. After starting my internship and not being paid for a month we ended up being evicted and moving in with her best friend. I ended up sleeping in the living room on the floor sharing an air mattress with one of my sister's while another got the couch and another got a bed. I took two jobs to get better pay. I've noticed that since moving in over here I started being treated like a child rather than an adult that had been helping support. The kids lost interest in spending time with me and my mother whom I had grown extremely close to after years of avoidance has pretty much completely kicked me out of all decision making. I was angry but accepted if she didn't need me and her best friend was taking my place as the parental role I was going to move out. So I found an apartment, had everything set to go and then told my mother I was moving out. When I told her this she asked me what she was supposed to do about buying a house and I told her the agreement was still the same I would sign on her loan but I just won't be living there. She said she can't afford a mortgage without my income and then it all clicked together that our original agreement of her taking loan responsibility and me eventually moving out was a lie that she never had any intentions of me leaving. The next day I get in a really bad car accident, my car is thrown over a fence and the only thing that saved me from the interstate was luck and a barbwire throwing me back over. When she came to the accident to get me I was upset about my apartment because I knew I couldn't afford it anymore and her comment was that ""everything happens for a reason and now I can invest in the house"" the longer it's been since the accident the more I realized it wasn't just whiplash. I got x-rays of my spine and it's fractured with possible nerve damage down my right side. When I ask her for help getting my things out of the totalled car she tells me she doesn't know when she'll have time. When I come home from work she barely speaks to me but the moment her best friend comes in doesn't shut up. When I call her about the prognosis that I'll need physical therapy with possible surgery and won't be able to work for three months and I'll be losing my health insurance she cuts me off to laugh at her friend's joke and I just sit here waiting for her to listen to me again about what's going on. Im angry at my mother and I hate her best friend for what feels like she's taken my place. I know the relationship I have with my mom is unhealthy and it reminds me of when I was a kid and I would disappear the moment her husband would come home. I'm not really sure what to do anymore. My grandfather said I can move back with him while I get through the fractures and get back on my feet again and I'm thinking that might be my only choice because I need Medicaid if I lose my health insurance. I guess what my actual question is.. what's wrong with me? Why do I have so much attachment and resentment to feeling replaced. Why do I have this weird marriage to my mother and I feel angry that her best friend is taking my ""kids"" away. I knew it was unhealthy so that's why I was moving out but it seems like everything got ruined. Is this relationship with her a codependency?

TL;DR
After years of helping support my mother with my three sisters we ended up moving in with her best friend and her friend has replaced me as being the step in parent of my sister's. My mother ignores me and when she found out I wasn't going to sign on her loan to buy her a house due to fractured vertebraes she's exiled me out even more. What is this relationship called? What do I do to fix it? How do I move out of this situation when I'm not allowed to work for three months? I don't want to be in this anymore.. I want to be my own person.."

I’ve been a programmer for the last 14 years. Started out as an intern and have just worked my way up through the company. I’ve been happy, but recently due to some company decisions think it might be wise to start looking around even though I don’t want to. I’m scared of change. I feel like I don’t interview well, but I can work circles around someone, loyal, motivated, and have the drive to learn what I don’t know. 

I’m a senior developer, but I sometimes doubt myself that I could apply and land a different senior developer position in technologies I don’t know.

My experience include.
ColdFusion 
C#
CSS
Jquery
MySQL
SQL Server
Accessibility(508

Team currently has been doing Agile for some time. So I’m very familiar with it.

I’ve noticed a lot of job listings would like a candidate to know AngularJS or ReactJS. I have not used these technologies in business setting. I feel more drawn to the UI aspect of development but landing that perfect job seems to be a challenge. Perfect job to me would be a remote job, or a local job with the freedom of being remote. It’s what I’m used to.

What would you suggest I do to ensure I can market myself well? Get better at interviewing? Technologies to become more familiar with?

At the beginning everything was going well and great, but she was too clingy she would keep texting me 24/7 and to call me all the time even if I was with my family or my friends or studying for an exam, later on she started telling why do your parents hate you, why your friends are shit and so on , we used to fight about this shit. Later on she started to get so naggy and with mood swings she started telling how depressed she is and how her dad treats her – even though her father was treating her well- and he doesn’t trust her and how she developed trust issues then I started to figure out how she keeps lying to me and hide stuff from me, and I confronted her about and we moved forward. Now it was time to pick in which city in Germany we are going to go to (we were not from the same major so we had a few cities in common to pick from) she went like a self cunt and picked a city that’s I can’t go to and she asked to pick a city near her and cried about it and acted like she would die without being near me so I picked a city with a really hard university, just to be somehow close to her (3hours by train) and I ignored my friends who asked me to go with them. After few months she was really depressed because she stopped doing yoga and some of her hobbies, and started to blame me for it, later on she said let’s take a break from each other for a while so she can get her life together, and I agreed. At this point for some reason I was madly in love with her so I didn’t wait for too long and I started to talk to her again but she was cold and kept giving me hints to break up for good after a while I was pissed and told her okay let’s break up if you want to that bad, and I blocked her on WhatsApp and Facebook then she  started to call me time after time so I blocked her number then she took he  sisters number and started calling but I turned of my phone. The next day she came to me at the university while she’s crying begging me to get back with her, and like a retard I did and everything went back to normal, a few months later she went to Germany before me after that she turned into a fuckin cold bitch barely talking to me and shit after her in a week I went to Germany, I met an old friend over there and hanged out with him and every time I go out with my friend that bitch starts to call me. And when I call her while she’s out with people from her university she starts a fuckin drama about how I don’t let her have fun with them. Later on every time I call her she starts telling me that shes busy studying and shit even though she didn’t study a shit and she would only call me before she sleeps and she doesn’t say a shit. During that time I started to have suicidal thoughts because I was struggling with the university and couldn’t pass the tests, I was alone , my German is shit, my old friend left for over a month. It was hard for me to create friendships due to language barrier. After that I told her about my suicidal thoughts she told me don’t come to me go to one of your friends. I was really struggling with having a reason to live, I was too depressed, I only left my room to buy cigarettes other than that I didn’t do anything. And I couldn’t tell me parents about it so they don’t worry about their son who’s far away from them. So I called on of my friends he was 6 hours by train from me and I went to him and stayed there for a while after that I went to that bitch and we talked about everything and we made up the next day me and that bitch went to get pizza then out of nowhere she no longer wants to eat and started acting weirdly and out of nowhere she mocked my suicidal thoughts, I was furious and burned out and told her to fuck off she walked away for a little bit then came back to me and started apologizing. We made up again after a while she went back to be moody af and asking for stuff. During this whole time I bought her shitloads of stuff, took care of her when she got really sick, stood by her side when she needed me. At the beginning of August I found a good offer to go back home because I wanted to go back to visit my family since I haven’t seen them in like 6 months, plus my sister in law was going to give birth to the first grandchild in our family. And when I told the bitch about my plan she started to beg me not to leave her and to stay with her  and the we can go somewhere for fun somewhere in Germany or  around it for a  cheap price because she didn’t has enough money to go back home . So I listened to her like a retard after 10 days she called me and told me her father booked a ticket to go back home to see her family and the cheap ticket that I have found was gone. I  was really pissed but I let go 3 days after that she called and broke up with me. After that she started to call me and cry how she still loves me, later on she sends me please don’t rape me and shit like that then she would call to check up on me and begs me not go clubbing and drink  a lot, I blocked her but she kept finding a way to get to me. At this point I was really mentally fucked up I failed everything at the university, I’m in the middle of nowhere with no one near or besides me I wanted to kill myself so bad but that bitch stopped me, until now I’m still mentally fucked up even though I’m traveling around meeting new people here and there. I do hate that bitch, and I want her to suffer like I’m suffering each day. Every time something nice happens to me and I’m happy af, my fuckin brain keeps reminding me of her ,my depression and suicidal thoughts. I don’t know what to do anymore I’m 24 yet I’m hopeless  depressed can’t live my life normally. When she came to my life I was cold , strong had a vision for myself, never suffered from depression, stress had no effect on me but now I’m the opposite. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m afraid that that I will end up with killing myself. Please help me figure out what to do with this fucked up life I ended up with."

I am a soon-to-be-graduating college senior. I have a job offer from my current internship, but I recently interviewed for a different position that I am much more interested in. However, if I were to get an offer from this other job then I would not be able to start for up to 9 months after because of the schedule of the hiring process.  I'm almost certainly going to accept the first offer, since I don't want to be waiting around with no income for up to 9 months.

My question is: If I were to accept the first job, knowing that I am planning on leaving in a relatively short time, should I be respectful tot hem and tell them up-front, or would it be fine to just tell them nothing at first and then only speak up a month or two before I leave for real?"

arglk4,35,2019-02-16,Anyone have experience looking for a job before graduating while pregnant?,sunshinewillbeinlife,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/arglk4/anyone_have_experience_looking_for_a_job_before/,"Dear all

I really need your advice and help. Really complicated situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a current graduate student and **I am going to graduate on December,2019.**

&amp;#x200B;

I just got a great summer internship offer two weeks ago. And the summer internship has large potential to become a return offer. But I just found out I am pregnant yesterday. And the baby should be delivered around **10/28**.  It really takes lots of my effort to get the internship offer and I think I still should go. Is there awkward to have a pregnant intern? I know in this case I may not get the return offer anymore, I will still try my best.

I just can't give up the opportunity and I still think I should go to intern (even in another state).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Now my concern is is it still possible that I can find a job before graduating? Will any employer accept me in this situation.** Since the baby will be delivered before the graduation, and I have my husband's mom to help to take care the baby, I am available to work once I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

**Should I delay my graduation to keep my student status in case I can't find a job?**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I really need a job after graduation because I am in financial stress. And I don't have a choice. I have to keep the baby because I have experienced a miscarriage last year.

My parents have blamed me a lot for the pregnancy, I am so stressful. My husband can't help a lot because he earned little and hard to support the family.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a german 22 year old guy that really wants to move to New Zealand. 

3 years ago, I visited the country on a Working Holiday visa, then came back to Germany and find myself in Australia right now, because I am looking for a way to get into New Zealand and become a resident. I want to live there.



I have looked at all different kinds of visas and options, and it seems like I have no other option than applying for a student visa, study over there for as long as possible, get the post study work visa and go from there.

Unfortunately, studing in NZ is insanely expensive for international students. It's like 22.000$ per year, which I am not able to afford AT ALL. 



As for sponsorship, I do not have studied in Germany, nor did I go through an internship, so the skill shortage list falls flat for me.

At the moment I applied for a hostel reception job, because I have a lot of experience on that one, which would offer sponsorship for the right candidate. But I probably won't be lucky on that one.



Therefore I am coming here to ask for any advice, possible options I could pursue and information in general! I hope you can help me out a bit :)

Cheers!"
arh2rt,89,2019-02-16,A day out with Zomato friend on Delivery,saif_shines,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/arh2rt/a_day_out_with_zomato_friend_on_delivery/,"I recently heard this news that one of my friends has got placed in Cognizant. *Woah, great news*, I congratulated him and conversation continued. He told,

&gt;*I'm going to Cognizant Internship on Weekdays, and on Weekends he's on Delivery duty with Zomato.*

Out of Curiosity, I told him if I could join him on a day in delivery here in Chennai and go on Deliveries with him. Here's a short compiled list of things that I learnt from, and I would like to pen them down for you.

## So, here you go,

* When asked, why did he chose to be a Delivery guy, his answer was pretty much straight saying, "" I was bored in the room and couldn't stay"", so chose this to keep himself busy.
* The next reason that he stated was the amount he was earning, he goes to intern at Cognizant from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, sometimes longer **every day** for a month. But he earns Rs. 12,000 INR but same time spend on this delivery services get him Rs. 40,000 INR per month, depending upon the orders he delivers. Later, when he got busy with Cognizant, he chose to do it on Weekends.
* He was very conscious that Job at Cognizant is secure and scalable down the line in next 3 - 5 years, while working a delivery guy is not.
* He intentionally asked his dad that, to drop him an amount fixed of Rs. 6000 INR in his account. Anything beyond the expenses of Rs. 6000, he would take from his own earned savings.
* He spent the initial amount from his friend, to get a Pre-owned Bike. Which he later turned into his own in 2 weeks of full-day service on Zomato.
* He's very much clear and passionate about doing some business and is definitely on this way. While Job acts something secure for his parents &amp; the society.
* He also has one of his colleague in Zomato who also works Cognizant and earns Rs. 1,50,000 INR per month. But, he joined Zomato along.

## While that was very pretty much about him, and his experience with the delivery goes this way,

* On December 31, 2018, he wasn't actually ready or in a mood to enjoy the new year. Zomato app for Delivery guys was pretty much easy, they just have to **toggle between online/offline.**
* So, he just kept his phone online, and got an Order that late night, and exactly at 12:01 AM he went on to the doorstep to deliver the order.

&gt;*""The customer, took the order, shared me the new year cake &amp; hugged me. Also, showed me so much gratitude.""*

* This guy was special, since he was pretty much familiar with technology than the other uneducated delivery guys, he used to understand the exact address &amp; map locations. The best part was, **he only does doorstep delivery**, no matter it's on 4-5 floor Apartment.
* If the phones go below 20% of charge, the app doesn't work. Once set 'Online', the app takes the complete control over the phone. You cannot turn the phone off or put it in silent mode, soon.
* Sometimes they have classes. They are taught to wear shoes and behave politely.
* Zomato only allows you to become a delivery for one particular Region who you chose to deliver to. You cannot go beyond that.
* All their batch take Group Photos when they wait near a restaurant and have their own WhatsApp group. He's a Batch POC to remaining 22 members of his batch. (Similar to Class Representative in Colleges :P)
* There are few people, who think they'll get more orders to deliver if he waits for nearest to the computer of the manager in the restaurant he's waiting in. That sounds funny, but it is true. More orders are like more marks.

**How do you get an order that has to be delivered on mobile?**

""I need to toggle to Active mode, once that's done as soon as some order is ready for me to get it delivered, the restaurant owner and I will get a screen asking to accept the order. I need to swipe it. Then I have to go to the Restaurant owner to get an OTP and enter in my app. (Which basically says the customer, the Delivery boy has reached the restaurant) Once swiped, Order details will appear to get the food to deliver."" he said.

**Do you know who is the CEO of Zomato is?**

**""I don't know who CEO is, (laughs), but if you ask the same to my colleagues here on service waiting along with others on they don't even know what 'CEO' is!""** *That said, I've asked him an irrelevant question, maybe.*

**Share me one interesting incident that happened with you?**

""Once there was one of us, who took a U-Turn in the wrong direction. It was Delivery boy's mistake. But when police caught him, all the delivery boys in that area joins to please the officer to leave him. The interesting part is, it just takes on WhatsApp message in the group, and all the guys in the batch will turn their **Active status off** and suddenly, no delivery boy will be available to serve customers.""

## Safety

Well that being said, for any delivery guys the biggest nightmare while they go on a delivery is Safety. Of course, I've experienced that part to. We were going calm straight, and suddenly met with an accident.

We were probably lucky enough that we didn't go with any serious injuries, but just a few minor ones.

So here's a picture of the bike that's damaged. - **Removed**

&amp;#x200B;

Looks like something serious happened.

## Finally,

After learning so much from him, here's what I just said what I want to,

*""I really love the values you hold, You are very much conscious and practical about the life and now, you already took action to build it the right way, while there are millions fail pick. I see you also have personal targets to save money and measure your success by the amount of money you make. While that's quite a good practical metric, there's also my last piece of advice for you. Money is only a need &amp; business is what you want to do. Figure out Why you want to do anything you plan for.""*"
arh68v,1,2019-02-16,80k of dept upon graduation,Ludrew,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/arh68v/80k_of_dept_upon_graduation/,"Hi guys, I'm a junior in CS at a public state university in the U.S. and I'm looking at having approximately $80k in debt upon graduation. Is it worth it? I don't know what else I could do. I'm currently looking at paid internships, so that might help, but this is still a lot of money to pay off.  I have half my tuition paid for by scholarship, yet I still face this. Tuition is $6000 a year including my scholarship, and housing is also around $6000 a year for this area. It's very difficult to find a place cheaper to live.  That's $20000 a year with taxes and whatnot. I really enjoy the tech field, and I work on a lot of side projects, so I know I'm in the right field. I have a 3.35 gpa. I would work part time, but the time commitment for a job is crazy compared to the pittance you would make for an unskilled job. What do you guys think? Should I tough it out and hope I land good paying internships while I'm in school? I worry about this a lot, and I don't have close family to talk with this about, so I've always just had this weighing on my shoulders."
arhju2,156,2019-02-17,Koroshiya,poloniumpoisoning,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/arhju2/koroshiya/,"My grandfather committed suicide in 1990, when I was a child. His body was found by me and my parents, who lived with him at the time; being his son, my father fell apart before the gruesome scene: an old man hanging from the ceiling, his fresh corpse still softly swinging to the sides.

It was up to my mother to quickly try to protect me from the awful truth, but it was too late. Seeing him dead really messed me up in the head and deeply damaged me emotionally, no matter how much therapy I’ve been through in the last three decades.

Before climbing the stool and kicking it so the rope would tighten around his already fragile neck, my grandfather cut one of his wrists and wrote the weird word in blood across his white shirt: *koroshiya*.

I had no idea what this meant back then, being only 6. The only thing I remember were my father’s hysterical cries, as my mother screamed for help, always placing her big hand over my eyes like a blindfold. The neighbors came and called the police and an ambulance.

“Do you wanna know why, Marcus?” my mother asked my father, a few days later.

“I don’t. I’m afraid he’s not the good man I know”.

So she gave my grandfather’s suicide letter to my uncle, but made a copy. It was years later that I found it.

My grandfather died at 68; he was old, but not ancient, and probably not too close to death by natural causes.

After two years, my father was a total mess. My mother divorced him so we didn’t have to suffer through his alcohol problems; he was never aggressive, he just cried until he blacked out from the booze and couldn’t keep a job anymore.

For years I wondered why, but it was always in the back of my head. I tried not to think about it. My mother worked hard to make my life good and provide on her own everything I needed, both money and affection-wise.

A few weeks after we moved to another place, I overheard my mother complaining to her friend that my grandfather was inconsiderate, and that stuck to me. To this day, I can repeat what she said word by word.

“It’s a tragedy that the old man committed suicide, but damn! That’s so inconsiderate. I don’t even care about me or his son, but he knew Amelia would be there when we found the body, dammit! And that entire scene with the strange word in blood? What was he thinking?”

I was 20 when I first read the letter.

&gt;No one knows what it’s like to hold the future of the Earth in your hands. I never told anyone, not even my wife, but I worked in the making of one of the biggest carnages of our story: the atomic bomb.  
&gt;  
&gt;I was so young. I was somewhat an intern, running unimportant errands for the important men. They told me I had future. They told me I wasn’t going to make it if I was weak. Because there would be no future for anybody.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the time, I was shown dreams. Of how the Germans would destroy everything if we didn’t stop them. Japan was a strategic place for them, and ravaging the distant country would greatly impact the Nazis.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was the only way, they told me.  
&gt;  
&gt;So I stayed. I almost wished the one to be sacrificed was me, but I knew it would amount to nothing. I feared more than anything a purposeless death.  
&gt;  
&gt;Well, look at me now.  
&gt;  
&gt;In my dreams, the beautiful, hard-working people from Japan told me I had nothing to worry. That they knew. That they were ready to be sacrificed. But I guess that, even if that was true, their mothers and fathers and children and brothers were not.  
&gt;  
&gt;“There’s no way Hitler is right and Albert Einstein is wrong”, my boss told me. I respected him greatly. He was an important man on The Manhattan Project.  
&gt;  
&gt;I asked myself every day and still do: was that really necessary?  
&gt;  
&gt;The first time I saw a picture of a distorted body – something I was part of – I went home and cried for three days straight.  
&gt;  
&gt;I had terrible nightmares in the last 45 years. The families, they accuse me. They haunt me. I wonder if that’s the same for everyone else involved.  
&gt;  
&gt;Did we save the world or did we doom it? Or did we just unnecessarily hurt a lot of innocent people?  
&gt;  
&gt;Yesterday, I went to the supermarket. I was walking carefree, as carefree as a man with thousands of murders on his shoulders can be. Then I noticed I was the only western person in the aisle. Everyone else was Japanese.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have been called a xenophobe for the last years because I can’t stand the sight of eastern people; I know in my heart that I’m not, and it happens because seeing them makes me break down crying like a boy, and relive my nightmares of guilty; I’d rather hide the truth, but now that I am telling it, one can imagine my terror when I found myself in this situation.  
&gt;  
&gt;“They don’t know you’re scared of them. Move naturally. Find the exit. Leave your cart”, I told myself, in a futile attempt to avoid desperation.  
&gt;  
&gt;One of them turned to face me. It was a girl, no older than 13, and it gave me a started me terribly. As she opened her mouth, tears started flowing from my eyes.  
&gt;  
&gt;She whispered the word *Koroshiya*.  
&gt;  
&gt;One by one, they all turned to my direction and chanted in a macabre tone.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Koroshiya.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Koroshiya.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Koroshiya.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Their eyes were unblinking, gaze fixed on me. They slowly approached me, reaching their hands in my direction. I tried to escape, but my legs were lead. I tried harder to escape, but all the aisles were full of them, and they blocked the exit. I cried and begged for forgiveness.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Oh, it’s okay” a woman with a baby stroller said, very calmly. “Just let me melt your son to death and we’re even”.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Give me your grandkids” a woman probably older than 80 spoke, her raspy voice full of pain. “I’ll give them back to you with incurable cancer to succumb in your arms”.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I curse you, James Herald Stone. I curse you and your sons and the sons of your sons. You’re not even close to atoning for what you did to my people. Your bloodline will pay dearly for this.” a very young man spitted the words, drawing closer.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Koroshiya.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Koroshiya.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Koroshiya.*  
&gt;  
&gt;They closed in on me, always chanting in unison, reaching for my exposed skin. As their fingertips touched me, I felt a terrible burn and pain like a million needles. It was like having my body covered in acid, then pierced over and over.  
&gt;  
&gt;With a dreadful scream, I passed out.  
&gt;  
&gt;I woke up to a paramedic leaning over me.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Sir? Do you feel better?”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Huh…?” was the only thing I could articulate.  
&gt;  
&gt;“You passed out in the supermarket. People said you had a panic attack”.  
&gt;  
&gt;Am I delirious? Did I see things that are not there?  
&gt;  
&gt;I easily accepted that. After all I’ve been through, it’s obvious that I would have PTSD. I wanted to have my wife by my side, to tell her about everything and cry in her lap, like the desperate, tiny thing that I am now. But she’s long gone; it’s been over a decade that life took her from me, and I would never bother my boys and girls — all adults and with their own boys and girls now — about it.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was funny how I thought that I would rather die than tell my sons the horrors I caused and dreamed of all my life. Because I will.  
&gt;  
&gt;The ambulance took me home, convinced it was nothing serious. I went to bed, had my share of horrific nightmares for the night, and got up. My son James Junior and his family are currently living with me and I appreciate it. It gets lonely during daytime, but I love having a full table for dinner and a child’s laughter filling the air.  
&gt;  
&gt;Junior and his family had already left the house as usual. Today the weather was great, so I decided to take a small walk across the neighborhood. I have to be in shape to play with Amelia and my other grandkids, I thought.  
&gt;  
&gt;And as I got out, there it was. The word. In red graffiti, right there in my wall. *Koroshiya*.  
&gt;  
&gt;I know it means murderer. And I know that’s what I am. I apologize to anyone that may care about me. I just want to be reunited with my old lady, and cry in her lap, like the desperate, tiny thing that I am.  
&gt;  
&gt;— James H. Stone”

I don’t know how I felt about my grandfather, because I barely remember what life with him was like. What I remember is seeing his horrible recently dead body, and my mother’s words. What I remember is my father choosing to be worthless for the rest of his life, and barely acknowledging my existence. Him crying in front of our house after the divorce, pleading for my mother to take him back, countless nights.

I slid a copy of my grandfather’s suicide letter under the door of my father’s crappy apartment, where he spends the whole day feeling sorry for himself for almost 30 years, only able to survive thanks to a modest share of his father’s money and, I assume, the generosity of his siblings.

Using spray paint, I wrote the word *Koroshiya* on his door. Let’s see where this goes.

As I said, finding my grandfather’s corpse at only 6 irreparably messed me in the head[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPoisoningTales/)"

I have a 3.97 uw GPA with 4.7 weighted. I will have 14 aps by the end of this year (currently 7 5s and 2 4s). Am female in a STEM field. Have a couple leadership positions in 3 smallish school clubs and did research over the summer. Internship as a website developer for a failed start up company

 I really regret not applying to not so prestigious schools that give money. I am also terrified of debt.

Sad times all around. Good luck to you all! :D"

I want to put myself in the best position I can be so when it's time to apply, I can be honest with myself and say that I was diligent and not have thoughts of ""if only i started studying earlier"" or ""i should done x in my personal time"". With that said, I would appreciate any advice/suggestions for me on what I can do until my graduation.

**Background:**

* Expected to graduate in December 2019
* Attending a California University (unranked)
* Attending first hackathon in March
* Grinded LeetCode/HackerRank somewhat heavily in the winter, but less now since school started. I try to get a couple of hours of practice on the weekends.
* I immediately start my school projects as they are assigned to make more time for personal studies.
* Been more active with my campus's computer science club
* If time permits, I attend data structure review sessions hosted by professors' student aids
* Currently hunting for a summer 2019 internship (+100 applications), only related experience is mentoring STEM subjects to K-12 students
* Saved project ideas that relate to positions I plan to apply
* Reading Cracking the Code Interview (CTCI) / Clean Code / Algorithm textbooks and general articles pertaining to software engineering (usually from [/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming) or [/r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming))
* Listening to tech podcasts (e.g. [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/podcast/) / [This Week in Tech](https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech))
* Watching video series ([Berkeley's Data Structures by Josh Hug](https://sp19.datastructur.es/), [Stanford Engineering Everywhere](https://see.stanford.edu/Course), [MIT's Algorithms Course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1))
* Keeping my LinkedIn updated
* GitHub is currently filled with just school projects(some more notable than others)

&amp;#x200B;

*On a more personal note:*  I don't see myself as a smart person, especially when it comes to new concepts or technologies. I find myself always having a (pretty) slow start, but tend to speed up once I break a certain barrier (if that makes sense). I also jumped on the Computer Science train only somewhat recently (did not even know Computer Science was a major until 3 years ago). So by no means am I a great programmer, but I'm trying to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance everyone! Wish you all luck on your own endeavors."

I'll start with where I am, where I want to go, and maybe you guys can help fill in that big gap in between. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a student at the University of Toronto in Computer science / math. I am graduating hopefully next year. I've never done an internship. 

=== BIG GAP === 

I want to someday work in the San Fran / Seattle. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm trying to be realistic, I don't think it'll happen within a couple years. Some steps I can think of are just keep applying to internships for this summer (I know it's late :( ) locally, and really push to get somewhere, even small. But I'll probably be graduating the year after that. What are my chances of landing a job with just one internship? How can I stand out, aside from doing tons of leetcode? How can I even get an opportunity to get an interview I guess? My GPA isn't great at all tbh. 

Edit: Thanks for all the great aDvice!! I know, it does seem a little stupid not too have internships / experience. I actually had some health issues that dragged me down, so for a while I thought I wouldn’t be going anywhere and I wasn’t very optimistic or even looking past the next few weeks. Now that’s changed and I find myself at this impasse, which is why I wanted some guidance. So thanks everyone!

I'm doing A level this year, and I'm predicted A-A* in all of the subjects I'm doing (Physics-Chem-Maths-Further Maths). I'm taking the SAT next month, but I've been getting 1560-1570 in my recent official practice tests.

I currently live in Morocco (and have been here for 10+ years), and I've got dual citizenship (Norway-Morocco). The problem is, there doesn't seem to be many opportunities for me in terms of internships or competitions in tech stuff, especially considering I want to major in CS. I've tried looking for US internships/comps/hackathons/clubs but it seems they're mostly for US residents/citizens.

I'm currently working on a revision webapp, but I've got tons of unfinished concept apps. Not sure if that helps. I also play guitar (Major time investment, not for college but for myself).

Any help? I'm willing to spend some money in order to improve my ECs as long as the activities are not too expensive and actually worth my money (compared to summer programs which everyone says will not help). I'm willing to apply to T20 schools especially since I'll need financial aid and they seem to be the ones that give out most of it. "
arjcem,2,2019-02-17,Should I continue in the field of Computer Science even if I hate everything about it?,piagnucolone-,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/arjcem/should_i_continue_in_the_field_of_computer/,"I graduated CompSci and Maths BSc, applied for Data Science MSc (currently in the first semester of four) and I'm totally unsure of my career choice.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is.. I was a great student in high school, I was good in almost every subject and didn't have a clear idea of what to study in uni, so I chose what was prospective - CompSci and Maths (I always loved Maths). Oh, how I wish I was back at that breaking point, choosing again. I would never have opted for the CompSci, never. I didn't even like the first uni years, but I couldn't get over myself (I'm not a quitter) and the courses weren't too hard so I finished what I started (with a good GPA). I wanted to switch a bit more to the Math spectrum, so I opted for Data Science MSc (different university), but because of my stupidity and poor pre-assessment of the curriculum, I am totally disappointed and have been continuously crying for the past half a year of attending this MSc. Programme is too technically-computer centric, almost no Maths and I hate the new university environment. Moreover, I already listened to most of the topics on my BSc. I've already decided to quit the MSc, but I'm still not sure if I should really quit (if this makes sense haha).

&amp;#x200B;

I despise programming (that doesn't mean I am bad at it), I did one internship at a more interdisciplinary company (medical devices) and have been crying for 6-months doing the internship - the interdisciplinarity was good, but still too much programming. I am at a breaking point, I genuinely don't know how to proceed. I know, and I hear it from people around me all the time, I can land good jobs in software/programming sector. I don't want them, but no one understands.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I have missed the bandwagon to pursue a career I would really enjoy (can't afford another BSc). Should I stick to the data science/software sector just to earn for a living? Should I finish the Data Science MSc at all? Or does it make sense to do a Statistics MSc instead, that I would probably enjoy much more or do let's say Quantitative Finance/Financial Engineering MSc that I think would've been of a bigger interest to me (still not ideal, but..)? Any thoughts, ideas? Another thing that popped up is Cognitive Science MSc, totally interesting (computer-philosophy-neuroscience connection) but totally unemployable I guess?

&amp;#x200B;

(If anyone was wondering, I would've done whatever BUT CompSci - most likely I would've opted for career in medicine, either medicine, pharmacy or radiology; but at this point I feel that even if I chose say civil engineering I would've been happier. And no, I don't have a family sponsoring me, I've worked my ass off doing part-time jobs while studying and am currently living and paying for MSc with my savings.)"

I am starting a paid internship in software development in a few months. Last year I left my computer science degree after 2 years because it did not offer any work experience and there were people graduating from my course who couldn't get jobs due to the lack of work experience.

I took a risk leaving and fortunately I came across an internship program, but it was just luck. So I will be starting that in a few months. Right now I have a lot of free time and I am hoping to get some work experience in a software company. Even if it is just for a few days I think I would get a lot of value out of it. 

I have created a list of emails of companies that I would like to get some experience at, but I am not sure what to say or if I am wasting my time doing this. I have done experience in python and java, but it is nothing intermediate. Does anyone have any experience with this or any tips for me?

Thanks in advance."
arkosx,2,2019-02-17,"Looking for &lt;$1500 gaming laptop, does anyone have reviews for the MSI GP Series GP63 Leopard-428 on sale ($1379) at newegg? Any good reasons to buy something else? (Needs somewhat flexible, and described inside)",Ziddletwix,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/arkosx/looking_for_1500_gaming_laptop_does_anyone_have/,"* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
Let’s say $1500, but price can be flexible. I could go more expensive if it makes a big difference, and I wouldn’t mind something cheaper (as my needs aren’t too demanding). I’ll be purchasing from the USA.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
Best specifications, and reliability. This will be largely used as a portable, and I’ll use my Mac laptop for my daily work.

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
Not particularly important. The vast majority of its use will be at home.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
Windows.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
At least 15”. 

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
This will be a gaming laptop. If it could stream occasionally (like screen sharing over Discord), that would be great.

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
My main games are fairly undemanding (MTG Arena, Overwatch, Starcraft 2, Age of Empires 2, Battlerite, Skyrim, Diablo). I’d like to be able to run the simple games easily on high settings, and the more involved ones (like Overwatch) very smoothly, but top settings not mandatory. I’d also like to have the option to be able to play modern games on occasion (AC:Unity, Witcher 3, etc, which my current laptop can’t do). However, as this will only be occasional, so it’s fine if it’s not the top settings, I just want it to play well.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
I’d place a reasonable premium on reliable build quality (I won’t put a ton of constant mileage on it, but I really don’t want to have to spend time fixing it!). I also need a good number of USB ports, as when I’m at home sometimes I consider hooking it up to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse (on occasion).

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
For a long time, I’ve been considering buying a new desktop, but I realized that I'm still ""on the move"" enough that a laptop would make more sense (for example, temporarily moving this summer to a new city for an internship, and I don't  have a car) This will largely be used as an occasional luxury gaming PC, so while I’m not sure I need one of the 10lb+ behemoths, it’s fine if it’s not the easiest to bring to a coffee shop.

I understand that my gaming needs outlined above aren’t the most demanding. That’s why I’m serious about being fairly flexible. If there was a suitably good model, I could easily be convinced to go cheaper (maybe to a GTX1060), which would be ample for my usual gaming needs, and I wouldn’t worry too much about how well the machine can run 2018 AAA games. Or I could definitely be convinced to spend a bit more and get a powerful machine that would be flexible for a wide range of my gaming needs going forward! 

* **For the actual laptop discussion.**
In my initial search, the [MSI GP Series GP63 Leopard-428 15.6""](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834154900) sold at newegg really stood out. It’s got a GTX 1070 and generally great specs for $1379 (for the current sale, which ends in two days). None of the other reasonable machines with these specs are even close to this price point. So… is there a reason not to buy this? Is there a catch? Does anyone have any experience with this model/brand? Is it cheap because it's poorly made?

Not knowing a ton about laptops, this seems substantially more powerful than anything else under $1500 that I can find for now (but if there are others, please let me know). I think my other best option is that I could probably do just fine with a GTX 1060, and not worry about modern games quite as much. Do people have advice for the most reliable and solid 15”+ screen gaming laptop under $1400 that runs a GTX 1060? I imagine that the advantage of this over the MSI GP I linked is that it might be better built, so that would be the priority. I really don’t want a laptop that ends up giving me tons of issues because it overheats, or the hardware gives me trouble.

Any and all advice is welcome! I’m a bit out of date with the gaming hardware world, so I could use some guidance.

 1. was for my Spanish class. For both Spanish 1 and 2. The teacher allowed us to Literally just read from the slides since she knew that most people weren't good at talking Spanish. So thats how I managed to do it even though I'm fluent in Spanish.

2. For a computee science class. Long story short, it was a train wreak. i stuttered and it was awful and cringy. I blame myself for not being prepared. 

3. Supposubly it was for a physics class but I chose not to do it and got a 0. Although i still passed with a low 70 though since it was like 20% so its all good.

4. Speech class. I enrolled I this class twice and twice I dropped it because I just can't deal with the pressure of speaking in class. I managed to 'survive' the first couple of weeks in this class but stopped attending since just sitting in the lecture room, id start to feel incredibly nervous, shaky and uneasy.

5. I'm currently  taking a class that requires me to do a presentation at the end of the semester. Obviously I'm not sure if ill be able to pass this one since its worth 30% of my overall grade. 

Overrall, ive always been quiet and shy. I dont have friends at college. At first I hated that but I learned to be ok with it and it doesn't bother me no more. The only friends I have are my old high school friends but I rarely see them since they don't go to college.I tried following the classic 'join a club' advice and I did do it. It always emds up the same. Everyone is has their groups of friends. Even if I do try to interact with them, they usually briefly reply but them focus on what their group is doing. I did briefly volunteer but the same thing would happen.

My grades are bad because I would rather just use Google to get answers to questions rather than go to office hours. I have no internships but tried to go to career fairs. Most of the time it ends up the same. I come of as awkward and weird. 

Part of me feels like ill never get my degree because I just can't deal with speaking in class or people in general and I've considered dropping completely. I realize that as I advance further in my degree (Computer science), I'm required to do more presentations. 

So I'm curious how y'all introverts/socially anxious/awkward people managed to survive this?

***Current Situation***: 
23 y/o. 4th year civil Engineering student. Decent Canadian uni. 2.6 GPA. 2 internships, one in construction project management at one of Canada's most technologically advanced hospital. No real noteworthy extracurriculars. Spent most of my time in school studying in order to increase my GPA, working part time and applying for internships. I'd say I'm probably dumber on average compared most other engineering students based of the ROI I've gotten from the time I've invested studying. I also jumped around between computer engineering which absolutely killed my GPA since I got straight D's and F's for 6 second year courses. Things improved a bit after I got to civil. Have three semesters left and will have to take an extra semester probably. Been getting B's and A's past semester and maybe this one for all third year courses. Will be $50k CAD in debt after all is said and done. Come from a poor family and I have to support my widowed mom who's getting old and can't work. I have 5 siblings very supportive and the 3 of us of earning age redistribute portions of our incomes as needed.




**Clear defined Goals***: 

-At least have the capability to be able to enrol into an MBA program. 

-$100-120k salary by 30 ideally. (Its possible working in construction management if you make all the absolute right moves.). I want to go over this if I can but it's not possible in an engineering field. However I think with an MBA you could do it since you could move into management.

-Have $3.5-4.5k from passive investment incomes. I'm thinking these would be rental properties. Not sure how to invest in that stuff yet and too in debt to take that risk. But the earlier this happens the better.

-Be financially literate at an advanced level where I feel confident investing and in my money managing abilities.



***Extraneous &amp; other vague goals***:

-Financial independence by 40-45 y/o. Generally Pretty frugal guy. Don't know how much spending would increase if I get married/ have kids.

-Pay off debt by 27 y/o.

-Have a side business that i can grow. No set age when to pursue this.

-Ideally work 40 hour weeks after 35 y/o, have better mental health and be at a point where im not a completely socially inept weirdo and have to spend alot of time and money dealing with with therapy, anxiety and being a workaholic to compensate etc.



Last two goals I think are very unlikely before 40 given that this goal would clash with having a decent paying job but who knows. I am willing to forgo these two options to work in management if it pays well enough.







So I guess the question is that is getting an MBA even possible at this point? If it is, is it concurrent with my goals and would it help investing that time and money into it? 



Thanks and would love to hear any opinions and thoughts."

~$1800, USA

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 

Battery life is not terribly important. I hope to get a monitor to plug my laptop in to and use at home. 2 in 1 could be cool, since it would allow me to download cases/books rather than buying the physical copies. Then I could annotate them and organize the notes on my computer rather than paper, since I am not the best with keeping papers organized.

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**

Somewhat important. I don't need an ultra thin book. I just don't want a super heavy, bulky laptop.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**

I have been using a Mac OS since 2013 and I only have Apple products. I used Linux at one of my internships and liked that too. I'm just worried about the Windows bloatware. 

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 

I have been using 13 inch and it has been fine for what I have been doing. With a monitor, I shouldn't have any space issues if I decide to go with a smaller screen. 

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 

None. I do enjoy playing games, however, I don't have the best self control and I'm worried that I will play too much in Law School. 

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 

If I do play, it would be games like LOL, warframe, potentially Halo Infinite if it looks good. Decent settings and maybe 60+ FPS 

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 

Good keyboard, reliable, enough ports 

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

While I have been using Mac OS, I'm totally open to switching. I'm not totally sold on the ButterFly keyboard or the touchbar. Also, I'm not planning on entering Law School until 2020, so this is more a way to research which computers I should keep my eye on over the next year and a half. I will most likely buy it next summer."

armzgd,14,2019-02-17,CS minor more appropriate for me?,HealTheSick,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/armzgd/cs_minor_more_appropriate_for_me/,"***Where I'm At***  
I'm currently taking a semester off from classes, working full time as an intern. I worked my butt off to get to this point. For over a year my big goal was to get work experience in some sort of software role. Doing well in my classes and applying to dozens of positions paid off. The money is good. I'm making enough to actually save for a safety cushion so that I can move out of my parents house once I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Problem***

The problem is that I'm not very happy there. I'm not miserable, but I'm really not happy. I don't particularly believe in the mission of the group. I don't feel like I'm learning or improving skills that I would want to utilize for the rest of my working career. I'm either bored or stressed, rarely engaged. I like my coworkers, but I don't care for the work.

This caught me by surprise because I really enjoyed my computing classes at university. I had an incredible professor who really kept me motivated and focused on growth. I learned so many cool concepts like different types of data structures and object oriented programming. I aced every computing class I took and was on the Dean's List. I was really engaged and passionate about the subject there. I'm disturbed that this isn't applying to my work. I'm confused as to whether or not that this means I have chosen the wrong major, or just the wrong company.

&amp;#x200B;

***Possible Solutions***

I've always considered myself more talented in soft skills like writing, teaching, and engaging. I feel like I would be better suited to a product management role, specifically because it requires more interpersonal skills. Don't get me wrong, it would absolutely piss me off if the manager of a team of technical developers was not skilled in the technical aspects of what the team is making. However there are people who are fantastic developers who are not so great with people, I think we can all agree.

Maybe after this internship is over and I apply for future positions, I could focus more in that field, and continue working towards my computer science bachelor's degree to grow my technical skills. I have a hard time believing a degree in management would be more beneficial to me (even if I am interested in management), than a computer science degree would.

On the other hand, I am seriously considering having computer science as a minor, not a major, and instead take more classes that will help me improve and grow in what I know I am more suited for: writing, persuasion, debate, and presenting. I'm certain that these skills will apply to work in the tech sector as technology becomes more intuitive and easy to pick up. Anyone who has ever been in a situation where they're disagreeing with the direction of where the team is going in knows this. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Wrap-up***

I would like another opinion on this. If you told me a semester ago that I would be making a case for dropping computer science as a major and picking up something like philosophy, I would assume I had a head injury or a terrible professor. I have neither, so this is overall very strange. 

I am passionate about technology and computing, which is why I'm so confused as to why I'm not thriving in my first full time software development position. Maybe I'm just not cut out for full time, private sector work. The way my career is going right now with this internship leaves much to be desired, and I know my education has a significant role to play in this. I would like some help in figuring that out."

arppa5,5,2019-02-17,Horrible idea to choose tech-related volunteering over a software development internship in the summer?,conflicted1010110111,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/arppa5/horrible_idea_to_choose_techrelated_volunteering/,"Right now I'm in the position where I'm deciding what to do for my summer, and I've got an offer to either volunteer and do tech work at a small nation in South America, or accept a software dev internship at a well-known (but not particularly great) tech company (not Big N, think more like eBay or IBM- you have heard of it but it's not known for being prestigious).

The volunteering is tech-related and the team will be building software for an organization at the country, and it is something I want to do wholeheartedly; the organization that sponsors it is also well-known. I greatly enjoy volunteering and I really want the experience to travel to this country and be able to help the local organizations out.

However, while it is my dream, I also have to consider what is necessary for a CS career. My parents and relatives have basically been ripping their hair out trying to convince me to take the software development internship offer- they think it is a career killer if I do not have anything substantial on my resume for this summer, and do not think the volunteering will hold any weight. Honestly I've looked up the internship and it doesn't seem great, bad location and bad reviews on Glassdoor, and I don't think I will be learning much there. All I will be getting out of it is the name of the company on my resume.

I was wondering if you experienced gurus of the CS world could help shed some light on this. Would it be such a terrible idea to do volunteer work that is tech-related, as opposed to actually taking a software development internship just for the company's name on a resume?

It might be necessary to note that I will be graduating quite soon as well; however, I have zero intentions of working full-time for that company I received the offer from.

Thank you for your time! Any input is much appreciated.

Edit: I should mention that I already have a software dev internship experience on my resume. This volunteering opportunity is also an internship, but is unpaid and is referred to more as volunteering by the staff members of the organization that offer it."
arpyrq,0,2019-02-17,Math &amp; CS Student taking ECE 391 instead of CS 241?,csquestions5583292,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/arpyrq/math_cs_student_taking_ece_391_instead_of_cs_241/,"Hey everyone, so basically I'm in a situation where based on a program that I really want to do in the fall, I might have to take ECE 391 instead of CS 241 for the 241 credit required in the Math &amp; CS degree. I don't want to get into the details of why I'm in this situation, and I know ECE 391 is a huge meme on this thread so I am very terrified. I would be willing to put in the crazy amount of work and basically take it with a bunch of Gen-Eds, but I'm worried because I tried to take an ECE course this semester (ECE 365, Fundamentals of Machine Learning) and I ended up dropping it for two reasons:

1 - I was taking a lot of other heavy courses at the time while doing an internship, so I just didn't have time to commit to a course not required

2 - For the probability &amp; statistics part, they drew a lot of material from ECE 313 which covers stuff that my transfer credit for STAT 400 did not cover, and it seemed like a very ECE way of handling probability.

&amp;#x200B;

\#1 won't be a problem because I will make sure to only take ECE 391 with a light courseload, my main worry is #2, and the fact that ECE 391 might make me learn systems programming with an ECE spin on things, a lot of which I might not have taken in previous CS classes.

&amp;#x200B;

If I go this route, by the time I take ECE 391 I would have:

\-Transfer credit for CS 225 in Java, I know ECE 391 is very C heavy, but on the website they have a guide for learning C if you don't have C experience, which I fully intend to study over the summer to make sure I know C going into the course.

\-Taken CS 233 (Computer Architecture), which would be the extent of my knowledge of Assembly programming. I also got an A in it, and I know it's one of the official prereqs for 391.

\-As for programming experience, I would have \~4 software engineering internships under my belt, and have taken a decent amount of programming courses (CS 242, CS 421, other technical electives, etc...) so I do feel that my programming maturity will be there for ECE 391.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, is there anything that I would be behind on related to my peers if I went into the course with the courses listed above? My main worries are (possibly) not knowing assembly well enough as opposed to what level I would be at in ECE 220, although CS 233 had a pretty decent amount of Verilog and MIPS assembly,  or stuff maybe learned in other ECE classes (385, etc...) that I might be missing going into ECE 391.

&amp;#x200B;

Would I be fine going into ECE 391 if I was willing to put in the crazy amount of work, or will it just not be doable given my lack of ECE class experience?

I am struggling with the job search and was hoping the internet might help.

&amp;#x200B;

I've spent most of the last decade working as a mortgage banker, and am trying to transition to a software engineering role.  I have a bachelor's degree in economics from a state university, and a computer programming certificate from a community college.  I continue to self-educate - currently working through Harvard's CS50 course, as well as the CTCI and EPI books, LeetCode, HackerRank, educational Meetups, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was let go from my mortgage banking job in the summer of 2018 after telling my boss that I was planning to change careers (I know - not a great idea to be honest with your boss about those things).  I've been applying for software engineering jobs since then.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've been going to a ton of meetups to network, and have been applying to jobs through LinkedIn/Indeed as well as applying directly on company websites.  I'm not geographically constrained, and have applied to jobs all over the country.  I've submitted almost 300 applications, which have netted me 3 first round technical interviews.  I am confident that my programming skills are at least at a level where I can handle a junior/associate position or an internship.  I just can't seem to land an initial interview to even prove myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my resume and LinkedIn profile are decent, and I have a GitHub account with a sample of the programs I have written - nothing too crazy on there, but to show that I at least have some clue of what I am doing.  I've been lurking on GitHub trying find an open source project to contribute to, but I don't really know how to start.

&amp;#x200B;

I rarely get feedback on the job applications, but when I do it is typically that the company wants someone with commercial experience.  When I manage to get a recruiter on the phone, I sell my transferable skills, which I know are not a substitute for commercial programming experience, but should have some value.  My friends at tech companies have referred me for roles, and the only thing I've received from those are the auto-rejection emails.  I naively believed that those internal referrals would at least put my application in front of a human - I was wrong about that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not even going to start on the agency recruiters that have been driving me absolutely nuts.  That is as an entire post by itself.

&amp;#x200B;

I was lucky to have some money saved up when I was let go from my job, but the funds are running low, and I am seriously starting to panic.  That's to say nothing about the depression and anxiety that have been building up as this continues to drag on.

&amp;#x200B;

What is everyone's approach for learning new technologies?

It was really late and I was half asleep when it started ringing. It took a few seconds for my eyes to adjust to the light before I could read the caller ID.

What I saw didn’t make sense. It must have been a joke because this is what was on the screen:

X (666) 666 – 666

Written under the number was:

THE Devil

My first thought was that one of my friends must have figured out how to hack his phone and change the caller ID information. I decided to play along and pushed the green answer icon.

“Hello,” I croaked. My mouth was dry and it made my voice sound a lot deeper than it was.

For a few moments, there was nothing but a strange background noise that sounded like animals squealing. It was very faint, but just loud enough to be unsettling.

“Is this Ethan Park?” The man’s voice was deep and clear like a television announcer. Not like one of those enthusiastic pitchmen trying to sell you something. His voice sounded gloomy. It was the kind of voice you’d expect to hear as the voice over for a horror movie.

“Yes,” I had the sudden urge to hang up.

“Hello Ethan,” The man said, “How would you like to receive a get out of Hell free card?”

“What? Who is this?” It had to be a joke. I was an atheist. All of my friends knew that.

“You know who this is. It says so right there on your caller I.D.”

“So, you are THE Devil?” I emphasized the word *the* since it appeared in all capital letters on my screen.

“I am,” The voice confirmed, “But you can just call me Dee.”

“I think you got the wrong number, Dee,” I decided to play along. “I don’t need a get out of Hell free card because there is no Hell.”

Dee laughed. It wasn’t a hearty laugh. It was a sinister laugh. It sent chills down my spine.

I pushed the end call icon, but nothing happened.

“You can’t end this call Ethan. Only I can do that.” Dee’s voice called out through the phone’s speaker, “And I’m not done talking yet.”

I tossed the phone on my bed and stared at it.

“One way or another we are going to finish this call,” Dee’s voice had increased in volume so that I could hear him without holding the phone. “All I am asking is for you to hear my proposition. If you choose not to help me, we will go our separate ways and I will see you in thirty years give or take.”

“I haven’t done anything to warrant going to Hell. Why would I need a get out of Hell free card?” I asked.

“Are you seriously going to lie to me Ethan?” Dee’s voice took on a threatening tone, “I see you need convincing. Pick up your phone.” When I didn’t move, he repeated the command in a less patient voice. “Pick. It. Up.” The screaming noise in the background got louder as he waited for me to obey.

I leaned down and picked up the phone.

“Now watch,” He said.

The screen of my phone went black then some sort of home movie started to play. The movie showed me several years earlier in my garage with Socks, the cat we had at the time. There shouldn’t be a recording of what happened in that garage, but there it was playing on my screen.

“How many animals did you kill that year?” Dee asked.

I didn’t answer. I assumed it was a rhetorical question that he already knew the answer to.

“You may have outgrown that phase of your life, but the marks still stain your soul.”

“Okay, I get it. I believe you,” I didn’t want to watch another video of me torturing an animal.

“You’re not getting off that easy Ethan. You forced my hand and now I need to make my point.”

A new video began. This one showed my younger sister and me in my bedroom. I tried to turn my face away from the screen, but my muscles wouldn’t respond. I couldn’t blink, I couldn’t release the phone. I was stuck watching.

When the video ended, tears streamed down my face.

“Do you believe in hell now Ethan?”

I nodded my head.

“I can’t hear you.”

“Yes,” I whispered.

“Good,” Dee’s voice took on a lighter tone, “Now we can return to the business at hand. Go to the bathroom and wipe your face off then grab a notepad and a pen.”

I set the phone down on my nightstand then did what I was told. When I returned, I kept the phone where I left it and sat down on my bed holding the pen in one hand and the note pad in the other.

“I need you to do a few things for me. These things must be done in the order I tell you to do them and they must be done exactly when I tell you to do them. Do you think you can handle that Ethan?”

“Yes,” I answered quietly.

“Good. Now write this down.”

Over the next fifteen minutes, Dee gave me detailed instructions of what I was supposed to do and when I was supposed to do it. When the call ended, I looked over the list. What he asked me to do didn’t seem so bad. Not when you compared it to spending an eternity in hell.

The following morning, I got up early and got to work on the list. The first thing listed was the easiest. I had to get a pair of my mom’s dirty underwear. I went into the bathroom where the hamper full of dirty clothes was kept and dug around until I found a suitable pair of panties and shoved them in my pocket.

The next thing on the list required me to grab a business card from a house that was for sale a couple of block from where I lived. I ran over there and grabbed the card and returned home. Now that I had the card, I was supposed to write a phone number on the back of it in red ink along with the phrase *XOXO until next time*.

After that, I had to drive over to the mall and go to Macy’s, where I was supposed to use a specific perfume tester to lightly spray the back of the business card.

When I was done with that, I glanced at my phone to see what time it was. Getting the business card ready had taken longer than I had anticipated. If I didn’t hurry, I was going to fall behind schedule. Dee said everything had to happen by the time indicated or the deal was off.

I sped over to the pet store and ran inside to buy the mouse. I grabbed the first employee I could find and hurried them over to the cage. When the employee asked me which one I wanted, I told them it didn’t matter, and that I was in a hurry.

Once I had the mouse, I got in my car and drove to my next destination, an office building downtown. When I arrived, I had to drive up and down the parking lot in front of the building, until I found the car I was looking for. Dee had just given me the color and the tag number. It was just my luck that every other car seemed to be the indicated color. It took longer than I would have liked, but I eventually found it.

Up until I had to find the car, I thought everything I was asked to do was pretty easy. Now things were about to get a little more difficult for me. My next task required me to take the mouse and set it free in the car. I glanced at my watch. I had three minutes to do it.

I walked by the passenger side of the car and checked the doors but they were both locked. I quickly walked around to the driver’s side. The back door was locked. I wasn’t going to be able to finish my task list if all of the doors were locked. I glanced around to make sure no one was watching and grabbed the handle of the driver’s door and pulled.

*Yes!* I thought to myself when the door clicked open. Good thing too because the mouse was starting to squirm out of my grasp. I opened the door a few inches and tossed it onto the seat right as it was about to jump free. Then I slammed the door shut and walked away.

I only had one thing left to accomplish and I still had about 30 minutes left to get it done. I pulled the panties out of my pocket and set them on the passenger seat of my car before I drove off to the next destination.

I pulled into the parking garage and began looking for another vehicle based on the color and tag number Dee had given me. It wasn’t as hard to find as the other vehicle. There weren’t a lot of yellow cars in the garage. Once I found it, I parked in the closest empty space then got out of my car and surveyed the area for cameras. When I didn’t see any, I ran over to the car and tried every door, but they were all locked.

*Shit*, I thought to myself, figures that I would be able to complete everything on my list except the last thing. That was when I heard someone walk out of the stairwell. I quickly ducked down and hoped the person would walk on by without noticing me.

As the person approached, I heard the sound of keys jingling then the headlights of the car I was hiding next too, the one I needed to get inside of, flashed twice as all of the doors unlocked.

I thought I was caught, but right before the man would have seen me, he stopped, said a curse, and then quickly started walking back to the stairwell. It seemed he forgot something and went back to retrieve it. When I heard the stairwell door close, I quickly took the business card out of my pocket and wrapped the panties around it. Then I opened the car door and shoved them into the glove compartment.

My hands were shaking when I returned to my car. *That was a close one*, I thought as I pulled out of the parking garage and headed home.

I didn’t give any further thought to the bizarre tasks I was asked to complete, until my phone rang later that evening.

“Turn on the television,” Dee said after I answered the phone.

I picked up the remote and turned it on. The news was on.

“I thought you might like to see the results of all your hard work.”

On the screen was an image showing a grisly wreck. A wreck that involved two cars I was very familiar with. The one I put the mouse in and the one I put the panties in.

“Authorities don’t know what caused the wreck that killed four people…” The reporter at the scene began, but I cut them off when I turned the TV off.

“Keep watching,” Dee said as the television turned itself back on, “It gets better.”

“In a bizarre turn of events, a few hours after the accident, the driver of the yellow car returned to his workplace and opened fire on his colleagues, killing seven people before turning the gun on himself. The tragedy continued, when police found the body of the man’s wife at the residence they shared in Sandy Springs.”

The television turned itself off as the reporters moved on to the next story.

“Did you know that was going to happen?” I asked.

“Of course I did. I orchestrated it,” Dee sounded offended.

“Why them?”

“It wasn’t about them. It was about sending a message,” Dee paused for a moment. “I get the feeling you want answers and while I don’t normally make it a habit of explaining myself. I will do so this one time, just for you.”

“Several years ago I made a deal with the owner of the De Soto real estate company. When it came time to collect payment on that deal, Mr. De Soto claimed it was no longer valid. As I tried to remove his soul, I discovered he had been placed under some sort of protective custody thanks to a technicality in the terms of our agreement. Since I couldn’t take his soul, I decided to take the lives of those he loved as payment instead.”

“Since I am forbidden from taking any soul I please, I had to alter the destiny of a few people. That allowed me to create the perfect situation that would make my displeasure with Mr. De Soto crystal clear to him.”

“The woman driving the car you placed the mouse in, was Mr. De Soto’s mistress. She had quite the fear of rodents.”

“The passenger in the yellow car was his daughter. The accident caused the panties you placed in the glove compartment to pop right out onto her lap. An argument ensued with her husband, which resulted in her being shot and her husband going on a shooting spree at his office.

“One of the employees killed at the real estate office was Mr. De Soto's niece, who had just started working as an intern. Now, when he goes to sleep tonight, he will have to ask himself if the price of saving himself was worth it.”

I sat in silence.

“Now, if you don’t have any other questions, I really must be going.”

“Our deal still stands right?” I blurted out.

“Yes, Ethan it does. You will not go to Hell for the things you have already done.”

I sighed in relief.

“I have to be honest with you Ethan. You were never going to go to Hell for those things.”

“What!?”

“Animal mutilation and molestation are child’s play compared to the things you will do. Those were just stepping stones to get you started. Great things await you. See you soon, Ethan.” I could tell he was smiling when he said those four final words."
arrtvj,0,2019-02-17,Which tech company sounds like the best for me?,Kersaverken,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/arrtvj/which_tech_company_sounds_like_the_best_for_me/,"I am curious of what kind of work cultures have what sounds like a dream to me. I am planning on trying out some internships, but I kind of want direction of what kind of companies sounds like the best for me. Anyways here are the kind of things I like in a company (or think).

&amp;#x200B;

* Efficient workplace that doesn't waste time with a huge emphasis on speed, efficiency, and high quality standards and rewards you for it. More money for more efficiency and quality. There is a huge difference between setting ridiculous deadlines and being efficient.
* I don't like feeling like I am getting dragged down from someone else not working. I just don't want to run into that school group project where nobody else does any work while you have to carry all their stuff simply out of laziness.
* No Crunch Time. It's something that's gives me ridiculous deadlines or bad management vibes. I don't like either. I done it for myself a couple times and it's pure hell if I am not doing for myself.
* (If I get a full time offer way later down the road) a huge ladder that I could maybe climb into a larger role with more benefits and pay. Essentially plenty of opportunities for promotions from performance. I know how politics work and it sometimes sucks if it's not in your favor but oh well.

&amp;#x200B;

Brief set of Skills I have (favorite to least ) that also normally correlates to my skill level in that language

* Python. Currently learning machine learning (not a framework, but the math behind it all) and done a whole plethora of other stuff that would just bloat this post. I normally resort to this first for everything and something else later if I need something better for the specific use for what I am doing.
* Swift. Fast as C++ and reminds me of Python. I use only Apple stuff, so it's huge benefit to me to have for personal uses. I was able to make my own better personal versions of some shitty apps that I have to use.
* C++. I originally planned on learning graphics with this, but Apple kind of screwed all my learning opportunities to increase my skills in this language. I only use these in programming challenges and contests.
* Unity C#. I really want to forget this skill.... I hope to switch it with Java or Kotlin one day. Especially since the University I plan on going to is using Java for DS and Algs when I take that course again. (I am currently taking it in high school, but I don't have prerequisite and I still wanted to take it anyway. It should be an easy course for me.)

&amp;#x200B;

I mainly program Python and Swift. The main reason is because Python is so huge that I am entertained with side projects all day and could automate whatever I want.

I also despise web development, but I don't mind writing a REST API to continue work on something not webby. I also don't really do well with Dunning Krugers because of the points listed above. I also don't like the idea of working at google since it would most likely make me feel like a child, which is something I hate. I know my first couple of times I am in no real ""I get to pick and choose"" thing, but it doesn't hurt to have ideas of where to aim at.

arsd3v,3,2019-02-17,IBM Graduate Internships - 2019,BottledH2O,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/arsd3v/ibm_graduate_internships_2019/,"Hello,

I wanted to ask if anyone has experience working for IBM as a Graduate Intern in the United States (Northeast section). I just applied to two of their internships - Graduate Research Internship 2019 and IBM Cybersecurity Internship 2019.

Previously (in Fall 2018), I applied to their X-Force Cybersecurity internship and a Software Development Internship but got denied.

Since then, I've added some major things to my resume - IEEE publications, MS in CS, and another relevant job experience.

If anyone has any insights on how the internship was or any pointers I can get for securing the internship, would be appreciated. I know that I might be a little late for 2019 summer internships, but never hurts to try.

Also, if you are thinking why I'm looking for an internship and not a full time job - I'm doing my MS full time with research and doing some other things during the semester.

Thanks!"
artdaq,2,2019-02-17,"Graduating In June, Dont Know Which Tech Path For Me, Please Help!",AdvancedBarnacle1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/artdaq/graduating_in_june_dont_know_which_tech_path_for/,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

First and foremost, forgive me if I post this in the wrong sub or any other incorrectness, I'm really frustrated because I'm graduating soon and I dont know which tech path I should apply to and I cant find answers from my peers nor professors, and in my situation, I hope someone here can help me out. Please, bear with me, I really appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: background I'm an international student studying Management Information System in U.S. I'm graduating at the end of June and hoping to work in a real tech job anywhere in the U.S, preferably in California although right now I'm in Minnesota.

&amp;#x200B;

School curriculum: The school that I'm going to is not the best school for pursuing IT-related degrees but it is in my budget so there is that. In my opinion, the curriculum in my degree focuses on programming, we have to take 1 Python class (which is the pre-req class to weed out the ""unfortunate"" students I guess) then moving on to 1 Java class. In those classes we were given homework on code this and that, and the professors legit never check the homework so I use Chegg and Stack OverFlow on every home work including the exams, yes I know it is very bad because I didnt learn anything. Furthermore, 1 Python/Java algorithm class (I'm taking the Java class), 1 COBOL class, 2 databases (SQL) classes, 1 teaches SQL queries and the other one I had to develop a distributed database system (the scenario is to create databases for U.S and U.K using partition) that class got me hooked to database design and management, not only I had to create the DDBMS system, I also had to populate, queries, create stored procedures, crow diagram, just love it.

&amp;#x200B;

What have I done: The school curriculum requires every student to have one internship, and luckily, I got one internship in one of the electrical co-ops in Minnesota. The place is not a software house and 80% employees are 40 years old above so they outsource every software and never have anyone create any in house software, so my internship felt like a class where my supervisor told me to make this and that except I got paid. The projects that I developed were:

\- Web database to store license keys (previously they were using Excel to store it and they want to have it in a web) I developed it using Django, literally using Django admin page and I designed the whole admin page to serve as a platform to store the license keys which my supervisor was very happy about it. I did not learn Django framework in class so I learnt that through YouTube and my supervisor said that it is good I can research and solve the project without help from him (thanks YouTube).

\- Web app where I find the discrepancies between 2 .csv files. So, every month, OATI software generates an excel file with the list of all ""members"" that pay and dont pay the electrical bills from that and the previous months, there were legit 20 columns and over 35.000 rows (not lying) and one of the ""business analyst"" went through those files each and every row (i have no idea how she does it without getting crazy) to see any discrepancies. So, I just had to make a web app that goes through the 2 .csv files and find members who dont pay the bills, I did not create the code at all, I legit put a chegg question for that project and through Stack Overflow, I didnt tell anyone, they just know I'm so good at coding which I'm not.

\- Arduino project to make a small car that can solve a maze (no, I dont know how to code it, I'm going to use someone else's code and hopefully improve it).

\- Codeacademy and Udemy courses for Data Science path and a Java course.

In my opinion, I know how to code on very simple basic tasks (For example, in the word ""ELEPHANT"" count how many ""E"" appears, or simple Codeacademy stuff), if I have to do advanced coding like bubble, selection, insert, I'm done, I cant do it.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm looking for: Through my experience in school and internship, I love when I have to design or develop databases, to me I understand way better than creating algorithm stuff, although I love to code to, to solve problems on a simple scale. So, what position should I apply for? Database administrator? Database developer? Business analyst? For sure not software engineer/developer because I honestly think I dont have the brain for it, I would definitely not pass the white board interviews. Last week, I went to a local career fair although its just one company, and they were demo-ing an automation stuff using Selenium, their positions are IT Quality Assurance, and to be honest, I'm very interested in what they do, it seems fun and easy although I dont know how to do it at all and I have been looking courses for Selenium but I couldnt find it. As for security, I'm going to take a security class in the Summer for only 1 term. Currently, I have been applying for database-related job, but if there is anything I'm missing, please do tell me. What positions should I apply for? If am posting in the wrong platform or sub, could anyone please point me out where should I post my question? Thank you so much for your time and help!"

So I went to my schools CS career fair and nothing came out of it, this is the 5th career fair I’ve been too. I don’t know what it is that is turning me off to recruiters, I don’t know if it’s my social skills (which I don’t think are bad) or if it’s my resume.

My gpa isn’t the best 2.8, I have had one other internship at a wealth management fund where I didn’t get any coding experience, and ended up doing mundane tasks because it was a small company and they had no idea what to do with their interns.

I just don’t know what to do, I’m graduating in May with no job prospects. I’m going to Career services to have them look over my resume and maybe consider other career paths.

But this is just disheartening, theirs freshman with less experience coding get interviews and I can’t get one as a senior? 

I need some serious guidance, because I’m completely lost. I just want to know I’ll have some stability in the future.

I’m really starting to feel like I just wasted 4 years getting a degree and minor that will leave me with 0 options for future employability. 

EDIT: Honestly I think it’s my resume, but I’m not sure at all."
artuyo,6,2019-02-18,How to quit a job that may or may not have been good to me?,probablynotahobbit,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/artuyo/how_to_quit_a_job_that_may_or_may_not_have_been/,"TLDR: My current employer paid for a lot of my BSME, but I don't see a future here and I have already accepted another job. How do I acknowledge what they've done for me without burning bridges?  

This is really long, so thank you for reading. Some people have said I was treated well, others said I was taken advantage of for years. If you have time, I'd love to hear outsider's perspectives.    

I've worked at my current employer for 8+ years. The whole time I was also going to school for my AS, then my BS in mechanical engineering. It started as a summer engineering internship just after high school, at $10/hr. While getting my AS, the company kept me at part time, despite my asking to become full time. Because I was part time, I was not eligible for tuition reimbursement. Finally, in 2014 I pushed for full time and got it because I was about to finish my AS anyway. At that point, they started paying for some of my BS.  
  
Fast forward to 2017. I was 1 year away from getting my BS, making about $15/hr, so I told them ""hey, I'm gonna be a real engineer in a year, I know you're limited to a certain percentage raise per year, can we work something out now so when I graduate I can get paid like an engineer?"" They agreed to raises every 3 months, for an undetermined amount of time.  
  
When I got my BS in August 2018 they made me salaried and bumped me up to 48k/year (which for a mechanical engineer with now 8 years of *job specific* work experience is embarrassing). Every time, they thanked me for being so patient. Keep in mind, I don't do *intern* work, I design and build tools and machines, do cost analyses, product routings; literally everything the other (also underpaid) engineers in my department do. Anyway, now it's 6 months and 1 raise later I was making 55k when I got an offer from another company for 80k. The same day (I hadn't told anyone) I get another 5k, putting me at 60k. True, the new employer may have called my current employer to verify that I worked there, but I have no proof that the raise was related to the new offer (I'll come back to this).  

I've already accepted the new job. I've told my boss (who has been on my side the entire time and is a great guy) that I've accepted another offer, and to expect a formal resignation soon. He was upset, but when I told him where I was going he seemed to hint that I was making the right decision.  

The thing that makes me feel like an asshole is that, because I was so underpaid for the type of work I was doing, my employer agreed to pay for additional classes as ""training"" which meant there really was no limit like there would be with tuition reimbursement. I don't know the total, but it's probably around 20-25k over 3 years. Still, even with having most of my classes paid for, This past friday was the first time in my live I've ever earned over 60k.  

As for the timing of the raise, if it was just a coincidence, fine. If it wasn't, then they knew I was entertaining a counter offer and their best ""we really want to keep you"" was to bump me up to 60k, which is still 2k less than the guy next to me who started a month ago in the same position with only 2 years experience.  

As for why I'm leaving...It would be another decade before I see 80k at my current employer. Annual raises are limited to 3% average over the entire company. When I was given the last 5k raise I asked ""so how long am I on this 3 month schedule and when do I go back to the same 3% that everyone else gets? What's my *final* salary?"" and was basically told that they didn't know (bullshit) and that they would see what happens in June when annual raises come around. The fact that my current employer, who has known me for close to a decade, couldn't say ""you'll be making X on this date, then standard raises from then on"" was a big red flag, especially when a company who has met me twice could do that without batting an eye. 

Basically, I don't know two things:  
  
1. Am I the asshole for leaving because of how much everyone has bent the rules to bring my pay up outside the normal means or have I been severely underpaid for years to the point that the only way to forward my career is to leave?  

2. What do I say in the resignation letter that's the equivalent of ""thanks for everything you and everyone has done, but it's time to move on""
  
Again, thank you for reading that long rambling post. Sorry about the details, I'm partly bitter and partly questioning if I am in fact an asshole."

To give a bit of context, I just ended an 8-month internship with a small startup who didn't extend my contract due to a shift in business goals, and a realization that they couldn't physically keep me.  I'm assuming that I left on a good note, as I was told that I could ask for a letter of recommendation anytime, and that if they had a Software Engineering position in the future, that they would contact me. 3 weeks later after that internship had ended , I was offered another unpaid software engineering position at a different company. As much as I feel confident in my skills to be qualified for an entry-level position (I also had former research experience, became a cofounder and vice-president of my university's cybersecurity club, organized an official Hackathon at my school, and worked on some personal projects), I don't want to miss an opportunity to gain more experience, and I figure that i'll be able to add something else on my Resume, until I find a paid internship or full-time position. I'll also be graduating this semester, so my parents are pushing me to find a paid full-time position. 

I'm not sure if it's worth it for me to pursue another unpaid internship opportunity, given my circumstances. On one hand I graduate this May and truly feel that I need to focus on my interviewing skills, apply for a bunch of jobs and finish up any leftover projects that i'm currently working on, so I could show those off in my Resume as well. On the other hand, this internship may make me more marketable, and I could learn more about my field through the challenges faced from a different company. This job could also potentially lead to a paid position on its own? I know of former classmates who have been looking for a job since last spring, so i'm trying to avoid being in their position."

Hey there!

I’m a guy in his mid 20’s from Bulgaria (might be moving to Germany later this year, if that matters) that has a little bit of background in electronics (mainly microprocessors as per my highschool diploma), I’m fixing computers in my spare time and I have few short “Coding” internships. I’m currently working towards my bachelor degree in Informatics and I’m nearly finished with it, but after four years of trying to become a programmer... I don’t think I’d ever be a good programmer and I definitely don’t wanna be a teacher. 

I’ve been trying to get a full-time coding job for at least 9 months with no luck so far and I’m starting to get quite annoyed from this pointless jumping around. If I’m being honest with myself I haven’t really enjoyed programming in a long time and maybe I have not put quite enough effort in it and maybe I just don’t have that kind of algorithmic thinking. Probably all of these are the reasons why I can’t land a job yet. Or maybe it’s just luck and connections that I don’t have, I really don’t know. 

So I’m getting curious what would be the best way to go about switching to a more creative field like design (web, print, ui, vector illustrations), game creation(game design, level design) or digital 3D art(modeling, sculpting)? I’m wondering this because all these things I mentioned above are things I sometimes just lose track of time when doing. I know I’m probably not doing them well at all, but I enjoy the process of trying to figure things out from visual perspective. 

For example when I see an interesting object in real life I’m always trying to imagine what the 3d model topology of that object would look like. And often I’ll fire up Blender to see how far I can make it. And I do make something halfway decent until a point, then I make a mess that I don’t know how to fix and I hit delete. Maybe try again, maybe just move to the next object. Or I see a cool place or scene from real life, movie or a tv show and I’ll follow the same process in Illustrator or Photoshop and most of the time end up with a mess. I have started quite a few game projects and game levels that I think could turn into really fun experiences, but they are just sitting on my laptop unfinished because I’m not sure how to go forward with them.

I’ve fooled around with lots of software products over the years, but it was all just for fun. Now, however, I’m starting to wonder if I can make a living out of something fun and the first questions that pop in my head are:

1. What would be the best process for making a good resume and portfolio in these fields?
2. Should I diversify my portfolio along all the subfields I mentioned I’m interested in or try to stay focused on one area until I (possibly) master it (meaning which way could land me on a stable job faster)?
3. Are bootcamps the way to go or can I stick to lynda, pluralsight, udemy etc.?
4. What are some things about a resume or portfolio in these creative areas that are frowned upon and should be avoided and what sort of things would actually sit very well there?
5. How would a newbie like me go about creating project if I don’t have actual clients? Like, if I make Web design, posters and brochures( for let's say the laptop I use or for my guitar) or are there some Creative Commons things that could prevent me from sharing my creation because it is an existing brand and I should make imaginary brands and things?
6. How much inspiration from existing brands, things, designs is okay to put into your creations, where do we put the line and say ”that’s a theft”?
7. When it comes to Game Environment Creation is it better to go with an actual game engine like Unity, Unreal, Source or level editor in games like in Dying Light or FarCry V? 
8. Also any idea about which are the most well developed communities for sharing and getting feedback on game environments or a safe way to share ideas for and start new games, gather a team possibly and the idea won’t just get stolen, things like that?
9. When it comes to Graphic design, I currently have sort of small, amateur-ish portfolio at DeviantArt, but with the amount of furries and my little pony enthusiasts (not judging, just not my thing I guess) in there, I’m not sure anyone would be taken seriously (I might be wrong, again not judging) even if I manage to start making decent designs. At the same time Dribbble &amp; Behance seem to be only for professionals. My question is: is there a community that sits somewhere in between and I can get my work critiqued, preferably without having to pay for?
10. Are there some red flags that I might miss in a company I’ve applied to, that are specific to the creative side of the spectrum?

I realize most of these questions would be better asked in more specific subs, but I thought here would be a good start. 

I should probably mention some things I have worked to some extent with, like: Photoshop, Illustrator, Blender, 3Ds Max, ZBrush, Substance Painter, Substance Designer, Unity, Unreal 4, CryEngine V, Source SDK, different in-game level editors. When it comes to coding I’m very familiar with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, some JS, some C# ASP.NET MVC, Java, some Wordpress custom themes, some git, gulp, npm. I guess these things could be a plus for Web design positions, so there’s that.

I have few certificates from LinkedIn and Pluralsight for Photoshop, Illustrator, and some for coding which I’m guessing are probably worthless as a certificate alone (without a decent portfolio), but they’re there.

Also when I was in highschool I actually tried my luck in 99designs or freelancer.com (can’t remember which) with one logo design contest and somehow my design got rated to 2nd place from at least 80 other designs. Maybe it was just a newb (almost) luck, but after I didn’t win I just never tried again for some reason and now I want to fix my mistake and actually make a long-term effort.

Overall with some help and guidance I would love to get a “Battle Map” for the creative fields ready and start my journey, so any advice, input, courses, books, subs, articles, magazines, portfolios are all welcome and highly appreciated! Thank you!"

I’ve been a console user since I got my first Xbox in 2005 but after getting very into Overwatch last year, I’ve been wanting to get a pc to play at higher levels. I currently have a laptop that the website “Can my pc run it” shows as being able to run Overwatch except for my graphics card. I have a GeForce 940MX but apparently I need a GTX460, Radeon HD 4850, or Intel HD Graphics 4400. So my question is: should I go ahead and spend the $20 and try it out? Is there a way to test it first? Is my graphics card super outdated? I have no idea about any of this type of stuff but I also wanted to get into pc building as my summer internship should cover the cost for a good high end pc.

I am a senior in college about to graduate in May I have about 3 years of experience, I started working as a part-time engineer at a company in 2016 then switched to my current company in May 2018. I am currently working as a part-time software engineering intern for a company in the Atlanta area. I really enjoy the people I work with here and it really is a growing company. But I am not too sure about my performance at work. 5 months ago I was assigned to a newly made team that was in charge of testing one of the company's many products, they assigned me to being the automation engineer for the team.




   It took me a month or so to grasp the basics of the product and the proprietary automation framework they use, anyone I mention the framework to at work, they all have the same ""ugh that sucks"" reaction . Since then I have been told to make sure all the existing test scripts passed with the current version of the product. It looked like these scripts were made a long time ago and a lot of the times they wouldn't work well at all. I am alright at fixing them, reworking functionality is good, but of course there is an expectation of getting the fixes out fast to make it in time for the testing phases, this is what I am struggling with. I am trying my best but this is the second time I was not able to complete my fixes in time. I am extremely discouraged, a lot of the time these scripts aren't even written right. Sometimes I'll have to basically spend a couple of hours to dive into the rabbit hole of figuring out the root cause in order to fix it and it takes up a lot of time. 




 I make sure to try and ask for help from other devs but I don't want to keep bothering them, sometimes some of them won't know what the issue is even though they wrote the script in the first place however many years ago. Some bugs with the automation framework were left unreported and the previous engineer literally wrote tests that would ignore some of the errors, those workarounds don't work anymore since since this framework is at a newer version. This is putting a decent amount of stress on me because I feel like I'm failing at my work, plus I have my school projects to worry about as well since I am about to graduate. Should I start looking for a new job? I am applying to a lot of other companies for when I graduate but seriously don't even know how much yearly salary to ask for or expect. Plus I am not sure if I should ask my current company for an offer given my awful performance recently. 




Sorry for the word dump, it's been a rough few weeks. Any advice on the situation is appreciated."

as0lff,1,2019-02-18,Where Do I Go from Here?,secretmanreddit,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/as0lff/where_do_i_go_from_here/,"I’m a 20 y/o Tier 1/2 Help-Desk Specialist for a high-profile government client in DC (TS clearance). This is my first role out of school (I recently graduated with a 4.0 from UMUC with my B.S. in Software Dev &amp; Security) and I absolutely loathe it.

I am wondering whether I need to suck it up and keep pushing on in this role for several more months, or whether it is realistic for me to pursue another, slightly advanced role.

For reference, I have attached a scrubbed version of my [resume](https://imgur.com/a/WWhySvp). I am under the impression that, on paper, I am qualified for many of the jobs I seek. However, in practice, I feel totally underprepared. While I hold all three AWS associate-level certs and graduated at the top of my class in my Software Development &amp; Security program, I’ve barely done any of these tasks at an enterprise scale. I can articulate some basic Linux concepts, build a small application using Java, and architect a simple AWS solution using core services, but I cannot sustain a highly-technical whiteboarding interview. I feel like other candidates who recently graduated and had more technical internships under their belts would blow me out of the water, from a technical standpoint.

All things considered, this leaves me unsure of where to go from here. Junior SysAdmin? Junior Developer? Junior Cloud Engineer? Cybersecurity Analyst? Business Analyst?

I’m looking for advice from more senior engineers and hiring managers, providing insight as to whether I would even be an attractive candidate in any of these capacities, or whether I need to keep grinding it out in this current role for a while longer. I have a strange knowledge base and limited experience, so I am not sure if companies seek somebody like me this early on. Thank you."

After my first year work my mother got in a bad car crash and decided that I wanted to move home to help take care of her. My friend tild me about opening that were at a nuclear plant near my hometown for operator positions. So I applied and got the job. In the past two years working at the plant have learned a lot and am paid well but really dislike the rotational schedule(switching between day and night shifts). 

&amp;nbsp;

I have spoken with advisors and they would admit into my alma maters MSCS program but I have to take a data structures and algorithms class in the fall and a system software class in the spring before I am fully enrolled. 

&amp;nbsp;

 Both classes are offered online and in the meantime I have worked through all of Python Crash Course and am currently working through Headfirst Java to keep my skills sharp.  

&amp;nbsp;

I have paid off all of my student loan debt and plan on working my current job while taking the two online classes. Hopefully I will be able to find an internship for the summer after these two classes and pursue my master's full time.

Do you guys have any tips for balancing online classes and work?

My last role was for verizon fios working as an fiber analyst, basically help desk but because its union the pay was close to 80k a year.

I graduated college 2 months ago. A month or two before I graduated, I began interning at Company A for 20 hours a week, $12/hr. There were talks when I was interviewed/hired that this could potentially turn in to a full time position somewhere down the road. That has not materialized yet and I am told it is budget concerns mainly - the company is relatively small and just starting up. I am still working the same hours/pay. 

I was contacted by a recruiter for Company B last week and interviewed last week as well. Much larger company than Company A. The job is full time, $15/hr, and pretty similar to what I’m currently doing with Company A as an intern. 

I have 2 big reservations about Company B.

The first is that I would be employed through the staffing agency for the first 6 months of work and no full time position is guaranteed after that. I’ve been told that most who work hard find a position within the company but not everyone does.

The second is that the shift would be 5AM - 1 PM M-F. When I was recruited I was told it would be 9 AM, when I interviewed I was told 6:30 or 6, and now it has been changed to 5 AM. I am not a morning person and find it difficult enough to wake up at 6:30 each day, let alone 3:30. I would likely have to become nocturnal or something. 

Now, I am hoping that Company A counters with a comparable offer because I enjoy working there and would much prefer their hours of 8-5. The title I would likely receive is also more appealing to me and would more so promote career growth into the field I want to go in. 

But, if Company A does not make a full time counter offer, am I crazy in considering turning down Company B?  I would barely get to see my girlfriend or friends during the week, with most of my friends moving away after they graduate college in a few months. My sleep schedule would become fucked and I don’t think I would be happy in that position, but my income would triple ($200ish a week to $600ish). I have some money saved up for rent so there is not an immediate need for more income, but there will be maybe 6 months down the line. 

Thanks for any feedback! 

TL;DR: 
Intern for Company A,  Company B offers job, pay bump and full time but unappealing hours and it’s 6 month contract work - no full time guaranteed after that. Crazy to consider turning down B? "

So the job description was basically, updates and basic computer repair/troubleshooting Microsoft office etc. When I started, I quickly discovered the person who was the Head of I.T. didn't really know much. I thought this would be good because of my lack of experience, but it turns out. Most of the problems the company was experiencing was user error, so once I had retrained users to use the software there wasn't much for me to do. So I started studying for the CCNA, passed the ccent on my 1st try but my problem is I almost never use any of these skills.

For a while, I've been dealing with mild anxiety. I would say I started realizing it in November but I ignored it. I have a lot of stress in my life, mainly financial and academic stress. I'm also a perfectionist in the sense that if I don't give something my 100%, or if it's not perfect, it's a failure. I also have a hard time believing in myself and my abilities, and I know that if I at least believed in myself, I would achieve a lot more than I do.

I managed to take deep breaths to calm myself down and not long after I broke down crying. Crying because of all the stress I'm going through, the fact that I didn't pass...I'm actually so desperate for a job now. I rely on my parents for money and I want to stop and have some financial independence. I'm in college and take a full course load so I don't have much time to balance an actual job with my academic schedule so it's ideal I do something online. Besides I am abroad for the semester so my visa does not allow me to work.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been meaning to talk to a therapist for a while but the cost is what has stopped me, however the one at my college is only available on Wednesday mornings and I have my internship then, so I really can't go. I can't go to any other therapists because I have no money and I am currently not registered with health insurance at the country I'm in.

From the time I was little, I wanted to be an architect. I graduated high school in the top of my class, I went to college and then grad school. I got my Master of Architecture and my MBA. From there I started working, and since then life, well life kinda threw it all back in my face.

I've worked in three firms in the last 5 years. I have been a typical intern, a designer, a project manager, and a drafter. I can pick up any program and run with it. I love solving problems through technology and research and I love helping others reach there goals and solve their own problems.  I am three exams short of being a fully licensed architect, and I  intend to finish those before I do anything else. 

As it turns out, architecture isn't all that it is cracked up to be. So far, it has been far too much stress for far too little pay. I come home at the end of the day and I feel miserable. I constantly feel like I am not good at what I am doing and I feel like I am always making mistakes. My job often makes me hate myself. And to top it all off, I have been re-evaluating my student loans and instead of paying them off, I just keep going deeper into debt. 

So that leads me to here. I honestly do not know what to do. As I said above, I have my MBA and my M. Arch. I am proficient in just about every architecture software, and I tend to pick up other software quite fast. I just don't know what to do with these skills, or how to even look for a job outside of architecture. 

So my question(s) I guess are as follows: Is there any sort of professional who could help me with my predicament? Does anyone know of any architects who left the field to do something, anything, else? Are there any ideas of what else my skill set could allow me to do? Or am I just stuck?

I'm sorry if this isn't the right kind of post for this sub, or if I am breaking the ""sob story"" rule. I'm not trying to be dramatic or anything like that. I'm just feeling very lost right now and I would be eternally grateful for any help I can get.

I'm in my last year of undergrad (CS and Math major) and want to make this year powerful for my application. I'm Economics minor if it is helpful.

I reached to professors outside my major since they were more welcoming and willing to help by telling their grad school experience and offering advises. I have strong internship experience (local businesses tho) and will be doing research in OpenCV this semester. I reached out to various professors in my department, but they said the subject doesn't fall under their expertise (not from a big school.)

I couldn't get into SURF or summer undergrad research due to some reasons. I've emailed all my local school professors to research in their listed fields of expertise but everyone ignored my email so bad that I was heavily discouraged.

I wanted to ask if someone can give me an advise where to start or go. I've watched a lot of videos, asked PhD holding professors, and read on Reddit, Academic (stackexchange). I couldn't get help such as how to reach PhD professors prior to application. I really want to reach out to professors and the only school (Harvard) have been positively replying with follow-ups from their parts. I believe my impress should've been much more better if I received some guidance.

Can someone comment on the situation? Thank you!"

So recently I have posted here talking about my chances of getting an internship abroad for a year, however today I wanted to discuss moving abroad and gaining dual citizenship eventually.

So as the title says, I am a CS student, and by the time graduation rolls around I will be proficient in Java, Python and JavaScript.

I am interested in pursuing Web Development or Mobile App Development though I am open to working in IT.

I am fully bilingual in English and French with formal French certification from the Ministère de l'Éducation National (the DELF).

I am open really to working anywhere in Western Europe however there are a few things that are really important to me.

1) I want to keep my Canadian Citizenship. I do not want to have to renounce my Citizenship.

2) I would preferably like to not move somewhere undergoing a healthcare crisis, but as long as I cant see a doctor with relative ease and have trust that the health care is good, I'm happy.

3) I would like to move to somewhere within the European Union.

I am willing to learn a new language, seeing as I am learning Swedish at the moment (still only about A2 level) but it's getting better.

In the end, I was thinking of applying to start ups or other companies before graduating, and then hopefully landing a junior development position somewhere in Europe.

I think personally I would like to end up in Sweden or France, but I would also like to hear your opinions, of what countries would be best, but also tips for my success going forwards.

Thank you and all the best!"
as5kyf,10,2019-02-18,What moment really made you grow up?,PauLWaFFleZ,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/as5kyf/what_moment_really_made_you_grow_up/,"So college is basically where you transition from being a kid to being an adult. Or, that's what its supposed to be. I'm sure that all of us, at least the ones who are still in or those who have already graduated and working, have that one moment where you realized ""I gotta make a change"". 

I started out at community college and for some weird reason, I missed out on taking the placement test, which meant that I had to go thru the BS of doing remidial math classes. So while I was knocking out all of the other basic courses like history, government and etc, I was taking basic math. So all through that, I was never really challenged, in that I still kept gaming quite a bit for those semesters.

Then came Calculus 1, which is what I should have started with. Now I had never had any problem with any math class in all my time in school, so I wasn't taking Calculus 1 that seriously. Big mistake. First test got like a 30 something, 2nd one like a 15. In the first time of my life, I felt like I was going to fail a class, a MATH one at that. 

Luckily, all of the HW was online, and it wasn't due until the end of the semester. I hadn't been doing it for the most part, which might explain why I was so lax about practicing and etc. But either way, I realized that hey, if you don't change things up, you're gonna flunk this class. I've known since forever that I wanted to be an engineer, and if you can't get past what is considered the basic math for all engineering majors, you can say goodbye to those dreams. I had been working at Wal-Mart at the time (I HATED that place), so I had known what a regular job was like, and I was like ""There is NO FUCKING WAY I'm gonna fail this class""

So I turned off the Xbox, and spent basically all of my free time studying, practicing, and doing the HW. Test 3, got a 97. Ended up turning things around and got a B in that class. I kept that mentally going forward. I got an A in Calculus 2 and 3, and for those who don't know Calculus 2 is a KILLER, a weedout class for all STEM majors who have to take it. For the most part (had a few relapses here and there), I've kept it up and I'm just about to graduate with a BS in Computer Engineering this August, and on top of that Lockheed Martin has already offered me a job. I also did an internship in Silicon Valley last Summer, which I felt really help me get my offer from Lockheed. I think if I get straight A's until August I have a chance of graduating Cum Laude.

Just wanted to kind of share my story to show that everyone that is doing well in school may not have always been that way. Calculus 1 showed me that you just being smart ain't gonna be enough like it was in grade school. You gotta HUSTLE in college. That goes double if you're in a Computer Science type major where you gotta write code. I'm sure other people got their situations where they realized they gotta change things up if they wanna survive, so lets hear them."

I am a freshman in college about an hour away from my home town. My family is good but I was always the odd one out, they are more outgoing and loud. I am the quiet type. My real connection was with my dad but now that I live further away from him. I feel as though I cant reach out to him or any of them. I know I am close and how easy it should be to reach out to them but why cant I do it?
This is the start of my second semester. The school part is going well, I'm getting good grades and attending classes consistently. But that's it. Other than class I sit in my dorm room. I listen to podcasts and watch shows with headphones and normally I'm in bed by 8:30. I wake up early, even when I dont have to but that's to get away from my roomate in the morning. My roomate is a mess and is rushing a frat. I went in blind and didn't know him, let's call him Gary. Gary is addicted to nicotine started with vaping and now there are spit cups on his desk and the dresser. He also has a very weak stomach and has been known to drink excessively. So I have walked thru and one time slipped on bis vomit during the early mornings. I can count the amount of words I have said to him over the past week on 2 hands. I think my relationship with Gary has led me to stop talking to others. For example tonight I went to the dining hall ate and was back in about 10 minutes and I never made eye contact or spoke a word. What happened to me?
I have some close friends from high school but I haven't spoken to them in months. How can I reach out to them now?
In high school I was the captain of the lacrosse team I had a bunch of friends I could tell stories I could be myself. I used to volunteer every weekend now I take naps to past time and avoid being awake. I had fun in social settings. Now I plan my schedule to avoid people (hence waking up at 5 am everyday to be the only person in the bathroom and then in the dining hall) 
I used to work out consistently since coming to college I never have the motivation to get there and do anything. How do I get motivated again?
I thought maybe therapy would be a good option for me. I attended two sessions with a therapist on campus but I felt like my problem is so insignificant. Someone who was sexually assaulted could have used those slots, not someone who feels lonely.
Even though I have plans for the future, like my internship for next summer, I feel like once I'm there I'll sabotage it and turn it into a place like where I am at now.

How can I appreciate anything again, or find joy in my life becuase I know I am too entitled and have so many things others wish they could have?

I am scared I will be alone for a long time, but I know that's not what I want. How can I reach out and stop pushing everyone away

TLDR; How can I get out of this mental space and be myself again? I used to feel comfortable now I feel isolated and abandoned, but it's becuase I push others and relationships away"

- they have no income (yet?)
- their capital is going to business expenses
- no members are taking a salary
- app based product

Info about job:
- the current team is looking to hand off their work, so I would be the only dev
- lasts until end of semester (about 10 weeks)
- no pay or equity

They would like me to join. I feel reluctant, especially when my work gets no pay. I think it could be good experience, and nice to say I’ve made an app in a real business context. Maybe this puts my foot in the door for when they can actually afford real employees.

What are your thoughts? Would you take it given my experience?

**Essays and LOR:**   

I really liked my Common essay. It was all about how I grew up in different parts of my country and learnt from diverse cultures. Had the essay read by at least six people; they all liked it :). College specific essays were also pretty insightful (particularly for Brown and Dartmouth)

I figure my recs are gonna be great too. My teachers and counselor have been really helpful and I have great relationships with all of them.



All of these colleges are reaches. To be honest, I'd never thought of applying to the US right until my senior year. I'm most probably gonna take a gap year to get some more internships and better my test scores, but still dream of that thicc acceptance.  Let me know what you guys think.

In about a year I'll graduate with a IT B.S. degree. Taking 4 classes and Im not working this semester. So, I have extra time, I want to apply for some internships for the summer and see if anything happens...

Why I think I want an A+ Cert  
Looking at the objectives I recognize most of it, but I'm not confident in my knowledge of it. I know it is considered basic stuff, but it covers a lot of basic things I just haven't memorized yet. Im not very confident on my knowledge and im worried about internships. I have hardly any experience troubleshooting. I'd like to feel confident on the material covered in the A+ cert. but...

Ive seen a lot of people claim that it is worthless unless I want to work for Geeksquad. I kinda expect to get a helpdesk job after college then work my way up. I'm interested in Cyber security. If the A+ Cert is truly worthless then I could still spend my ""extra"" time studying and reading. That would save me like $400, but If want to learn the A+ material why not just take the test?

Lets say I have 2-3 hrs a day I can spend studying, learning, reading, experimenting. Since I dont have a job... (live with parents)  Are there better ways to spend that time other then prepare for a A+ ??

I dont come from a tech background. Even though I'm almost done with a IT B.S. degree, I'm still unaware of some basic things. Any suggestions?  Should I stick with trying to get the A+ before the summer?"

I'm not sure if I should start applying outside my city and move, or if I'm overreacting and should job search more in the area. Here's a backstory (I'll add more details in comments if you'd like, but I don't want to bore you with a book):

&amp;#x200B;

\- 4-year business degree (business admin, supply chain management) and 3-year CS degree (A- average for each of them)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Finished school in dec 2018 (took an extra year and a half to cram the rest of the CS degree, going through the past few summers since I was going for a CS minor originally)

&amp;#x200B;

\- 1 paid internship as an analyst at a good company, and work as a business teaching/research assistant that stopped at the end of 2017

&amp;#x200B;

Since December, I've been applying to any entry level dev-related jobs or analyst jobs that I can find. I'm resorting to temp data entry work at minimum wage for the time being (at least it's full time), because I'm going to go crazy if I sit around unemployed and apply everywhere for a year like some of my friends have. My city is manufacturing/logistics focused, with some healthcare work too, but not too much else. I'm hearing ""Oh, why didn't you learn a trade"" from everyone, and it's starting to get to me. My parents always wanted me to live at home and save money for a while, and I do too... but if I end up doing this for a long time, I might as well pack my bags.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I'm in Windsor Ontario, which is on the Detroit Michigan border. There seems like there's a ton of jobs across the border, but from what I've read, it seems hard to get companies to accept me for a TN visa if I don't have any dev experience. Almost all of the job postings I've seen say things like ""you need to be qualified to work in the USA"", which I'm not until I get a TN. I've applied to everything I can find in Windsor so far.

asbbvl,130,2019-02-19,"Losing to Grandparents’ Rights. Grandparents have lied (to attorneys and us), manipulated, stalked, and sued us.",SpringWish,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/asbbvl/losing_to_grandparents_rights_grandparents_have/,"We have about 12 days before a scheduled Pre-Trial Conference and I'm terrified. We are now pro se. Our previous attorney informed us that Grandparents ""did not want to take this to Trial"" and then suddenly they changed their minds and here we are. We had to let our attorney go because, frankly, we can't afford it.

Our family is our 2-year-old, my husband, and myself. We (parents) are in our late 20’s. Grandparents are my biological parents. Grandmother shows full-blown narcissistic traits. Extremely critical, grandiose, gaslighting, controlling, lack of empathy. She has had incidents of violent outbursts with screaming, swearing, threatening to leave and never come back, admitted to wanting to kill herself. Some of these incidents occurred in front of our baby. Any simple requests about how she treats our son were disrespected constantly (""please don't feed him this"" or ""please don't touch his toys if you're sick"" for examples.) Any such incidents were either denied by her or downplayed. In short: we didn't trust her with anything!

Grandfather is enabling to Grandmother's behavior and is just as controlling and manipulative. He's had conversations with my husband, saying, ""If you do this then \[you can get\] OP to do this. I know my daughter.” He’s said verbatim, “I don’t care about your feelings” and when I tried explaining that humans in general have a basic right to privacy, he said, “no I don’t agree with that.”

Grandfather stalked me at my previous employer. (After a conversation in which I explained I wasn’t ready to talk to my parents and *I* would contact them when I was.) I did not tell Grandparents where I was working or living, on purpose. Grandfather showed up suddenly while I was working and asked to speak to me. My manager pulled me aside and informed me. I started crying and could hardly breathe. She confirmed that I wanted him to leave and he did not come back. But it did make the rest of my days working there frightening. I had no idea if they’d show up again. And they now knew where I was. (To add… Both my parents stalked me several years ago, too. This wasn’t the first time.)

Where did this particular case begin? My husband and I made a poor decision—the decision to move in with Grandparents. Grandparents were granted standing in Court only because we lived in the same house as them, on a different floor. Previously, my husband and I resided happily in another state, far away. We were 100% debt-free. Then, we had a surprise pregnancy. Grandparents-to-be convinced us how lovely it would be if we lived near each other when Grandbaby was born. It was their idea. They have a huge empty house and they offered to help with the baby. Grandmother is a nurse so that sounded encouraging.

Before the pregnancy, my husband had already been thinking about going back to school. We shared this idea and Grandfather said he would pay for our living necessities so my husband could get his degree sooner (Grandparents are wealthy.) It WAS too good to be true. Me being a naïve dreamer thought, maybe it would finally put any negative past behind us (this entire post is the tip of the iceberg.) But the ugliness came out again as we began living with Grandparents.

Asking Grandparents to spend time with our son was like pulling teeth. So, we learned to stop asking. After our son was a few months old, Grandmother lost interest in doing anything for him besides playing rarely. When she did play with him it was usually at inappropriate times when we had asked her not to, like when our baby was learning to eat solid foods. At *no point* did Grandparents *ever* act in loco parentis. Husband and I went away one time during the year and a half we lived there, and Grandparents didn’t even want to watch Grandbaby overnight in the same house they already lived in. We hired a sitter.

Overall tension was terrible because we didn’t trust Grandmother with our child. My husband informed Grandfather that we were planning to move out. Grandparents were upset that we were leaving after &lt;2 years when they wanted us to stay the entire 4 for my husband’s degree. But my husband and I hadn’t realized before just how much we were being manipulated by them, especially with money. (Honestly, it was stupid and unnecessary to give up our financial independence... I know.) Grandfather wrote us a check every month to cover necessities like insurance bills, gas, clothing, toiletries. Grandfather also tried to convince my husband to *not save* any of it, because we “don’t have to worry about it.” But after the conversation about our plans to move, Grandfather withheld the check. Suddenly, we couldn’t pay our bills. Knowing the circumstances, it was 100% intentional.

Our family was trapped. Days later, after one last final blowup from Grandmother in the presence of our child, we left and didn’t go back. We had no jobs. I had recently recovered from disability, and my husband had applied to jobs a few months prior but none followed through. We couldn’t return to where we lived before, because my husband was only 2 months from graduating with an Associate’s (in a program that he was able to receive it on the way to his Bachelor’s) and, in order to satisfy his degree, he already had a paid internship coming which would be enough for our family to live off of. But for 2 ½ months our little family lived in hotels, Airbnbs, and finally with a friend that charged us rent. We were able to survive because I took a nights/weekends full-time job at a restaurant. It wasn’t enough, since we were still accruing debt until the internship. And it was a horrible financial blow, since we left the house we were living in sooner than planned. Now we have several thousand dollars of personal debt post-Grandparents, from those interim months. Our credit was also severely damaged after having to live off our credit card for that time.

To sum it up, we can’t afford this lawsuit any more. We were very close to giving in and allowing Grandparents supervised visitation every month, because are *EXHAUSTED* in every aspect. Monthly visits would still be tough on us because my husband works during the week and I work weekends and we have one car. Simply seeing them messes with us already enough—my mind reverts to a scared little girl. Grandparents asserting the fact they have enough time, money, and such resources to win this lawsuit alone scares the living crap out of me. They are pushing for non-supervised time with our son. They treat our son like a novelty doll. They don't attend to his needs. He’s 2 and he doesn’t know any better about their behavior. We did already have 3 court-ordered visits with them of supervised visitation. It was agonizing. Husband and I did our best to grit our teeth and act friendly but, underneath, we are still dealing with everything that’s happened, psychologically, financially… We do NOT want visits with them being written into a Court Order anymore. And, it would be so much better for our family in every way to move back to our previous state (where our son’s paternal grandparents and uncles live, too.) This lawsuit and a continuing Court Order would make that incredibly difficult.

I think we have reasonable basis to not trust Grandparents. I truly believe this lawsuit is Grandparents trying to control us again by bypassing us (Parents) completely to still get what they want. We don’t know what else we can do to fight any longer.

&amp;#x200B;

Other relevant facts:

I did consider having a restraining order against my parents but felt that was too assertive. At this point, I wish I had. I don’t wish them any harm but I want to go No Contact again. NC helped \*amazingly.\* We focused on rebuilding our lives and we began to heal. But now we are forced into communications with them because of the lawsuit. It affects us daily.

Speaking of mental health. We have been given the option in Court to ask for psychological evaluations for both Grandparents and us parents. I’m scared to do this because I’ve never been so angry or hurt or depressed in my life. I don’t want to hurt anyone, including myself, I just feel so hopeless and trapped by all of this. I don’t know if psychological evaluations would help hold them accountable somehow or if they would slip under the radar as usual. Could it help? Or be worse for us?

I gave all this information to our past attorney and he used almost none of it. I wrote him many papers with examples of Grandparents “meddling” (what he asked for) and disrespecting our family and he didn’t do anything with it. Our past attorney actually said to us that if this were to go to Trial, we would “get torn apart.” Well. We're about to.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR… Husband and myself were happy and successful living on our own. Surprise pregnancy, then Grandparents convince us to move in with them because “wouldn’t it be nice.” Grandparents don’t seem all that interested in spending time with our child after all. Grandparents enact manipulative, psychologically harmful behavior and Grandmother has violent outbursts in front of our baby. Our small family leaves the house. We struggle but survive. We get jobs and our own place again… without telling Grandparents where we live or work. Grandfather stalks me while I’m working. We receive unwanted emails and messages, as well. Suddenly, we’re served Custody papers from Grandparents. An attorney gives us a pity discount so we have food money and represents us. Court Mediator (a grandparent himself) seems to think Grandparents are sweet and innocent. No one in Court knows Grandparents have been playing dumb and lied to the attorneys about us, saying we didn’t communicate with them and “we have no idea why \[Parents\] are doing this.” Grandparents say they don’t want to take the case to Trial but file for Trial anyway. Our family can no longer afford representation. 12 days until a Pre-Trial Conference and we have nothing.

Edit to add: State involved in the lawsuit is Pennsylvania."
asbdhi,2,2019-02-19,Need help with resume for Big N companies.,millenseed,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/asbdhi/need_help_with_resume_for_big_n_companies/,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I've never tried this before. My story is this: after graduating from my B.Eng, I did my MSc then started working. After a few years I decided to go back to academia and do my PhD, from which I graduated a few months ago. While I did the PhD in a relatively unknown government lab (that houses  some of the best scientists in the world in my field), I hade to be enrolled at a university (which is also unknown). Just mentioning this, I don't know if it really matters. 

Since then, I've been a postdoc and at the same time a contract-based software engineer for a very large and respected company. Before that, I also did a research internship at one of the research labs of IBM and prior to my MSc I also did another internship at one of those large consulting firms. So there's three big names in my resume, even though current one is contract-based (and I've been doing a postdoc at the same time), and the other two are internships.

Now, even though I get some interviews from Big N companies (e.g. last week I made it to onsites for a SWE role at Google), the majority of my applications don't get replies. I'd like to change that. I am based in Europe and targeting EU positions.

Today I rewrote my resume, which used to be 4 pages long, following the resume advice from careercup. I don't really like the template, but at least I have a more concise 2-page version. Can you please comment on the following:

1. Overall readability
2. Appeal 
3. Should I include publications?
4. Should I change the ordering of the types of positions held? Now it's Professional, then Research, then Education. 

Thanks in advance!

After the navy i intend on pursuing a BS or MS in Software Engineering. I have a fair amount of questions if people can answer that would be fantastic. What can i do now without going to school to prepare me for that? What looks good on resumes i can start doing now? Will coming from a military background help my chances of landing a job or an internship? Do people look for leaders even when applying for a junior position or internship, or do they just want someone who can follow? What are your predictions for relevant languages and or programs in 5 years from now, i really enjoy java and hope it will remain a very prominent language. Where are good places to look for a job location wise? What is a good expected pay (as of now, i understand this can fluctuate in 5 years) for someone with military background and an internship in a junior role? How do i move past being a junior developer once landing a job? Is it just time there, consistent results, displaying leadership and taking charge whenever possible? What do they look for. What does the trend for previous pay look like from like 2015 to now, and what is your opinion on the future trend up to around 2025? I can't think of any more at the time, but these are some questions i'd like to get answered maybe from people who have experience and have seen these trends before, any input is greatly appreciated!

ase8sl,9,2019-02-19,I want to leave my job with the family company but I feel trapped and I do not know what to do.,lecorrele,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/ase8sl/i_want_to_leave_my_job_with_the_family_company/,"I really need help you guys. I will try to explain this as best I can.

I work for the family company my dad started (I don’t want to give a lot of details in case they somehow manage to read this). I have worked up here every summer during college, and started full time towards the end of 2017 upon graduation. My only job experience has been with this company besides working for a snowcone/hot dog stand in high school.

I graduated college with a communications degree with a non impressive 2.8 GPA. I never got an internship, but instead always worked for the family company (including school breaks too) when I could. 

I’m 24 years old now and have been working here for 1.5 years, and my dad is wanting to turn the company over to me pretty soon (next 2-3 years). This company is very profitable, bringing in close to a million dollars in revenue each year. All my friends would think I’m absolutely nuts if I were to turn this down, which I don’t blame them. However, though I do love my dad, I have never been able to get along with him, ever. There are a lot of qualities about him that make me have low respect for him. Some will suggest talking to him about it, which I have (and my siblings too) before, but nothing changes. Even if he did change, I know I wouldn’t want to keep working here. 

I would not be happy with my life if all I ever did was take his company and grew it more. I’m constantly battling in my head because I would have such an easy lifestyle and financial security. But I believe I won’t be happy because this is the company he started. I regret spending all my time up here throughout college.

I feel trapped because who the hell would want to hire me? I have a comms degree, had a poor GPA, not much job experience, and throughout college all I ever did was work for the family company doing basic office work and favors and such. Now, I am doing sales and account retention.

I know my parents would support me with leaving the company, and even talk me up if employers ever called (though I said those things about my father, he still would support). But I’m scared to officially quit, because I feel like I’m starting from scratch. What do I need to do? I don’t want to be here anymore, and I need help figuring out what my passion is.

I love working with people, I’m a very nice/easy going person, and I show up to work always. I am hardworking and passionate about the things I do. Some people may be question more about the relationship with my father, I do love him, but I promise you guys this isn’t for me. I need your help.

Thank you very much. "

I also have an internship at my school datacenter managing tickets and physically moving servers/helping with migration processes. The only career I'm interested in is software consulting, mainly for the social interaction and travel that it comes with. Ever since I got a chance to talk with a software consultant who visited the datacenter, I haven't been able to see myself doing anything else. I've had several interviews for software consulting positions, but none have led to the on site interview. Are there any tips from people who work in the software consulting industry on how to get a job in that field as a new grad? Any certs that are looked highly upon for software consulting? How would I show the people interviewing me that even though I don't have a software consulting internship, I can still preform well? Thanks in advance. "

I'm a U0 in the faculty of science doing comp sci. 
I want to go into industry after graduation so grad school is definitely out. From what I've read on other subreddits, it seems like coding skills (side projects, internships etc) are more important than GPA (not saying gpa's not important). 
My question is, ""1) Is a liberal in comp sci or a major in arts enough to get a job after graduation, comparing just the credit load and courses. 2) What are the most important courses in the B.Sc that I'm missing out on, if I do a liberal/BA?

Where can I find entry level jobs, in terms of job boards? I've been using LinkedIn and Indeed and have been applying to at least 5 jobs a day.

asgtyj,4,2019-02-19,i have a second interview for a job (advice please!),anxietyqueen95,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/asgtyj/i_have_a_second_interview_for_a_job_advice_please/,"i graduate college in 2017, i have been an unpaid intern ever since. i have been on a few phone interviews (horrible horrible anxiety leading up to those) and even fewer in person interviews (actually only one and this is the same company). my anxiety has made me cancel previous phone interviews and in person interviews, sometimes i analyze a job way too hard and i find so many cons that i can rationalize to myself why it was a great idea to cancel those interviews. 

now, this is a job at a company that i was excited to apply to (i applied to several different job titles at this company) but this job title was the worst of them all. but i finally got called in to do an interview and i could finally see this company that i had always been so excited about. i go in and it’s a tiny office with way too many employees squeezed into the space. there is only one closed off room and it is the executive’s office. it is a damn mess. i proceed to have this very awkward interview in this mess of a room, i feel like my interviewer was not prepared to give this interview at all. 

right when i am almost done with this interview, the exec comes in and basically i have to go over this whole interview again and my interviewer seems even more awkward and quiet now that the exec is here. he is a very loud man in general. he says at the end of the interview “ok so this is a laid back kind of place, people shoot me with nerf guns, ya know. you gotta be comfortable hearing the f word and using it. you gotta know how to take a joke and how to give one right back” total work hard, play hard kind of person (to a level that makes me feel like he is a jerk)

this place seems like it could either be great or my worst nightmare. now i have extreme anxiety about my future working at a place like this (it could be awkward or uncomfortable personal interactions like this day in and day out) as well as doing a second interview (an interview= the bane of my existence)

i don’t know if anyone has any advice on doing an interview or experience with cancelling interviews and regretting it or any kind of job advice that u think could be relevant, i just need someone to tell me something that i haven’t heard yet to give me the confidence just to not cancel.

I did my internships in other countries and my master thesis in Germany. I'm looking for jobs mainly in Hamburg and I'm very close to land a job in this city. Accordingly to the hiring managers feedback, I have feeling that I will have two job offers in two different companies in the Aerospace industry any time soon. I did my research and asked my friends (also Auslanders) who already found jobs in this industry and others such as energy or automotive. Based on the data I gathered, my conclusion is that the salary range for an **entry-level** job in **Mechanical/Aerospace Engineering** is around **40-50k bruto per year in Hamburg**. I already narrowed down to 45-50k when I was asked about my salary expectations in the interviews.

The **1st question** is: Do you have any objections regarding my conclusion? Basically, how much I should earn, guys? 

The **2nd question** is: How open the companies in Hamburg are to negotiate salaries for entry-level job positions? I want to have at least two offers in order have a leverage.

ashyik,21,2019-02-19,Where Do I Go At This Point 9 Months Post Graduation as a Subpar Student?,Ghost_Spookelton,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ashyik/where_do_i_go_at_this_point_9_months_post/,"Well, here I am asking/venting about my situation on a Reddit board. Let me preface with a backstory about my time in college and then the important points:

&amp;#x200B;

I was a B.A. in Computer Science and a minor in Digital Arts &amp; Multimedia Design from 2014 to 2018. I was a subpar student (2.6 GPA, no internship, minimal GitHub and portfolio website) because I didn't understand for a second how competitive and intense the ComSci market is. I had the mentality of ""C's get degrees"" but the reality is ""C's don't get jobs"" it feels like. My first two years were stellar, getting Dean's List and a great GPA but then the last two years were atrocious as I spent a lot of the time smoking weed and chilling with friends rather than studying and forwarding my knowledge. I was in a less-than-stellar state of mind too, NOT depression (I wouldn't compare myself to people actually depressed) but did not have a positive outlook on a lot of aspects of my own life.

&amp;#x200B;

After graduating last May and up until now, I have submitted about 600+ job applications in my tri-state area and some across the country, and have had about 50-100 call backs and follow-ups, and only about a dozen or so interviews which all ended in ""you aren't good enough"" or ""someone else had better experience"". Even entry level rolls they picked someone with experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of my skillset, my meat and potatoes is in JavaScript/HTML/CSS, Java and partial knowledge in a handful of frameworks and back-end environments like jQuery, mySQL, and Angular.js.

&amp;#x200B;

As for networking, I keep in minimal contact with professors and associates of large companies my college worked with minimally, only asking for help months ago and then trailing off on my own. I try to keep in contact with colleagues from my field, but I usually just get ghosted.

&amp;#x200B;

As for my portfolio, my Resume is well adapted from working with some college advisors and my only coding portfolio is a simplified Java Blackjack game with one suit of cards and a Spelling Bee game in Android Studio that I'm pretty sure crashes upon totalling points.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I feel like I don't even know my own field anymore, as I'm pulling my hair out trying to solve a coding challenge from applications that I'm sure other colleagues could answer in a few hours. I talked to my advisor in college about internships, but I never got a straight answer and missed the opportunity so many others took. I'm working two retail jobs and at the end of the day, I try to spend as much time relearning and applying but I'm so physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted that I can barely get anything done.

&amp;#x200B;

Loan payments have been kicking in each month and I'm tired of the occasional screaming match with my dad over getting rejected for the 10th time. At this point I would genuinely be alieved if someone hollowed out my skull with a bullet. I guess what I'm asking is, where do I go from here, how do I better network and ask professors without looking like a complete dumbass who didn't study his shit in school, and how do I find the strength and energy to go on after 9 brutal months of negative progress?"

I'm a freshman Linguistics and Computer Science major at UCLA (note: It is not a regular CS major with the engineering school. [https://linguistics.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LING-CS-spring-2017-update.pdf](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LING-CS-spring-2017-update.pdf)) Despite that however, I'm suffering through a very terrible quarter. It just hit me rapidly, and I bombed the CS 31 midterm (we only have one that is worth 25%) with a 53/100 while the class average was an 88. I'm completely stuck on our 4th project that is due later in the day, and I feel way behind in the class. I've been thinking about dropping the class with a W since last week. However, if I don't pass CS 31 this quarter, I won't be able to take CS 32 until the winter quarter of next year(I could take CS 35L in the fall first). Since CS 32 is so crucial for tech internships, how detrimental will it be to my applications or my future prospects if I don't land anything by the end of sophomore year?

I don't think I can feasibly take CS 32 over the summer either "
asiapa,4,2019-02-19,Need Advice: Keep My Day Job or Go Back to School and Work Nights,uptocode,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/asiapa/need_advice_keep_my_day_job_or_go_back_to_school/,"Hi Reddit.


I am a 23 year old male who currently has a decent sit-down office job making ~$38k a year at a company with a nice culture and benefits package.


I come from a large family, and I still live with my parents. However, I provide most of the financial support for my parents and seven siblings (five of which who still live at home). I regularly (at least every other month) pay the full rent of ~$2500 dollars. I also buy groceries, and do a fair amount of cooking. My father is self-employed and has a home business that partial provides for us. However, he cannot shelter the full cost of living for my family alone.


I am concerned because, while I like my current job, I am never going to break past $40k a year. There is not a lot of upward mobility at all. My parents are also aging, and I cannot depend on them to financially always be there for me. But at the same time, I also want to continue providing financially for most of my family.


I went to community college for two years. I am debating going back to school to help my career long term. I think having my first bachelor's degree might help me attract a better job and help me later in life.


I want to go to school for computer science. I was formerly employed as a front-end developer at a previous work experience. So, I am not completely new to the field. I also had internships back from when I did go to college that have given me some real-world experience.

So, here are my options as I have researched them:

**1)** Continue working decent office job in an unrelated field. Job pays $38k, has full benefits, and a small tuition assistance program. Do not go to school at all. Focus on developing career.

**2)** Work day job. Go to a reputable full-online BS in Computer Science program from a local university with a decent program and minor name recognition. Take advantage of work's tuition assistance program.

**3)** Go to school full time at a different local university with more name recognition and a better program. Get a night job at Amazon or UPS.

**4)** Go to a great university in Chicago. Move away from family in suburbs. Find night job in the city. I have a sister in the city that I could temporary live with.


I am hesitant to move away from my family because I have a younger sister in middle school. I am her world, and until she is old enough to handle it, I am really all she has. My family situation is not the best. I want to be a pillar for my family members for them to rely on. Would it help them best to try to go to school young while I can?


I really need some advice here, Reddit. Please feel free to ask me questions if more information is needed.


---


**EDIT:**


To give more details:


* With the exception of one sibling, the five siblings that live with me are all adults. They just work sporadic jobs, and they do not contribute regularly.
* The $2500 rent is for a house we share. So, this is just the housing cost for my mom, dad, my siblings, and I.
* My mom is unable to work much due to a formally diagnosed illness. She just works on the side which hardly covers her car payment.



I plan to have a sit down with my parents come spring, and tell them that the other siblings need to financially contribute as well. That said, I still really could use advice here Reddit. Please help. Any advice is really appreciated.


I realize my family's finances are pretty fucked Reddit. I just don't want to make a bad move here and make things worse.

Some background on me: I have a misdemeanor B for attempted computer crimes from three years ago. I'm able to get it expunged in a year. Since then, I've had two internships at solid tech companies, a few on campus jobs in college and a year experience as a software engineer at a unicorn. I've had two offers rescinded (one being from another big (2+2), but it was for an internship 2 years ago) in the past because of this record, but obviously I've had several others be okay with it, so it's pretty much a crapshoot.

In two days I have a final round with a big (2+2) for a software engineering position. When should I disclose my record to maximize my chances of being able to work there? I'm fairly confident that I'll pass the technical portion, so this is really the only thing holding me back. Should I tell the hiring manager straight up during the i n t e r v i e w, should I tell the recruiter after I (potentially) get the offer?"

Hi all, throwaway. If only 1 person reads this, it would be great.

My Gf and I have been dating for 2 years. She has been my first real relationship. I had one relationship before where my ex cheated on me by being on Tinder.

In september, we started to live together. Immediately, there were some issues: the appartment flooded, shitty landlord, fire, etc. My GF had an internship so she was away a lot, so it was basically me who had to handle it (with her support, that is).

We then moved to the place of a friend of mine, he lived with his wife and had an appartment with furtniture for us. We payed 300 euro all included while normally it would have been at least 900 euro. My SO did not like the place, but at least it was safe.

We also started to have sexual problems, because of me. My mom died, the stress of the appartment, school, my libido dropped. I let her be on Tinder during the month of october, because she has a higher libido than I do. However she told me she doesn't need it and we decided monogamy was a thing we highly valued in a relationship.

We often argued, I got frustrated and mad sometimes (never violent physically or verbally), but those things were indeed not ok. I should have realised that sooner, and I deeply regret it. In January we were supposed to move out but GF left on holiday, I got really mad and told her she maybe should look for a new place after she came back and that she should move her own stuff out. She thought I kicked her out then and there, but I did not mean it like that. This was on my Bday. In the weeks before, I had been contacted several times by an anonymous person through social media. They had sent me screenshots of her on dating sites (while we agreed on beeing monogamous) and the person had intimate details about our lives, also told me she had been cheating on me for a while...

I was hesitant, I admit. I should have believed her but my experience from the past relationship made me scared. After the moving out thing we were on a break. But my GF told me that if I would be on Tinder, or kiss with a girl, while she was on Holiday she would never speak to me again. While she was gone we talked everyday, I apologized a lot, went to shrinks and a sexuologist.

She came back, I picked her up from the airport after having payed her ticket, cooked her dinner etc. She then told me she had kissed someone else, ok. After that she said she had hooked up with a random guy in a toilet of a bar. To show me how it was to be really cheated on, to make up for our bad sex life, because she was drunk, because I had been 'mean' sometimes, because she was mad that I thought she was a cheater..

I cried the whole night, let her stay at my place. When I came back she told me that I should 'just forget about it'. I cried and told her to get out. She is still mad at me for that because I 'kicked her out'. Afterwards I payed the downpayment for her new appartment (she paid me back), her sister called and she pretended she stayed at a friends, while this annoyed me because I had been doing a lot for her (they had disinvited me from her wedding aswell, i mean, good for them). She also wanted sex with me so 'the other guy would not be the last one she hooked up with). I gave her 2 questions, one was to cancel the trip she planned in the summer (to the country where she cheated on me)

Afterwards, a few days later, she came back and told me she wanted to be with me but to have sex with other people, then it was because I had been so mean etc. I wrote love letters etc, nothing helped. She needs time and space.

I have been giving her the time and space she wants. Recently, she has been reaching out and so have I. Yesterday I stayed at her place, we had a lovely time, but it still involves me apologzing a lot, whenever I try to adress what she did, she told me I was in the wrong for believing the anonymous person and that it didn't mean anything, and how mean I was while living together. Me kicking her out for asking me to 'just forget about it' and me swiping on Tinder while she was there mean that I am 'still the same agressive person'. She got ill afterwards and I took care of her.

Currently she is not sure she ever wants to live with me again, after this she will move to a different country and I am not sure what to do. She still wants to hang out."
asq4ca,28,2019-02-20,Today i was threatened with suicide and blackmail because i didnt do someone else's work,BaidDSB,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/asq4ca/today_i_was_threatened_with_suicide_and_blackmail/,"Leaned a lesson that no one should be helped for anything. Nobody deserves free help and trust no one. 

Story: 

So im a BDS intern. The end date of my internship is on the 25th after which i will get my registration and certificate. Got 9 departments and i already got clearance from 7. In one dept, i have already finished my work quota months back. 

Let me preface this saying that im very good at computer stuffs and i have done a few things for the college itself as official promo work [for free of course]. Now a clinical tutor in this dept [community dentistry dept] knows how good i am. Yesterday she called me to do the video project of a fellow female intern. Now i have always been taught by my mom to help people no matter what which will only be helpful for my life. So, while i already told this girl no, because a teacher asked a favor [she used the word] i decided to do it, despite my best friend signalling not to do it. In return for my work the teacher promised to choose me over another intern for the last quota thing.

Finished it and brought it today. The Teacher asked for only one 3 second audio change. I agreed to edit it. But now when the time of the work came she just suddenly forgot she made a promise and told me i was acting as a child. It hurt me a bit to see a teacher lie [no one likes this woman, she doesnt even respect the Dept HoD to honor his request. Even student has a problem with her.] but i said ok and left. I told the intern girl to do the editing herself and i even told her the steps. She wenmt and complained to the teacher that im not doing the project which im not obligated to do anyway. I could have refused but i did it. Teacher called and asked me very rudely why i wont do her work. Now i was angry and told her in a slightly raised voice that i felt exploited and i dont want to do it anymore. 
She suddenly started shouting and told i shouldnt talk to her like that. Then she said he wouldnt give me clearance. Blood rushed in my head and i stormed out after she told me to leave. My friend tried to calm me down a lot and when i was leaving i told them if needed ill call my parents because she doesnt have the right [she doesnt. HoD has a right but he likes me a lot and gives me a lot of leeway.].

Came home. decided to post here asking for a video editor's to know how much they take for these stuffs [deleted that and posted one again a few hours ago because it got no attention. Seems like i lose out a lot of money for doing things for free.] My Best friend called to tell me that the girl went to ask my ex for help and to cut my name off from the project [i was allowed to credit myself] and she said a lot of bad things about me to her [told this story here before. How i was used by this ex to get another guy she liked to propose her.]

Around 4 pm i got a call from that girl asking what software i use. I told her everything very calmly.

Few hours later my friend calls again to tell me that the girl told him that she went to my ex but as soon as she saw my name she kicked the girl out of the house. Distraught, she decided to commit suicide but her mom told to make me do her video to which they decided they would blackmail me instead [her parents will come to the college to get me in trouble.] 

[Important Tangent: 4 weeks ago i was talking to this girl about how lonely i am  for the 14th. and how great it would have been if i could control my social anxiety to just ask my crush out or HER or another girl i liked from teh college. She thought i was asking her out and i said no. She plans to use those texts to blackmail me.]

Anyway. Told mom because this was a serious charge. She told to just do the damn edit and give it to her and i was a fool to help anyone. I couldnt believe she said that because she taught me to help people!

I tried to help someone. A good deed. Now im in trouble of not getting cleared and these blackmail thing is happening.  Never thought it would cost me this much. I will never help anyone again, doesnt matter if they are dying in front of my eyes or not. "
asqdaj,4,2019-02-20,Advice on Education Options,myrabreck,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/asqdaj/advice_on_education_options/,"Sorry if this post doesn't seem too specific. I am currently a middle school English teacher who did a software engineering program in high school 7 years ago, and I want to return to software engineering and computer science for he rest of my life. (I'm also being laid off at the end of the year.) The problem is that I'm a bit rusty and have no math or CS classes after high school. As long as I'm going to be unemployed, I thought I might as well consider my education options for breaking into development. 

&amp;#x200B;

My ultimate goal is to find employment and have access to an education that will allow me to explore the field in order to choose a specialization.

&amp;#x200B;

I've broken down my options as follows:

1. Do a second BS at a state university \[3-4 years, but if it takes that long I can apply into an MS after my 3rd year\]--my concern here is the length and the lack of a guaranteed completion date because of the program's scheduling issues. I won't be able to work full-time because the classes are during the day.
2. Do an online post-bacc such as OSU \[2 years\]--my concern here is that online education won't provide the networking I need to obtain references for an initial internship. Does anyone have any alternative views on this?
3. Get into an MS program such as Northeastern's ALIGN \[2.5-3 years\] that will allow me to take pre-requisite coursework--this is the ideal goal for me.
4. Do a bootcamp, and get a break-in job while completing a BS through an online program such as OSU--this seems secure, but I've had a difficult time figuring out the reputation of bootcamps.
5. Do self-study, move, and attempt to apply to internships and jobs--I don't know how well this would work, because most positions I can find in my state (NY) require enrollment in a degree program.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone speak from experience about which of these options seems the most secure, or what your experience has been with any of them?

asqkhg,2,2019-02-20,MBA Cost-Benefit/Break-even Model,ejburritos,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/asqkhg/mba_costbenefitbreakeven_model/,"In a previous post, a user asked if anyone had a spreadsheet that modeled the true cost of an MBA. Although it's hard to quantify something that has a handful of subjective factors, there are plenty of hard numbers that can help justify someone in making the decision to pursue an MBA. 

In the post, I mentioned that I found an older model someone else from gmatclub made and modified it. That original model can be found [here](https://gmatclub.com/forum/the-true-value-of-your-mba-64239.html). 

I made a handful of changes (a good amount of cosmetic ones as well) and tried to make it a little more user-friendly.

I have a description tab that contains some high-level notes and descriptions on the model, but I can explain them in this post as well.

The model presents 2 different scenarios: The ""Base Case"" and the ""MBA Case."" 

The Base Case is a scenario where the user does not go to graduate school and remains in the workforce. 

* The user inputs projected salaries and salary growth rates. 
* There are 3 ""stages"" of salary growth that the user can input.

The MBA Case is a scenario where the user foregoes 2 years of salary and also incurs a tuition cost where monthly payments begin 1 year after graduating and end 11 years after graduating. 

* Similar to the Base Case, the MBA Case also has salary and salary growth rate inputs for 3 stages.
* The MBA Case also has internship comp, a signing bonus, and various inputs for the student loan.

This model is not perfect and could absolutely get more granular, but the result (break-even year) would be affected marginally. Things you could add or should also consider is the change in living expenses during your MBA and post-MBA, taxes on income through each stage, and a PT MBA.

Feel free to give feedback to me and/or help others.

asr6mt,9,2019-02-20,I tried negotiating a slightly higher salary for my internship. They immediately pulled the offer. Is this something common? Was this a red flag?,ThrowawayBoobaJumba,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/asr6mt/i_tried_negotiating_a_slightly_higher_salary_for/,"Hi,

I was offered three internships for this summer. One of the internship was really cool and in a small startup. I really wanted to work there and it seemed like great experience. However, they were only offering 18$/hour CAD (13.5$/hour USD). I live in Montreal and other internships offer around 21-26$/hour. 

I contacted the recruiter after getting the offer and was very enthusiast about the internship. I simply asked him if he could do slightly better on the salary considering he was quite below the average and I am definitely more qualified than most students. 

He told me he was going to think about it and call me back. He called me back 2 hours later and simply said he was pulling the offer because he couldn't afford to pay me that much. I replied that I was just asking if he could do more, and if he couldn't, I would still consider the offer. He said he didn't care and even said that he would be happy to have me re-apply next summer. 

Honestly, I am quite baffled. I searched a lot on this sub if negotiating intern salaries was common and if there was the danger of them pulling the offer. People seemed to think that companies would never pull an offer simply for asking for a better salary and if they did, I dodged a bullet by not working for them. It does seem quite exaggerated to completely pull the offer simply because I tried negotiating the offer. I'm quite disappointed because me and the recruiter went along quite well and I aced the interview. I guess they were looking for people to abuse at their startup.

Do you guys think it's common, or at least a safe thing to do to simply open a conversation about a slightly higher salary? 

**Edit**: A few things seem to not be clear in my post.

Firstly, I did have other offers to turn to and compare with. I still have two offers. One pays 26$/hour and the other 22$/h. I just found that the startup I was trying to negotiate with would be an interesting experience, be it good or bad. I personally would love the be an entrepreneur myself later in my career. Having the opportunity to work with founders and see what goes wrong in a startup would have been quite interesting. Maybe it won't look as good as Google or any other name everyone recognizes, but I believe it would have been a unique experience. 

Also, I am not in it for the money. I will accept the 22$/hour one because it is more interesting. I just didn't want to miss out on 2-3$/hour extra that I could have for free. There is no point accepting an offer if you can actually get more. Worst case scenario, the startup would have said no to the increase and I would have still taken the offer. 

Secondly, I will write exactly what I said in the so called negotiation. This call occurred after a series of email with him leading to the offer, which I said I need a few days to think about. He then gave me 1 day and a half to decide what I wanted. I came back to him today and  I then asked for his number so I could discuss some details about the offer.

Me: ""Hi Mr John Doe, I am really happy you decided to trust me enough to give me an offer for an internship. I loved your company right from the start and after having an interview with you, I knew this internship would allow me to get a true hands-on experience where I would get to contribute to a product I believe in. After taking some time to think about your offer, I would love to accept it and help you implement [features we talked about in interview] and contribute to your product's success. However, there is just one thing. After looking through our school's statistics and Glassdoor, the salary you are offering is quite smaller than the average. Speaking to my friends and having other offers has made me realise the salary you are offering me is less than I expected. (I didn't say it, but wrote in the job posting that the salary was competitive, so I expected the average). As I said, I would love to get a change to work with you and am looking forward to working with you this summer, but I am wondering if you could offer a higher salary?""

Him: ""What exactly are you expecting as a salary?""

Me: ""I understand you are a startup and have different available funds, but I expected around 23-24$/hour. Up to how much would you consider paying me?"".

Him: ""I will call you back later with the answer to your question.""

He then called me to tell me they decided to rescind their offer. "

I thought my 20s would be better than this. Three years ago I graduated from marketing only to find out there were next to no jobs in my city, and to make it worse many of my friends started getting good jobs. They tell me the same thing every time - “You gotta network bro!”

I hate networking. I hate pointless conversations. And honest to god, I don’t even know if I want to do pursue marketing anymore. When I was graduating high school my parents were on my ass about going to college (typical boomer mentality, go to school and a job will come…) So I picked marketing and went from there. I don’t really have a passion for anything that could get me a job, so basically it was a waste of time. Ever since I graduated Ive only had two unpaid internships, one of which was such a waste of time it wasn’t even worth it to put on my resume (owner was a massive asshole and consistently devalued my work while only comparing me to interns who he blatantly favoured).

Why not move out of my city? Because the cost of living here is still relatively cheap. I could move to a larger city with more opportunities, but the biggest city I live near is CRAZY expensive and if I moved I’d have top work 3 jobs to pay the rent. No fucking thank you.

So now Im tying to find work after my last job let me go four months ago. Since then, Ive only had emails containing “We have gone with another candidate. We wish you all the best in your future endear…” OH FUCK OFF. Fuck that bullshit man. I’ve had interview after interview going nowhere and I’m completely sick of it. I can’t even get a fucking retail job. And I REFUSE to work fast food, I did not go to college for 3 years to serve fucking fast food hamburgers. 

Im sick of this goddamned bullshit. Im sick of going to interview after interview and hearing nothing back. Im sick of putting in all this effort to get nothing out of it. To make this worse, more and more of my classmates are getting good jobs, going on nice vacations, and meeting the love of their lives. How can I be happy when they are off having their lives come together when I get a rejection letter from FUCKING PETSMART???

I want to learn to drive as well but my anxiety always holds me back, plus therapy being expensive means Im stuck in a hole with no escape. And the bus transit in my city is beyond useless, especially now in the Wintertime. I feel so trapped. 

I feel like I’ve lost control of my life and there is nothing I can do to change it or make it better. Being unemployed I spend my days not doing much aside from applying to jobs and video games, and Im starting to go crazy from it. 

I can’t fucking deal with this anymore. When will my life get better?!?!"

astkn2,1,2019-02-20,Need advice (concerning lab responsibility),pigdiz,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/astkn2/need_advice_concerning_lab_responsibility/,"Hey all!

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so, I'm a part of two labs at the moment (2nd year grad student) and I help run health assessments in one of them. Let's call this the secondary lab. I'm also the data manager on that project and the project lead is also a 2nd year graduate student. Everybody else on the project, besides PI, are either close to graduating undergrad or post-bacc. Enter, let's call her Susie. She's also a part of both labs, however she's a post-bacc who is interning for 20 hours a week. We have similar meeting schedules because our primary lab has regular lab meetings, journal clubs, etc. I spend more time in the lab than 20/week, obviously, because we run on a 9-5 office schedule. And, I'm here later than that regularly, as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Circumstance: We need to enter in our availability for next month's assessments and I noticed that Susie checked that she was unavailable in the time periods that I know we have our journal club, and also the time we have our trainee meeting.

Petty: Our Journal clubs are not structured enough where we need to block that time off. If one of us is busy, we can often move it to another time. Also, the assessments can be ended early, so the time period that may involve our trainee meeting, she should be free for also.

Problem: I would note that I'm available during these times, but seeing how little Susie has available since she's not declaring availability in our mutually available times, I have a secondary-lab specific problem. If I say I'm available, more than likely me and the project lead would have to put more groundwork into these assessments and we've been trying to pass those responsibilities on to interns as it takes a lot of time out of our schedules and not really theirs. One intern has a set schedule whether she's in the lab or not and Susie has more freedom with her schedule to make up 3 hours that she'll be gone doing assessments per week. However, I love this lab and my PI. I don't want to say that I'm not available because Susie did and have this affect how much work will be put onto the leader and my PI, because that's even less fair.

&amp;#x200B;

Advice: Am I just being bitchy/nosy or is this a valid concern? Susie has also been annoying tf out of me by non-stop talking and being non-stop ego-buffed by her advisor about a paper she's first authoring that she didn't write :/, but that's another reddit complaint post and I'm sure that annoyance has inspired this rant, as well. I'm positive that I can't let my lab down and say I'm unavailable. Do you think if I find a way to mention this within the group (not as a confrontation, more like ""this day isn't great for me because of our trainee meeting, but we can cut the time off early"" she'll get the hint via leadership? I certainly cannot afford to be gone multiple days a week for 3 hour periods at a time and the PI has an even more strict schedule, I know for sure this slowdown of data acquisition wouldn't be fair to her.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Should I call out an intern in my lab who's likely bullshitting about when she's free to help with our research project?

&amp;#x200B;

Update to those who helped: I followed advice to only put what I was comfortable with and also included ""maybe"" dates that Susie Cakes did not. We got the schedule and I have 8 days out of March to her 4 :/. Which isn't horrible. The lead on the project has 7 days and the other intern has 6. I'm leading, but  not by far, could be worse.

I'm a recent graduate who used to work at a company for a month and a half, Jan 2019 - Feb 2019. I also used to intern at that company last summer. 

So I worked at the company as a BI Analyst; however, I was mostly developing reports. 

I was laid off the past Monday. 

I'm looking for advice on how I should mention my story to future employers when they ask why my previous job had such a short work time period. 

I had the specific task of developing and sending out daily reports from multiple sources. Unfortunately, the past 4 days, from that Monday, data hadn't been flowing in correctly and the data was incorrect due to a fault in the switch system in the technology. 

Since I didn't want to report incorrect and incomplete data, I decided not to send this report out (yet). I mentioned this to my supervisors. 

The CEO didn't like that no report was sent out for the past few days and let me go. Unfortunately, I had no say in the matter after I received the notice of termination and being escorted out of the office. 

I totally understand his decision because I was developing reports for a pretty expensive and huge reports but I didn't want to create false impressions of the data. 

As a side note, I take huge pride in my data and follow data ethics. I don't care if a program is underperforming but I do care that the data is correct and consistent. 

Thanks in advance for the advice, y'all.

I'm entering a new field outside my degree and therefore am open to any Analyst job I can find. I have not fully received an offer from either internships so this situation is completely hypothetical and I'm looking for advice.

**Job A**

I had an interview yesterday with Job A and although it was with a reputable company, the interviewer pretty much described a position with no work-life balance, long hours, and rushed training. The position opened up more out of desperation to complete the amount of work. They informed me that I would hear back from them by this Friday and shortly I received an email asking to call the recruiter tomorrow morning.

**Job B**

I finished my interview today with Job B and I feel pretty confident about it. I don't want to jinx it, but I would much rather work for this company. The culture is better, they are more willing to take me on as a FTE, and the opportunities for growth seem better. The thing is, the interview process is broken down into 3 steps: 1st was the phone interview, 2nd the in-person interview with managers, and the 3rd is with the partners (the company is blooming out of a startup). I was told I would likely hear back about whether I advanced to the 3rd round of interviews later this week or possibly early next week where I would then meet with the partners within the same week.

**My dilemma**

If I get accepted for both rolls - remember this is still hypothetical - and Job A needs to know by this weekend or early next week when I haven't completed my 3rd round of interviews with Job B, how should I proceed?"

A little background: I'm an ME student and I've done several internships at Apple and a few other big tech companies/startups.   


I can't return to the teams I worked on at Apple because they don't really do new grad hiring and I also think I got a horrible performance review from my last internship which is why I think I haven't had any callbacks (How does the internal performance review appear to recruiters?). The other big company I worked at I managed to get to the last round of interviews but I blew it and they rejected me almost immediately after the call.  


I feel like everything I've done so far has just been mostly luck, I managed to fail some of the simplest technical questions in interviews and none of my old employers want me back... Recently I took out 3 days of the week to do an on-site with several delayed flights and now I'm very sure they rejected me making the whole experience a waste.  


I'm not sure what the purpose of this post was, I kind of want to vent but also ask if anyone here has been in a similar position? I feel like I'll be in this shitty mindset until I finally manage to get a job and the opportunities for new grads are dwindling as graduation gets closer :("

I ended up applying last fall as a junior, and fortunately I got my acceptance a few days ago! 

However, I do have some reservations about the entire situation, particularly the fact that I am entering Haas as a senior, and thus pushing  back my graduation back by at least a semester (though let's be honest, finishing up Haas in 3 semesters might actually kill me, especially since I took Econ 136 already, thinking my Haas application was doomed). I'm going to be doubling in Economics as well, so at least I'll come out with two degrees. Today at the Winter Career Fair, I've had to explain to several recruiters that although I am a third year, I won't be graduating next May. I've definitely gotten a few confused looks, and more than one internship has specified that they want someone graduating between Dec 2019 - May 2020. 

I guess my post has two parts: 

\-Has anyone else has been in a similar situation, or does anyone know of a classmate who's done this as well? I've scoured the net for any threads touching on this topic, but I haven't found any answers from anyone who has actually gone through this. I'd really appreciate it if someone could talk a bit about their experience, because this seems to be a rarely-talked about situation.

Now I'm familiar with HTML/CSS/JS, Python, SQL, and Ruby, but I am currently on an internship where I HAVE to know Postgresql and Ruby on Rails. I've started so many tutorials, and I'm finding that the ones I find either have a million outdated gems, which would not be so bad if it only took me a little while to fix dependencies, but they usually take me hours, or they assume I know alot of things about the framework before teaching them to me. There are some specific things I can't seem to find good **video** tutorials on (I figure the alternative to finding ONE good tutorial is finding several good ones that explain the things I don't get in pieces):

* Writing an API for Ruby on Rails
* How to build a Postgres database from the ground-up using Rails
* Setting up Models, Views, and Controllers (Specifically View ""templates"")

at1whj,1,2019-02-21,Unhappy with my educational decisions,GhoulDragon,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/at1whj/unhappy_with_my_educational_decisions/,"G'day Reddit!

I (f21) have been seriously struggling with my educational decisions for some time now...

I took a diploma in media design about a year ago. I've always been very creative and I currently kind of freelance as an illustrator and designer. So, the next logical step after finishing design school would be to search for a job, right? Well, I didn't because I kind of still didn't feel ready for the job market. I went through some hard times during my school carrer (bullying, anxiety, self-doubt) but I kinda managed to get rid of my worries. However, sometimes they come back and I just don't feel good enough for anything.

In school I used to be one of the best in my class. I'd always get very good grades. Everyone praised me on how talented I am art wise. So yeah, taking that diploma was like living the dream. Altough, I was always very self-concious. Always thinking that I'm still not good enough.

So, back to education. After getting my diploma the next logical step woud've been to get a job but I was too self-concious to do that. My mum always tried to talk me into becoming a teacher although I don't even like kids. SHE always wanted to become a teacher but never did. So she would always try to make the job attractive for me.. like ""Yeah, you have soo much freetime and can do whatever you want. It's easy.."" etc.

Welp, so I decided to go to university (Europe) to become a teacher. My subjects are English and History. I wanted to do arts but they didn't accept me - which upsets me a LOT because I just don't get why! I was on numerous art exhibitions and all of my teachers in design school would praise me for my drawing skills. Like I said, I also take commissions regularly etc.

I used to be very good at English back in school. However, when I took my design diploma I became so rusty. Don't know whether you can tell from this text or not. I'm constantly worried that my English is too bad to become an English teacher. And History... It's really interesting and I like it but the exams are just too much for me. I'm constantly studying years and names and .. I think I'd be much happier with arts but I don't want the past one and a half years ""to be wasted"". Also I'm too worried that I'll fail again when I try to get into the arts program.

So what to do know?  
I think I developed some kind of mild-depression. I'm studying nonstop for 2 months now and I'm still not finished with the past semesters exams. While others are enjoying their vacations I'm studying for my f\*\*king History exam next week. I had like zero freetime the past two months. I'm currently supposed to enjoy my semester break but NOPE. And in march the next semester is going to start and I'm just way too overwhelmed with everything.

I feel like I'm wasting my talent and that I should go and search a job in a design / marketing agency. However, my mum always tries to talk me out of it like she did one and a half years ago. Like ""Well, you won't have much free time. You'll be working all the time."" etc. etc. ""Well, you have to get a job when you decide to drop out of collage."" YES, I KNOW THAT MUM THANKS. But everyone has to work.

The question is... Maybe I would'nt like working in an agency. I don't know. I just had an internship once but I liked that. However, I don't want to loose my progress in university for nothing.. I'm really stuck. I'm basically unhappy with every decision I took after finishing my diploma. I should've applied for a job but my mum always portrayed it in such a weird way?? ""It's difficult to find something. You'll be so stressed"" Etc..

I'd really appreciate your opinion on this. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm so unhappy in the moment!!"

- my boyfriend, after four months of lying to me and using me as his emotional blanket, telling me how good I was to him and how I fixed him, dumps me after I have a stretch of illness (explained below) and lies about other women, calls me crazy and tells me that he dislikes insecure me and blames me for asking questions about his feelings for me. Lies to me for months and then dumps me and acts like a cunt. The last month before he broke it off was horrible - he was texting other women, calling me insecure over it because I asked about it, telling me it was good I wasn’t too thin otherwise I wouldn’t want to be with him and implying that it was great I wasn’t a looker, but more homely. Told me I was too much of an opinionated woman, how I was too smart and difficult. Talked about his ex non stop, was a cunt sexually and kept fucking gaslighting me whenever I expressed any doubts or concerns about us or him, always blaming my anxiety for his own fuck ups;

- I develop bronchitis and it becomes chronic, along side a cancer scare, severe allergy reactions and the worsening of my anxiety (all in two months plus the two months since the worse passed and I’ve had bronchitis coming and going);

- work tells me they’re letting me go as I’ve finished the big project I was working on and they can’t assure the internship I was doing there for the bar (that’s how it work where I’m from), meaning I’ll have to postpone getting my law license a year and they lied to me when I applied and got in six months ago. They’re paying me in full but still, it’s a blow;

- my estranged father had a stroke and I am now on my way to see him. I’m nervous and stressed about this and having to go alone to sit in a strange city with only his idiot of a girlfriend to keep me company.

I’m exhausted. I really don’t know if I can keep this up anymore. I really don’t know."
at2l3f,1,2019-02-21,Should I give notice before or after a long vacation (after only working there 3 months),thermodynamichue,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/at2l3f/should_i_give_notice_before_or_after_a_long/,"So I started a new job back in November and was super excited about it- the right field and good hours for me (as a student.) 

However pretty quickly after starting the job, I realized some issues, the main one being that one of my coworkers that I spend the most amount of time with is pretty (extremely) hard to be around. 

This summer I need to complete and internship to get my degree and when I got this job I figured I would use this job for that. However, this coworker makes life pretty miserable and there are better opportunities elsewhere (I want to move back home for the summer.)

So I’ve known I need to give notice before quitting for the internship (which will still have me under 6 months and therefore still in the probationary period.) I have a week and a half long vacation in 9 days (that I got approved when I got the job.) My original plan was to take the vacation and then work 2 more months and then quit, but the situation with my coworker is making me miserable and dreading the job. 

I would like to quit sooner, but I don’t know when the right time is. My options are to give notice ASAP and offer to also stay two weeks after my vacation and give notice the day I get back from vacation (which seems awkward?) 

I’m feeling pretty guilty because, while it is a relatively easy and low qualification job, the hiring process took 2 months for them to hire me. (And they really needed the help with my position, I don’t want to hurt my other coworkers + my boss because of this one coworker.) 

What should I do? "

I graduate in December of this year, so I have one final chance to get some good internship experience over the summer. I've had two internships so far, both in construction management. I would really like to try a civil design firm this summer, but I guess I am not averse to another construction internship.

Anyways, I applied to many different positions, some across the country (US). One company has gotten back to me about a construction management internship. They want to hear from me by tomorrow, and they have a generous offer that is close to home. The problem is that the other companies that I have more interest in (particulary the design firms) do not send notices about offers/rejections until early March. 

I'm not quite sure what to do. If I accept the internship I have already been offered, I may miss out on more compelling offers in the coming weeks. There are some companies in that group which I could see myself working for in the future. However, if I reject the offer, I'll run a serious risk of being rejected by the other companies that have yet to contact me with an offer/rejection. It's a sort of FOMO situation.

Have any of you guys been in the same boat or a similar situation? Does anyone have any advice?"

Hi Everyone, looking to get a wake-up call or some sort of fire lit under me to focus on applications more. Wanted to see where I stood and what I need to do to make my application stronger.   


Applying Fall 2019 for Fall 2020 start.  


**Background**

* Work experience: 2 years in fast growing FinTech startup (one of the first business hires) - promoted twice (Strategy + BizDev Associate --&gt; Product Manager --&gt; Growth and Marketing Senior Associate).   
Prior to this - 1 year working as an intern for top bank in Blockchain Innovation Department. Prior to both of those above - ran (and managed 5 staff at) a surf and SUP school for 4 years to pay way through university.   
Also, 2 research internships at universities (one in Ireland, one in Saudi Arabia)  

* Extra Curriculars: Volleyball coach. Orchestra member. Developing app for lgbt mental + sexual health (wire-framed and working with medical clinic to accumulate information to use in-app). Part of inaugural cohort of students in FinTech Future Leaders - collaborate on FinTech papers for publishing and work on FinTech change consulting problems for T1 Financial Institutions. Fluent in Irish + English.   

* Undergrad school/major: Mathematical Science at a Leading Irish University. Top of Class.   

* Postgraduate school/major: Full-board scholarship for Masters in Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Notre Dame.   

* Other school: Night-time associates degree in Irish Language and Culture during freshman/sophomore years (Top of class). Study abroad in Hong Kong (HKUST) and letter of recognition for end of term grades.   

* Race/nationality: Irish but now living and working in US with H1-B  

* Sex: Male  

* Age: 24 (will be 26 if starting Fall 2020)  


**Stats**

* GMAT Score: 700 (Q47 V40 IR 8 AWA 6) from last August. I am retaking GMAT in a May. I performed very poorly in Quant (after ignoring to study it and getting prematurely cocky about doing well based on my degree). Aiming for 740+ with Q50+ and increasing V to 41 or 42 (I've bought and am working through LSAT books for Critical Reasoning since this is my weakest V section).  

&amp;#x200B;

* Undergrad GPA: 4.0/4.0 (89% overall. School has a grade-&gt;GPA conversion software that when I use yields a 4.0).

&amp;#x200B;

* Postgrad GPA: 3.87 / 4.0

&amp;#x200B;

**MBA Info**

&amp;#x200B;

* Goal of MBA: MBA in Finance.Go into BB IB or Consulting first to gain financial modelling skills and expand my network more. Longterm goal is to work in a VC in the Tech space (I know this is hard to break into so I would need more of a name brand on my resume (MBB or T1 IB))
   * More context: I want to use the MBA to develop the financial analysis + modelling skills needed for   
a successful career in VC. My masters in Tech Innovation + Entrepreneurship was great for the skills needed for startups and developing an extensive network but it lacked any advanced financial modelling or accounting courses.   

* Target schools: Booth / Columbia (potentially applying early-entry) / Harvard / Stanford / Wharton  (and maybe INSEAD) "

at5yry,93,2019-02-21,"PSA: Shoot for the stars, your application is unique",grajmiss,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/at5yry/psa_shoot_for_the_stars_your_application_is_unique/,"I know that in a search for certainty, people often look at things like GPA, GRE, class ranking, or alma mater to try to determine the chances of being accepted in a program.

But please don’t let people here or in your life stop you from applying to your dream programs. If you have a story to tell, tell it.

Please remember that each school has a vision for their graduate cohort, and this often involves  choosing a variety of students with different backgrounds and experiences. You need to show that you have strong academic potential, but you can do this in more ways than one.

My point is, if you’re reading this and wondering if you can’t shoot for the stars because you’re not a perfect candidate in numbers or grades, please ignore your detractors. Don’t let anyone convince you that your potential is cemented before you apply. You will never know your chances unless you try. Be stubborn, and don’t disqualify yourself or let others disqualify you here. Let the admissions committee decide, not you, not your peers.

I see tons of posts where people ask if a grade, a GPA, a GRE score will eliminate you from being considered. The answer is no. There are exceptions to every rule and you don’t know who is an exception. An average cohort GPA doesn’t tell you about every admitted student’s individual story and purpose. The SOP, recommendation letters, work experience, personal fit, and research potential also have enormous pull in an admissions outcome. 

Many of you seem nervous thinking that one or two details from your app are inadequate, and that it makes you ineligible from applying. Let me assure you that even the most prestigious universities have students that didn’t arrive with perfect grades or start-ups or publications in top journals! It completely depends on a holistic assessment of applicants.

Be stubborn. Not like a jerk, but have perseverance. Ignore the people who want to discourage you. Do your best. I can only offer my own story:

When I was an undergrad, I was trying to get admitted into my college of engineering. An engineering advisor (head of his department) looked at my first semester grades and told me I statistically had no chance of being competitive enough for ever getting into engineering. I ignored him. I took more classes and studied hard. The next year, I applied for one of the most competitive engineering departments at my school. They said I could always apply, but they had already chosen their students for the next year. I ignored it. Applied. I got invited to join one month later. 3 years later, I graduated, as I set out to do, at my school’s college of engineering, with honors.

Then, when I got offered a very rare, competitive internship, I had the l had the least impressive GPA of all my peers in the program (two had 4.0s, one was a double major with a 3.98). My program was “ranked” the lowest out of all the ones represented. There were less than a dozen of us interns selected nationwide, including a Fulbright Scholar with a perfect GPA. I ignored it. Three months later, who got the job offer? Me. Not them. I’m the only one that joined the company after school out of a nationwide internship cohort. And the sweet irony is: I now recruit and evaluate interns for this program as a supervisor.

Finally, when I decided to apply to graduate school, I sought counsel from many sources. One of my own professors literally told me I “didn’t have the GPA” to apply to her alma mater.  She actually laughed.  I ignored it. Fast forward to last month, I have a PhD interview at a school tied in ranking with her alma mater.

During this years application cycle, some masters student on here said my GRE score was not high enough. Ignored it. I now have multiple top 20 PhD acceptances, two with extra funding. Who is anyone here to tell you what you can’t accomplish?

People are quick to use metrics to categorize you, but having been a recruiter myself AND a supervisor that evaluates interns for my company, I know it’s not that simple. Don’t count yourself out until you receive a rejection email. Apply and see what happens. No one here can tell you what your potential is. Looking for a number to assuage your anxiety isn’t going to help, because it’s not possible."

And for the past two years, I have failed to get a job.

I just received what I think is the 31st rejection email in a row, and it just doesn't feel like it's worth it to keep filling out questionnaires and doing interviews when I know, in a couple weeks time, there'll be another email starting with: ""Thank you for your application, unfortunately..."". I'm applying for Master's courses just so that I have something to do next year with the hope it'll lead on to a job, but for the life of me I don't see how it's gonna change anything. If I don't get a job this summer, when I finish the MSc I'll be 22 years old with no job experience for three years.

Is this normal? Most of my friends are at least getting 3 month internships, and others have got 6 month placements. Is there a language or skill I should invest in?

Is it important who writes the letter? ie:a department head vs a professor or associate professor.

I’m just asking because I had a department head write a letter for me. However he basically talked about my skills in his class, then highlighted clubs, skills and plans which were all in my resume. He taught most of my calculus classes. Is this a strong letter from him?

1. If UIUC has one of the Top 5 CS programs in the country, why does it have such a high acceptance rate (66%)?
2. We didn't get to see the ARC on our tour, but is it really as big as people say it is?

I had an internship last summer at a prestigious institution and all of the graduate students I was working with kept warning me not to do my PhD there because the graduate school promoted an atmosphere that was very unhealthy. 

My question is, in a world full of all of these stories of depression and anxiety riddled graduate students... are there any schools actively taking steps to combat this problem? Do any of you go to or know of any schools that you would consider supportive? Are all of you just struggling through your graduate education, or are any of you at a place where you feel these statistics definitely don’t apply to you and your peers?"

If the companies are going to be scummy to you there is nothing wrong being scummy to them.  I feel like mass denials are starting to be sent out today most likely because the slots in the program have filled up (only 300 slots IIRC).

I just choked in the last interview (everyone had 3) and had to get a lot of help on a leetcode medium level problem even though I ended up completing it. I had all leetcode medium level problems and the first two interviews went well. I also didn't mesh well with the last interviewer.

Regardless, you have always got to keep working hard and persevering no matter what. 

This was actually the first internship I applied to for Summer 2019. I applied early August of 2018, phone interviewed late October, got ""denied"" in late november, then got an on-site invitation January 10th 2019, and got denied 2/21/2019. Feels bad to get denied after all this time, but I choked on the last interview so I kind of deserved it to be honest.

So I just graduated 2 months ago from a pretty decent college and finished off with a 2.8 GPA(I realize I'm probably already kinda screwed right off the bat). I've got some experience from hackathons and have projects and have actually gotten quite a bit of interviews ranging from less popular local companies and even made it to the final round for a couple of big N throughout college and kind of recently. However, I've literally bombed every single one. In fact, I feel I've only now started to get pretty good at these leetcode problems (I'm at around 90+ and I still don't feel that great at answering them) because I just have a lot more time on my hands now that I'm done with school (I really should have balanced my time better during but there's no point looking back now I guess).


Anyway, a lot of these new grad positions I've applied to only seem to hire within the first 6 months after college and because I've failed so many of these interview processes they all tell me to reapply around 6-9months later so it's looking like I can't apply until August or so. But 6-9 months from now I'm not technically a new grad...

It's looking like the only thing I'll be able to add to my resume when I can reapply is an open source project or so and maybe just improving my GitHub. Is this even going to change anything for me? I messed up a LOT in college and went through issues with coming out, anxiety, failing classes, and sometimes just not putting enough effort. I feel like now that I'm better at interviewing and trying more it's going to be a lost cause.

What should I be doing if I can't find SOME kind of professional experience to add to my resume especially since internships only allow me to apply if I'm still pursuing a degree after the internship ends? I also really want to move somewhere on the west coast of the US since I'm not near any large tech areas and I just like it over there.

***TLDR***: 

I'm a new grad with a low GPA and very little if any professional experience who's only now getting his shit together 2 months post grad. I don't think I can find better professional experience to add to my resume by August(what I assume is the next hiring cycle) and I probably only have one more chance to reapply to these companies before I'm no longer a ""New Grad.""

Thanks in advance!,igotallthesefeelings,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/atbexl/have_you_ever_felt_like_youve_wasted_portions_of/,"**TL;DR: 30-year-old college graduate just moved to LA to become a writer. He feels like he's not experienced or connected well enough to land a killer assistant position. He's too scared of asking people for help finding jobs, but he needs money. He feels like he has nothing to show for his work over the years, and that he never will.**


Long story, but I’ll try to make this enjoyable and understandable.


I’m a 30-year-old college graduate with a bachelors and masters in film and writing. In high school, I spent a lot of time slacking off which resulted in me not being able to go to a good college. I attended community college but dropped out because I didn't feel like I was studying anything that meant anything to me. Years pass and I meet the woman who would become my life, and she encouraged me to go back to school once I started to put together that writing made my heart happy. So, from 2011-2018 I attended school and worked for CVS to pay for school and life. 


Fast forward:
I've just moved to Los Angeles from Florida with my wife to pursue a career in film. I’m currently an unpaid intern, and it’s bumming me out that to increase my chances of becoming a paid writer I need to become someone's assistant. It's all a part of working my way up the chain which I understand, but it's a bit soul-crushing some days.  


I feel like the last seven years of my life was a gauntlet. Both of the programs I attended were difficult, and I also spent some of the worst days of my life working at those CVS stores, and I feel like I have nothing to show for it. 


I wasn't imaging parades being thrown in my honor once I moved to Los Angles.  ""Everyone he's here! The new voice of our generation. Give him every single writing job available!"" 

No way. 

I'm only responding to this apprentice/master relationship that's prevalent in my field. It scares me that one day I'll be someone's 38-year-old assistant or hell, I'll be 38, and no one wants me to be their assistant. 

I have zero office experience. I'm not comfortable around new people. I work hard, but keep to myself most of the time. These things have never been an issue in my life until now, and it seriously freaks me out that I wasted time learning the wrong shit. 

On top of all that neurotic goop - I don't have a job. I've applied for customer service jobs, temp work, etc. I have former classmates who freelance as film crew members, but I feel lame about asking them for work. I hate asking for help. My wife and I were diligent with saving money before moving, but I'm scared we may burn through those savings before I land anything stable. 

It's all a little overwhelming right now, and I'm trying to be positive because my wife can't find a job in her field either (Government and policy). There's no need to have us both curled up in a fetal position on the floor. I want to make her happy and proud, but currently, I feel like the jerk that dragged her ass to California. 

Keep in mind; we've only been living here for like a month. I'm currently feeling every single bad though I could have about my life. So, I found this subreddit and thought, ""Yeah, that sounds good. I need to vent like whoa.""

So... sage advice, words of wisdom, peppy cheers, or a cute gif will suffice. Thanks for letting me vent. "

I recently completed my operating systems class last semester with a B+, and I was so proud of myself - I had consistently made Cs and Ds throughout my freshman and sophomore years, and I had to repeat CS 314. Last semester, I started off my junior year strong - OS was my only B, everything else was an A or A-. I now have a 3.3 cumulative GPA, when I had a 1.8 my first semester freshman year.

I also secured an internship - two, in fact! It’s admittedly not anywhere fancy like Google (it’s a small startup and IBM), but it’s still an internship, nonetheless. I didn’t think I would graduate with one under my belt. I was so proud of myself for the progress that I had made since freshman year!...

...Until I see what my computer science friends are up to both on LinkedIn and real life. One of my friends is an undergraduate teaching assistant as a sophomore and already has two internships under her belt - one at a startup after her senior year of high school, and one at Google after her freshman year. She’s a Turing Scholar and has a 4.0 GPA. Another is a Senior, and he has a sweet job lined up at DE Shaw after he graduates - he’s had internships at Bloomberg, Facebook, and worked part time at HomeAway throughout his junior and senior years. Oh - and he also founded his own e-commerce fashion site while in college and is (most likely) graduating with highest honors.

I then look up UT students on LinkedIn and it’s even worse! There are FRESHMAN who have the same level of experience as me. This one kid who’s a Turing Scholar and BHP student started a successful Wiki business, I think in high school. Another has SIX internships as a sophomore at fancy unicorns like Uber, AirBnb, and Lyft. Another has published 3 papers in math and theoretical computer science, a research internship at Stanford and UMich, and wants to apply to top CS PhD programs. And it seems like EVERY profile I click on has a computer science student that has an internship at Google/Facebook/Apple/Microsoft.

I feel so insecure about my achievements :( My “progress” and “accomplishments” of going from a 1.8 to 3.7 GPA last semester seem so pathetic in comparison to these students. I also had someone tell me the other day that I only got an internship at IBM because I’m a girl, and this just added another layer of insecurity to my abilities.

ati36y,3,2019-02-22,[Help!] Graduating in May with bachelors in Information Systems. Should I go for help desk role or try to for something more aligned with my degree such as systems analyst?,austinspeedy11,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ati36y/help_graduating_in_may_with_bachelors_in/,"Title says it. I’m graduating soon with a BBA in Information Systems. It’s like IT but less technology and more business. 

I’ve always been a lot more inclined to IT than IS. I started as a Computer Science Major my freshman year and switched to IS as a sophomore because software development was way too stressful and time consuming at the time. For this reason I would say I’m a lot more tech savvy than most of the other people in my degree field. 

So I have a year of experience coding in java, some oracle sql experience, I know some basic batch and power shell (trying to learn more). I have a good understanding of basic networking principles. I’ve worked with enterprise software (Mostly ERPs), I have a good understanding of business requirements when it comes to IT systems. I have taken a lot of business classes like accounting, finance, management, and marketing. 


Here is my dilemma. I’ve always felt like I should have went to tech college and just did IT for two years and then do certs while at some entry position to prepare me for something better. I’ve always been interested in doing system administration and getting certs.

I live in an area of about 70k. We have a good amount of entry level IT help desk jobs open. I don’t feel as though it would be bad for me to start at one and make maybe 40k a year. My degree isn’t exactly for that but I know I could manage. 

I think I could do better pay wise at an IS analyst position but they’re are fewer of these and I have a worse chance at getting hired. I also can’t move for another year. I’ve currently been offered a job to do help desk at my internship for about 36-40k with benefits and profit sharing. It’s a great workplace that will give me a lot of chances to move up in the company. 

I want to work somewhere where I am using my degree and somewhere where I can learn more about IT, but also make enough money that I don’t feel undervalued. 

I know it’s a lot of gibberish. Thanks if you made it this far. Any kind of help is appreciated. 

PS: if anyone would want to help me or give me tips with a resume for an IS analyst role, please message me!

atin2s,80,2019-02-22,The hotel room,Bolliger69,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/atin2s/the_hotel_room/,"When I was 19 years old I worked in a small company as an intern. After working there for a month I started to settle in and become part of the team. They were planning on having a ski vacation to which I was also invited. I gladly accepted, knowing I could show of my skills. We decided on going to the Swiss alps (which are very close to where we work) so we arrived there by train a few weeks later. We were staying in a small hotel in the forest. It was an old traditional Hotel that didn't cost a lot. After our first day of skiing we arrived in the hotel and ate together. In the hallway I noticed a tall man in a suit walking by quickly with a large suitcase. He wasn't really dressed for a Skitrip.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that evening when I went to sleep in a room that I had to myself I heard a loud crack. It sounded as if something had broken in the room. I turned on the lights and saw that the ceiling had a huge crack in it. Large enough to almost look through it. I heard a muffled voice coming form the room upstairs until it stopped talking. I put on some clothes and went into the hall where a tall man came walking in my direction. He was wearing dark clothes and was limping slightly. He was the man I'd seen earlier. He said in stressed out voice: ""Did your ceiling just break?"" I told him what had happened and that we should talk to the hotel manager. As I walked in the direction of the stairs he grabbed me by the arm and said: ""No, I broke the floor. But if you tell them they'll kick me out of the hotel. Let us tell them what happened in a few days. Then I can stay a while longer"" I wanted to answer no but since he was still holding my arm I said ok. I went back inside my room hearing his muffled voice for a while then finally some silence.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day was different. I only went skiing for a few hours before returning to the hotel. I went to my room and saw that the ceiling was looking bad. I decided to put a chair on my bed and stood on it to look at the crack. When I looked through I saw nothing but when I grabbed the ceiling to gain stability it felt like it was wet. I quickly jumped down, pulling the ceiling apart even further. I stepped from the bed and looked at my hands which were covered in blood. I ran to the sink and tried to wash it off when I heard more cracking coming from the room.

&amp;#x200B;

 I ran back and saw parts of the ceiling laying on my bed. As I gathered the parts the ceiling broke completely and a woman fell on top of me. She was dead and her face was completely disfigured. She had scratches not just in her face but all over her body. I screamed, threw her to the ground and ran towards the door frantically. This was when I heard loud footsteps coming towards my door quickly. It was audible that the person was limping so I knew it was him. I heard banging on the door while I ran towards the window. As I climbed out of it I screamed for help and the man was quickly caught by another guest.

He had tried to hide several corpses in his hotel room. One of them under the floorboards which had resulted in the floor breaking. The police told us this. They also told us that he had escaped before they arrived at the scene."

Though I don't have the second offer in hand, I'm hoping for some advice ahead of time on what to do, should I get offered after starting my job with the first company. I've laid out the two possibilities:

1. I accept the second offer, and quit my first job just a few days in. I risk pissing off the first company, who will possibly mention this to the second company. Also, the second company will definitely find out I did this via background check, as my employment dates will now certainly differ from just the dates of my internship listed on my resume.
2. Turn down the offer politely, stay in contact with the recruiters, and hope to leverage the connections/my good performance as a way to get an interview in, say, a year from now. During that time, I'll stay &amp; learn at my current job and fine tune my interview skills. Bonus will be that now I can ask my current manager/co-workers for references too, if necessary.

I personally don't have ethical problems with quitting during the first week, though it's not something I'd plan to do more than once. I'm mostly worried about the negative consequences that might affect my career, as well as standing with the second company. If anyone could pitch in with some input I'd be really grateful."

My role is to manage the marketing department (though I am the only person who works within marketing). I used to really enjoy my job but things started to change when we got a new boss. He is a nice guy but tends to try to please everyone but his immediate employees and generally seems overwhelmed by certain aspects of his job. For reference, his role is public-facing and reports to a board. 

Lately I’ve been feeling overwhelmed with lots of last minute projects and requests from our 5+ person sales team. I will often let them know when a deadline is unrealistic or if I have too much on my plate. Sometimes they react fine but other times they’ll say things like, “I know you’re so focused on deadlines but I’d really like it this way,” etc. Deadlines are important because I’m often working with vendors to create specific materials and managing other projects on top of that. They also tend to be very nit picky and micromanage certain aspects of my work without taking my expertise and recommendations into consideration. I’ve noticed many of them have lots of recommendations on how we should be marketing without understanding why things are done a certain way. My old boss used to defend me in these situations and would shut down unnecessary comments or feedback. My current boss just tells me to do what they want. 

I have expressed to my boss that I always have a lot of my plate and would love to have another marketing person. Not to mention I want more of a leadership opportunity. I don’t think this is unrealistic considering the size of our sales team but he says we don’t have the money for it and won’t even invest in a marketing-specific intern. 

My boss also doesn’t take my opinions into consideration which has put us into bad situations just to please other people in different organizations. I end up having to pick up the pieces when we could have avoided the situation if I was listened to. From what I noticed, he puts more investment into our sales team financially and professionally. I have to constantly explain the value of what I do and why we’ve made certain decisions and investments in the past. (If it isn’t already obvious my boss comes from a sales background.) I’m honestly feeling like I’m not learning anything anymore which is not helpful for my career. 

I’m wondering if anyone has advice on ways to manage my frustrations so I’m not constantly miserable in the office. Am I just being sensitive or is it time to move on? I have started to look at jobs but am worried I will put myself into a similar situation.

TLDR: I’m feeling under appreciated and overworked and am started to feel constantly frustrated and resentful. Are there ways to manage these emotions or is it time to just find another job?"

&amp;#x200B;

So I had a phone interview today (mostly soft questions-- nothing too technical) for a software developer position.  A little bit of background would be that it's for an entry-level position at a medium-sized tech company starting in the summer, and I'm a college senior.

&amp;#x200B;

Toward the end of the call, my interviewer asked if I have any offers from other places and (after hesitating briefly) I said ""no"". However, this isn't technically true-- my former manager at my internship made it very clear that I am welcome back at any point. Further, a professor has invited me to join his lab as a research assistant to do full-time work. For whatever reason, these slipped my mind when I was asked.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is: is it worth mentioning this in some way? I plan on sending a follow-up email for the interview (just a courtesy email expressing my thanks and interest in the position), so if I needed to I could mention it there. However, it seems to me like I should probably just leave it alone and not bring it up. Any advice? If I should mention it, is there a certain way I can phrase it to not come off as rude?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks so much for any input!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: The company has made it clear that there will be further steps in the interviewing process, so there would likely be a later chance to mention this if that's more appropriate."

To put it generally - each customer submits a case through the website filling out various yes/no questions  as well as a short and long description of their situation and what they need from their service provider. Then, our job is to show their case to relevant service providers with the goal that eventually they contact each other and the service provider gets hired. This is my target feature - whether or not the service provider got hired. However, in practice this only ends up happening in about 5% of cases which means I've had issues improving my AUC. My end goal is to rank each case 1-5 depending on how ""hot"" it is. So far my approach is giving me better results than the humans who were doing it before (that is, my algorithm's 5's end up getting engaged 10% of the time versus the human's only doing 7%, and almost 80% of the engaged cases on the whole are sorted into 3, 4, or 5 rather than 1 or 2) but I'm not sure how to evaluate its performance on the whole since my AUC is still only around .6 and nothing I try improves it - which I suspect is a result of the low percent of successful cases in the training set.


I'm a complete beginner at Python but I've made quick progress. I'm learning all this machine learning stuff on the fly but it makes sense so far and my classes this semester are helping a bit. My approach right now is just using XGBoost on default settings, with about 7 features that I picked using an function to rank them as predictors by how they cumulatively affect AUC. It does slightly better than just the simple logistic regression I was using at first but I know I'm still probably using a naive approach. Ive tried using ADASYN to oversample my set of successful cases, but that doesn't seem to make too much difference. I've also seen things about using Firth regression for datasets with sparse target features but I'm struggling to implement it (I found a good gist that implements it but it runs into a memory error I haven't been able to solve).


My next step is to attempt to implement text-based classification, I'm not sure what kind to use yet though. I've been reading about a lot of things like Naive Bayes and XGboost. I'd like to have it stack on top of the XGboosting I'm already doing with the more categorical variables but most of what I'm reading just has text based classification as a means to and end in and of itself rather than as a part of a larger method.


So to distill this into a few specific questions:


Before considering text, I have some sparse features and some dense features (mostly sparse one-hot encoded stuff but also some like ""questions answered"" or ""length of description"" that are integer values). Right now I have these both together in my feature matrix. I've read about considering them separately, is that something worth considering?


What are some good ways to implement text-based classification in conjunction with my current model?


How naive is my approach overall and does anyone have any suggestions on things to consider I haven't mentioned?


Many thanks for any help."

If I work 12 weeks, I will have only about 3 days at home (I have to fly home from college) before driving/moving to the internship location, and I'll have a week and a half at home at the end of the summer. 
If I work 10 weeks, I'll get to attend someone's graduation which is important to me, and then have two more weeks at home, with the same week and a half at the end of the summer free. 

Is there a significant difference between working 10 or 12 weeks in a summer internship? I want to maximize the opportunity I have this summer (especially with this being my first and only non-research internship in college) and also make the extra money (about $1900), but the earlier start date is slightly inconvenient (I will miss a valuable graduation and only have a few days at home to prepare for the move). Any insight you have into the duration of a summer internship would be very helpful and much appreciated. I am leaning towards working 12 weeks to get the extra experience, but I'd love to hear input from people who have had internships before. 

Thanks!"

I’d like to hopefully go into the investment and finance field (on the more computational side) and was wondering what would be good for me. I’m currently a math major and am waiting for my CS decision as my second major.  
  
For CFRM, I know they really like people to study Math, Stats, Physics, CS, etc. so I thought that these two would be good (if I can get into CS hahaha). It seems, however, that a lot of investment bankers and such have studied finance and Business Administration. Looking at available internships and their descriptions, though, bring us back to the quantitative sciences.  
  
Two of my uncles are finance executives right now and they were the ones that introduced me and connected me with the idea of investment banking and finance so I’d hopefully like to see if I can follow through. I’m in Accounting 215 right now and it’s the first business class I’ve ever taken. I’m really enjoying it so far. My uncle told me finance is even easier than accounting, which is promising, but I’m taking it with a grain of salt since he’s ridiculously smart.  
  
I’ve talked to a career advisor, but it doesn’t seem like they know much about it. I was just told to look around on linkedin and consider what I was already considering. I know asking other students isn’t probably too much better if at all, but I was wondering what you guys might be thinking? Maybe for those of you who have/had similar goals and know more about it than I do?  
  
In any case, thank you very much!"

ator45,28,2019-02-22,Does anyone feel like one of their parents got worse over time?,FlimsyDragonfruit69,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/ator45/does_anyone_feel_like_one_of_their_parents_got/,"Ever since I was a younger kid, I always felt like my mom was the worse of my two parents. She was the one who would yell, scream, and sometimes hit me if I got below a 90% on a test or didn't do as well as she would've liked me to do in swim or at a piano lesson. 

For example, I remember once getting an 84% on a math test in 5th grade. 21/25. My dad picked me up from school that day (my mom usually did), and I told him about it. He was like ""Mhmm. Yeah. Okay."" So basically neither showing disgust or approval. Kind of like a ""whatever.""

When my mom got home that night, she was pissed off. That wasn't fun. My dad sometimes did get angry with me when I was in elementary school, as all parents do, but he always said ""Learning is more important than grades."" 

However, I feel like as I went through middle school, high school, and now college, my dad became the harsher of the two. In middle school, I got all A's, and he would say ""stop bitching about you getting an A in pre-algebra; you asked me for a lot of help and I bet you still don't get it."" 

In high school, I distinctly remember him getting angry about my 2280/2400 SAT score, and he said to my mom, ""Look, if we don't RAIL her about this, she'll think it's a great score."" And I'll admit that a 2280 isn't necessarily the best score. It's great for MOST colleges but probably not Stanford and the Ivy League. Anyway, things turned out okay on that front. I got into a decent public university that they were thankfully satisfied with.

I also remember him getting angry over my 750/800 in SAT Chemistry and angrily saying that one of his friends (whose daughter went to MIT), thought it was absolute shit and that the friend hoped that my other subject exams went better.

In college, I once interviewed for a research position at UCSF. I didn't end up getting it because I was a freshman, had zero wet lab experience, and I think the interviewer just did it as a formality (as in s/he already had someone in mind). My dad has been conducting research for many years as a physical chemist, and he was like, ""See?! I told you that you wouldn't get it. You don't have ANY skills to conduct research well. You are clumsy, slow, and inexperienced."" Well duh, I'm 18. You're 54. You've gotten a PhD and have been to school/work longer than I have. His words are still at the back of my head as I'm applying to research internships right now. 

And even nowadays, he gets more aggressive than my mom about stuff. Not that my mom has never yelled at me--oh she has. Many times. And he will also yell at her for things. She'll just step back and take it. I don't even know how to describe it. It's like he'll just raise his voice if he's annoyed at the most mundane, short-term thing that won't even matter in a few years. 

I think my mom is now definitely the more passive of the two, but she also enables him to get away with things.

I'm not even sure what caused this change over time, other than the fact that my brother died when I was 11 (when I started middle school) and he lost his job (well, he still has a job, it's just that it's less stable because it involves research). And so what if one or both of those events caused the change?

Getting angry at me and my mom doesn't bring him back, and he never really tried to look for more work. Maybe it was because when I was younger things were less scary in terms of my future, but like, yelling at me now doesn't brighten my future. Whatever.

Just wondering if anyone can relate to one parent getting a lot worse over the years.

atpc0g,93,2019-02-22,What are the best paying companies where you can work an honest 40 hours a week and have a life?,HorseOceanSorcerer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/atpc0g/what_are_the_best_paying_companies_where_you_can/,"Hey all. So I, like many of you, started reading cscq in college. I went to a shit school and never thought I could go to a 'top' tech company and make the kind of salaries people post on here based on my peers. But worked my butt off and managed to get an internship at a Big 4, which I converted to full time. Then I went to a big unicorn that offered even better comp and benefits and the chance to do cool work.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is I'm so, so tired. I'm only a few years into my career but I'm sick of putting in 60 hour work weeks, getting hit with crunch, being under-resourced and over-utilized. I know this kind of comp / career capital is what people would kill for. It's definitely what I wanted back in college. But as I've gotten a little older I care so much less about work and so much more about my life outside of work. My partner, my hobbies, my family, etc. I don't want to spend my early 20s staying till 8 at the office every night trying to crank out code for a company I could care less about. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, cscq, I want to pare it down and put in an honest 40 hours of work and make solid pay. I think I'm a decent engineer, maybe even a good one. But I don't want my life to revolve around work anymore. I just want to keep it reasonable, take on solid problems that won't consume my life, and enjoy myself.

&amp;#x200B;

On the tradeoff curve between work intensity and comp, where's the best place you can go for low work intensity and medium-high comp (hopefully competitive with Big 4 / startups)?"
atppfb,2,2019-02-22,Concerned About Letters of Recommendation,lessthansilver,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/atppfb/concerned_about_letters_of_recommendation/,"First time poster, first time applying to graduate school.

I'm currently in the process of applying to master's programs in computer science, and I'm concerned with the overall quality of my application. I currently have a 3.4 GPA, recently scored a 161 Verbal and 165 Quantitative on my GRE (still waiting on my score for the writing section, but I'm 99% certain it's on par with my other scores), and I'm confident in my writing abilities for my Reasons Statement/Statement of Purpose/one of the other billion ways to say ""application essay."" In terms of schools I'm applying to, I'm applying to UNC Chapel Hill, University of Kentucky (which I am currently a student at), and University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee. Of the three, I would prefer to get into UKY.

Where I'm concerned, however, is my letters of recommendation. I was a quiet student for the first three years of college and didn't interact with professors at all really (which is something I really regret, but time travel hasn't been invented yet), so there isn't many professors that I really know and who know me. As it stands, my current letter writers are my manager in my application development internship that I've had for six months now, one of my physics professors, and the part-time lecturer for one of my computer science classes (who is really the only computer science lecturer that knows me enough to write a letter).

When requesting my letter of application, the part-time lecturer brought up the valid and very worrying fact that students are better served by having full time faculty write letters of recommendation. The problem is that the only full time faculty in the computer science department I've interacted with is my current professor for my final design class, and I've only known him for five weeks now, but we're friendly enough with each other (although I could be reading too far into it and he's just a very nice person). I only have roughly 2 1/2 weeks until the first application is due, and I'm wondering if I'm up the figurative creek, and I missed out on grabbing a paddle.

In conclusion, what I'm wondering is if my application is strong enough on other fronts to make up for these weaker letters of recommendation. Any advice as to how to proceed with these final few weeks of my application is also welcome. In advance, thank you for your time in reading (and hopefully commenting)."

I am looking for some career field advice on how I can best prepare for the future and continue to ensure my future expands. 

&amp;nbsp;

Some background info (vague on purpose):  
• I am in my mid twenties  
• I have a Bachelors in Info Assurance and Cyber Defense  
• I will graduate in April with a Masters in Info Assurance and Cyber Security  
• I was recently hired at a Fortune 100 company and will begin working in late spring. The exact position details is TBD and can be tailored to my interest and strong points   • I have no certs beyond an IBM Analyst cert  
• I am a US Veteran (relevant only to possible resources like [this one](https://fedvte.usalearning.gov/coursecat_external.php?group=ALL))  
• I currently do not know any coding beyond some minor Perl and I also have written a few programs in JS with the aid of Google and peers  
• Certs are not covered as an employment benefit for where I am going so there is no need to wait to see if they will pay  

&amp;nbsp;

My question is what should I do, beyond focusing on my Masters, to help prepare me for the workforce and to be as valuable as possible to them when I arrive. My current plan is to work on Network+ and self teaching myself Python through Code Academy. From there, I would like to complete Security+ and then tackle the OSCP for some technical skills improvement. OSCP seems very daunting to me as it appears to assume a great deal of knowledge is expected before beginning (like with sites such as HTB) but I don't want that to deter me from getting a head start with my career by obtaining it. Lastly, I would like to complete CISSP. I am looking to complete these 4 within 1.5-2 years from now. 

&amp;nbsp;

As stated, I would like to arrive to the workforce as molded as possible in order to be as great of a benefit to the company as they will be to me. This will be my first professional experience beyond internships and my military career. 

&amp;nbsp;

Are my goals too lofty/am I thinking too much into this? Am I missing steps? I would love to hear some input and guidance and am definitely accepting of any resources for the 4 certs I listed alongside any others that you may feel may benefit me more. "

Therefore in his eyes, it is beneficial to acquire some extra advanced skills from the grad level classes.

On the other hand, I am an intern at a company that works with wireless technology and the engineers there say that doing a thesis is a good idea because it's a project that can distinguish you on your resume. They also say that if I wanted to return and get my PhD at some point, it would be better to have already completed a thesis.

So I spent 12 weeks straight out there. First time I really got away from home and totally away from my family for an extended amount of time. Felt like i got lucky on my housin stiation because I ended up in a place that wasn't so expensive by Bay Area standards (850 a month for a room in a shared house, and the room was of decent size) and on top of that I got a long with all of my roommates. So it was the first time I got to experience what it was like to go to work as an engineer, come back home and enjoy your money, and not have to worry about studying and all that. And boy, that was GREAT. Looking back now, that was a HUGE game changer for me. I think it really planted a seed in my head that I need to get out.  


I came back home and long story short, wasn't able to get my old job back that I had before I went out there. So I had to find something else to do. Ended up at UPS, but that was only part time. Once you've done an internship like I did and get paid like I did, you won't forget it. So I picked up Uber and Lyft, and I feel like I've learned how to make the most of it.

I'm in my 3rd year of college, CS degree, and I've been doing a pretty good job in school. I have a 3.7 GPA and often times I'm the one helping my peers. In terms of personal project, I developed a small RPG game within C++. That project was good enough to convince a large bank to hire me as a year-round part-time intern.

The bank assigned me to work on a feature on Angular and I've been spending the past month trying to learn it and work on this project. My issue is, I just can't wrap my head around this. My greatest struggle is that there so much files and components and I can't keep track. I try to follow something by navigating through the different components, end up getting confused, lose track, and can't back-track. I try to go back to a code I read, can't remember which file it was in. Then theres the modules, there must be thousands of them, how do you guys keep track of what does what, when to use what, what methods a module has, etc. HTML/CSS.... who said this was easy. I get the basic tags, but similar to Angular, there so much stuff going on. If I had to spend my time looking up every CSS class, I'd be a 100 years old when I'm done. I feel like writing a multi-threaded application is easier than writing advanced HTML/CSS.

&amp;#x200B;

In school, I was able to get by by thinking through a problem and using basic programming fundamentals and data structure. In real life, I can't even think through a problem, I'm just paralyzed with information overload. My question is, how do you handle all these information and how do you get comfortable in them?"

Exactly a year and a half ago i made the switch from chemistry to finance.

Reasoning for switch:

I loved chemistry and whatnot but it wasn’t my one all be all. Working two-3 jobs while learning chemistry was too time consuming for me to make any difference to the world.

However math is really what im drawn to which is why i choose finance. All my math classes stats are A grades. 

Where i am now:

Year and a half later i never looked back on chemistry. Ive read about 15 books related to finance/investing in my free time and I love it. I enjoy what I’m learning and the nature of analysis. 

My only problem is im a senior and i haven’t been able to land an internship yet.

I have entered case study contests and others to gain some experience/exposure to the work involved. 

Enrolled in finance B.A, with a minor in Econ.
In a year when i graduate i will have a 3.1 overall and a 3.4 or 3.5 major gpa. My finance and math grades are all A’s except macro and acct. 

I know its not stellar but its not horrible. 

What kind of jobs should i be aiming for? What kind of places should i continue to seek internships from? Is there anything else i can do to to boost my resume?

Ive been part of an investment club, and ive begun networking and meeting people. Ive connected to one manager for a company that does 300m in business, and i know one entrepreneur  who I’m going to assist with an online business. (Rest are classmates/peers)

I am also a stats tutor at my college if it helps. 
Ive been tasked with as many as 15 kids at once. 

Excel skills are nice, i get by with sql, and learning program R. 

Whats my future looking like?

atvuhl,26,2019-02-23,My career fair experience,mighty_joey,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/atvuhl/my_career_fair_experience/,"On Thursday February 21st I attended a career fair at a local University. It happened to be the University I graduated from with my first degree in business economics. I took a half vacation day at work to make attending the fair possible, as it took place at 11am on a Thursday. 

I was unsure of what to expect from the career fair. I pictured some company representatives who were being reluctantly pushed by their employers to go stand at a booth for several hours. This was not at all the case. The people I spoke with were genuinely interested in hearing my story and seemed to have a vested interest in being there. A lot of the people I spoke with were managers in the IT departments at their respective companies.

The reason I am sharing this is that I was blown away by how great of an experience the career fair was and I feel like students in this program should find local career fairs to go to as well. The fact that the career fair I attended was at the University I graduated from does not matter. I could have gotten into it regardless. At the door I was asked if I was a student or alum. I simply said ""alum"", and that was it, I was in the door. There was no further verification.

The company representatives were eager to meet qualified people to bring into their organizations. This shows by the fact that I've been offered two interviews for internships in the two days since the career fair, and I wouldn't be surprised if I hear back from another company or two. I am not bragging, I am simply stating the fact that we are in a great position in this CS program because we have a degree in another field, and many of us have some solid work experience under our belts.

So my suggestion is tidy up your resume, find some decent clothes to wear (i wore a suit), and head to a career fair near where you would like to work. You will likely come away with a few new connections, a professional headshot, and if you're lucky, some legitimate job opportunities."

aty9tz,3,2019-02-23,"Overcoming the odds, improving over the next 3 months",CompMath,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/aty9tz/overcoming_the_odds_improving_over_the_next_3/,"So I was recently released from my first software development part time job which I managed to stick with for 11 months.I was laid off due to my slow ability to work and turn over tasks super fast. To give some context I did have a rough start to the company since I started near the end of the semester where projects and finals are in full swing and then forgetting to mention that I had an internship for the summer so I never was able to fully engage and understand how the system worked for being able to have fast turnover time. Every time I was assigned tasks it would take me at least a week to complete since I was to stubborn to ask for help and pick at the other developers brains. Basically after my internship I was essentially playing catch up with the team trying to comprehend more of the code base on top of trying to implement the task I was assigned. For this I was laid off.

What I learned is that I still have much more to learn in computer science and I need to work on my problem solving and thought process. I have a habit of trying to code as soon as possible rather than sitting and drawing out a solution and not really considering test cases. The good thing about all of this is I have an internship for the summer as I would like to improve my skills before then and overcome this failure so I can potentially get a full time offer from them or even a co-op. I am a super senior in college graduating in Fall 2019. What advice would you guys give me. I do have a bunch of passion projects that I know would help me out and have been trying to get more into HackervRank. Any advice is welcome!

Also side note you can tell that I am or was inexperienced since when I joined the team I had quit my 3 year old job as a dishwasher."

My friend said that they were joking with friend C about something and C suddenly got really depressed. Upon asking, my friend found out that C’s grandparents passed away. My friend literally said, ‘why can’t he get over it? I was just joking. When I feel depressed, I just do things I like and grind assignments and get over it.’ 

This made me feel really mad, but more astonished. It’s 2019 and there are still people not taking mental health seriously.

As reading week ends, this will be another super sensitive and high stress time for most students, I believe. There will be midterms (including some of us who have three midterms this Monday), people looking for internships / PEYs, people going through relationship problems or friendship problems or family problems, everything. **you’re not alone**. 

I was recently diagnosed with anxiety because of something that happened in my relationship and I’m seeing a therapist. UTSG covers $120 up to 20 sessions which is really generous. Therapy is really useful; if, you don’t have a trustworthy / mature friend to talk to about serious problems (people who dismiss you and say everything will be fine), and you’re going through lots of stress and anxiety and worrying about things alone, definitely find a therapist or someone who you trust to talk to. Anxiety only amplifies if kept within yourself. 

Take care everyone 

Tl;dr it’s getting to a very stressful period of time for all of us. Don’t be afraid to seek for help. Please seek for help. "

au07l3,1,2019-02-23,Worst Theatre Production Experience I’ve Ever Had,creepyreni,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/au07l3/worst_theatre_production_experience_ive_ever_had/,"I (17, Junior) go to a performing arts academy and our technical aspects are a big part of our shows as well. I’ve been head of publicity during a lot of the productions (Photography, promoting, headshots, decorating the school). At our school, in order to graduate, we need to complete an internship in technical theatre. Heads of crew in our productions are usually options for internships when you’re a junior, except publicity. My acting teacher suggested to the technical directors of shows who runs internships at our school, that head of publicity become an internship.

During my interview, she asked that, and I of course was super happy and accepted that offer. She let me know after getting the position that I’d be working co-head with a senior who needed to do their internship as well. I was kinda okay with it, but it bugged me because she only took the position to complete her internship. I later found it she had no publicity experience and I was glad to teach her but she didn’t really seem to run along with it.

We decorated the school, I did a lot of work. My co head and I had trouble communicating. We both have really different personalities which makes the atmosphere awkward around us. I would often text her a paragraph explaining some things that needed to get done or discussions and she wouldn’t reply or just say “Okay.”

The thing that set me over the edge was a text message I got from the assistant technical director (a senior). She (summed up) said to me that she was dissappointed in the work my co head and I were doing. She said we needed to communicate more and take more pictures and post on the social media more. I messaged her privately and addressed the situation. I hadn’t been given the social media account passwords, so only the other crew were posting. She proceeded to tell me that the Technical director and her say no, that I can’t have them. I’m thinking to myself....I’m the head of publicity and your restraining me from doing my job but get upset with me when I can’t do it?

She texted me telling to talk to the technical director one day. I went and the TD told me I’m failing my internship and I should just give it up. Okay, I’m doing the same if not MORE than my cohead and she gets to keep her position because you LIKE her?

Tech week had been a living hell. My co head is best friends with the assistant technical director so they constantly watch over me and it made me feel anxious. I asked for someone else to bring their laptop so I didn’t use up all the storage on my google drive uploading. I used up to 5 google accounts because no one else would help with uploading. I got a text from the co head saying I put the camera equipment back in the bag wrong, but I hadn’t even used the schools cameras the day she said that. She who doesn’t know how to use camera starts criticizing me, a person who knows how to use a camera, on how I don’t know how to.

I put photos into a file to get printed out. 117. They only printed out 47. My house crew who are amazing are rushing to get stuff completed because the technical director starts yelling at us. When I explain the rest of the photos weren’t printed, they are clearly upset that one of the people didn’t do it all. Canons take in CR2 format, so I said they could’ve easily converted the rest into JPG, but they didn’t. They were upset and I suggested someone quickly go out and print, but they said it’s no use. Today, the last day of shows, I went out early in the morning, and bought the rest of the photos with my OWN money. I walked up to the technical director and said that I did this and she wasn’t even happy, she just said “Oh okay that’s good” and brushed me off.

One of the directors (my acting teacher who I love) said that my crew and I could go to the very back and watch the show since no seats were being sold back there. I took the offer and invited one of my crew members up because she’s actually nice to me. The technical director is on stage before the house opens and starts YELLING across the house at my crew member, saying why we were up there. I didn’t want her to get yelled at so I said back that we were publicity and that one of the directors let us up here. She runs off stage and starts complaining to the other director, pointing up at me and complaining, almost yelling. 

I love my school but I hate the technical director, she’s two faced. The show was amazing, though, we put on broadway level productions and this was still didn’t fail to amaze me. I enjoy being a part of everything but this has ruined my views of technical theatre.

TLDR; The technical director and assistant technical director treated me like absolute shit and I got paired with a co head that’s never done the position and was clueless"
au0oqo,11,2019-02-23,Should I leave a job I really enjoy after 8 months for an Engineering Residency?,cs_throw_away_1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/au0oqo/should_i_leave_a_job_i_really_enjoy_after_8/,"I just started working for a company in the Bay Area last month and so far I really enjoy it. People are incredibly friendly, the work is interesting, and we actually maintain a consistent 40 hour work-week (which I've heard is rare in CS?).

However before I got this position, I applied to the Google Engineering Residency and I just found out that I got in. It starts in September and the salary for the program would be about the same as my current salary so that's not a major consideration.

So far I'm leaning towards taking the position and leaving my job. I've always wanted to work for Google since I love their products and their work culture and I'm not sure if I'd get many chances after this. It would definitely boost my resume for the future, which would be great since finding this first job was really tough for me. And after this program, my total compensation would shoot up.

However, is there something that I'm missing? Even though I've heard that the Google culture is great, I've heard horror stories about 60 hour work weeks at big companies. And I'm not positive that it's a great career move to leave a full time SWE position for what is essentially a year long internship. Also I do really like my company's culture and coworkers and I'm not sure how rare that is. I wouldn't want them to hate me if I leave 8 months in.

Is there something that I'm missing about this situation or should I just go for the Residency? Any former Residents care to share their experience with the program?

Topic : Feelings of Inferiority,HelpMyWeinerAndMe,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/au14ui/goal_of_post_unloading_and_receiving_myriads_of/,"Summary of Inferiority I think about all of this everyday, deal with this too often and am reminded of it frequently because of “triggers”. And I’m tired of it. Trying to navigate them, understand them are just as stressful as the feelings and circumstances are themselves. I don’t even know what a solution or coping looks like... Being Ugly and Feeling Ugly. When I look at myself in the mirror, I don’t like what I see. I am ugly. I am ugly to myself and I am ugly to others, there’s no other way around it. It devalues the rest of me in the eyes of others. I don’t like living while being ugly. It only holds me back from things. Because I’m this way, I’m super limited for romance on top of being short/small framed. It makes me not desirable romantically ever ( knowing and thinking about that makes me feel bad) and it makes me inferior in the eyes of others. I don’t like being associated with this ugly. I don’t like being reminded by myself that I look this way. It’s like going outside with your shirt inside out... but with a shirt can fix it, but being ugly is something that is forever. I’m tired of being beneath others and not good enough. There are times when I don’t even want to go outside because of the way I look. It’s painful. Sometimes, I have to remind myself that I have to live my life and can’t let being ugly take over. There’s no solution to this. I just have to deal with it. Many people don’t have to deal with this at all, so they don’t have the solution for it or need a solution. I’m tired of my therapists sugar coating things for example telling me I’m not ugly. They only say that because there’s nothing else they can do or say to people when they’re ugly. And I envy the attractive population so much for it. Wanting to experience what it would be like to be with an attractive person and feeling love leads to viewing of pornography and the viewing of pornography leads to more envy and frustration (on top of all of the other bad things about pornography which is another problem I’m dealing with - health problems). Being reminded of my looks by seeing myself, by seeing someone with better looks or with generally normal or good looks and by seeing people who are intimate irates me so much the same way the other things I'll say do. I wish I could take out all the feelings of anger and envy and inferiority on something. Before, I even wanted to take those feelings out in some of the most heinous ways possible but I suppressed those feelings by remembering that doing something unfairly doesn't solve the unfairness I've been dealt.
I feel uncomfortable around attractive people. Part of it has to do with social anxiety I suppose, and also because I don’t have much experience socializing or getting to know an attractive person (since most don’t want anything to do with ugly people since often times, ugly looks devalue us in society and functions almost like class). I feel uncomfortable because I am seen as beneath them in general and feel beneath them as a result, on top of already being uncomfortable around them because of their good looks alone. When I feel this discomfort, I become irritable. The only solution is to get away from the person or situation. It could even be as small as riding the subway with some of these people. I also feel down and angry upon seeing them, knowing that I’ll never be good enough for them romantically or sometimes socially because of my looks (even though looks aren’t the only thing that define me). And of course I envy them too. For their looks, for the privileges that come with looks (there are so many of them as looks and the idea of sex really baits people. Self confidence, status, being treated nicer, luxury of love and relationships and using their looks to advance in life to acquire wealth, more status/popularity, etc.) and the fact that they have less worries and easier lives and the chance at finding love. I also feel hatred. I hate ones that use their looks to their advantage on purpose. I also hate ones that are really confident in their looks and kind of flaunt it or come off as conceited. It's like a mockery to me. Even seeing them smile sometimes feels like a mockery to me. It's rare that someone would actually mock me, but it just feels that way. Seeing these people is a trigger within itself. That gets me angry, on top of the hatred and sadness I have to deal with by looking the way I do and therefore not being good enough socially or romantically. I just hate the unfairness. It’s also frustrating not being able to change the way I look or how others see me. I hate being not good enough and inferior and uncomfortable and not being able to change my looks.
I feel uncomfortable around white people who I also find attractive. Part of it has to do with social anxiety I suppose, and also because I don’t have much experience socializing or getting to know a white person since I grew up in a low income neighborhood where white people don’t reside in, because I distance myself from white people infested areas because of this discomfort and because anything that’s geared towards white people (places, hobbies, groups) is likely geared towards wealthy people or white people since here in New York the two are nearly interchangeable since most whites are middle class or wealthy (it’s to the point where I don’t know much about my city because I’ve really sheltered myself because of this discomfort and can’t tell what from what in the city. There probably are some places that are meant for everyone, but I won’t find out anytime soon because of this cluelessness as a result of the discomfort and because of the discomfort) - both meaning the same thing to me as someone who grew up low income from immigrant parents (who don’t speak english) with little understanding about the white and professional world. Not all white people are the same of course, but it’s hard to truly understand that because of my lack of interaction with them. I feel uncomfortable because I am seen as beneath them in general because of the whole underlying white supremacy and class ties that runs the United States and feel beneath them as a result, on top of already being uncomfortable around them because of their color alone. Some of them look down on you by choice and/or look down on you because of the very same kind of conditioning that makes me feel beneath them. It would be fine and dandy and all if that was it, but on top of having to overcome these disadvantages, I also have to compete with these very people in order to earn freedom and successes, through education and job hunting, finding love etc. When I feel this discomfort, I become irritable. The only solution is to get away from the person or situation. It could even be as small as riding the subway with some of these people. And of course I envy them too. For privileges that come with their skin, general looks and the fact that they have less worries and easier lives and the chance at success. Many things are made by them and made for them. It’s often why in commercials, the families that are portrayed are middle class or wealthy ones that live in homes of great quality. It’s also frustrating not being able to change the way I look or how others see me. I hate being not good enough and inferior and uncomfortable and not being able to change my looks and upbringing. I envy both the privileges that these two kinds of people have and also envy the things that they don’t have to go through like the stress I have to go through dealing with and trying to navigate all of this as they get to just live life carefree. It’s worse when they’re ignorant to the problems of others and/or are conceited.
It’s a little more than just white people though. It more has to do with socioeconomic status and popularity/fame more than anything (since like I mentioned before, most white people are wealthy and as a result acquire status easier and faster here, so at this point it boils down to that, however). I feel uncomfortable around people of higher socioeconomic status and people who are talented (white people because of privileges that make their lives easier and therefore give them the time, money, resources, connections and mental health to perform and advance... not to say that other races cannot become talented... it's just that we have less privileges) or have higher status in general because of their popularity or looks and the privileges that they have as a result and therefore feeling like. Also people who have done and experienced a lot in life are people who I feel beneath and uncomfortable around. Intelligent people too. People who have accomplished a lot, both quantity and quality. People who are ambitious and have a lot to show for their goals, life and ambitions. Upon seeing or reading about someone who is incredibly accomplished, I feel bad about myself (one example, browsing someone’s linkedin account... I couldn’t even dream to measure up to that person even within two lifetimes. Privileged or not, I’m still behind.) I also feel pressured. I feel like I need to change who I am and try to be as ambitious and as accomplished as they are so that I can feel good enough and on par. It’s impossible to be on par with some people. I’m not good enough to be around those people and I also feel bad because I don’t measure up whenever I'm around them. People in powerful positions have the power to dictate your worth in society. Job employers dictate if you’re good enough for the job, rich white men created white supremacy, professionalism which describes how assimilated you’ve become to white culture in the sense that you speak formally/properly like a white person and earn their respect (since all the people who are employers/in power are white people because their governing and taking over - killing off the native americans, but let’s not go there) and beauty standards (which were created to benefit their women). Professionalism and white supremacy are two entities that are simply one in my eyes. Two societal barriers that make others look at me as inferior and not good enough and therefore make me feel inferior. I shouldn’t have to change who I am in order to be accepted by others, but it looks like there’s no other way out because the people in power dictate your worth and how you attain freedom. And there are some people of higher socioeconomic status that don’t see others as inferior or beneath or not good enough for them, yet I wouldn’t be able to tell at first glance of course because you can’t see someone’s true colors based on their looks alone. You would just have to find out by chance. So I’ll still feel beneath them initially, unless I am of equal socioeconomic status or develop value through some skills or talents or something weird. And then all that’s left are the things I can’t change like my skin color, my height and my facial features.
White people here in NYC are often attractive as well, so the discomfort is more - a direct correlation to how inferior I am to them. It’s because generally speaking white people and light skin is found to be attractive. It’s also because white people here and in general are wealthy and therefore have had access to healthier foods in their neighborhoods that they could afford, and likely have more time and more resources that aid in general life well being which reduces stress, likely are more fit because of the healthy foods and opportunities to play on sport teams etc. It also doesn’t help that white people are seen as the most attractive, so even if I did have a chance to find love, there’d be no point since white people are the most desired. I envy white men for being able to charm attractive women. Their facial structure could even be less attractive than mine, but their white skin is what saves them. Light skin is just attractive. Do you know how small I feel (especially as a man?)
Being Brown. Brown skinned men like myself are short and often times ugly. Our darker skin alone is not seen as attractive as light skin. Our facial structures are less attractive too. On average, we are on the shorter side, which makes us less manly and attractive. White men are seen as more attractive because of their light and I guess because of their socioeconomic status and because of white supremacy norms or in other words - because they pushed the idea that they were the best because they have it all and created it all - others consciously and/or subconsciously bought into it and are attracted to this power and associate it with those looks. After all, we are attracted to people who can provide. Also, negative stereotypes don’t help people of my color. We’re known for being short, weak, ugly, awkward, nerdy, smelly, unmanly and “nice guys” (not very assertive and submissive) and more things exclusive to the Indian or Middle Eastern nations’ cultures. Brown people are really unattractive. A lot of our facial features aren't attractive, but it also has to do with racial conditioning/white supremacy/racism that’s rooted in our subconsciousness that influence what we find attractive - by that I mean beauty standards being Eurocentric.
Being Short doesn’t bother me all that much. It sucks. It only sucks a lot when coupled with the others - being a poor, brown, ugly minority. I guess it does suck because it’s the main thing on top of being ugly that prevents me from having a chance with women. It also makes me feel small around people. Even the majority of women I feel are my height or taller, and the short ones don’t want short men anyways.
Growing up poor under immigrant parents and having less resources not only has led me to this mental health dilemma, but has also put me in a position where I have a hard time even trying to express how I’m feeling (bad verbal/written skills, also another insecurity - thing that makes me inferior and uncomfortable and also a thing that professionals and white people look down on)don’t know of terminology - like social justice stuff that aids in my expression, understanding and self development when it comes to this stuff. I’m tired of this. I’m also tired of having to see mental health doctors for my problems (other problems too) and also dislike being around doctors in general, police officers, people in authority in general and having mental health problems because I’m in a position where I’m beneath others.
I’ve always had an identity crisis growing up because of feeling inferior to different people and being around different kinds of people. I felt inferior to the strong and tough african americans and latinos in my low income neighborhood, so I wanted to talk and act like them to be accepted. I felt inferior to the tall and attractive white people, so I wanted to talk and act like them to be accepted. Now I don’t really know who I am, how people see me and who exactly I want to be or what things would make me feel on par with others/would make others see me as on par or what my personality would be or want to be seen as or whose opinions or views of me should matter.
This last part I just added recently. I feel kind of uncomfortable around or when I think about or read or hear about people who are kinda sexually forward or ""excessively promiscuous"" (wasn't allowed to use a certain word here) or when people are intimate with one another and I can see it or when I suspect that someone who I walk by in person who I feel could be an actress in adult films (unfortunately because of all of this stuff in general, I too have preconceived notions about people based on their appearances. I feel like in the society we live in, it’s impossible to bypass that because stereotypes and whatever are everywhere.) I know that doesn’t make sense because I’ve been watching adult material, but I guess that’s how I feel when I view it for what it is and not in an unconscious state for pleasure. The feeling is a strange one. I don’t think it’s anger. It might be envy, but at the same time it doesn’t feel that way. It’s almost like a feeling of - this is wrong (even though sex and stuff are normal. Could it be that I feel inferior to someone who is promiscuous?). I wish I knew how to explain it better. It does stack on top of the envy I have for those people envy though there’s a lot more than what meets the eye like how the industry treats them bad as well as the professional world. I can’t just shake off the envy because... well what I envy about their situation is present and nothing more. Thoughts like these are almost a constant I feel because it’s such a big issue coupled with my insecurities about my image, but also because I feel as though the bad sleep I’m experiencing is making my mind a bit wonky. In class it was hard to concentrate because of these thoughts coming and going as well as the need to comprehend them and I guess come up with solutions.
Summary
I hate it all. (Not mentioned, but my home life and upbringing - verbal abuse, lack of resources, stupid parent, stupid single parent, underserved or nonexistent resources for low income neighborhood, no privacy, sadistic family members)(that I still have to be grateful and guilty because there are people who will look at me and think my problems are only a fraction of theirs), things I’m not even allowed to mention, Other insecurities of mine like my voice, body, Being ugly, being short, being a minority, not being good enough for love and more and being beneath others according to existing societal standards, beauty standards, people pretending to be who they aren’t, a superficial based society as a result of media brainwashing us that makes people alter themselves through lighting, makeup etc., white supremacy and its byproducts, professionalism (which is another way the elite separate themselves from the rest and define everyone else as inferior)(another way that forces people to become fake and superficial in order to please others. Resumes, speaking formally, dressing in clothing for interviews that has no value otherwise), the white, privileged and wealthy profiting off of the poor, ignorant minorities through business while putting on the facade of genuinely trying to help us while also making them look superior because it only emphasizes the class difference. (hate that I) envy those who have wealth, good looks that “award” them too many privileges one of which being the ability to earn money through modeling and adult films (even though the adult film industry isn’t pretty and is a toxic and manipulative and fake and ugly on the inside), envy and privileged people and my identity crisis. I’m tired of having been conditioned to feel inferior and to want to prove myself to others (when maybe I should be the one I should be proving things to.) Who do I want to be? What makes me feel good enough? What do I determine my value on without sugar coating things for myself in order to avoid feelings of inferiority altogether? How do I cope with my shitty circumstances for the rest of my life? How do I live with this anger and frustration?
Edit : 2/23/19 So today, I volunteered to join an organization that was tabling (had a table up at a place in hopes of handing out fliers and information to promote events and whatnot). (You might wonder why I even did this upon finishing reading this. I want to volunteer because I genuinely want to help the less fortunate, give back to the community and to give back to nature. I wouldn’t have put myself in such an uncomfortable position otherwise) It already started off as a bad day because I had gotten a shitty haircut. Another thing that gets in the way. No hair shape or style works on me on top of being ugly. Continuing on.. So the person I volunteer with is someone kinda extraordinary (I only know because I looked them up online, their linkedin account). They’ve been involved in a myriad of extracurriculars, volunteering, internships, attended an amazing university, graduating with honors etc, speak 3 languages, supports themselves, isn’t even going to settle for the career they have now (which shows ambition and that they’re advancing and moving on in the future... this and this person in general is a good foil for me though in the sense that their existence highlights how little I do and am, how little I’ve done and how much time is going by without me growing or making anything of it), once lived in one state and moved across the country to live in this state (showcases the ability to make a huge transition, plus showcases another experience/stage of life this person has undergone) is married, is under 25 years old, is a professional, is attractive, is kind, cares for the environment, is self aware, is ambitious, is talented... someone like that would be amazing to be around. It’s a privilege to be around someone so lucky and amazing... but it also feels like a punishment. I’m one hundred percent inferior to them no matter how I look at it. If I could live to be 200 I still would be inferior to them. A whole second lifetime and I wouldn’t be able to measure up to them. (why does inferiority matter so much, I don’t know. I suppose because we’re conditioned to want to fit in to have friends/love, so our value and appearance matter. Humans need one another. Stuff like professionalism, status, looks, etc. matter when looking for work - which earns money which earns freedom/time.
So yeah, I’m inferior to them, so I was uncomfortable around them. I was also uncomfortable because I didn’t have much to say because I’m not really cultured. I don’t do much or know much because of my upbringing whereas she and the other people I was with are a couple of years older than me and are cultured, accomplished, have had a lot of experiences, are really making the most of their time/are situated (job, home, etc.) I was also uncomfortable because I was supposed to help out but I didn’t really help out because I’m not a very social person and I didn’t have much to say because I don’t know much about the organization. I felt stupid too. She was trying to simplify things for me, but that act from her part only made me feel more inferior. She was nice, it’s just that on top of everything else, her knowing that I was uneasy made me feel even more small and inferior. In addition, there were many accomplished and/or white people who were coming to our table and were at the event which made me uncomfortable.
I just snuck out midway through the event and sent an email to her because I wasn’t going to further make myself look and feel inferior by explaining all of this to them, especially in person with my poor verbal skills. I’m already ashamed enough and am considering breaking up communication with them even though they’re helping me by inviting me to volunteer at events that would assist in furthering my college/career (especially since I’m a lousy 20 year old student at community college) Feeling inferior makes me anxious and the inferiority and anxiety made me depressed. I just had to leave. And so I did. I can’t change my circumstances, but I can work on myself to be on par with some people (though I’ll never be on par with certain people). I can find ways to cope with stuff like this and everything else when I feel down because when it gets to the point of feeling depressed, it consumes me. I forget about the rest of the world and what’s amazing about it and then I feel like my life is over because I can’t have or be certain things. That’s not to say that all of this isn’t small in terms of the grand scheme of things. It’s very big. However there is more going on in the world.

au1ca1,2,2019-02-23,Goal Of Post : Unloading and Receiving Myriads of Supportive Responses. Please Help Me Accomplish My Goal. Topic : Feelings of Inferiority,HelpMyWeinerAndMe,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/au1ca1/goal_of_post_unloading_and_receiving_myriads_of/,"Summary of Inferiority I think about all of this everyday, deal with this too often and am reminded of it frequently because of “triggers”. And I’m tired of it. Trying to navigate them, understand them are just as stressful as the feelings and circumstances are themselves. I don’t even know what a solution or coping looks like... Being Ugly and Feeling Ugly. When I look at myself in the mirror, I don’t like what I see. I am ugly. I am ugly to myself and I am ugly to others, there’s no other way around it. It devalues the rest of me in the eyes of others. I don’t like living while being ugly. It only holds me back from things. Because I’m this way, I’m super limited for romance on top of being short/small framed. It makes me not desirable romantically ever ( knowing and thinking about that makes me feel bad) and it makes me inferior in the eyes of others. I don’t like being associated with this ugly. I don’t like being reminded by myself that I look this way. It’s like going outside with your shirt inside out... but with a shirt can fix it, but being ugly is something that is forever. I’m tired of being beneath others and not good enough. There are times when I don’t even want to go outside because of the way I look. It’s painful. Sometimes, I have to remind myself that I have to live my life and can’t let being ugly take over. There’s no solution to this. I just have to deal with it. Many people don’t have to deal with this at all, so they don’t have the solution for it or need a solution. I’m tired of my therapists sugar coating things for example telling me I’m not ugly. They only say that because there’s nothing else they can do or say to people when they’re ugly. And I envy the attractive population so much for it. Wanting to experience what it would be like to be with an attractive person and feeling love leads to viewing of pornography and the viewing of pornography leads to more envy and frustration (on top of all of the other bad things about pornography which is another problem I’m dealing with - health problems). Being reminded of my looks by seeing myself, by seeing someone with better looks or with generally normal or good looks and by seeing people who are intimate irates me so much the same way the other things I'll say do. I wish I could take out all the feelings of anger and envy and inferiority on something. Before, I even wanted to take those feelings out in some of the most heinous ways possible but I suppressed those feelings by remembering that doing something unfairly doesn't solve the unfairness I've been dealt.

I feel uncomfortable around attractive people. Part of it has to do with social anxiety I suppose, and also because I don’t have much experience socializing or getting to know an attractive person (since most don’t want anything to do with ugly people since often times, ugly looks devalue us in society and functions almost like class). I feel uncomfortable because I am seen as beneath them in general and feel beneath them as a result, on top of already being uncomfortable around them because of their good looks alone. When I feel this discomfort, I become irritable. The only solution is to get away from the person or situation. It could even be as small as riding the subway with some of these people. I also feel down and angry upon seeing them, knowing that I’ll never be good enough for them romantically or sometimes socially because of my looks (even though looks aren’t the only thing that define me). And of course I envy them too. For their looks, for the privileges that come with looks (there are so many of them as looks and the idea of sex really baits people. Self confidence, status, being treated nicer, luxury of love and relationships and using their looks to advance in life to acquire wealth, more status/popularity, etc.) and the fact that they have less worries and easier lives and the chance at finding love. I also feel hatred. I hate ones that use their looks to their advantage on purpose. I also hate ones that are really confident in their looks and kind of flaunt it or come off as conceited. It's like a mockery to me. Even seeing them smile sometimes feels like a mockery to me. It's rare that someone would actually mock me, but it just feels that way. Seeing these people is a trigger within itself. That gets me angry, on top of the hatred and sadness I have to deal with by looking the way I do and therefore not being good enough socially or romantically. I just hate the unfairness. It’s also frustrating not being able to change the way I look or how others see me. I hate being not good enough and inferior and uncomfortable and not being able to change my looks.

I feel uncomfortable around white people who I also find attractive. Part of it has to do with social anxiety I suppose, and also because I don’t have much experience socializing or getting to know a white person since I grew up in a low income neighborhood where white people don’t reside in, because I distance myself from white people infested areas because of this discomfort and because anything that’s geared towards white people (places, hobbies, groups) is likely geared towards wealthy people or white people since here in New York the two are nearly interchangeable since most whites are middle class or wealthy (it’s to the point where I don’t know much about my city because I’ve really sheltered myself because of this discomfort and can’t tell what from what in the city. There probably are some places that are meant for everyone, but I won’t find out anytime soon because of this cluelessness as a result of the discomfort and because of the discomfort) - both meaning the same thing to me as someone who grew up low income from immigrant parents (who don’t speak english) with little understanding about the white and professional world. Not all white people are the same of course, but it’s hard to truly understand that because of my lack of interaction with them. I feel uncomfortable because I am seen as beneath them in general because of the whole underlying white supremacy and class ties that runs the United States and feel beneath them as a result, on top of already being uncomfortable around them because of their color alone. Some of them look down on you by choice and/or look down on you because of the very same kind of conditioning that makes me feel beneath them. It would be fine and dandy and all if that was it, but on top of having to overcome these disadvantages, I also have to compete with these very people in order to earn freedom and successes, through education and job hunting, finding love etc. When I feel this discomfort, I become irritable. The only solution is to get away from the person or situation. It could even be as small as riding the subway with some of these people. And of course I envy them too. For privileges that come with their skin, general looks and the fact that they have less worries and easier lives and the chance at success. Many things are made by them and made for them. It’s often why in commercials, the families that are portrayed are middle class or wealthy ones that live in homes of great quality. It’s also frustrating not being able to change the way I look or how others see me. I hate being not good enough and inferior and uncomfortable and not being able to change my looks and upbringing. I envy both the privileges that these two kinds of people have and also envy the things that they don’t have to go through like the stress I have to go through dealing with and trying to navigate all of this as they get to just live life carefree. It’s worse when they’re ignorant to the problems of others and/or are conceited.
It’s a little more than just white people though. It more has to do with socioeconomic status and popularity/fame more than anything (since like I mentioned before, most white people are wealthy and as a result acquire status easier and faster here, so at this point it boils down to that, however). I feel uncomfortable around people of higher socioeconomic status and people who are talented (white people because of privileges that make their lives easier and therefore give them the time, money, resources, connections and mental health to perform and advance... not to say that other races cannot become talented... it's just that we have less privileges) or have higher status in general because of their popularity or looks and the privileges that they have as a result and therefore feeling like. Also people who have done and experienced a lot in life are people who I feel beneath and uncomfortable around. Intelligent people too. People who have accomplished a lot, both quantity and quality. People who are ambitious and have a lot to show for their goals, life and ambitions. Upon seeing or reading about someone who is incredibly accomplished, I feel bad about myself (one example, browsing someone’s linkedin account... I couldn’t even dream to measure up to that person even within two lifetimes. Privileged or not, I’m still behind.) I also feel pressured. I feel like I need to change who I am and try to be as ambitious and as accomplished as they are so that I can feel good enough and on par. It’s impossible to be on par with some people. I’m not good enough to be around those people and I also feel bad because I don’t measure up whenever I'm around them. People in powerful positions have the power to dictate your worth in society. Job employers dictate if you’re good enough for the job, rich white men created white supremacy, professionalism which describes how assimilated you’ve become to white culture in the sense that you speak formally/properly like a white person and earn their respect (since all the people who are employers/in power are white people because their governing and taking over - killing off the native americans, but let’s not go there) and beauty standards (which were created to benefit their women). Professionalism and white supremacy are two entities that are simply one in my eyes. Two societal barriers that make others look at me as inferior and not good enough and therefore make me feel inferior. I shouldn’t have to change who I am in order to be accepted by others, but it looks like there’s no other way out because the people in power dictate your worth and how you attain freedom. And there are some people of higher socioeconomic status that don’t see others as inferior or beneath or not good enough for them, yet I wouldn’t be able to tell at first glance of course because you can’t see someone’s true colors based on their looks alone. You would just have to find out by chance. So I’ll still feel beneath them initially, unless I am of equal socioeconomic status or develop value through some skills or talents or something weird. And then all that’s left are the things I can’t change like my skin color, my height and my facial features.

White people here in NYC are often attractive as well, so the discomfort is more - a direct correlation to how inferior I am to them. It’s because generally speaking white people and light skin is found to be attractive. It’s also because white people here and in general are wealthy and therefore have had access to healthier foods in their neighborhoods that they could afford, and likely have more time and more resources that aid in general life well being which reduces stress, likely are more fit because of the healthy foods and opportunities to play on sport teams etc. It also doesn’t help that white people are seen as the most attractive, so even if I did have a chance to find love, there’d be no point since white people are the most desired. I envy white men for being able to charm attractive women. Their facial structure could even be less attractive than mine, but their white skin is what saves them. Light skin is just attractive. Do you know how small I feel (especially as a man?)
Being Brown. Brown skinned men like myself are short and often times ugly. Our darker skin alone is not seen as attractive as light skin. Our facial structures are less attractive too. On average, we are on the shorter side, which makes us less manly and attractive. White men are seen as more attractive because of their light and I guess because of their socioeconomic status and because of white supremacy norms or in other words - because they pushed the idea that they were the best because they have it all and created it all - others consciously and/or subconsciously bought into it and are attracted to this power and associate it with those looks. After all, we are attracted to people who can provide. Also, negative stereotypes don’t help people of my color. We’re known for being short, weak, ugly, awkward, nerdy, smelly, unmanly and “nice guys” (not very assertive and submissive) and more things exclusive to the Indian or Middle Eastern nations’ cultures. Brown people are really unattractive. A lot of our facial features aren't attractive, but it also has to do with racial conditioning/white supremacy/racism that’s rooted in our subconsciousness that influence what we find attractive - by that I mean beauty standards being Eurocentric.

Being Short doesn’t bother me all that much. It sucks. It only sucks a lot when coupled with the others - being a poor, brown, ugly minority. I guess it does suck because it’s the main thing on top of being ugly that prevents me from having a chance with women. It also makes me feel small around people. Even the majority of women I feel are my height or taller, and the short ones don’t want short men anyways.
Growing up poor under immigrant parents and having less resources not only has led me to this mental health dilemma, but has also put me in a position where I have a hard time even trying to express how I’m feeling (bad verbal/written skills, also another insecurity - thing that makes me inferior and uncomfortable and also a thing that professionals and white people look down on)don’t know of terminology - like social justice stuff that aids in my expression, understanding and self development when it comes to this stuff. I’m tired of this. I’m also tired of having to see mental health doctors for my problems (other problems too) and also dislike being around doctors in general, police officers, people in authority in general and having mental health problems because I’m in a position where I’m beneath others.

I’ve always had an identity crisis growing up because of feeling inferior to different people and being around different kinds of people. I felt inferior to the strong and tough african americans and latinos in my low income neighborhood, so I wanted to talk and act like them to be accepted. I felt inferior to the tall and attractive white people, so I wanted to talk and act like them to be accepted. Now I don’t really know who I am, how people see me and who exactly I want to be or what things would make me feel on par with others/would make others see me as on par or what my personality would be or want to be seen as or whose opinions or views of me should matter.

This last part I just added recently. I feel kind of uncomfortable around or when I think about or read or hear about people who are kinda sexually forward or ""excessively promiscuous"" (wasn't allowed to use a certain word here) or when people are intimate with one another and I can see it or when I suspect that someone who I walk by in person who I feel could be an actress in adult films (unfortunately because of all of this stuff in general, I too have preconceived notions about people based on their appearances. I feel like in the society we live in, it’s impossible to bypass that because stereotypes and whatever are everywhere.) I know that doesn’t make sense because I’ve been watching adult material, but I guess that’s how I feel when I view it for what it is and not in an unconscious state for pleasure. The feeling is a strange one. I don’t think it’s anger. It might be envy, but at the same time it doesn’t feel that way. It’s almost like a feeling of - this is wrong (even though sex and stuff are normal. Could it be that I feel inferior to someone who is promiscuous?). I wish I knew how to explain it better. It does stack on top of the envy I have for those people envy though there’s a lot more than what meets the eye like how the industry treats them bad as well as the professional world.

This leads me with a lot of time, and it's very likely that I will set up my schedule such that I will live closer to New York and only be required to go to school twice a week for two MW or TTH classes. Thus, I'm thinking on what I should do?

I'm thinking about either getting an internship, going full time, or working freelance for the time being. I've applied to several internships with little luck, have no idea where to look for freelance opportunities, and don't really know if I should go ahead applying for full time just yet.

I'm a little bit scared about full-time, particularly because I need to make a several week long trip to Korea this summer (no idea yet as to when exactly)."

I just tried hard to get As so my parents wouldn’t yell at me, and I did.  4.0 unweighted 36 act captain of a sports team national merit national ap scholar.  All meant nothing to me.

I am a technical founder in a 2 person Delaware C-Corp which puts my co-founder having majority control. I had brought the company up from 0 kLoC to the 100 kLoC it is today. When we first had the equity talk in early October last year, we came to a napkin agreement with my co-founder to receive slightly lower equity compensation (35%) as a workaround for my timetable (I'm currently in my undergraduate studies in Singapore, my hometown, so that I can be eligible for a Visa upon graduation), with the exception on the condition if we get into a prestigious accelerator (YC) that I'd drop everything and spend every minute of every day on it.

Long story short, we didn't get into YC after the interview but we pushed on for the month after and received some, but not too much seed investment commitments. We filed incorporation paperwork in early December and I returned home early January. On filing the paperwork, my co-founder was concerned with how non-standard clauses could affect our ability to fund-raise so we decided to use boilerplate 4-year cliff, 1-year vest with double-trigger acceleration terms in our incorporation documents. I agreed but was blindsided (which I found out later) by a clause that superseded the napkin arrangement. What was also present was the existence of only one board seat and the promise of a board seat. However, I never got one, even today.

Since being back home, I have continuously pushed updates (had meetings and managed developers in New York) and worked on the business (wrote code weekly) while receiving no ($0) compensation for my work. As my team was in New York, I made sure to stay up late nights most of the time to guide my weaker developers through the problem they were having. To keep myself updated on what was going on in the business end of things, I always asked my co-founder if he could schedule a call. Keep in mind he never took the initiative, even as a CEO, to schedule something as trivial as an update. I began to get suspicious when he rejected almost all of my requests on the basis that he did not have the time.

As my developers were mostly interns and that we had a myriad of ongoing projects , I realized I had to scale up development operations. So what better way to do that than to hire out of my home-base in Southeast Asia where the technical talent was exceptional and not expensive on the level we could not afford, like in New York or Silicon Valley. In one of our rare phone calls, my co-founder agreed to the plan and I began conducting research into options.

I ran into a roadblock when trying to gain administrative access to some of our company's accounts like job portals, AWS (I was trying to create a well-structured IAM organization policy to protect our users). When asking for access, my co-founder kept saying no, until I convinced him that these things should be trivial, or all our users' key data would be vulnerable. Something I'm sure no one wants... right?

At the same time, fundraising had come to a standstill in the US so I decided to look for opportunities in this side of the world. I had successfully made inroads into both hiring and VCs and had used various \*@ourdomain.com to make them. I had not been receiving any emails on those that I created so I started investigating into what was happening. As it turns out, my co-founder had been routing all emails into his personal email and that's where I became a little paranoid - if he had been doing that to all emails, what had he been doing to mine? It was impossible to know for sure as he wasn't particularly honest. When poached for a shared email address where we could collect all emails, he was not only hesitant, but simply gave an unsupported excuse that some of the emails had to go directly to him. I eventually got him to set up one, but turns out he only routed some to it. I sent a message to him last night about this, after creating more email addresses but no access to retrieve them.

Today morning, I got locked out of all accounts. Even pictures with me on our Social Media and Instagram were completely deleted. He finally decided he wanted to call me, which he explained to me that I should ""just walk away"" and would follow up with more information.

I must admit, I chose my co-founder poorly and this is probably a horror story many founders never want to experience, I am freaking out and hopeful for good advice here. Was I wrong? Did I make a mistake? What can I do? Who do you think I should talk to in person about this?

While founder disagreements is the #1 reason startups fail, I am on the fence about any kind of ideas that will jeopardize my company because I have literally poured my heart, soul and sweat into this venture and I don't want to see it fail just yet. This is a tough question but, is there still anything I can do to regain majority shareholding?

Things I have considered so far:

* Just starting my own company here and rebuild the network and operations from scratch, I only have had a couple months of work to lose.
* Warn my users about the security problems that currently exist under the management team. This one's controversial I know, but it is really scary how my co-founder blatantly holds all of our users' private data and says they agreed to it, via the T&amp;Cs. I'd rather have my users safe than sorry. I mean after all, how can you trust someone after pulling stuff like what I mentioned?
* Lawyer up

Update:

1. Sent a warning email to investors (that I know of)
2. I whistleblowed on SEC's website, but I mean, not like they're gonna give two shits about a small time company.

Learning is plowing through utter garbage fluff there to make a thicc book to bundle with a dysfunction homework platform for $170. Would a professor think I'm crazy if I made an appearance at an Office Hours and asked for a list of things I need to know? Those are my stem subjects; essay based subjects are a different gig. Papers feel impossible to write without ridiculous amounts of research. I simply can't write anything of substance within the given constraints.


Makes me question why I'm here. The food is terrible. Doubt the certificate matters that much. It feels like it's an outdated social gateway. Am I a crazy person? If I failed to find a career I love, I would just fuck off into the woods. Spend your free time messing around with arduino in your loony smart home.... That sounds like a better time than the rat race. 


The company is good, makes me think it's worth it. College life seems to have made me realize how ridiculously good and useful developed interpersonal relations are, how much one stands to learn from them. Honestly kinda feels like my mind was taken out of a mirrored maze. That said, I am getting older and I lowkey barely went to class during high school. Rarely hung out with anyone... Maybe I'm just becoming properly socialized now.


Nevertheless, I can't get over the fact that I'm living in government housing getting fucked up all the time. Need my adhd medication to study, which is the exact same thing as someone needing meth to work minus the making money*. Then there's the booze, marijuana, ssri, and whatever is this week's special on Uptodate. Not to forget the communal breeze. This feels problematic but I don't know what to do. Is it just me?

**tl;dr:** thought uni is worth it because of the education. now feel like it is worth it

**explaining points that may cause confusion, not important unless you're curious:**

*: Lots of people seem to seem to disagree and although approved for adhd, desoxyn prescriptions are rare, they're near identical. A small change can mean a lot in chemistry but this isn't one of those instances. Meth's extra methyl group does impact PSA sorta like the difference between morphine and heroin. Adding those two two thicc acetyl groups to morphine intensify its subjective effects because it passes your blood brain barrier more easily but those have molecular masses that are approaching the limit but amphetamines are way below the threshold so they pass through pretty easily. Amphetamines mostly work through TAAR activation and messing with VMAT and an amphetamine molecule is better at that d-methamphetamine. I couldn't find any comparable data for VMAT. Meth has to first metabolize into good ol' amphetamine and that extra step to it's metabolism gets you better bang for your mole. Still, people barely tend to like meth more. I vaguely recall a study showing that they're indisguishable when directly compared by subjects but I'm not sure about as I've struggled to find that study again. With methamphetamine it appears you may be getting more serotonin rather than norepinephrine but effect on dopamine transporters is near identical. Word on the internet seems to suggest that common doses of meth are around 15 to 60mg and my prescription for amphetamine falls within that range too, although it's extended release. People often take meth because they need it to work and because it's more enjoyable to get through the day with it. I acknowledge that use and abuse are each nuanced concepts in their own respect but my behaviour would be greatly socially unacceptable if arbitrarily different; I have no restraint in sharing that I'm prescribed adhd meds but there would be devastating social repercussions if that was meth instead. Meth users and I seem to share a similar relationship to our respective amphetamine. The difference is that I come from the part of society in the right situation to procure the stamp to have insurance pay for mine and keep the cops off my back to make my daily drug use be socially acceptable. I can provide the study for any claim made that interests you. That said, I barely know what I'm talking about and would greatly appreciate someone who does correcting me, both the science and my rationale.


&amp;: I had time conflicts for most of my courses and I could go to either class. Once I realized attendance no one checks if I increasingly went to neither class.... Often just went to school two days a week for a class or two, often even missing those so much that became a problem. I missed quite a bit in sophomore year but junior and senior I was basically disconnected from my school, attending a couple hours every week when I had to. This wouldn't a big if I actually still had people around. I'm an only child and I hung out with my bestie maybe once or twice a month and other than that, parents, those sparse classes, and a work-from-home internship thing I did, rarely interacted with people offline."

I’m going to get it expunged by doing the alcohol education program (aep) as soon as possible. But my concern is if they run a background screen before my start date in June, could this still affect my employment? Will it even come up? How quickly do these things get expunged? (South Carolina)

I'm a [M.Sc](https://M.Sc). student in mechanical engineering with a specialization in industrial management. I've also done a [B.Sc](https://B.Sc). in Finance in parallel. Both universities are good, top 100 worldwide, top 10-15 EU, top 1/2 nationally. Grades are mostly ok, good enough for at least tier 2 management consulting.  
In addition to this I've held relevant internships and part-time jobs in strategy, banking and engineering since year 2. I've also spent two years after my bachelors with a tech startup doing project management and market analysis. Also got several good extracurriculars, e.g. board positions in student organizations.  


Thats my pros. My cons are that I've tried to do too much shit at the same time and got burned out and depressed. Averaged 4h sleep per night for &gt;1.5. years until my brain stopped working. I simply stopped caring about things which is still affecting me and has delayed my graduation. I was supposed to be done by this spring but I won't be. Things are steadily improving but it's taking a long time to get fully well.  


Last summer I had an internship for the country's largest retailer, as a supply chain planner. My performance was good, I think. I was on time every day, had one sick day (due to excessive pollen levels which caused asthma, fixed medicine in one day and wasn't bothered by it since). Met or exceeded every KPI. Fit in quite well with the department, but wasn't as talkative as I normally am due to the depression. Overall a good experience - relevant tasks, nice people and the payment was actually really high for an internship.  


At my last day I got only good feedback from my boss and she asked me if I would be available for part-time work if they had need of it. The latter didn't happen, but on the other hand they were rolling out a new system in september/october which would automate more tasks and decrease the labour needed. Hence why the part-time job didn't happen can be (1) due to them not wanting me, or (2) simply due to them not needing help since the system would long-term decrease the staff.  


I need to get a job this summer too and I'm thinking of getting in touch with my old boss, since that's the easiest solution.  


'm thinking of simply saying things as it is, i.e.  


""Hi X, hope you're well.   


I'd like to inquire about your needs this summer, bla bla  


I should also mention that I've postponed my thesis, due to x,y,z, (*what I said above, depression/burned out),* bla bla  


If you need to proceed with new talents that's understandable, and no hard feelings from my side.  


Best,

aub9k3,5,2019-02-24,Credit Rating Options,nadadenada123,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/aub9k3/credit_rating_options/,"Hey everyone, how is it going? I am a Financial Economics student and I  have a summer internship at one of the big three Credit Rating Agencies (Moody's , Fitch, and S&amp;P)  and they offer me to give my preferences out of the following options to be working in, which I cannot yet decide.   


**Corporates:** Basically rating debt of retail and normal companies. This is my least favourite option as I hear is quite mechanic and boring. Also 

&amp;#x200B;

**Structured Finance:** This involves some quant work in modelling cashflows for complex securitised products, like CDO's, ABS or C/RMBS. I think this is pretty interesting and challenging but I am a bit wary of how niche this is , and how value adding it might be for the future if I do not precisely go into Structured debt as a working carreer for the rest of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial Services:**  Here is just basically rating debt issued by financial institutions such as banks and insurers, as far as I know this is more interesting than corporates as well as challenging and at the same time keeps it pretty broad. 

&amp;#x200B;

**IPF/Sovereign: In this case you d be rating sovereign debt as well as international public finance debt.** To me this sounds quite interesting as S&amp;P gets a lot of  media attention for their sovereign coverage and the possible impact that these ratings have in whole countries economies. But I have one issues with this option: 

1- Also I think it might be niche and knowledge might be hard to transfer to other jobs/internships. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now maybe you guys could give me some advice? I am mostly concerned with how valuable would these different departments be in other areas? I know is only a summer internship so its not like its marking the whole of my future career but I still dwell between keeping it broad (financial services), maybe learning some more programming or modelling and how complex CDO's and that kinda stuff are rated (structured debt) or the sovereign or public debt which sounds like a very fun job to do? 

&amp;#x200B;

Out of those 3, Id say that in terms of interest Structured debt and Sovereign are battling the first position and Financial comes a bit behind, but I find them all extremely interesting so ""go for what u like the most"" answers wont help much.

aubjg8,2,2019-02-24,Help me find a fulfilling career,GeeseHonk,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/aubjg8/help_me_find_a_fulfilling_career/,"Hi all,

I’m a 24 year old, based in the UK. I'm currently working as a data analyst in a well-paying job that I don’t really enjoy. I feel as though this is due to the role being office based; I’m sat down all the time, there’s little variety in the work, and there’s no tangible sense of accomplishment. This paired with a long commute and not bonding with any of my co-workers has left me feeling uninspired.

I have a maths degree and have completed a 12-month internship doing operational research (data analysis) in the civil service, which I also found unfulfilling. I didn’t really think about my career when choosing a degree, I just ambled into studying maths. I guess this was down to me being good at it, and having been told that it would open a lot of doors for me in the future.

I’m struggling to see which of the open doors I’m excited about though. There’s plenty of office jobs, which I’ve ruled out due to the bland, static environment. I want to be on my feet and outside most of the time, working with different people and environments. 

Another option I’ve considered is teaching, having taught maths in a secondary school during my degree. This was okay, I enjoyed interacting with the kids, but I wasn’t passionate about it, and have been told terrible things about the work-life balance of being a teacher.

Ideally, my top requirements for a career (at the moment) are:

-	Solving problems.

-	Creating things with my hands, some desk work would be fine.

-	The ability to work for myself in the future.

-	Workload variety.

-	Environment variety.

I am currently thinking of learning a trade, as I think this would satisfy these requirements. However, I have no idea how to choose a specific trade, or how to approach returning to college (already completed my A-levels)/ starting an apprenticeship. 

I’ve also considered returning to University, to do a masters course in something that would help me transition to my ideal career. However, I’m struggling to find any postgraduate careers that satisfy my requirements.

Any advice would be great.

aubm9k,1,2019-02-24,Life advice. [Still trying to get into EE],Flysohigh7,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/aubm9k/life_advice_still_trying_to_get_into_ee/,"I was accepted into university for an undergraduate in electrical engineering. Unfortunately over the first 1-2 years of school my adviser somehow switched me to mechanical engineering before I could really get into the EE curriculum. (I did seriously consider a career in mechanical design + areas of research for maybe 6 months but ultimately I do not identify or have any desire to follow that path). The only related classes I have taken is mathematics, physics, a course on basic electronics and circuits, introductory computer science, and maybe controls.

I have some experience in electro-mechanical design (batteries), working with data, and after my undergraduate degree worked for about a year in the field of solar arrays, semiconductors, p-n junctions, basic electronics, and was writing software most days (in aerospace). I think I have used every bit of electronics/electrical related education I learned (what little of it), and don't have an interest in pursuing mechanical engineering. While it was interesting, at the time I did not envision remaining in the solar industry for the rest of my life.

During this time I was accepted into a 2-year EE masters program with full funding which I was pretty excited for.  But before I could start my program I had a severe medical problem that basically put my life on hold for a while. Ultimately, I had to drop out and will need to re-apply.

I'm essentially fine now, and am currently working in some test lab. It was the first job I could find at the time (without re-locating) and while it is to an extent open-ended, it is still very much in a 'mechanical' lab, which is a little depressing, (mostly environmental testing). I also didn't apply to very many places. My current role doesn't add anything really to my desired career goals or technical knowledge (but I could try to come up with more additional small projects and maybe incorporate some sort of software so I could probably make it work for the time being. We do own oscilloscopes, enough equipment to be an electronics lab, etc. but its not something we generally use on the job and I would have to make up projects kinda in downtime). It was offered that I switch to an EMC/EMI testing lab under the same company (but the only location that is hiring right now is in a state that sees more snow that I might be able to handle haha). Maybe another job opportunity will open if I wait a little bit. I wouldn't mind re-locating however, assuming I can afford it. There are other companies. I'm also trying to do a decent amount of self-study outside of work to catch up everything I missed out out in undergrad + work on EE projects. Virtually the only interaction I have right now with people in any sort of electrical field has been joining the local amateur radio club.

The shortest timeline I could have is re-applying to grad school this autumn. Assuming I get re-accepted at some point, I could apply for internships or other jobs after accepting  a program at least for the summer or spring or so before I start school. Some people have also said to find a company and work there for several years before grad school. I also don't intend on getting anything beyond a masters right now. It would also be exciting to take part in research but based on my experience or lack of experience we'll see what happens. I think in order to get accepted for research I'll need to move locations.

I'm not quite certain of what field I will want to pursue. Eventually I want to get out of test (at least based on my experience I like design). I thought I might be in PCB or board design. Or maybe in RF. There's also a lot of EE I haven't really discovered. For example, I haven't had very much exposure to signal processing, but I do have a natural liking of Fourier transforms. Maybe I'll go full software.

Basically, I don't think my current job is beneficial to my life goals or being prepared for grad school and beyond. I'm not sure what I should do right now or if I switch jobs where to even apply.

If you have any advice on how to prepare for a career in EE or to interact with more EE's or anything else I should be doing right now, let me know! (Also if you have any class materials, textbooks, or electronics blogs feel free to comment!!)

Hello world,

I graduated last spring and have had a hard time getting an engineering job. I have had one interview so far for an internship position, but unfortunately have not had a success full time. I know had I have done everything I should have to get a job, but I can't cry over spilled milk. A couple of things

1. I graduated with a low GPA (2.7)
2. I never obtained any internship experience while in college
3. I have a very good senior design, which gave me a background in designing a manufacturing process from start to finish. I got ample experience in cost analysis and equipment selection. This is what has given me the motivation to step into project engineering.

Those things have placed me incredibly behind. I have moved across the country to a new state to hopefully start a new life, but have had to take a restaurant job to make ends meet while I still search. I want to get into project engineering, but I need help.

\- Should I go ahead and get my Chemical FE exam done. I want to do project, but didn't know if I really should be focused on getting the eventual PE.

\- Should I look into getting more certifications (Six Sigma, etc.)

I am just lost and need help. Any advice particular to my situation would be greatly appreciated."

For context: I go to a really great public school with a lot of great resources, am a freshman currently majoring in economics and mathematics, hope to get my PhD. in math or econ, did really well in high school doing a lot of stuff (you'll see in a moment that this is not, in fact, a shameless attempt at humblebragging), and generally feel like my future success is in my own hands (which leads me to my problem). 

My current situation: This was somewhat of a necessarily self-inflicted crisis; recently, I had an advising appointment with a math advisor that is, frankly, one of the most brilliant people I've ever met--went to Princeton for his math Ph.D., is renowned in the mathematics community, the whole nine yards. He taught and teaches my current two-semester sequence, and I thought he'd be a really great resource for grad school in the future with both (possibly) letter of recs and advice, so I requested to meet with him to talk about future coursework and whatnot.
My biggest takeaway, however, had nothing to do with classes. I had a pretty mediocre first semester; it was the type of semester your mom is really proud of you for (mine was, at least), but you know that you should've done better. I got a B+ in my math class (which, I should say, wasn't an easy class at all, but I still got a B+). I got another B+ and two As in other throwaway, grad-requirement classes, so finished the semester with like a 3.6. Not bad, but not good either. However, my prof/advisor basically told me that if I kept getting grades like this, there was no way I'd get into a top program; this was a fact of how competitive the programs were. This felt like a punch in the gut. I never got anything lower than an A in high school, so it was hard to hear that I wasn't doing well enough to meet my own admittedly-lofty expectations. No longer could I expect to do well in school while over-extending myself into every relevant pre-professional/leadership group (which I am in just in case if I end up going into the workforce after all).

Since then, I've been extremely reclusive; I'd consider myself a very social person, and I've pretty literally spent every weekend doing homework and studying all day, watching a few episodes of Game of Thrones, and then going to bed. I feel like I'm stretching myself way too thin, and this on top of the fact that I need near-perfect grades from here on out on top of research and internships.

I don't know what to do. Midterms are this week and next and I can feel my stress welling up inside of me like a balloon. I don't know if I should give up on going to grad school for my sanity or if I should pull out of all my groups for my sanity or drop out of school for my sanity. I just feel like if everything ends up not going my way I'll end up regretting the course I went down, regardless of whether or not I put in my best effort. I'm just tired of being so hellbent on success or caring what some admissions department thinks of me or needing to worry about the next three years of my life during my freshman year while all of my friends go out and have fun. 

I just feel overwhelmed by it all, and I figured someone in here would relate and be able to give some words of wisdom. I'd rather someone be completely honest than tell me just what they think I want to hear. 

TLDR: Grades need to get better to go to good grad school, already overextending myself, destroying my social life in favor of my resume and GPA, want some nuggets of advice, honesty is appreciated."
aufhgw,10,2019-02-24,"I feel behind my peers in terms of my skills and experiences, what can I do to compensate?",VisualCicada,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/aufhgw/i_feel_behind_my_peers_in_terms_of_my_skills_and/,"I’m a second semester sophomore at a target school (Cornell). I have never been overly interested in finance because the entire “prestigious/pretentious” and “business bros” atmosphere really turns me off, but now I realize I shouldn’t be pushed away from a job I am interested in due to a minority of students.

With that said, I’m an economics major with a ~3.9 cumulative, although last semester I think I had around a 3.4. The only job experience I have is working for a small political campaign in 2016 but don’t have much to say about it.

I applied to roughly 5 investment/business/consulting clubs and while I made it through some interviews, I never placed in any of them besides one, now defunct, investment club. Sophomore summer I’ve been enrolled already to study abroad throughout the summer, so by fall of my junior year I still will not have any finance experience.

Completed coursework: all economics except intermediate micro which I’m taking fall junior year, calculus 1/2, stats, general chem/physics

I intend on taking accounting/finance junior year but accounting is a prerequisite for finance, so I likely won’t take finance until spring junior year.

**These are the options I’ve formed in my head:**

-	Despite my lack of connections in clubs (and my friend group is not interested in finance), I’m still at a target with a decent GPA so I should be able to land SOMEWHERE.
-	Take the Bloomberg course, edx/coursera finance courses, and courses through Lynda.com (from Cornell). Also brush up on excel and master VBA while I’m at it
-	Pick up a minor in CS, info science (data science emphasis), or operations research and info engineering, all of which are currently foreign to me. I believe the engineering minor I just mentioned is connected to Cornell’s financial engineering masters program and places very well in hedge funds


**What I’m Unsure About**

The rave around here is Goldman Sachs for some reason, but I have yet to hear somebody legitimately enjoy the work. In my ideal world I’m working at a hedge fund but I’m also unaware of the many job opportunities, salaries, and competitive nature of each position. I looked at WSO but they want me to subscribe to see employment reports, which I’m currently not looking for.

TLDR: Decent GPA at a target but lacking experience or clubs. Looking for resume stuffers since sophomore summer I’m studying abroad. Also interested in the different types of firms and work and how each of them differ technologically. I’m fairly decent in Excel which I believe is enough for IB but at  be more interested in a hedge fund. Main focus is using my time most efficiently to get a junior summer internship without any current work experience

I chose the major because I was interested in policy making and thought that it would be a good degree to chose if I wanted to \*\*\*help people\*\*\*. I had experience working in government at the federal and local levels, and as an intern at a consulting firm, but I was naive. I understand now that one is much more likely to create effective policy if they spend years establishing themselves in a specialized field. Regardless, I no longer think a career in public service is right for me. My focus has changed.

My question now is, do I grit my teeth and spend the next year and 2/3's (quarter system) finishing up this degree and getting out? My GPA is... not suberb, due to some health issues last year that are superfluous to this post. If I did this I would probably try to work towards applying to a graduate program in a more desired field in a few years.

My other option is adding more time and perhaps getting a minor in a field of study that has some more hard skills and hoping that will move me towards more desirable positions. My university's business school is actually pretty acclaimed and I wish I had the forsight as a very green just-out-of high-schooler to understand the implications of my choices. I am interested in the Business Analytics major but I really do not have enough time left on my scholarship to pull a whole other major off at this point.

Short-term, I want to get hired. i see people on this subreddit with fantastic experience in valued STEM fields from presitigious schools who are having a hard time finding a job. I feel like I will be left behind.

Long-term, I really want to eventually enter a field where my salary allows me to live in a major metropolitan area in the US or Western Europe while working towards FIRE. Eventually I hope I have the opportunity to contribute to society in a meaningful way, but at this point I am just trying to survive, lol.

I have an apartment that I couldn’t afford without the job, bills to pay, and my paychecks are a huge help. I moved my whole life for this job, not understanding what a disaster it would be. 

Problem is, it’s a super terrible job. I won’t go into specifics- but it’s a mix of a customer service line, salesperson, project manager, and insurance broker. I am responsible for running a program that distributes insurance, generating new revenue (its a $3 million program), and responding to all customer requests by phone and email (20 phone calls a day, 60 emails a day). I am the only person working with the program, no intern or support staff. My direct supervisor is great, but the rest of the organization is unbelievably toxic. I get no support from upper management- in fact, it often seems like they’re working against me. 

So when I try to focus on the revenue, the customer service side slips and I get in trouble. If I focus on the customer service, I don’t generate enough money, so I get in trouble. On top of that, I’m still facing the usual nonsense that you get when you work with customer service (rude people ALL THE TIME), so I’m under assault from all angles. I feel as though I’m not being set up to succeed- that if I succeed, it will be despite everything  I’m facing. 

I graduate in one year. I could move up my timeline and quit this job, but I don’t know that I should. I always thought that working would be tough, but I’m working 40 hours a week, and working on weeknights and weekends from home. I hate this job, but I kinda backed myself into it, and don’t know that I have too many other options. 

I partly needed to just type this out for my own thoughts, but I would appreciate any thoughts or advice anyone might have. "

So I've sent out a few internship applications (these are credit bearing internships) to some tech companies. All have rejected me but one, a big corporation, and I'm expecting an interview this week. Anyway, the more I think about this, the more I feel like I don't want an internship this early. I have my own few reasons.

My technical skills are still poor. I only know a bit basic on python, C/C++, basic robotics/electronics, and that's all. I'm not sure if performing poorly on my first internship will get me bad reputations for my future internships.

I kinda dislike the corporate culture, hearing from what my seniors have experienced. I've been looking out for some startups, and sent in a few applications, but they aren't interested in freshman and told me to reapply once I've got a few hard skills.

Also, there are a few projects in line for my in the university, which if I manage to complete, would earn me some big name: basically an R&amp;D/entrepreneurship project, and a multi-club collab robotics project. I'm not sure if those would be higher priority than an internship.

I'm new to all this and have little guidance, so I appreciate any input you guys have. Should I pursue an internship at this stage?"
aumn9k,1,2019-02-25,Careers for a simple life?,Malfetus,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/aumn9k/careers_for_a_simple_life/,"I graduated in December with my Bachelors in Computer Science.  I spent 2-3 months applying to development positions and ended up landing what I thought was my dream job as a designer at a video game studio working from home 100%. The pay was crap and the hours long, but what broke me essentially in the first week, was coding for 10-12 hours a day. I immediately recognized that coding isn't what I wanted to do as my primary work output; At the end of each day, I was completely broken despite nothing particularly bad happening at work. I was completely unable to separate work from home as I live in a tiny 1 bedroom.  I could barely speak and my girlfriend expressed concern.

Needless to say, I quit pretty quickly and had to confront some truths about myself:

1. Money isn't a priority for me. Doing the things I love to do and spending time with the ones I love takes priority.
2. In the past, I've been successful at jobs with some downtime. Either a hurry up and wait mentality or a checklist of things that need to be completed for the day. I need structure.
3. I don't mind the occasional 50-60 hour work week as long as it's not the norm.
4. I don't mind physical labor and have had success in jobs that get you out of the office and active.
5. I enjoy troubleshooting and researching problems that have pre-existing solutions. Part of the reason I don't enjoy coding is simply that I'm not creative; If a solution was in front of me, I could apply and understand it but if it required writing a new segment of code to solve a problem and I couldn't find reference material, I was basically screwed and would spend 9+ hours on a single fix whilst mentally decaying.

&amp;#x200B;

Anything and everything is on the table for me now. I obviously have a strong case for tech with a CS degree and internship at a networking company but I'm open to any suggestions. I'm not looking for a job I love, just a job that I don't hate and doesn't follow me home. I'm not looking for a job to be my primary source of fulfillment or to make an impact on the world.

As someone who went on my first job search back in 2012-2013, that seems kinda crazy to me. I had a totally irrelevant major (history), took one CS class, and had 2-3 decent projects on my portfolio using angular and python. I job-searched in NYC (probably one of the most competitive job markets in the country), and I had no issues in getting interviews back then. Of course, passing them was a lot harder, but simply getting a call back seemed pretty easy.

I also recall that back then, DevBootcamp (RIP), App Academy and Flatiron School had a pretty good track record in the NYC job market. Bootcamps seemed like an actual solution  and companies weren't afraid to take a look at them.

But seeing how students here with a CS degree can't even get internships, let alone full-time jobs, after 200 applications seems absurd.

So to hiring managers and recruiters who have been in the game for the past 5-8 years. Do you think the overall quality of the applicant pool has gone up? If so, why do you think so? If not, do you think it's just a case of selection bias of people on this sub?

I literally have no experience (except for practices doing back-end in php, actually was very fun and i learned a lot) and I just finished my studies and today I started my first real job at this.

&amp;#x200B;

My work will be web design... which I hate. I'm a programmer, not a designer. Tell me what you want me to do, do not just tell me ""make a cute website for this"". And I will not even be hired legally. But it's the only thing I found quickly that does not require moving from town, does not ask for experience and I even can work from home. I went this morning, they gave me a quick ""training"" and they gave me the keys of the repository of the company.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually I just needed to vent, I'm quite terrified because my father died recently and I'm going through a mild depression, I'm not at my best to move out of my small town and stop seeing my family or my house and almost all of my classmates already have good jobs in other cities (well, compared to this).

&amp;#x200B;

A few days after graduation, in January, a couple of companies came to give a work exhibition to our institute. And it was terrifying. These gentlemen come in suit to my small rural town (where only we learned basically java, php and a bit of web. this is not a university or something like that) talking about Japanese investors and their hundreds of employees and blah blah blah and... well.

You have to create code, eat code, shit code, live code. You have to be fucking Neo. ""You are as valuable as your github"" (which I do not even have). And that anyone who is not in the labor market and does not craft in github for a year is basically dead (I'm not going to lie, it's the only reason why I took this job, i would have preferred to wait at least a year and overcome this shit without pressure).

It looks like a fucking war.

Fuck, I like to program and all that, it's very funny, but I have hobbies that I like much more, like gaming, or books. I do not want to program in my free time. And it's not like I know how to do it, anyway. Should I write random programs and upload them? Is there a tutorial on how to become a Linux maintainer from scratch or something like that and invest two or three years of my life in creating portfolio points?

&amp;#x200B;

Here ends the ""context"".

&amp;#x200B;

I never worked with repositories, the companies in which I did the internships were small. I did my work in my local pc with wamp server and when I finished I gave them a zip with everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

My new company has the main server and I must connect by ssh and work there, but I do not know how. And in my scarce hours of training this morning nobody taught me anything of this. 

They gave me this line (plus the password) that I assume serves to connect me:

    ssh -1 myusername -p 370 domain.ofthecompany.iguess

I was thinking about using VS Code because the only thing I will do is html, some javascript and css (if depression does not make me kill myself, it will css). But I do not know how to connect with VS Code.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also open to any alternative for a better IDE. I have experience with PHPStorm and Android Studio, so I thought of WebStorm but it seemed like too much for what I'm apparently going to do.

I am sort of freaking out as my dream career just fell through and I am now unemployed. I am looking for some advice going forward as I search for a job. I am a law school graduate who originally intended to use my law degree to enter law enforcement. After graduating in May of 2018 and successfully completing a lengthy hiring process with the law enforcement agency I intended to work for, I was hired and started the academy. It was my dream job and I was finally set to start the career I had been working towards for roughly the last ten years. Unfortunately, I ended up sustaining an injury and discovering a medical issue that would render a career in law enforcement unfeasible (due to the physical demands and the likelihood of seriously injuring myself). In short, I need to find another career and I am concerned about a few things.

First, I would prefer to find a job that does not involve the actual practice of law/bar passage. I discovered during the course of law school that practicing law is not for me, as the experience I did obtain through internships made me realize I hate the actual job of being a lawyer. Frankly I would worry about my ability to competently represent and advise clients, as I feel like I am just not cut out for it despite maximum effort.

Second, I would like to use my JD (Juris Doctor) to my advantage but most JD preferred jobs that do not require bar-passage either require additional education or experience that I do not have. I am fortunate that I do not have any student loan debt (merit based scholarship, savings, and some family support allowed me to avoid this); however, I do not want to go back to school for more education as I am getting older and need to start making money to support my family.

Lastly, I am also a little concerned that if I apply to entry level jobs that do not directly relate to law or the practice of law, I will be seen as a flight risk or overqualified.

I do have about five years of experience in purchasing/production planning with a manufacturing company that I might be able to make use of. I also have a BA in Philosophy (not the most marketable degree).

So, I have two questions: 
(1) What kind of careers are out there for someone with my background?
(2) If those careers are outside the area of legal services/law, how do I tailor my resume and application to avoid being seen as either overqualified or someone who will leave to be an attorney one day?

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance reddit.

I got into UIUC's engineering college and UMD's honor college (ACES) but I can't decide where to go and it's starting to stress me out because both schools are great for their own reasons. Plus my family is split over where I should go which doesn't make the decision any easier.

**pros for UIUC**

* UIUC is technically ranked higher than UMD in most articles for computer science
* a lot of people say that it's easier to get a internship or job out of UIUC.
* the average starting salary for a graduate is $96k which I'm ngl, is very appealing.

**pros for umd**

* UMD is my state college so it is significantly cheaper ($25k vs $48k a year) and with no chance of financial aid but being in that sweet spot of middle class where paying for college is hell, money is a factor
* it's closer to home. If I do end up going to UIUC, there is a much bigger chance that I'll move out of Maryland for a few years after I graduate from college to get a job and I won't see my family as often while I'm in college.
* UMD is still a pretty good school for computer science

tl;dr I'm deciding between umd and uiuc for comp sci.

aurzmf,1,2019-02-25,Fees added after I signed Notice To Vacate. That can't be legal,FizzlePickles,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aurzmf/fees_added_after_i_signed_notice_to_vacate_that/,"Hi everyone! Long story, TLDR on the bottom.

There's these 2 guys who decided to rent this apartment in a complex. During their stay, The apartment complex changed owners and raised prices, but they were able to renew their old lease with their original rent amount in tack. One of the guys needed to leave and I decided to sublease the rest of his term. I ended up signing a new lease with the current management with some addendums to bring the price down to what the other guy was paying for the rest of the term. A few months later, I needed to leave as well (were all college students. I found an internship. He left for the same thing) and so I was planning on subleasing to get out too. However, The property changed hands again and a new management team replaced the old one due to mismanagement. When I notified the new managers I needed out, they went digging for my lease to see what they can do. They only found the original lease of the two original guys and said they will call me tomorrow if they find my lease. Otherwise, they would let me off the hook cause they can't enforce something they don't have. They notified me the next day saying I can vacate as long as a sign a 30 day notice to vacate and pay what I owe up to that 30 day time. I guessed they couldn't find my lease. So I counted my blessings and agreed. They sent over the form, and I signed it and dated. Early termination fee was left blank. (I guess cause we don't have a lease outlining early termination). Management hasn't signed it as well.

8 weeks later, I've already left the place, and I recieve some mail from them. Its a bill saying I owe an early termination fee. The notes say the fee is equal to the rest of my rent if I stayed on. That's a 4 figure sum they are asking!! I'm not sure if the end date matches my original lease, (cause I don't have it) so I'm not sure if its accurate or not.

After the bill is the 30 day notice to vacate I signed. However, It is signed by managment on a date before I signed it. I believe the date they say they signed it is when they emailed me the form. But I was the first to sign. Second, early termination is now filled with the amount the bill lists. That can't be right.

I mean, I felt bad that they couldn't find my lease from before, so I felt fine paying the extra month and leaving the deposit with them. But now they are asking me to pay a 4 figure sum in the next 14 days, or else they are bringing it to collections.

Maybe they found the lease, Idk. I do have the 30 day notice to vacate before management signed and added that bull crap early termination fee with my signature on it first.

Any advice would greatly be appreciated.

***TLDR***

I was trying to get out of my year long lease early. During the time, The Apartment Complex changed owners and a new management team was installed. When I called to consider my options, they went looking for my lease but could not find it. We agreed  I can leave, as long as I give them a notice of intent to vacate and I pay up to my leave date. I signed the notice of intent to vacate they given me with early termination fee left blank and management's signature blank as well. 8 weeks later, I get a bill saying I owe them the early termination fee. With the bill is the intent to vacate I signed, but management signed their portion before I did and the early termination fee is filled with a 4 figure sum. I have the document before they added their stuff with my signature on it. I don't know if they ever find my lease.

I got into UIUC's engineering college and UMD's honor college (ACES) but I can't decide where to go and it's starting to stress me out because both schools are great for their own reasons. Plus my family is split over where I should go which doesn't make the decision any easier.

**pros for UIUC**

* UIUC is technically ranked higher than UMD in most articles for computer science
* a lot of people say that it's easier to get a internship or job out of UIUC.
* the average starting salary for a graduate is $96k which I'm ngl, is very appealing.

**pros for umd**

* UMD is my state college so it is significantly cheaper ($25k vs $48k a year) and with no chance of financial aid but being in that sweet spot of middle class where paying for college is hell, money is a factor
* it's closer to home. If I do end up going to UIUC, there is a much bigger chance that I'll move out of Maryland for a few years after I graduate from college to get a job and I won't see my family as often while I'm in college.
* UMD is still a pretty good school for computer science

tl;dr I'm deciding between umd and uiuc for comp sci.

I don't know. Any tips?"

I looked into DevOps because that seemed cool, but it seems like there's a million and one skills in that arena to catch-up on. Data engineering also seems cool.

They are asking me to list my employment history on a form and authorize a background check for these companies. This is a bit of an issue because I'm concerned they may run a background check on me before I have my final interview. This means I run the risk of losing my accepted job if the original company wonders why another big tech company is calling for a BG check on me. My dream company could also be tipped off that I'm scheduled to be starting at the original company in a month. I'm stuck on the best way to move forward, trying to decide between these options:

1. Turn down the interview, go with my original job, and try again for my dream company in a year or so
2. Move forward with the interview, list my original company, and risk losing jobs/standing with both companies
3. Move forward with the interview, but **don't** list my internship on the form. If they don't notice then I would be in good shape. However, they might ask why I didn't list it (since it's on my resume) in which case I have to come up with an excuse and it looks suspicious.
4. Be upfront and tell my dream company I've accepted an offer, admit I was withholding this info for the last month, and pray that they are okay with it. I could also risk being blacklisted from future interviews if this goes wrong.

I'm aware this is unprofessional behavior, and I never plan to do this again; it's only because I felt pressured into accepting a job I didn't feel was a good fit. Any advice you could give is greatly appreciated."

Early on, I realized I didn't have much in the way of interview skills, which I've honestly improved on by a lot. I now have gotten at least decent at answering their questions, except I can sometimes tense up during the interview. I also went into a bit of a depression early on, which even caused one interviewer to tell me that he didn't think I would particularly like this kind of work.

Im finishing up my masters in modeling &amp; simulation engineering, and was looking at completing a PhD. Thing is, its much more design focused I realized and I've slowly been losing my touch with actual programming. I know all the core concepts, and can understand the code I read of course, but my problem solving skills for getting more complex things done like 'writing an encryption system' or 'reprogram/contribute to this decade old code'  (both with missing or poor documentation) is a monumental task that I always feel behind my programming peers. (it takes them days and it can take me weeks minimum to complete the same tasks). I was thinking of redirecting my focus to software management roles, since while I may not be extremely talented at core programming, I believe I understand well enough and also am intensely familiar with the software development process (using a team). 

Would I be taking a career hit financially and in terms of climbing the ladder if i moved towards less programming myself and more of a design lead? Is that jump even possible if I cannot code nearly as well? (I can problem solve conceptually, but the actual implementation for tiny intricacies always get me, which I feel is an indicator I am doomed furthering my career). 

i have been reading a lot of comp sci books and practicing programming problems to hopefully alleviate this issue but having the instinct to know specific solutions to unforseen series of small programming problems is hard for me to train for. Stack overflow only helps so much when you're working with a non-public product. I know problem solving is important for a management position so if i cant do that, Im screwed I think (what if people cant find a solution and I cannot offer basic guidance?). 

If there is an alternative, Id like to know what job title it would be called. Until then, I feel like Im one of the few 'imposter syndrome' people who genuinely isnt good at their job. For the record, I only have about 4 years of work experience programming, but there are literal interns who show up and finish projects the day of. Everyone works at a much faster pace than me. "

auzcn9,48,2019-02-26,My housemate's boyfriend is basically living in our rented house and doesn't pay a penny.,Quinny31191,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/auzcn9/my_housemates_boyfriend_is_basically_living_in/,"So a bit of back story. 

Myself, my arsehole housemate (who we will call B) and two others live in a rented house in the UK. Recently B has got himself a boyf (Bf) and recently (roughly 6 months) Bf has basically been living in our house.

He is usually round 5 nights a week, sometimes staying a lot more than that, all the while having showers, cooking food, watching TV throughout the day (he doesn't have a job btw), charging his phone, playing games on his gaming laptop and just being an itch that doesn't really go away. 

To make matters worse, Bf is extremely intorverted and controlling over B. Before moving into the house together B was a shy, quiet and didn't really have much self worth. He wouldn't clean up after himself, would shower probably once or twice a week, didn't put his clothes in the washing machine, basically the epitomy of the stereotypical WoW player. 

After a year of basically being his parent we've got him out being social, given him confidence in himself and he basically sorted his life out. He started cleaning up after himself, showered more than once in a blue moon, started buying decent clothes (he had never owned a pair of jeans) and started to push himself. We were all dead proud of B and it felt fucking amazing that we turned him into a (almost) functioning member of society!


Then Bf arrived. 

It wasn't too bad in the beginning. The usual new relationship stuff happened and he started coming round to stay. Since all of us in the house have SO's we agreed that they can stay a couple of nights a week, any more they'd have to start contributing to the house. 

Anyways, Bf started staying round a lot more (3-4 nights a week) and we told B that we weren't happy with it. Firstly because its not really fair one us that he can bend the rules, and secondly because Bf's name isn't on ANY of the rental forms. 

B then started to regress back into his pre-house state. He's stopped showering, stopped washing his clothes, stopped cleaning his room (to the point where its stinking the whole fucking house out), never cleans up after himself e.g. the kitchen and he's basically locking himself in his room. 

This is where shit starts to hit the fan a bit. 

So at the start Bf had a paid internship, which due to circumstances which were out of his control fell through and he lost his job. This is pretty much where Bf started staying round 5 nights a week, usually coming on a Friday and staying right through to Tuesday/Wednesday night and going home. 

When Bf is round B turns into a completely different person. He's quite snappy, cheeky to us, never gives the full answer and LIES CONSTANTLY. He tries to cover up how much Bf is staying. He says that he's going home and they'll both leave the house. Around half an hour later B will return with Bf closely following behind him through the front door. 

They usually do this quite late on the night because they think we'll all be asleep. Only problem is that my bedroom is above the front door and you have to SLAM the door shut due to the frame being warped. Anyways they wake me up every time with the door being closed at like 1am and I can hear B and Bf giggling to eachother like school girls who've run away from school.

After this happening I confronted the pair of them and basically said that its unfair on us that Bf round all the time and doesn't contribute anything towards the house. They've agreed and said that Bf won't be around as much, but little to my amazement nothing has changed and he's even been round for two whole weeks without going to his parents house. 



This is where I need legal advice. 

Since Bf is technically living with us and isn't on the council tax, rental contract, utilities or registered as living here under the Housing Register, how illegal is this? Is there anything I can do to limit how often Bf stays over?

It doesn't help that every time we confront B and Bf about this, they say that they can't afford to pay the rent, but STILL PUSHES THE FUCKING BOUNDARIES on how much Bf stays. 

We're all students in the house so we're pretty poor as it is, but we've reached a point of just kicking them out by a majority simply because if they don't give a fuck about our rules then why should we give a fuck about him?

I'd also like to say that myself and the other two don't want to move house. We quite like where we are and want to stay put. 


Tl;dr housemate's boyfriend is round 5 nights a week, doesn't work, doesn't pay any bills and is super controlling over housemate. Refuses to leave or pay anything. Wat do?"

av27pa,0,2019-02-26,At Will Employment Internship,sawerchessread,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/av27pa/at_will_employment_internship/,"Hello,

I got a job offer for a position where I would work as an At-Will intern for a dev-ops internship. I really want to work at this company but I also want to wait and see if I will get a chance to do summer research at a university program.

A) If I accept the offer, then I get accepted to the University program, can I just quit ahead of time and notify my employers? Will there be legal/informal liabilities for this?

B) Does it make sense to give up a real world internship for summer research experience? I want to try to go for grad school and a Ph. D., but only if I can get the appropriate experience this summer. Otherwise, I'll likely enter industry. Is this a good idea?"

av2rdi,1,2019-02-26,Character development? (A win on my part),DestabilizedAnkles,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/av2rdi/character_development_a_win_on_my_part/,"Exactly a year ago I wouldn't have been able to go somewhere alone without feeling embarrassed and sad, or without begging someone to come along with me. Today, not only did I go to the same event I was too afraid to go alone a year ago, I'm also eating alone which was something I never imagined I could do 2 years back. 

And that's not the only thing, I've also managed to get research experience in my university this past year (by asking a professor I didn't know and then meeting with him) and I've gotten an internship which I'm in rn. All of those things I was too afraid to even apply for. 

It feels very liberating to be able to do things without fear. Fear of what? I'm not sure. All I know is that I'm working toward not being reactionary, and being more proactive with the things I want to do and say. 

I can't say I still don't feel inferior (in a sense) but forcing myself to accomplish things by reminding myself that others have done the exact same things before and will continue to do them (eating alone, speaking up in class, applying for things) and that there's no reason why I can't do the same things. Reminding myself of that helped tremendously, also surrounding myself with people who were in similar situations as me. 

I became friends with someone who was in my same department and had held off on doing things because they were too shy. We both decided it was time to change and did the exact same things, even if we weren't in the exact same internship or research team. 

A driving force toward wanting to change was the regret I felt for wasting so much time. I was in my fourth year of college and had nothing under my belt. If I was too afraid to SEND AN EMAIL for example I'd hit send and go to sleep. If I was too afraid to speak up I'd practice what I wanted to say and tell myself that the faster I did it the faster it'd be over. 

These methods were far from perfect. A lot of the times afterwards if feel so much embarrassment, whether it was because my voice sounded weird or because I didn't stand up for myself, or I just felt generally awkward. But these experiences, although painful in the moment, have made me a little bit more ok with putting myself out there. 

I didn't want to continue feeling hindered. 

Sorry if this isn't of too much help. For me, it really was like a switch that turned on, although after the initial desire to get better it took two years to actually reap the benefits. "
av2voz,0,2019-02-26,Accepting an Internship contingent upon learning a particular framework,praventz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/av2voz/accepting_an_internship_contingent_upon_learning/,"Hi everyone, so the title kind of explains my question. So I had my first internship interview and one of the questions they asked me is: if we gave you an offer tomorrow and told you, that you need learn a framework or technology before starting, how would you go about this? So I gave them a fairly honest answer because I have had a lot of success with watching online classes to learn a bit of Python and told them I would probably try to find an online course and follow along.

Maybe some of you know about this, but the framework was Microsoft .NET for Web Development and Web Applications. While I have never used this particular framework before I do have a decent knowledge of basic web designing from previous jobs and class work. With a decent background in web development is this an easy transition? The good part is the web project wouldn't span the entirety of the internship, towards the last month (of a four month internship) I would probably be doing something else, which would be debugging some low level software problems from clients. 

Any experts on the matter care to share how they learned this framework? Has anyone here ever been asked to learn something before they started and internship? "
av32ie,1,2019-02-26,Software Developer or President/CEO of a small bank.,SoftwareBanker,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/av32ie/software_developer_or_presidentceo_of_a_small_bank/,"Backstory: I've always wanted to become an engineer and own and work at my own Research and Development company. For that I've always known I'd need a large amount of funding. Recently though, the best track to do that was I would become a software developer, work to reach management and in around 5 years or so make 6 figures to fund real estate investment that would eventually be the largest amount of my income so that I could fund my own research.

Where I am at now: for the last year and a half I have worked as a teller at a small bank in my home town while I go to school in the evenings. I have done as much as I can to make myself as indispensable as possible. I have taken on as much other responsibility as I could and have done well. I oversee Cybersecurity and also work on introducing and implementing new technologies into the company, as well as being the best teller on the line. The CEO and head of the BoD have started mentoring me in hopes I would stay on here, although they know I have always planned on leaving.

The other day, the CEO pulled me into an office to make sure I knew what I would be doing if I stayed here rather than leave. He made it clear that in 10 years when he retired he would be expecting me to be the new president, and him and the previous CEO would groom me for the position. If I decided to stay he would promote me off the teller line and into a loan office within the next few months after a short training program. Provided I have a large loan portfolio, I could be making 6 figures rather quickly (3 years or so). I'd be starting at around 50k a year (negotiable) and they'd pay for my schooling. In 8-12 years I'd be president. Both CEOs current and previous are well off and successful real estate investors, who would be willing to mentor me in both banking and that area. If I take this opportunity, I would be retired a millionaire before 50 with a possible ownership stake in the company.

I am a very hard worker, i'm intelligent, and I am good in leadership positions. I don't doubt that I would do well if I did move on with my previous plan, but I fear I don't know enough about the industry to know if I'd be able to be better off working in it or staying. The CEO has made it clear that if I chose to try software development and come back that I haven't burned a bridge and the offer is open. So my best thought at the moment is to do an internship that I have planned for about 3 months before I get a job offer and then determine my future possibilities. I'm curious as to what some other, more educated in the fields opinions may be. Any advice is welcome (especially someone who knows something about the success of software developers, and project managers), thank you so much.

So after 3 days of feeling like a total imposter and nodding my head at countless things I didn’t understand, I finally went underway on a project! I had no idea how I was going to go about doing anything and was worried not knowing what’s expected of me. I guess none of that matters so far.

After about 2 weeks I kind of realized how quickly the brain absorbs everything. I started progressing very quickly through the project I was assigned to, but my mentor stopped giving any time towards me.

About 3 weeks in I’ve pretty much finished the project and showed it to my boss. He was extremely impressed, especially not knowing anything about my project so far, I think he was surprised to see I finished it. 

Now for the past month or so; have been me not wanting to bother anyone and stopping in my bosses office every day  (Mentor never has time) and getting asked to ads a feature or 2 which takes me 20 minutes and back to doing nothing 

Any advice for me? I am trying to not bother anyone, but at this point I need things to do to keep learning and I’m out of things. This place is offering a full time job if I’m a “Fit” but despite how polite everyone is, I just feel more annoying than anything else and am not sure if they’re even still considering me.

I have been trying to learn other things such as more about bash, linux, Full stack. The problem is that it doesn't seem like I have enough time for all the things that I need to do to catch up.  
When I apply to internships, established companies won't even give me a first interview and small startups say that I don't have enough experience. 

I know that a lot will tell me that I am only a sophomore and I have plenty of time, but that regardless, I am behind a lot of people and I don't want that to still be true.

So, here's the deal. I'm currently in school and about to graduate in May with an associates in network security. I, as well as 3 others have been hired on part time past the agreement of our internship. We have been here 4 months total. In this time we have had 1 senior tech quit, a helpdesk manager who was hired the same day as us get fired 2 weeks ago for creating a toxic work environment, and our last senior tech quit. We are currently looking at how to migrate our customers vsphere 5.5 to the cloud which requires us to be on 6.5 before we do that. We are leaning on google to figure this out because we are now the IT operations department.

Here’s my problem. We got put on a lot of projects but because I was the only one to stand up to the helpdesk manager, who bullshitted her way into the position, on many of her tyrannical demands, of which she had no comprehension of the complexities, I got given tasks like data entry of invoices, helping move desks and other heavy shit while the rest of my team were troubleshooting routers, switches, firewalls, servers, etc with the guiding hands of senior techs. I was put at a huge deficit as far as technical abilities and now the big honcho of the company( 16ish people total) has told me he doesn’t think I’m as technical as the others and wants me to focus on creating “operating procedures.” This includes change management documentation, statements of work, how procedures should be done with documentation, and “being the ticketing system master.” He has said my strengths lie in “operations” but every time he says that all I can hear is business management. I want to do IT. I want to get good at the fundamentals. When I signed up for this internship I wanted to learn about network engineering, sys admin stuffs, and network security protocols. I am the only one asked to do this. This conversation also involved him asking me to come in once a week to clean the building for $250. 

Well, as of today, one of the interns, who is now full time, got lit up by big honcho for a myriad of things like;

1. We don’t understand

2. We have no one we can ask about these things other than google

3. No one is explaining the processes to us; we have to get chewed out first

I am at the point where I am intentionally under reporting my time because of how long it takes me to do things so I don’t get accused of milking the timeclock ( we’re only supposed to be there 30 hrs a week). For example, I had to clone a drive the other day. I tried both veritas and clonezilla, both had issues with boot files missing. I tried all of the rebuild BCD, SFC, chkdsk options with zero results and before you ask why I didn’t just use a cloner, our big honcho doesn’t want us using that, because reasons. My next step was to create a disk image on the SSD and restore from that. Simple, right? No, because the image backup fails. I wasted almost 6 hours on this goofy task and have yet to learn anything. I will be reporting 7 hours that day instead of the actual 9 I worked. We have no one but google to ask questions to and now I’m essentially being pushed out of IT because I don’t know enough as a four month intern. I don’t know what to do. I’m essentially being told to make spreadsheets and word documents while steering away from the technical aspects. 

You guys have any advice?"

I'll start with my history. I am 20 years old, I have a 3.7 GPA currently with my 4th semester of college, a computer science major, and I have won multiple coding competitions at my college. I've also received a big scholarship and an important award in high school. I have only had one official Job before, which was working at a kids summer camp, but I very much disliked it because it was hard entertaining 30 kids alone all day with the resources I was given, so when the summer ended I did not reapply to work again. Other than that I have had no official jobs, but I do tech support for my neighbors and coworkers of family members as well as dogsitting.

&amp;#x200B;

Since about fall of my senior year in high school, 2016, I have applying to lots of places, mostly stores, department, grocery, etc. but since 2016 I've only had one response, which I got last week for a phone interview, but today I got a notice that I was rejected. The only job I had I got because of open interviews, and I think I only got the job because I applied there months before.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly have no idea if im doing something completely wrong, because when filling out resumes I really only put my personal information, work and education history, experience (if related), my resume with references, and any relevant skills. and I've called the various stores seeing if they have my application, which the manager happens to be out then. But I feel very demoralized because of the lack of responses and the one response I did get resulting in a failure. But I have no idea what I'm doing wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

To go off on a tangent I've asked for advice before on other websites and some older friends. And the most common suggestions I've gotten from both sources was to either look for a ""comfy job working at a front desk or something"", so I could do schoolwork when I was not busy, or to look for small businesses, but I haven't found too many in my area, and none of the ones I checked out weren't hiring the last time I checked. I've also looked for programming internships in my city but I haven't found any.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm honestly sick of being insulted by my family for not having a job.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for helping me and reading this, any advice would be welcome. If you need to ask any questions to help me out I will answer as long as it doesn't involve personal information"

I actually took a gap year after high school to just work in retail because I was unsure of what to pursue in college as it was a daunting experience. Throughout high school, I was severely depressed and after seeking help through a therapist, I gradually felt better. I always wanted to pursue something meaningful in college because it would motivate me more to finish my degree if I had enjoyed my studies. So, I registered to attend a state university to pursue psychology. Ideally, I'd like to become a therapist or even a psychologist.

The issue is that I'm not sure if I want to go to graduate school immediately after completion of my undergraduate degree. My parents don't pay for my schooling and I would hate to accumulate more debt without guarantee of a well-paying job or at least the prospects of one. Right now, I'm trying to obtain as many job experiences as possible. I've worked in retail in companies like Starbucks, Nordstrom, H &amp; M, and I'm currently working as an HR assistant/file clerk.

I've realized that entry level psych jobs or internships are really only offered to those in graduate school or already have a bachelors degree in psychology. But my dilemma resolves around my financial instability, especially after I graduate with my bachelors. If I'm able to obtain an entry level job with a bachelors in psych, it probably won't even be in the clinical psychology field and it most definitely won't be enough for me to pay back my student loans in a reasonable time. Therefore, I've been looking to minor in IT and even take certifications courses, to possibly work in the IT field while I apply for grad school for clinical psych. I'd enjoyed working with computers and even taking apart hardware ever since I was in middle school. Does anyone know if this is a viable plan or do most IT jobs require more than just certification courses and college courses?

Thankfully, it's not that big of a jump: it isn't like I'm about to graduate and realized I hate engineering. And a lot of what I've learned in my focus has been really, really cool! But now that I'm looking for jobs, I find myself increasingly frustrated. 

I'm trying to develop my skills with programming languages that are relevant to the fields I'm interested in, and work on some personal projects, but I can barely find the time. I'm constantly getting bogged down by academic assignments in Verilog and SPICE, and it's not even the sort of stuff I want to do. Most of it I probably wouldn't even put on my resume.

I also had a recruiter at an AAA studio get into contact with me, although ultimately I never even got a real interview. However, that's pretty much been it.

avf26b,1,2019-02-27,Do I need anger management?,lucialunacy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/avf26b/do_i_need_anger_management/,"Hi, Reddit. Before I start, let me say I know this isn't replacement for a professional diagnosis. I just want to see if I'm overreacting before I go through with getting help.

I don't know how to start this post because I never thought I would ever consider anger management. I mean, I love working with children, I have been working with people with disabilities for nearly a decade, and all of my career prospects involve helping people. I am not confrontational, I'm quiet around people I first meet but goofy around close friends, and I generally consider myself to be a go-getter regardless of hardships. Basically, I'm the last person one would expect to experience anger on an unmanageable level.

But I've noticed something...different within the past two years or so. If someone doesn't use their turn signal while driving, I go on a rant about how terrible and stupid drivers can be. If a customer service rep isn't over-the-top polite with me, I'll get angry internally and think mean things about them while I treat them with indifference. If someone in my house puts something of mine in the wrong place, I'll complain to myself how no one respects my belongings and I'll feel bitter about it for longer than necessary. 

When there is actual confrontation, my heart will begin to race like it's never raced before. It feels like it will burst out of my chest any minute. My body will start to feel unstable, as if I have this inconsolable energy coursing through me. A million nasty thoughts about the person or situation will flood my mind, and it takes every ounce of willpower I have to not snap because I don't know what I would do or say if I did. It gets to the point where I have to physically walk away from the situation to prevent myself from going over the edge. And it doesn't end there.

I'll often ruminate on the incident for much, much longer than anyone ever should. I'll drive home gripping the steering wheel, begrudgingly say hi to my parents, and will just flop in bed trying to calm myself down...only to neglect my responsibilities and *still* wake up feeling upset. It will get to the point where I'll hold a grudge against the person and treat him or her differently, while he or she is none the wiser. Stuff that happened days, week, months, even *years* ago will still bring about anger within me when I think about it, as if it was a fresh occurrence. I'll obsess over what I would say or do to that person if I was in that moment again, or how I would treat him or her the next time I see him or her to ""get even.""

Now, when I say ""confrontation"", it's usually when someone disagrees with me. They could be as nice or as mean as they want, and I'll feel the same way. Even today, I took off from my internship because I had a small disagreement with one of the workers yesterday, and I'm afraid I'll act on the anger I'm still feeling today, which could lead to me getting terminated from completing the internship. I can't stand how easily worked up I get over such meaningless, trivial events. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'll blow up the minute someone looks at me the wrong way, and I don't want to lead my life like that.

I don't know how I got here, and I don't even know how to fix it. It might not seem big to an outsider, but it's big enough to affect my ability to be relaxed and happy. I feel like I'm always on the edge of snapping or having a panic attack (I have a history of general anxiety disorder and panic disorder). Because I feel overwhelmed day in and day out, I'm always rushing through tasks like homework, eating, showering, etc., and I'll feel the rage bubbling up inside when something takes longer than usual. I'll get headaches or feel sick to my stomach when I'm upset, which is becoming a daily occurrence. I'll eat my feelings, which isn't good for my weight, and that makes me feel angry toward myself.

I feel like the only time I'm in control of myself is when I'm working with children or people with disabilities. Somehow, I have much more patience and forgiveness for them. I am overly grateful that's the case because neither of those populations deserve to be mistreated. But the minute I interact with someone that is an adult without a disability, I become irate internally if they so much as walk too closely to me. I'm afraid it's only a matter of time until I say something or do something hurtful and I'll regret it. 

I don't want it to come to that. I don't want to sabotage my internship, my schoolwork, my relationships, my career prospects, or anything else that's near and dear to me. In the moment, it will feel right to tear someone apart verbally or...even physically, as disgusted I am with myself to admit it; but I know for a fact I will regret it later, and I most assuredly never want to harm someone.  

Am I overreacting? Is this an actual issue, or am I just acting entitled? I have no idea what to do, but I definitely know I don't want to continue my life like this. "

I’ve been working at my school’s IT department for the past 2 years and have been lucky enough to get a ton of hands on experience including vSphere/vCenter infrastructure, vulnerability remediation, Microsoft server maintenance including AD, physical data center maintenance (working with fiber and pizza boxes), and some networking topology stuff. 

This summer I have an internship with a Big 4 firm doing government cybersecurity work. Not quite sure what my explicit role will be because the projects are determined pretty last minute.

My goals (subject to change as I learn more and generally become less naive) are currently to work towards management roles, and maybe DFIR. I don’t think I’m cut out for pen testing, and I love working on teams and managing projects.

This semester I have more free time on my hands and have been diving into IT/cyber career stuff and am wondering where to go next.

&amp;#x200B;

* I’m working on improving my personal website
* I’ve begun following industry thought leaders on Twitter and reading cyber news
* I’ll soon be publishing some neat personal tools on Github
* And I’ve been building up and hardening my home lab!

&amp;#x200B;

Now I’m asking:

* Should I seriously look into CompTIA Sec/Net+ or are those not worth it after having relevant experience and a good job?
* Should I start working towards any other certs?
* How seriously should I consider a masters? I would love to be done with school (slowest and most expensive way to learn), but if a masters would significantly help me, I’ll find a way
* And if a masters would be helpful, what type of masters? Should I just try to find the cheapest and fastest program I can to knock it out of the way and keep my experience growing, or should I take the time and put in the effort to try to go to a top school and deal with the loans?
* Or, is all this thinking too far ahead, and I should just stick with my home lab for now?"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm new to this community and honestly, I made this Reddit account to seek advice. Although I understand that people here are not therapists, I would still like to hear people's opinions on my situation right now. Hopefully I can sound coherent and not too self-centered! So let's begin, here is my situation right now:

&amp;#x200B;

PSA (after I've finished typing): Pretty long, random thoughts, not the most coherent, kinda brain falling apart, in need of advice, pls be prepared (also uses words ""love"" and ""enjoy"" a lot ugh I'm sorry)

&amp;#x200B;

**Who I am:**

I am a 21 year old Asian-American woman in my third year of college studying business with a marketing concentration. I grew up in an immigrant household, but my parents never pushed me to play piano or study STEM topics. I've learned at a young age STEM didn't really interest me, instead, I was interested in leadership, design, and anything that required organizing, planning, and creativity.

I thrived in high school. There were so many leadership opportunities that I wasn't afraid to take because I wanted to get into a good college, like most students, and prove to myself that I can balance school, extracurriculars, and a social life. I was pretty much working on schoolwork, a project, or building relationships with people every day for my high school career. I had a great community that supported me through leadership roles, and just made me feel so confident about who I was.

Fast forward to college, I didn't get into the school of my dreams, not even close. Although I got into a school that I would've liked to attend, I boiled the decision down to financial aid, and chose the school that gave me the most financial aid. I was hopeful as a first year, that I would find a community I could thrive in and continue to learn more about being a leader, but the school I chose, didn't seem to offer much of that at all.

There isn't anyone passionate about the same things I am, and the student engagement is so low. The student body seem to only care about athletics or social activism. Both are great communities on campus, but I personally don't fit in either.

I am a part of my school's Asian Pacific Islander club, but it's difficult to gage other Asian Americans on campus and I'm not sure why. A part of me thinks it's just because students at my school just *don't care* and I've slowly developed that mentality (unfortunately) because no one seems to be interested in anything, but also, what am I interested in?

If there was anything I learned in high school, it's that I **love** having responsibilities. I enjoy planning, leading teams, executing projects, and being so *passionate* about everything I do. I love working with people who ride the same wave and can create the same visions. But I have yet to meet anyone like that in college, let alone a community.

I want to attribute the fact that my lack of involvement is because of the school I attend and the lack of resources, but I always tell myself that it should be **me** who is in control of making my college experience the best that it can be. But it can be hard to think that when everyone around me seems to be thriving in their college environment, seizing new opportunities, networking with their peers, falling in love with what they do. And then I think... I'm just... *here.* Not knowing what to do, who I am, what I want. This really feels like a **quarter life crisis** where I seem to be questioning everything I'm doing or not doing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Challenges I'm Facing:**

***Finding an Internship***

\- The only work experience I've had is working seasonally as a sales associate at a retail store, which \*surprise\* I thoroughly enjoyed! I love meeting people and creating bonds with them, while helping them feel good about the products they're trying on or purchasing. I enjoy working with my coworkers and it feels so great to be able to solve a problem without having to as the manager every time. I consider myself quite and independent worker, but I like working in teams when it comes to bigger projects (delegating tasks, etc).

\- The latest leadership I've had was co-hosting a cultural event at my college. And currently serving as the Vice President for our Asian Pacific Islander Club (although I really should do more with that). I loved co-hosting the cultural event. It encompassed everything I wanted to do: planning, meeting people, delegating tasks, everything that I enjoy.

\- That's pretty much it. My summers consisted of working at the retail store, but I'm going onto my third year summer and this is suppose to be the **important one.** How I spend this summer seems to be what I should focus on post graduate, but here's the problem: **I can't find an internship**. And what I mean by this is, finding a reliable internship that is close to home and promising. My friend applied and got an internship through LinkedIn last year, but it was not what the description was, so she ended up quitting. I've applied to big shot companies like Nike, Adidas, and Expedia. Haven't heard anything back from Nike/Adidas (I'll take it as a no) and then flat out rejected from Expedia after like a day. **But I don't know what local/small companies are reliable and trustworthy** for me to apply to and get it.

\- Another challenge pertaining to internships is that I'm currently studying abroad right now and won't be back home til the end of June and school starts the beginning of September, so I really only have two months which most internships require at least three.

\- **Is it too late for me?** I've contemplated on directly emailing specific people at Nike or Adidas to be like ""Hey, I am a really hardworking person willing to learn about marketing from your company, please let me in I am willing to do anything"" (ok obviously not in a reeking of desperation, although I am, way but that's the jist).

\- I am well aware that compared to the other thousands of 20-25 yr old applicants, I am on the lower tier because I am not constantly involved in my community, nor do I have any direct marketing experience.

**My current options**:

1. Work at my seasonal summer retail job
2. Apply for internships ?? (BUT WHICH ONES)
3. Take the summer off and focus on creating/learning more about creative content

Let me explain the last option:

&amp;#x200B;

***What do I really LOVE to do?***

I really love social media. I find it so fascinating, how the web works and how much information you can learn from digital platforms. I am an avid Youtube user, and as an avid Youtube user, I've seen so many woman flourish from creating their own content, and that inspires me to create my own too. I only have like two videos up on Youtube, and I know off the bat, it's not a stable or promising career, especially now since most of the successful Youtubers started back in 2010. But I am so amazed at what people can build for themselves when they just take their time and do something creative. And I really want to do that. But I don't really know where to start, or if I should invest my time in it at all.

Along with the digital space, I love hearing people's stories through platforms like Jubilee Media, The Cut, etc. There's just something so artful about hearing other people's stories that make me want to go out and learn more, ask more about people and their stories.

That side of me a just kind of a creative mess. I love graphics, learning about people, creating, but don't know much about it at all. Which is why I'm wondering, ***is it too late for me to start?*** What about all those years... what was I working toward? I really don't know. **All I know it that, there is so many sides of the digital media world I want to explore, but I feel like I might be misallocating my time if it doesn't work out.** I really love the idea of creating something with my own heart and soul, and honestly, I don't mind failing but, ***am I ready to fail***. Or should I be asking ***Am I ready to succeed?***

I don't know. And I think that's what's halting me from being more progressive about my future because I don't know which direction I want to go, but at the same time, there are so many directions I want to go. I want to learn more about the digital space, create relationships with people, travel the world, but most importantly **build something myself and be proud of it.** And I don't know where to start.

&amp;#x200B;

**lol should I switch to STEM field?**

All my friends in STEM seem to have it ""easy"" for them. And by easy, I mean their path seems to be clear like step 1 step 2, etc. But I know they are working so hard to get from one step to the other, but it just seems like their futures will be more promising. Although going to school studying business right now isn't the hardest thing in the world (but not the hardest, I mean probably one of the easiest), it seems like we're just thrown into the dog eats dog world *without much direction* (unless you have connections). **Also, would it be too late to switch over?**

&amp;#x200B;

**Where do I even make connects? How do I network successfully?**

&amp;#x200B;

Pros about me: I work well with deadlines. Good at leading and organizing teams. So passionate about what I love. People person! Persistent, willing to learn. Take challenges heads on. Question WHY. Pretty considerate. Love looking at trends and finding patterns.

&amp;#x200B;

Wow. If you've actually made it this far, thank you for taking your time to read my thoughts. Honestly, I don't think this was that coherent at all. I just needed somewhere to type all my thoughts down and possibly get some opinions on my overdramatic self. But bottom line is, **I'm just scared of where I'm going with my life because I don't have a solid plan.** Also don't want to just ""peak"" in high school.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice or suggestions would help, or if you don't have much to say, thank you for reading! Hope you guys have a wonderful day :)"

I just wanted to get a second opinion in what MAY be happening. Here's a quick run down of what's going on.

I majored in GIS,  about 5 years of experience, however I have acquired many transferrable skills, SQL, Python, Etc...

Anyways, I applied to a company that specifically works with wind turbines. The ad asked for someone with 1 year of SQL experience, data analysis, etc. So I applied. Phone screenings, interview everything felt good and I thought it went well. I went in for an interview on Friday, and the very next Business day, Monday, I see an ad calling out Wind &amp; GIS intern.

Clearly, I must have influenced them to post this because during the interview I had to explain what GIS was and how it relates to the position that I applied for.

Anywho, I am still waiting to hear if they want to hire me. Do you think they just want to get an summer intern in and just do what I can do for much much cheaper?

What do ya'll think?"

I want to rescind the offer of A and work for B instead. Here are a couple of questions that I want to listen to your opinions 

1. Should I notify A my decision as soon as possible? I am thinking so because the earlier I notify them, the more time they will have to find a new candidate to fill the spot

2. Should I notify A my decision via phone or email? I hear some people saying that reneging offer via email is a ""coward"" action, but I am not sure which is the best way to earn their forgiveness.

3. In worst case, if they snitch my actions to my university, is it likely that my university will punish me for reneging an accepted offer?

4. A' offer letter states that my employment relationship with A is completely ""at will"". Should I assume that at least from legal aspect there will be no trouble for me to renege the offer of A?


Edited 02/28/2019: after reading comments in this post and also search for the same topic in cscareerquestions, I have decided to renege the offer and do the best for my career development plan (Yes, I am a ""coward"" in that sense). Can you guys share any good idea on how to politely and professionally notify company A about my decision?

avj5fa,2,2019-02-27,(Hopefully) Short story about loneliness,Noire_balhaar,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/avj5fa/hopefully_short_story_about_loneliness/,"I got diagnosed last April. I am now 25 years old.

I am currently studying to become a teacher and I am living with my mom. Here's the stuff that makes me feel so lonely.

1. My mother thinks ADHD is a joke. She is a teacher too and complain about ""every child has something these days, in my days bla bla""
2. I lived in a psychiatric hospital when I was 16/17 but they thought I had borderline and I am angry they couldn't come up with something as ""simple"" as ADHD.
3. People say I should accept and make peace with my past but that's easy to say when YOU have self esteem and didn't get misdiagnosed, bullied, beaten and raped in your early adolescence.
4. The only place I feel truly accepted is at the school I currently work. They accept my ADHD, help me, make sure I can function and try to understand what is going on in my head. They are absolutely great.

The thing is. I am still a student. It is possible to do my last internship, next year, at the same school, and I even know that it is possible but I am too afraid to ask. It makes me sick to my stomach to even think about finding a new school when it is the first time I ever felt at home somewhere. So the fact that that is the only place I don't feel lost, makes me feel even more lost.

I don't have the courage to talk about it with someone. They already think I talk too much and my mother just wants to watch TV when she comes home. I feel really lost.

TL;DR: I feel lonely because I can't talk about what bothers me. I feel accepted at my job/internship but I am too scared to ask if I can stay.

avjbd2,25,2019-02-27,2019 Moderator Applications,Gaston44,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/avjbd2/2019_moderator_applications/,"Hey everyone,

After talking to the mods, we decided that it's time for us to on-board some new moderators. Our sub just hit 50,000 subscribers, something that I'm really proud of. That makes us the second largest forum for financial careers, behind the legendary/infamous WallStreetOasis (where I went myself for advice on my internship and first job back in the day). Being integrated into Reddit, I think we have the potential to reach a heck of a lot more people, and would love to see another digit tacked on to our sub count in the next couple years. 

That being said, this place could use a refresh. There are two areas we can improve on: our design, and our content. 

**Design**

While a subreddit devoted to helping people with their finance job search should be clean and intuitive, I think we can improve our CSS and overall theme. To this effect, we are looking to onboard 1-2 moderators that have experience with Reddit stylesheets, and with flair. I'd like to create a user flair system such that people can tag themselves by their years of experience, and their industry. I'd also like post flair, so that readers can easily find the content they're looking for, and can click to filter for relevancy. Lastly but definitely not least, we can expand the sidebar and provide links to help people find what they're looking for without necessarily having to post. For this role, coding and design skills are required. Ideally you would have experience doing this for another subreddit as well, and work to show for it. 

**Content**

We are also looking for 2-3 content moderators that would fill a number of roles. One important function would be to remove spam and irrelevant content from the subreddit. Being devoted to financial careers, we get a ton of bot spam promoting ad-filled ""research"" sites, and paywalled content. With the sheer amount of posts we get every day, it's important that only actual discussions appear on our front page. We also get trolls, which seems to be a universal constant. Your duties here will thus include monitoring the moderation, reports, and spam queues, and removing posts/banning users as necessary. 

We also need to have more stickied posts and AMAs. I was thinking we could have a biweekly or monthly role highlight, where a different career within Finance is showcased. These posts would have a synopsis on the role, duties, relevant skills, and things like exit opps. I'd also like AMAs where finance professionals can answer questions from our readers and provide advice. For this role, we'd like to see some finance experience, and ideas on how content on /r/financialcareers can be enhanced. A good fit would be if you've used this subreddit yourself to get/provide advice, and have thought of ways this place could be made better.  

----

In the comments below, **(PLEASE DO NOT PM ME/SEND A MODMAIL)** tell us about why you'd be a good fit for either the design mod or content mod position. Any previous experience is obviously a plus, and for content mods, financial acumen would help. Let us know what ideas you have for the sub, and how you would efficiently implement them. I will leave applications open until all the positions are filled, or until sufficient time has passed. Contest mode is enabled to obfuscate upvotes and prevent favoritism. 

Benefits of being a mod:

* Moderator and overseer for one of the largest financial career forums
* Unique and differentiated experience that could benefit your resume or impress an interviewer
* a cool lil moneybag by your name

avjmpj,4,2019-02-27,Company keeps asking for more time to evaluate my application. Is this normal?,AshingtonDC,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/avjmpj/company_keeps_asking_for_more_time_to_evaluate_my/,"Nearly two months ago, the recruiter for this company (Big N) contacted me regarding an internship I applied for. I completed the phone screen, then did not hear back for a month. During this time, I of course interviewed for other positions. About three weeks ago, I reached out to follow-up with the company regarding my phone screen. They responded that I had moved to the technical interview round. I completed the technical interview 2 weeks ago. Around this time, I received an offer from another organization. I let Big N know that I had a pending offer deadline during my technical interview. I also emailed the recruiter to let her know as well. They assured me that I would get a decision by the deadline.

Last week, with the deadline approaching, I reached out to the recruiter as I had not heard back. She responded a few days later, apologizing for the delay and that she was busy. Understandable as it was a long weekend. She proceeded to let me know that they wanted to do one final behavioral interview AFTER my deadline. She said that she could reach out to try to get me a decision ASAP after my interview. Now, I really wanted this position, so I secured a deadline extension from the organization that I had the offer from. I completed that interview on Monday. Again, the interviewer told me that I would surely receive a decision by my deadline (today).

Recruiter called me today and let me know that the hiring managers (who I interviewed with) decided that they wanted to have a chance to interview with all the applicants before making a decision. They did not deny me, but rather, they wanted MORE time to evaluate me against the other applicants. Since today was my deadline, I had the choice to drop the other offer and continue or accept the offer and end the process.

I believe that I did really well during the interviews. The interviewers kept saying how technically qualified I was for the position and how my behavioral answers matched really well to the company culture. I never assumed that I was certain to get the position, but I felt that I had a very good chance. It was perfect project and location-wise. Since they were hiring for 3 positions and kept asserting how qualified I was, I felt that they could make a decision by today (they wanted to go to the end of this week).

I ended accepting the offer that I had as I would rather have an internship this summer than taking the chance of getting rejected. However, I am extremely disappointed by the way this company conducted the interview process. I feel like they totally didn't respect my time and I lost out on a great opportunity as a result. Is this common among Big Ns? "

I would just like to say that, I am not trying to humblebrag, sound rude or offend anyone in any capacity. None of my parents/family members are in the cs industry so it's hard to find an outlet, so I thought I would come here.

&amp;#x200B;

**About Me:**

So I'm a 19 yr old software developer and cs freshman at a top canadian cs school. And I'm not sure what I want to do next, I'm not even sure if school is right for me sometimes. I taught myself how to code when I was around 10/11 years old, and basically fell in love with it ever since, it was challenging at first since I didn't really have a mentor or anyone to go to. Over the years, I had learned a bunch of tech stacks, played around with robotics, competed in competitive programming competitions, etc.

Skip forward a few years and I'm a junior in high school, and I land my first tech internship at a large canadian tech company, Shopify. The internship went well, I worked on a distributed systems team and developed an internal HTTP bandwidth compression protocol that reduced round trip times, this caused Shopify to give me a return offer and I came back for a 2nd internship my senior year of highschool, at the end of that placement, I got a full time offer(Total Compensation was around $135,000 CAD), straight out of HS, that I turned down to go to university.

Now I'm a university freshman. Over the past few months I received software engineering internship offers at top US tech companies (Google, Microsoft &amp; Facebook). And I'll actually be interning at Microsoft this summer.

resume for additional context: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zk2C2qcaM8L5dlAHyRObFQBzQZZGEYBF/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zk2C2qcaM8L5dlAHyRObFQBzQZZGEYBF/view?usp=sharing)

**What I'm struggling with now:**

Which brings me to where I am now (almost done my first year at university). And I've been conflicted on what to do with my career next. Almost everyday I sit in a boring CS lecture, where I pay tuition to learn about things I already know, I don't feel like I'm learning. On the other hand I'm working on an iOS app/startup in my free time, that I think has a lot of potential, and my overall goal for it is to have Microsoft acquire it (part of the reason why I'm interning there).

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially I feel like I'm wasting my potential at school, and I learn more by interning at companies and working on my app/startup. And I'm conflicted, do I go through with school for another 3 years? or do I work on my app/startup look for success in it and leave school?"

Im in college which takes a lot of time and my current cs courses are starting to frustrate me because of spending the first two weeks of every course learning what a fucking variable is.

I also work at a job I despise and can't wait to leave. While at work I think about finally ""making it"" as a developer and never having to work in places like this again. But I get off work, have to do homework for some math class or something and then go to bed so i can go back to work. I go to work the next day and nothing has changed. I didn't make anything cool yesterday, i didn't learn a new concept, nothing changed. I applied to some internships knowing I probably wasn't qualified for, just dreaming that maybe someone will call me, but it never happens.

I know this is pretty much just a rant but idk what to do."

I have 5 days to accept this offer, but I still have other actual paid internship interviews with actual engineering companies coming up in 2 weeks. One of which is Google. All of these would start in the summer and now overlap with school

I may not get any of those positions, but if i accept my current offer, then I wouldn't be able to leave. If I decline this position and don't get any other offers then I'm left empty handed.

I had a series of jobs and interships, including an internship in DC, which according to most people should had let me pursue a job in politics or at least management at a company. That seems to false. Months after graduation, after my savings started to run out, I got a job at a call center. I am no longer at that company and they are in major legal trouble. Currently, I am facing the same problem that I faced after graduation coupled with my only experience outside of school is with a failing company that is massively hated. I'm currently working at a warehouse on night shift to make ends meet. 

Problem is that when I go on interviews, the number one question it seems that I am asked is that why I don't just go back to school? I have been against going back to school because I do not want to accure more debt. Not to mention, bills need to be paid. One interviewer mentioned that I am going under a reinvention. But I do not understand why a Masters Degree that I know I cannot afford is nessisary. I ran the idea by a trusted mentor and more schooling seems to be her advice as well. 

What no one seems to be able to tell me is why I should do this? I feel that if I have a legitimate reason then I may be able to justify taking on more debt. But as of now, jumping the bridge so to speak just because everyone else it telling me to does not seem viable.

I'm hoping that the community here may have some suggestions or reasons as to why I am being given this one answer."

Every single adult in my life constantly asks what I want to be when I grow up and I have never known the answer. Programming is literally the only thing I have ever liked or found interesting that could actually be a viable career path, and as I am a junior who should be applying to universities this fall, I figured why not try to major in computer science? My coding knowledge is pretty rudimentary lmao, I've taken Intro to Computer programming at my school where I got a tiny bit familiar with Java and Python, and now in my Engineering class we are programming robots using RobotC (I have no idea if that's widely recognized or not but my teacher told me it's a variation if C++). I would absolutely love to talk with someone and maybe interview about college and what being a CS major is like.

some questions I have are:

What level of math is required for this major? 

I'm currently in Calculus 1 AB this year and hoping to take Calculus 2 BC this year. Say that I go to a school that accepts these AP credits, what math classes will I have to take in college towards my major? if you are a CS student right now, what math classes are you taking?

What is an acceptable amount of background knowledge of CS going into college?

Like I said I haven't really done too much with programming, I'm not writing 100 lines of code every day, I've never built an app or anything like that. I'm a huge noob and my programming knowledge does not go very far. As a freshman, do you take intro classes, or are you just kind of thrown into it? is there some type of placement test? 

What school(s) did you go to?

Have you been placed in a co-op, internship, or any other type of work study program while you were a student?

are there any classes or programs I should take in high school to help me to prepare for this major?

avlv5v,44,2019-02-27,Late Night Radio DJ Gets An Interesting Song Request,muckenzie,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/avlv5v/late_night_radio_dj_gets_an_interesting_song/,"I’m a late night radio DJ. 

It might not sound like much but it’s the only thing i’ve got going on in my life right now. I’m a broke college student and the gig is just a semester internship to keep me busy. Obviously the job has its perks, there’s the endless supply of coffee when i’m in the station, not having to pay for music streaming services, and occasionally some hot chick thinks it’s interesting, but mostly it’s a time waster. 

What I really want is to be a film director, to show people the truth. I want to document the world through the eyes of the underprivileged, but until then, I sit and I play top 40 bubblegum pop for anyone in a 30 mile radius. 

It definitely isn’t bad though. My favorite is when I get scheduled for dead shift. It’s the time between when the evening DJ gets off and the morning one comes on. Essentially I babysit the station from 10pm to 6am. When you work dead shift no one ever calls, there’s no stupid games, no fake radio personalities, just you, the music, and the odd soul who happens to be listening. 

At least that’s normally what happens, but a couple nights ago was a whole different story. 

 I was playing some Ariana Grande song when the request line rung. At that point it was a little past 3am and to be honest the phone kind of startled me. I know some people think this time of night is unlucky, but I was never one to believe in the superstitious junk so I just shrugged it off and picked up the line. 

A girls voice floated through the receiver.
“Hello?” she giggled after she said it. 

“Uh hi, would you like to make a request?” 
I cradled the phone between my shoulder and ear as I rolled my chair towards the queue screen, getting ready to pull up whatever song she asked for. 

“Yeah I’d like-“ 

and that’s it, the line just went dead. 

I shrugged to myself in the studio and ended up just throwing on some random track. I figured if she wanted the song that badly she could call back. 

About fifteen minutes pass and the phone rings again. This time I answer quick. 

“Hello? You didn’t play my song.” 

Damn it, why couldn’t this girl let me enjoy my dead shift in peace? 

“Well... that’s because your end dropped the call before you could tell me what you wanted.”

I was trying to keep the annoyance from my voice but it was hard, i’d barely ever had one request call in a night let alone two! 

“Okaaaaay,” she drug out the vowel sound in her reply, it was kinda eerie. 

I shook off the heebie jeebies and got her track, queued it, and hung up. She asks for some weird bohemian looking song i’ve never heard of but hell, it’s almost 4am and I bet no one important is listening. 

The queue gets to her song and I hear the beginning notes waft through my headphones. It’s got some kind of weird chanting at the beginning, and suddenly the music strikes a chord my brain must not have liked because my heart starts to beat faster. 

and faster.

I’m getting spooked now and I jump up from my chair which accidentally pulled the headphones out of the aux. Now the room is filled with that weird chanting and the music is getting so loud. I’m panicking, nothing like this had ever happened to me during the dead shift before. The music is getting louder and louder, the walls are vibrating with the sound of the sickening chords. I open my mouth to yell for help but I hear nothing. Only the growl of the harsh, grating music.

I envision black smoke pouring from the speakers and enveloping me. I try so hard to get away from the smoke, I’m backed up into the corner of the studio trying to get away. But it snakes it’s way into my mouth and nose and it’s getting harder and harder to breathe. I can’t tell if the smoke is real or not but I find myself sliding down the wall curling up into the fetal position. I remember thinking, “this must be how I die.” The black smoke grips my lungs and I feel myself losing consciousness. 

I must have passed out because I wake up to pounding on the locked door. 

“Aidan, dude, what are you doing in there?” 

I look around quickly taking in the studio. No black fog, no crazy visions, no music. There’s morning sunlight streaming in through the windows and I can hear birds softly chirping in the oak trees outside.
The morning DJ, Teddy, is at the door. He must be coming in for his shift. I shakily rise to my feet and open the door for him.

“It’s alright man, I won’t tell.” he winks like he’s just told me the worlds best pick up line. 

I don’t really say anything, just nod and quickly leave the studio. As i’m walking home I try to recount the events of last night, but there’s obviously no logical explanation for this. 

It’s been three days since that happened and I haven’t slept since. I don’t know what to do anymore. Every time I close my eyes I hear that damned music. 

I’m a late night radio DJ, and I think I played a bad song.

avmzhd,1,2019-02-27,Growing up people always said “it gets better.” I’d like to know when that might be.,KittyxKult,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/avmzhd/growing_up_people_always_said_it_gets_better_id/,"Each time I start meds I get hopeful like maybe this is the one. Maybe this is the time I finally get to know what it feels like to want to live. Maybe once in 25 years I will get to know what happiness is. I am 25 and have no idea what those things feel like and I am looking at AT LEAST 25 more years of not knowing, if my smoking and drinking and eating and fucking catch up to me fast enough. I’m killing myself as passively as I can, so no one will notice, so when it finally happens I won’t have to deal with all the judgment and begging me to stay in a world that has no place for me. 

And each time, I’m reminded that I’m incurable, unsaveable, unlovable, and just plain tired. 

I’ve gotten past the “why me.” Why do I have to have bipolar? Why does life have to kick me while I’m down with a new crisis everyday. Why why why. I don’t care why anymore. All that matters is that it is and there is no way out. It doesn’t stop, it’s not going to get better, so I’d like to get off this ride now please. Living life is like being forced to sit through a movie you can’t fucking stand, on repeat, forever, while everyone else is telling you how awesome it is.  And even when everything is perfectly fine, and life is just going normally, it doesn’t go away. Because I don’t want any of it. The only thing keeping me alive is that I can’t leave my cats behind without someone to care for them. They’re the only good thing in this world. And most days in the back of my head there’s the thought that if I’d never gotten them, I would be free to kill myself without having to worry about them. That’s the pain of loving something more than you love life.  

People keep telling me to choose life but this isn’t a life. Waking up exhausted every morning to struggle through my internship and schoolwork, coming home unable to take care of the housework, some random bs sending me spiraling until I’m lying staring at the walls for hours before I finally fall asleep. Lather, rinse, repeat. I don’t have the energy to do anything I enjoy, or the money, or the time. I’m 25 and I’m on mental house arrest while everyone else my age is living their lives. 

And yet I’m expected to suffer through this hell, so my loved ones don’t have to miss me? My only reason for existing is so I don’t make the people I love have to mourn? How is that fair to me? To have to suffer everyday. Shouldn’t the people who love me understand? If I had cancer, if it was something they could SEE, there would be no blaming me for dying. No guilting me. I literally have to keep hoping for a terminal fucking illness so that I can die in peace. How fucked is that? I’ve heard of people who have a suicide attempt and they are glad they survived it years later - if I could go back in time I would have done a better job. All being saved got me was 8 more years of pain. It reminds me of those cheesy vacation T-shirt’s. “I survived my suicide attempt and all I got was this stupid life.” 

I’ve done the therapy. I’ve done the meds. I’ve read articles about what it takes to be happy and tried whatever they suggest. I’ve tried, I really have, over and over and over. People get it wrong when they think I’m suicidal because I hate myself. I don’t hate myself. I have compassion for myself and I don’t deserve to suffer anymore.  Nothing matters. There are billions of people on this earth, hell knows how many have existed before me and how many will exist after me; in 50 years max no one will remember who I am or who any of us are. And one day the planet will explode or melt or whatever it’s gonna do and that will be the end of that and none of it will ever matter. The universe will probably just spontaneously create another lifeform to fuck things up with war and inequality and disease and bullshit. 

And I don’t even care to be remembered. It’d be just fine with me if everyone could just Eternal Sunshine themselves and yeet my ass out of their brains like I never existed. I just want to go. I don’t belong here. I feel like an alien stranded here with no way home. 

I’m tired and no one will let me sleep. "
avn0l1,2,2019-02-27,Is it realistic to assume that I can get a job in tech without a CS/IS/IT degree?,BOM_true,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/avn0l1/is_it_realistic_to_assume_that_i_can_get_a_job_in/,"So I'm hoping to get advice from people in industry from this thread. Basically my situation is that I am a civil engineering major, and I have been doing research that involves web app development (Django based) and some informatics type work regarding hydrology. I've found throughout the last year and a half or so of doing research that I enjoy programming more than I think I would doing civil engineering design. 

As far as skills I feel like I am pretty good with Python, CSS, HTML, and Js with some experience with some libraries such as React. 

I managed to land an internship this summer in a web development position, working with their security team, so from what I understand handling permissions on different websites and working with OAuth and SAML flows and things like that. The problem is, I am graduating in April in civil engineering and there is not necessarily a guarantee of a full time job after the internship.

I have considered a few option, such as going to grad school in information systems or  data science or something like that. I am also considering working for Epic in Madison, but it kind of scares me that their codebase is built in MUMPS, which doesn't seem like it would lead to meaningful work experience if I wanted to switch to a different company. 

Based on experience in this thread, is it realistic for me to assume that I can get a good job after my internship without doing graduate school?"

I'm 22, I've had the one job after graduating with a degree in Information systems. Below is the section of my resume that includes the exp I got from the only I.T job i've ever had.



Effectively diagnosed a variety of I.T user issues - hardware, software, VPN, printer, etc

Documented any and all steps taken to troubleshoot/resolve issues

Developed experience working with Active Directory, networking infrastructures, and ticketing system 

Appointed to projects’ technician and managed all new user requests

Reviewed and updated documentation for all managed products, services, and resources

Frequently received excellent  customer service reviews





Sorry if the formatting was weird. Also, I was curious about how much of other experience should I leave on my resume? I was working as a sales associate for an internship (no technical IT exp) and worked as an RA in college for a couple years. should I just remove them entirely to make my resume only include the technical experience now since that's what I'm applying for?

avp4vq,4,2019-02-28,Financial Aid Refund Check Stolen,SooshiGrey,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/avp4vq/financial_aid_refund_check_stolen/,"I'm a college student in Milwaukee Wisconsin. My financial aid refund check (the leftover after tuition is paid) was stolen and cashed (amount is around 4k). I never received the check so I don't know when or where it was stolen from. The school and bank have been moving extremely slowly towards any resolution. Most of the money is from a student loan. I depend on this money to pay my bills, as I only work as a part time intern. I've expressed many times that I'm at risk of getting evicted if I miss a rent payment, which could potentially lead to me not being able to continue attending the school, or my internship. This is my last semester and I have a job offer contingent on graduation. Failing to finish this semester would be devastating.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Below are the details and the dates they happened. Legal questions are at the bottom of the post.

On 01/14/19 my fin aid refund check was allegedly mailed to me, but I never got it. I emailed the bursars office on 01/27 telling them I hadn't received my check and got no reply. I sent another email on 2/7 and told them I still haven't received it. The next day (2/8) they sent me an email telling me the check was cashed on 01/27, and they attached a picture of the check from the bank it was cashed at. I immediately called the school and told them the check was cashed fraudulently. They put me in contact with a guy I'll call poc, who has been my only contact since, and he told me he would contact me the following week to fill out some paperwork.

On 2/9 I filed a police report at my local PD.

On 2/13 poc left a voicemail saying he was going to email me the paperwork the next day. The next day comes, and no email. On Friday 2/15 I went into the bursar's office and talked to poc directly. He fumbled around and eventually printed the documents. The documents included the date they were sent to poc, which was 02/13. He had apparently been to busy to forward them to me. I filled them out and he told me he would send them to the bank so they could start their investigation. I asked numerous questions, which he kept telling me he didn't have answers for. I requested a contact at the bank. He called them and they told him he was to be my contact. So to get any information the process is: 1. email poc, 2. poc emails bank, 3. bank responds to poc, 4. poc responds to me. Considering it takes multiple days to forward some documents, this is a ridiculously slow method of getting any answers.

On 2/26 poc sent an email saying:

&gt;""Just wanted to give you a quick update and let you know that it sounds like \*schools bank\* has contacted (or will be shortly), \*bank where fraud occured\* regarding your check that was cashed in error.  I spoke with US Bank today, and said that I hope this can be resolved sooner vs. later.  As soon as I hear more, I will let you know.""

After reading this I was shocked. Poc has been telling me that there's been progress and things are moving, but now tells me they haven't even contacted the other bank yet. I notified the school over a month ago already

**Questions:**

1. Is the school or bank legally obligated to process this case in some time frame?
2. Am I entitled to any information about any progress towards resolution?
3. Is anyone legally obligated to pay me the money? Is there a possibility they might never send me the money? If so, am I obligated to pay back the loan?"

IU and UK both accepted me into their honors colleges, but Purdue did not.

Searching for Cover Letter tips here usually produce posts and discussions in two categories:

* Don't bother, no one likes/uses them.
* Tips for applying to big FANNG internships

What about applying to only startups at the mid. + senior level?  Right out the gate from `{{ genericStateSchool.name }}`, I only applied to enterprise with formal cover letters while wearing a suit and a tie.  Much easier to get hired at startups using hip tech; caused me to ditch the formalwear.  Are startups looking for casual tones in a cover letter along with casual dress?

More background: IC/consultant for the last several years.

Sample cover letter I've sent to single-word startups on AngelList and SO:

&gt;Hey there `{{ engineerInChargeOfHiringWithoutGettingPaidExtra.name }}`, I'm `{{ someSelfTaughEntitledDouchebag.name }}`.  
&gt;  
&gt;Currently a Backend &amp; DevOps Engineer ( occasional Frontend work too ) for multiple apps currently in production on AWS, GCP, DO and Azure.  
&gt;  
&gt;The `{{ jobSeniorEngineerLeftAfterPoliticalDisagreement.title }}` opening caught my attention because of how closely the requirements match my current experience with:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- JavaScript, Ruby, Python, GO and anything else I have experience with and see constantly on remoteok.io- Node.js, Rails, Django + Flask  
&gt;  
&gt;\- microservices  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Docker + K8s  
&gt;  
&gt;\- GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and maybe SVN if your CTO is over the age of 45  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Postgres, Redis, Mongo, databases...  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Pretty much just matching their job listing as close as possible ( if I can't do this, I don't apply )  
&gt;  
&gt;Sentence about how I actually read their culture doc.  Sentence about being able to work remotely ( if remote ) with underpaid devs. in Chicago and entitled devs. in Seattle or the Valley.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sentence about how my extensive backend exp. allows me to ""hit the ground running"" with new routes + features.  Sentence about how if they want someone who's serious about the job then we should Google™ Meet™ or Zoom®, ending with a ""let's chat!"" or ""let's talk!""

I write it from scratch ( using this as a template ) for each company that req. a cover letter or has a cover letter-like dialog box on their Lever site.  Is this too casual of a tone, even for super hip companies with hammocks instead of desks?  Do I sound too smuk?  I'm not God's gift to software ( or close ), just want to leave contracting and get a reliable salaried job."

I am taking a second intro to CS class at my local university and my professor is a useless douche canoe who spends most of his lectures talking about himself and laughing at his own jokes. At first, I thought I must be misunderstanding how bad his teaching was because I'm not very experienced yet and other students seemed to like him. However, after two months of being frustrated, I went on RateMyProfessor and found out this guy has DOZENS of bad reviews on there that seem to have gone completely ignored by the university. I even found videos of him online before he got tenure, and he used to do a lot more for his classes than he does now. Presently, when we are assigned a program to write, he just dumps the responsibility for helping us learn how to program for it on his TAs, who are all overwhelmed and have basically checked out rather than try to hold real labs where we talk about what we're supposed to be doing. Instead, they are glorified study halls where the TAs are regularly rude and snotty because they are stressed out by the sheer number of people who don't know what they are doing. When I asked my professor after class one day how to best study for our midterm, he couldn't even give me a straight answer. If his lectures weren't mostly about his bad jokes and the fact that he has written multiple books and traveled to other countries to teach computer science, maybe I would know what the fuck I am supposed to be learning. And it might help if he ever answered his email, or when I came to see him during office hours didn't go off on tangents about his plans for the department or how many students he taught who are now getting rich from their amazing jobs because of how well he taught them &gt;:(

&amp;#x200B;

 I have friends already working in the field and I have shown them class materials, my notes, etc. and everyone of them has been incredulous at what he isn't teaching me. So now I am scrambling to try and know what I don't know and learn it on my own, while also managing a HUGE workload from his class - which is another rant by itself . He adds these ""challenges"" to each assignment which he says aren't technically required but he refuses to give an A to you if you don't do them, and most people don't get As unless they write a ridiculous amount of code. I learned from a TA that one of the only people who got an A in our first week wrote over 1000 lines of code for a bubble sort. A bubble sort! We were supposed to just sort the integer elements in a small array, who the fuck needs 1000 lines of code for that?! And douche canoe actually has a section in his syllabus devoted to him waxing poetic about how he considers an A to be reserved for those who demonstrate ""true excellence"" and ""amazing skills"" and goes on to talk about how this, in his opinion, drives his students to be better programmers because he holds them to such a high standard. It makes me want to vomit; every word of this spiel is dripping with self-satisfaction. He clearly thinks very highly of himself and as I struggle every week to try and do the best I can on my programs, it makes me hate him. Plus, I am really worried I won't be able to do a good job when I get an internship or job. I love programming, but this class is making me dread it and I hate that. I just don't know what to do :( 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I am a CS student who has an awful professor and no recourse because my department is close-knit and he has tenure. "
avv1h6,1,2019-02-28,Former Manager May Be Potentially Withholding Pay,anonymousharassed,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/avv1h6/former_manager_may_be_potentially_withholding_pay/,"Idaho.

This may be a long post. I've done some research of my own but I would also like to get a few more opinions. Here's some backstory.

Two weeks ago today I was terminated from my job. I spoke to my boss about a week prior to this after he brought up some concerns with my attitude at work. He didn't feel as if I enjoyed my job, to which I assured him that when I work I have an intense look on my face that isn't reflective of how I'm feeling (a small case of resting dick face). We came to an understanding and I told him I would do better regarding body language, perceivable attitude, etc.

The day prior to my firing I was interviewing a potential intern. In the middle of the interview, my manager (also the business owner) interrupted my line of questioning to ask our candidate, ""So, did you use your job at \[redacted\] to prey on high school girls?"" He then proceeded to ask this candidate repeatedly, in a joking matter, if he used his position to prey on ""little girls"" and ""young girls"". He also made it clear that in the 60s and 70s he was ""quite the womanizer"" and partook in plenty of illicit activities, including getting drunk and other ""mind-altering"" substances available to him.

I had a massive problem with this as, by definition, this is considered sexual harassment (if I am incorrect in that please let me know) and I am not terribly interested in being part of a company whose owner willy nilly incurs a lawsuit for the sake of a joke. This was completely inappropriate to bring up to a candidate, but I kept my mouth shut until the end of my shift with the intention of mentioning my issue to him the following day, despite the candidate being visibly uncomfortable after our 30 minute interview became a 1.5 hour line of questioning about hypothetical pedophilia.

The next day went on perfectly fine and at the end of the workday he sat me down in our conference room with another employee, my subordinate, and asked how I felt the last week went since our talk about my attitude. I told him that I felt it went pretty well, but also mentioned that it might be in his best interest to avoid inappropriate lines of questioning with candidates as it sends an uncomfortable message. He then informed me that I was too thin skinned for his sense of humor, that he called the candidate who ""had no problem"" with what he said (a young college kid looking for a job is probably more interested in being hired than being honest, in my opinion), that he feels I have a problem with him, and I had just completed my last day of work. However, he mentioned that I would be paid for the full month of February as severance.

At this point I was kind of stunned but managed to be as respectful as possible, handed over my keys to the office, and bid farewell with a handshake and a thank you. 

Sometime over the next few days I received an email reiterating that I would be receiving a full month of pay, and also a thank you from him regarding my professional behavior on the day of my firing. He also said, ""I forgot to mention this last Friday but we are going to treat this as a resignation if that's ok with you"". 

I didn't reply to this email because I absolutely did not resign from my position, I was terminated, and I believe his intention is to avoid allowing me to file for unemployment. I planned to cross that bridge after I was paid, though.

Today is the day I was set to receive my final check, which before taxes would have been around $3300 for the month. What I found deposited in my account was a little under $800. This number doesn't add up whatsoever. Even if I were only paid for the hours actually worked this month I would be receiving something in the ballpark of $1800 before taxes. 

I sent an email reiterating his intention in the email he sent about the entire month's pay, as well as pointing out that I feel I was paid incorrectly and would like to see a copy of the paystub regarding today's payment. I am waiting for a response but I want to be prepared for what to do next.

I suppose I have a few questions regarding all of the above:

1) Is an email confirmation of intention to pay me for the full month a legally binding agreement by law?

2) Is he legally allowed to underpay me for hours worked for any reason?

3) What steps are recommended to insure that, at the very least, I am paid what I am owed?

4) At what point do I take this to the Department of Labor for my state?

I tried to keep this relatively vague and will probably delete it later, but any advice in the meantime is welcome.

Thank you!"

 I was just wondering about your opinions :)

I've applied to the following universities (not arranged in any order) and wanted to get your opinions on my chances at getting into any of them. I understand that an application goes beyond the following stats and it's difficult to identify whether an individual would get in purely based on the following data, but I would still appreciate your opinions. So I'm applying to;

Yale, Stanford, Columbia, Upenn, Brown, Carnegie Mellon, UCLA, UCSB, NYU, Purdue, Stony Brook (SUNY) and Bentley.

Stats:

International student but a US permanent resident/greencard holder.

Asian (Indian) from Kenya.

Undergrad major: actuarial science or data science (for those of you who don't know, it's related to math/econ/computer science)

GPA: N/A (We don't use GPA)

Rank: 1

IB Diploma student (Math, Economics, ITGS at Higher level and Physics, English and Swahili at Standard level); predicted: 43/45

SAT: 1st attempt - 1440 (790M, 650R, Essay - 15/24); 2nd attempt - 1460 (790M, 670R, Essay - 16/24); 3rd attempt - 1470 (780M, 690R, Essay - 16/24); Superscore - 1480 (790M, 690R, Essay - 16/24)

Honors: Kenya Math Olympiad (semifinalist), ACA world competition (2 time national champ), National university level math competition winner, completed the ICDL (International Computer Driving Licence), and School topper for Computer science and global perspectives (IGCSE) and IB diploma topper for 1st year.

ECs: 3 UNPAID internships (2 at actuarial science firms, 1 at a hospital), Helped build a latrine for a rural secondary school, Climbed a mountain with the blind, planted trees (with the president of Kenya), chess club president (1 or 2 years... not so sure), created 2 websites (one for IGCSE and one for IB), tutored young kids after school, participated in the East Africa Model UN, school's career committee website maintenance, and a Microsoft, web and graphic design specialist.

Recommendations: Pretty good.

So that's pretty much my application excluding the essays, which if you'd like to read and review them, you may PM me.

Oh, if you can, just let me know what unis, from the list above, are likely going to accept and/or reject me. BE HONEST!

Thanks."
avv5q4,2,2019-02-28,I have a choice of two jobs. What would be the best choice of actions here?,PenguinBond,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/avv5q4/i_have_a_choice_of_two_jobs_what_would_be_the/,"Hello. I am a 20 y/o college student and I have two employment opportunities presented to me. Neither are completely confirmed, but I feel both have a fairly high chance of me working for them because of a few following reasons:

The first job is with a company that provides temp hires to other companies while said companies look for someone to fill their positions. I study computer science, and she said she is not looking for someone that does IT, but a general engineering student. Despite what I study, she says I probably still fit the application nicely and would like to hear back from me. The pay does not really matter, but I do not know the pay of the other position so if it ends up being an unpaid internship then I do not really want to do it. This position would pay 15/hr and would be about 15-40 hours a week. I would start working as soon as I could.

The other position is a data analysis intern for an organ donation company, and it is over the summer of this year. I was referred to a position by a woman that works for the company, so I feel that since I know her it would really increase my chances of getting the position compared to other applicants. Particularly why I want to work for this position is because it is only over the summer and seems more specialized as well as relevant to my interests, and likely pays just as much if not more. It also has a consistent 35/hrs a week and that would be great since I would have no school going on.

In an ideal world, I want to work for the first company until the summer hits and then go work for the organ donation company and then come back to the other company. I want to inform the woman I am talking to who runs the first company that I would love to work for her, but am expecting work over the summer. What is the best course of action to take here?

Would it be wrong of me to work for the first company, and if I get the position of the 2nd one, to leave them by the time the summer comes around?"
avvbhf,109,2019-02-28,TIFU by introducing fake stops for bus routes,Bukeno,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/avvbhf/tifu_by_introducing_fake_stops_for_bus_routes/,"I never thought I would end up a TIFU victim but oh man... Life is just full of surprises.

&amp;nbsp;

A little background about my situation so this TIFU actually makes sense. I'm currently a co-op student, (if you don't know what a co-op student is, think internship), for my region's transit scheduling department and had no prior experience with working in this field. I was introduced to the program that they use to create bus stops, routes, and schedules and was given my own personal account, playground, tools to play around with. 


&amp;nbsp;

Since I obviously had no experience with this program either, I was pretty curious and played around with most of the functions and man... I should've been more careful. I was logged into my own account and using my own playground and decided I wanted to create my own route so that's what I did. I used a pre-existing route as a template thinking that since it was my own account and own playground, it would not affect the server's routes (and tbh I didn't know how to create a new route) and started adding bus stops left and right to see how the process was done. I was getting pretty far into creating my own route, even adding the run-time of the vehicles, how long each trip should be, etc. when my supervisor asks me, 

&amp;nbsp;

""Hey Bukeno, did you happen to put in any new stops in your playground by any chance?""

&amp;nbsp;

To which I reply, yes. 

&amp;nbsp;

My supervisor then proceeds to tell me that all the new stops and routes that I've created within my playground was visible to everyone's systems since it was a global database (something along these lines, can't quite remember the specific explanation). What this meant was that, the random stops I added were visible to the planning department, the customer service department, even exterior companies that utilizes my region's service such as Google, could see this random stops that were added and had no meaning behind them. 

&amp;nbsp;

Hopefully no one was too confused about the stops that just popped out of nowhere and I didn't cause any major problems.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR - Added new stops to bus routes for my region's transportation department that I thought only I could see, but instead everyone who had access to the servers and people who rely on our servers could see.

Im a cs major in munich and already have experience as a working student and will probably do an internship soon.

I never had to do whiteboard coding or LeetCoding for any interview, was mostly just talking irl and some questioning.

My question is, should I still grind LeetCode questions before I graduate, or are they not common in germany?

IBM, Microsoft and Google have offices here in munich, so I assume its still worth it to study them for these international companies?"

What are your experiences with coding as an engineer? If learning code is unavoidable, which programming language would you recommend to learn?
