For the most part, I have enjoyed my internship and have learned a lot but most importantly have learned what I absolutely do not want to do. I've mostly worked with a web project and upgrading old software to new software.  I know I'm an intern with no experience so there isn't much I can do but from what I've seen a lot of the developers have similar tasks to what I do (but on a larger scale).

My favorite part of computer science is the creation stage.  I love to get deep into a problem and figure out the best solution to tackle it. Maybe that's what every CS major wants but from what I've seen at my internship and online a lot of programming is implementing new features and bug fixing.  I know that's part of the process but I'm not sure I could handle it being 100% of my career.

I'll try to give a more clear picture that may help some of you get a better direction for my question.  I started ""programming"" at 12/13 when I got into a small modding site for Halo and Call of Duty.  I would write small 50-100 line ""mods"" that may not even have worked (I didn't own a modded Xbox).  After that, I was hooked and loved programming.  I would just follow along to YouTube tutorials in C# and VB.  When I got into high school I took every CS class they offered and competed in a programming competition at the local college.  I've always done pretty well in math which has helped quite a bit in the projects I like. For my senior project, I built a fully working battleship program with a somewhat working AI to play against.  The feeling of creating something completely from scratch was one of the best feelings in the world and cemented my dedication to CS. When I got to university the classes were fairly similar to high school. It was mostly algorithm development courses and that's the part I love.  I love the problems they give us and writing an efficient algorithm.  And that's the part I want to dedicate my career to. 

So what careers are out there that are focused on algorithm development and creation and how can I tailor myself to these fields?


Also, in no way did I mean to come off as condescending or pretentious.  It's really difficult to put all of my thoughts into a concise post and I tried to do that as best as possible.  If you have any other questions or want clarification please ask and I'll try to respond quickly."

I am going into my second year as a CS major and I need some guidance on how to get an internship next summer (2019).

In my first year, I only took a basic introductory programing course, discrete mathematics, and linear algebra. This upcoming year, I'm going to take courses that cover data structures, software development (Java), and computer systems (architecture etc). 

Right now, I'm not proficient in any languages yet and don't have any personal projects. During this summer and throughout my second year, I am planning to learn Python or Java and do some personal projects.

One thing I'm worried about is also that all my extracurricular activities (clubs and volunteer experience) are mostly not related to CS at all. Will it hurt that I have non-CS extracurricular activities?

Any advice would be appreciated!"

he said it would be temp to hire and the pay would be low due to budgeting. I took it because it was better than living at home and getting nowhere. 

at first I went through some training but as time went on the boss simply gave me bullshit data entry tasks. I asked family about this and they all say I need ""to build a resume.""

well now that engineering degree might as well be useless because most companies will rather want fresh graduates or experienced engineers than someone who didnt use any engineering for over a year. 

I'm stressed because at 28 I'm too old to yet again build new skills, especially since no girl will ever want to be with a guy who doesn't have a salaried job with benefits. at least according to family members that is. I also heard dating is hard in your 30s becaus you're dealing with the left overs. 

well If things dont get better in a year I will kill myself. hopefully leave this planet for good.

I was working with them through an internship and, well, when I hit senior year I was in the right place at the right time to land me a full time seasonal position there. I still wanted to go to college so I've been working hard to make both schedules work. Recently this year I've also added on a second part time job to help with bills during layoff. Now I find myself at a crossroads between this company that I'm comfortable in or a degree that will stay with me for the rest of my life.
The classes that I have to do to further my degree are starting to conflict with my work schedule. My advisor even said it was nearly impossible to do with the schedule I have unless I change something. The college won't let me take those classes at another college for the same credit either. I tried reaching out to a professor for a direct study to try to work around this with no luck. My last resort is to ask my job to change my schedule which they've been very strict about before.

I'm torn because this job is a great opportunity for me, especially in the field I'm in. They're helping me pay for my degree but only up to a certain amount (and as of right now if I just take one course per semester, the cost that I would have to pay out of pocket is way too much for what it's worth for ONE class... Ofc FAFSA will only help if I have at least 6 credits which at this point I do not due to this scheduling nightmare. I'm not looking for outside loans either) 

I'm just nervous about making this decision because I have a dependency on the job due to bills. Not that they're incredibly expensive but that if I were to just keep my part time job to pay for the bills, I'm afraid that I would be struggling to get by every month. Its also a factor further down the line because even if I do have a degree, there aren't a lot of opportunities in my field where I live now. 

Is this a smart move? Am I making a better decision for myself by getting a degree or keeping this job? 

TLDR; Full time job with benefits is really messing up my path to getting a degree due to its hours. Is it more worth it to keep this job that I'm comfortable in or sacrifice it to get a degree faster and with a more flexible schedule?

Every wednesday we make provisional lists for our suppliers, and every Friday we have to download a new list and update the old provisional lists. 

I wouldn't be here asking for help if our suppliers didn't need every single change marked on the original list we sent them. I.E they just can't take an updated list.

So every friday I have to put the lists side to side and filter A-Z Last Name and then compare addresses. 

I've managed to find code on the internet that directly compares rows but that doesn't really help as new additions or removals alter the persons on the rows. I.E someone could be row 9 on the provisional list and on the updated list be row 13. 

I'm wondering if I can make excel ""hook"" (match?) someones surname (and first name if possible, but surname will do fine) and match it to the new document and show me if there is a change in the address field which is column ""T"".

For example. 

S Eriksson (Column X) is on row 9 on prov list With Address Stockholm in column T.

S Eriksson (Column X) is on row 14 on the updated list with Address Gothenburg in Column T.

I'm either looking for a simple: ADDRESS CHANGED.

And if somehow make all changes appear from the updated list on the provisional list.

Also if there is a code that says ""This surname doesn't exist on the provisional list"" 

But a simple ""ADDRESS CHANGED"" would by it self reduce the workload by 99999999.99%. Checking thousands of people melts your brain really. 

Also if there is a code that says ""This surname doesn't exist on the provisional list""

I think I've done a great job at my internship and my manager said he will be giving me a 5 star rating in my review to convert me to full-time. However, he also said that the company is currently not looking for new hires and is in fact in talks to cut down its size slightly, and as such, I may not receive the full-time offer. Now I know this is a bad sign for the company, but I just want any full-time offer I can get so I don't have to be stressed out my senior year. As such, I've also been looking for other interviewing opportunities.

One of my co-workers (not an intern) had previously worked for a (frankly better) software company. I'm on good terms with him, though I don't think we are extremely close or anything. I was hoping I could ask him for a referral for a full-time position interview in that company (if he still knows anyone working there) because I really do want to have a job when I graduate. How exactly should I bring this up? Like, ""Hey, I know I'm working in this company and I may get a return offer here, but would you also be willing to refer me to this other company also""? He isn't my mentor but he's been looking at my progress and he thinks I'm a good programmer and can pick up things quickly, which of course makes it easier for me to ask for a referral. I just don't know how or when to bring it up (I leave in 2 weeks).

I'm still relatively new so can't do everything yet. She says OK and promptly sends an email. Good. I go back to work.

A few mins later, $L comes and starts talking about not being able to change something on the website, and $I is standing behind her. I look over to $I and ask ""is this related to the thing you just came here for a few minutes ago?"" $I replies ""no we can't change a link for some reason, it won't change in the website"". I get worried because this shouldn't be happening. All the systems are working fine and if there is a problem with trying to change links, it could be a big thing that requires contacting the people who've been here for much longer. Nobody here is bad with computers, plus $I is a student worker, so she should know about basics at least. This could be bad.

I lock my computer and walk over to $L's room with them, and they've got the CMS open in editing mode on one monitor, and the website open on the other where they're trying to make edits and change a link. $L shows me the problem where the link in the CMS is changed to a different link, but when you click it on the website, it still redirects to the old link. I hover over the link in the CMS and it seems to be linked properly, so nothing should be wrong. There shouldn't be an issue here, everything is working fine. It's a relatively simple CMS to use, and pretty straight forward. I decide to reset and redo the whole process and see if that helps. So refresh the CMS, copy the link, link it to some text, press save, and refresh the website. When I click on the link, it redirects to what they wanted!

$I screams, literally screams, ""HOW??? WE JUST DID THE EXACT SAME THING!!!!"". $L thinks and says ""you know, the only thing we didn't do that he did was press save"". $I with her high pitched voice replies something like ""no wayyyy"". I say something like ""haha yeah happens sometimes, I've probably done this as well"" and leave feeling relieved.

Moral of the story, don't panic, the system is probably not dying. User's just need to be reminded of the save button."

The bit I'm concerned about is that my most recent experience is with C# and the .Net tech stack and it makes me feel 'stuck' in that ecosystem. It feels like many of the more modern companies go with other languages or a mix of technologies like Java, Python, Go and others. This feels like a concern for me because it seems like I'm going deep into one tech stack and it would narrow down my opportunities in the future. I'm writing here to understand if that is a genuine concern or am I mistaken... I've also been offered a new position where the main stack is C# and .Net.

Regarding my end goal described above, this shouldn't matter, but for whatever reason it feels like knowing multiple tech stacks would give me enough knowledge to always be able to choose the right tech for the job.

So should I try to switch to a different tech stack before it's too late?"

I'm getting ready for the summer 2019 intern applications as I'm going to be a junior this fall, I want to get as much of an edge as I can. I know recruiters approach you sometimes on LinkedIn, but I was wondering if it was considered okay to approach them on LinkedIn? I have connections with a few and have even sent them connection requests and they've accepted. But now I don't know what to do or say to them which wouldn't seem like the typical begger for a referral.

If anyone can post their experience with this or even general advice on how to word messages to better my position with approaching recruiters, that would be greatly appreciated.

It is important to me for the school to have the following qualities: a strong computer science program, collaborative, valuable internship/research/professional opportunities, and urban. I would also prefer a flexible curriculum, preferably interdisciplinary, but this is not as important as the aforementioned characteristics.

Currently, my match schools are University of Washington CS and Northeastern, and my reach schools are Columbia, CMU, and Berkeley EECS.

I am a rising senior graduating in May 2019. I have had three internships. The first was at a start up teaching children how to code. The second is a product management internship at a startup creating software for healthcare insurance companies, and the third is a product management internship at a fintech company. My role at the product management internships were similar: gathering requirements and writing design documents for new features, and working on an intern project which is creating some new functionality for the company.

Though I liked my internships, I realize through my coursework that I would like a more analytical role instead. I want to spend more time working in Excel, R, and Python rather than building software or designing user interfaces. So for my first job I am planning to apply to data analyst roles in non-finance companies, and analytical roles such as risk analyst in finance companies. 

How do I best market myself for this transition? What skills should I highlight? What is considered a good resume for an entry level analytical job in finance? Also, if you have any advice on what other financial roles are a good fit for my skills, I would appreciate it.

93vyje,4,2018-08-01,"Senior at an Ivy League studying Engineering. I spent the last few years chasing prestige and now I'm clueless, what do I do?",LostCollegeKid_,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/93vyje/senior_at_an_ivy_league_studying_engineering_i/,"Using a throwaway account here for obvious reasons.

Hi Everyone,

I'm a rising senior at an Ivy League university studying Industrial Engineering, and I'm completely clueless about what to do with my life and career as I'm entering the final year of my studies.

A little bit of background:

I'm a international student from a third world country who is fortunate enough to be studying in the States. I entered university as an Aerospace Engineering major, yet introspectively I knew it was not what I wanted to do. I've always fantasized about working for prestigious investment banks or consulting firms, closing huge deals, trading with the hedge funds. Maybe I needed reassurance because of my insecurities, or just wanted to shove it to my friends in middle school who used to bully me for being a nerd.. who knows. This in itself is a conversation for another day.

But the gist of it is that I changed my major to Industrial Engineering a year into college because I wanted to be a little closer to finance. And with a lot of work (getting an internship as an international here is so f\*kin hard), I landed an internship doing quantitative modeling at a large investment bank. But little did I know that I would be loathing absolutely every minute of it. I'm pulling in great money, yet the work is dull and the corporate culture (emphasis on networking, sucking d\*ick) absolutely kills me. To be honest, at this point I'm not even sure if I care for the finance world at all.

Yet, I struggle to find what I really like and also what I'm good at. I know how to code, but I'm not good enough software developer. I know math, statistics, and machine learning, but I'm far from being a good data scientist. I know finance, but obviously I hate my current internship.

Now here comes the dilemma: I'm supposed to hear back about my return offer in 2 weeks, where I will have the option to go back to work for the bank full time. Knowing that I hate the role, but fought hard to land an internship here in the U.S., rejecting it seems like a very risky move to me (not to mention  I run a real chance of not landing a job here in the U.S. and eventually having to go home). My GPA is great, but it means little during recruiting when all my peers are exceptionally bright, and I don't even know what I actually want to do.

However, if I do take it, I know I'm gonna hate myself whenever I'm at work. Yet I know I'm gonna have the opportunity to pursue an H1B Visa and (hopefully) find something that I actually like in the U.S. down the line.

I would really appreciate any advice you guys could give right now -- I just feel so clueless regarding what to do.."

**Edit: Thanks for the responses! I've corrected the spelling and added my GitHub account. I'd love to hear of any other suggestions -- mainly what I could be working on to catch employers' attentions (besides an online portfolio which I'm currently developing). Also -- what level of web dev jobs should I be applying for? Intern, Entry Level, Junior, or Mid? (Obviously not senior lol). Thank you so much for the help guys!**

I'm a recent grad in Computer Science who's had 2 internships - 1 scripting for a security office in python, and another working on a web application (full stack). I left the last internship my senior year because of school (I still got a ton done on the project, though). Since then I've been working freelance and have finished 3 projects - 2 local businesses and one web comic. I also have some side projects from school I'm proud of (for example: machine learning w yelp api, full web application connected to sql database).

Now that I'm graduated I know there is a lot for me to learn, but I also feel like I've had a decent amount of experience for my age to get an entry level job. The skills I feel I know pretty well (somewhere between intermediate and advanced) would be python, C++, html5, css3, javascript, and sql. There are others I've encountered in school which I've put on my resume under skills. I've also completed a 48 hour udemy web bootcamp which helped a lot. I don't think I'm an expert - but I think I have enough knowledge to start out.

After graduation I thought if I applied to enough places, I'd get at least a couple of interviews. But its been a few weeks and I haven't even gotten one callback. I've been applying on linkedin and indeed. (Around 10 on linkedin and 25 on indeed). I've been trying to apply for entry level jobs but even those aren't replying. I'm worried -- what did I do wrong? Should I have gotten an internship at a more prestigious company? Does my resume need work? Do I need to learn more before a job will accept me? I live in the center of sillicon valley so there are tons of jobs - maybe theres just a lot of competition? I'm thinking my next step is to create a cool online portfolio to show some of my projects from work and school. Maybe that will get employers' attention? If I am doing anything obviously wrong, please let me know! I am open to any/all suggestions.

TLDR - I'm a new grad who can't get a job. I've had multiple internships and feel I'm ready for an entry level position, but nobody is calling me back. What am I doing wrong? (Resume attached).

-Extracurriculars: endless list of school clubs, theatre (been involved in every show since my school opened in 2015, as well as being a TA for lower level classes and other various responsibilities), NHS member, President of my school's International Thespian Society Troupe and drama club, secretary for two years of the local teen volunteer organization in my town, creative writing (published in a book and some magazines, winner of many writing awards inside and outside of my school), Print Content Editor and Head of Graphic Design for my school's newspaper as well as Newspaper Student of the Year, attended Long Island University's Summer Honors Institute for theatre, and a bunch more stuff (no school sports though)

What I want to major in:
The main issue I've run into during the college search is that it's hard to figure out what schools have a major I would be interested in. My current career goal is working on the production side of television, but I want the ability to change my mind and sway from that path a little if I find out it's just not for me. So I have been looking at majors that deal with the business side of creative endeavors, or something along those lines. I'm not really interested in getting a film degree. The closest thing I've found to what I think I'm looking for is Business of Creative Enterprises at Emerson College.

What else I'm looking for in a college:
-A school that allows non theatre majors to participate in mainstage productions
-Preferably an urban environment (in the US)
-If the school is not located near television studios, students have the opportunity to intern at different locations
-Not a heavily religious school

If you want any other information, just let me know. Thanks in advance!"

I honestly did very bad in terms of grades but I can still go to second year. Lately I’ve been thinking of what I wanted to do with my degree. After doing research I found out that the job market is not that “nice” towards biomedical engineers and that it’s easier to find a job in Canada is a mechanical, software and electrical engineering. I thought about going to the medical industry since I can apply for it later ( need the mcat and a few other things). I know that I won’t be able to do anything if I don’t get my grades up second year, which i certainly will aim to do so. But if there are any biomedical engineers in this subreddit, any advice? Like should I try to find a co-op/ intern after second year, should I try to get masters later on or medical school?

I hold a CS master degree from a university in UK. My undergraduate degree is from a Malaysian university in mechanical engineering. I am interested in pursuing PhD in machine learning. 

The reason why I am looking for a place in Europe (UK preferably) is that my wife is currently doing her PhD in UK. I am currently working as a junior data scientist in Malaysia but am thinking of pursuing PhD.

The current situation is that my master degree result is not that good. I only obtained a pass. Not merit or distinction. I would like some advice on whether I can potentially land a PhD position.

I was also thinking of doing a research internship at a university. But I don't really know whether a university will take me as an intern as I am not a student anymore.

Any advice will be really appreciated."
93zgwo,0,2018-08-02,[Virginia] Landlord is charging an extra month of rent due to late notice to vacate,interntenant,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/93zgwo/virginia_landlord_is_charging_an_extra_month_of/,"Hi all!

Myself and two college-aged peers rented an apartment in Fairfax county VA from January 3rd to September 3rd. We were working as interns and will be returning to school for the fall semester at the end of August. We plan to vacate the premise on August 10th.

When we rented the apartment we made sure they were aware that we would only be needing the apartment for 8 months. The lease states that we will be living there for 8 months and moving out by September 3rd.

Here comes the fun part:
I go into the leasing office on July 23rd and ask the gentleman who went through our initial move-in paperwork what we needed to do before moving out. He handed me a slip of paper where we could fill out our future address so they could send us the deposit check. He does not mention any issue at this point in time.

We turned in the form on the 28th to another employee at the leasing office. She states that we are late to turning in the form and that we will be charged an additional month at the month-to-month rental rate (A significant increase from our current rate). This is a complete shock to us. We read through the lease and found the term she was referring to:

**LEASE TERM: The initial term of the Lease Contract begins on the 4th day of January 2018, and ends at midnight the 3rd day of September 2018. This Lease Contract will automatically renew month-to-month unless either party gives at least 60 days written notice of termination or intent to move-out... **

I asked the man who went through our move-in signing if we was aware that we were leaving in August and he said yes. He also confirmed he was aware that we were working as interns and would be returning to classes in the fall. I asked him why he did not inform us of the form they required us to turn in - his response is that it is stated in the lease. A copy of this form was **not** provided to us at move in.

Another issue is that while inquiring about living there and the duration back in December 2016, the property changed owners and email providers. This led to most of the email communication being lost on their end.

Had we been given the form at move-in it would have been turned in that day - as we already knew when we were to move out. I have tried to work with them but it seems like there is no reasoning with them. The case has been escalated to their manager and we will be speaking with them tomorrow morning. Any advice or laws that we could use to help our case? Thank you in advance for any help!


Note: We are not trying to beak that lease early. We have already paid through September 3rd"

I'm a master's student graduating in December. I'm just curious what kind of positions could make use of my all skills - backend engineering and machine learning, which are pretty common recently for many people. I'm looking for a backend position now but don't want to give up on machine learning part either.

My research is real-time audio classification using deep learning and Tensorflow - I did from data collection to field experiments. And previously (before my master's degree) I also worked on statistical ML like hidden Markov models pretty deep.

And my internship was about web backend engineering. I was the only backend engineer at a small startup and learned everything myself. I implemented multiple REST endpoints using JBoss and Hibernate and made a demo collaborating with a front end engineer. I set up security stuffs like https and OAuth, and connected to an open source SSO tool. I also made a cluster of Cassandra and ElasticSearch instances but it was more about using them than engineering the base technology.

I'm also interested in making a scalable system. At the internship, I didn't really reach that part but that was like my next goal. I kinda tried Docker but didn't go to production level. I also wanted to work on keeping consistency between the Cassandra instances and ElasticSearch. I've learned a little bit about Hadoop some years ago and don't have meaningful experience on this part.

I want to develop my career that can include things mentioned above. I think a position I'd be interested in but not qualified at this point can be data engineering - data pipeline kinda stuff...?? What kind of positions do you think I should look at? Should I just get a backend job and just study by myself? 

Thank you everyone!!!"

It would include all algorithms from the course (and others as I continue to learn) as well as some general functionality for data preprocessing and evaluation (ex: train/test/validation splitting of data, feature normalization, k-fold cross-validation, etc.).

My question: is this worth doing? I enjoy programming, and think this would be fun, but I don't have a ton of free time (only got a couple of weeks before a busy semester starts). Also, this project wouldn't be very useful  in terms of application -- scikit-learn does everything better and faster than whatever I would come up with.

941m7s,194,2018-08-02,"When I was 25, I met... myself.",awkward-swan,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/941m7s/when_i_was_25_i_met_myself/,"Well, here goes.

I’m sitting here at a desk unfamiliar to me in a bedroom I don’t recognize, and yet it’s home. I have no explanation for the insane turn of events that have happened to me... and I’m terrified of what is to come. So here I am.

I’ve had to rewrite this whole post three times because I’m still trying to wrap my head around everything. Everything I thought I knew was a lie. Or something like that. Maybe the answer is I just had the wildest, most vivid dream of my life. I don’t know— I can’t process it all.

But let me start from the beginning... at least, as I remember it.

In 10th grade, I met the love of my life. Well, my second love. Theatre was my first, and the second was... Rosemary.

She was perfect.

Not just her outer beauty and the way those little crimson ringlets cascaded over her face like the most beautiful waterfall there ever was. Or the way that the mesmerizing scent of her strawberry shampoo always sent me to another world entirely. No, we also had much in common, like big acting dreams and our passion for theatre manifesting in all the countless after hours spent practicing for our roles in our school plays... Well it was her, myself and my best friend Rodney rehearsing lines and losing sleep over this little dream of ours. We were the three musketeers. But she stole my heart from day one.

My love for her only grew over the next three years of high school, and I constantly warred with myself over when I should tell her about how I felt.

Well I decided the day.

We had just graduated and she was about to leave for Georgia, where she found a great college for theatre/arts. Her car bulging with her belongings, she was all packed and ready to drive up, with her parents following in theirs so they could say goodbye up there and then head back. The last three years had all built up to this great moment, I guess. I was going to finally tell her that I was absolutely in love with her. Maybe it was weird timing, given that she was about to leave but I had waited this long (read: procrastinated) and I couldn’t let her leave without knowing first what I had to say.

There we stood in her driveway, her parents in their car waiting on her... There I stood, looking into her eyes and heart beating a million miles a minute. Praying I could get all the right words out.

“So, this is it, then,” she said with that smile that always managed to melt me.

“This is it,” I said, mentally preparing myself.

“Promise me you’ll call and keep in touch?”

“Of course. You too!”

“Oh hey, I almost forgot.” She pulled out a notebook with blue-and-black designs on the front. I recognized it instantly from slyly passing it back and forth in class to her and Rodney during our first year together. I was surprised to see it; it had been a while. “Not to get all old fashioned on you but... you should be my pen pal. Use this to write in, mail it to me, and I’ll write in it and send it back. It was an idea I got from a friend of mine. I thought it was cute.”

I agreed, chuckling at her creativity. And then a lull... a somewhat awkward silence. It almost seemed like she was... waiting for something.

“Rose! We need to leave before the traffic gets bad,” her mom called out impatiently. I literally had seconds.

“Well,” Rose said with hesitation, “that’s my cue.” She winked. Theatre pun.

“I guess it is,” I said, at a total loss for words. She headed back to her car and.... that was it. Anti-climactic, I know.

I never told her. She never knew. I was an idiot.

I went home incomplete that night. Sure, we traded that notebook back and forth several times but life just got in the way, and our penpal correspondence eventually ceased entirely. And the “unrequited love” void in me ripped open a mile wide a few years later when I found out she got engaged... to Rodney. To my freakin’ *best friend*. I know it may sound cliche but I honestly didn’t even know they were close like that. I never saw it coming. I lost her.

But life goes on, and so did I. I ended up switching my major from Theatre/Arts to Accounting in case I didn’t hit my \~big break\~ by the time graduation rolled around. So I graduated, landed a job that followed an internship. Both theatre and Rosemary became distant memories of the past. I met a great girl named Emily. I was going to propose. She wasn’t Rosemary, but... I loved her. I think.

I took my lunch break away from the office. As I walked I felt strangely drawn to the first floor of the garage building next door, belonging to a hospital. But something arrested me— the sight of this older man dressed casually, with his head in his hands, sitting on one of those long concrete parking stops. Something about him seemed so familiar, and yet I knew I had never met him. I tried to keep walking but something made me stay. He looked up, his face etched deep with grief— he must have sensed my presence.

I felt silly for staring at him so I broke the silence. “I’m sorry.. I just feel like I know you?” I stuttered awkwardly.

He chuckled in a half-sad way. “No. But I know you. I know you well.” I waited, totally confused, expecting him to expound on that. “Does the name ‘Rosemary’ ring a bell with you?”

He may as well have punched me in the gut— that name ripped a hole through me as my head filled with questions. “Yes... is she okay? How do you know her?” We didn’t talk anymore but I still cared. I always cared. “No. She’s dead, Tom.” His face fell, the grief taking over again.

My briefcase fell to the ground with a loud THUD.

“In my reality anyway.”

“Wait... what?”

“Tom, it’s no coincidence that you met me here. I was here to bring you a choice. In this reality, you are a great businessman. You’re doing well. But are you happy?”

“Happy? Well— I’m okay, I mean..” I stammered.

“Do you ever wonder what it would be like if you had just told her your feelings? If you had just told her everything?”

My confusion deepened. “How— how do you know about that? How do you know about my life?”

“I’m here to give you a choice, Tom,” the man reiterated, rising to his feet. “To go back and live your dream. To have Rosemary. And theatre. But it’s going to cost you everything.”

“What do you mean? How—“

“In my reality, which can be yours... Rosemary will be brutally murdered”— he choked up here — “by a disgruntled ex and there is *nothing* you can do to stop it from happening. You will lose her forever. But you will have gained back the moments you forfeited with your silence, the day she left for Georgia.” It was a strange sight to behold; this grief-stricken man and yet there was this steady glow in his eyes, like... wholeness. Like a quiet contentment. Despite everything.

Anyway, I just continued to listen. I gave up any hopes of trying to make sense of this man several sentences ago. He reached into his bag and produced an item I never thought I would see again, its blue and black designs on front all too familiar. The notebook. “Write your answer. In here. The choice is yours. Choose wealth—“ he gestured to me— “or happiness.”

——

I don’t know what happened right after that. Maybe I passed out; I’m not sure. But all I remember is my eyes fluttering open, blinking away sleep. Staring groggily at a red fluorescent light in front of me.. an alarm clock I had never seen before. Disoriented, I turned slowly on my side. I was laying in a bed, in a room completely foreign to me. Sunlight spilled through the blinds so it was light enough to see everything including the quiet, slumbering figure lying next to me, their torso rising and falling with every steady breath.

Frozen with shock, I gazed at the cascade of red ringlets obscuring the figure’s face. I lifted my hand to brush some of them away and...

Rosemary.

First, I think it would be wise to provide some background. I've been a programmer for pretty much my entire (relatively short) life, and got interested in it pretty quickly, albeit with the help of my uncle, who is an engineer.  I attended one of the most competitive school districts in my state and worked very hard, with very little happiness about that work, to attend a good college, where I am now a student. 

In the past year of college, I effectively whipped myself with very few breaks in order to earn good grades, but started to run out of steam near the end of the year, where the stress became too much.  I would study non-stop for a week before every final, trying to jam as much information as possible into my brain, and the night before a final I would be so stressed that I could not sleep, and so I underperform on the finals.  I tried taking Nyquil before, as much as I dislike it because of the feelings of abuse I get from it.  Since my college is on the quarter system, the midterms and finals are essentially perpetual, and so I'm always studying. 

 I'm now trying to get an internship for next summer at a good tech company, and as is standard procedure, they sent out some coding challenges for me to solve as a preliminary review.  My extensive years of experience coding weren't much help in these challenges as these are logic based, not knowledge problems primarily.  I'm doing a coding project this summer, which I put on hold to practice these logic problems.  Today, when it came time to do the problems, I failed them, not being able to solve them in the time allotted, not even because I was nervous, just because I could not figure them out.  I think I have lost my edge.  During work time for my projects, I often catch myself browsing spotify and distracting myself when I could be working instead.  I think I have lost my edge. I don't believe that I am very smart, I just think that I have whipped myself to get to this point, and I don't know if I can stand the thought of an entire career of the same sort of behavior.  Everything takes work and I acknowledge that, but I am unable to find a good work-life balance, because I feel like I have to work twice as hard to keep up with my peers, and fundamentally, I'm very unhappy with myself (my character).  I want a way forward where I no longer hate myself, and where I'm at least competent at my work.  I believe that I love it, but perhaps very deep down I face denial, and this scares me as well.  In all other regards, I am blessed: with my family, and my socioeconomic situation.  What are meaningful steps I should take to figure out how to resolve this, as I have a feeling that it's times like these that have the most impact on life's direction. Thank you for taking the time to read this, I apologize for my burdens."

- Took a national chemistry test and was one of the top 50 (out of over 800 candidates). Further tests will take place until a top 4 list is prepared. These 4 students will represent my country in the International Chemistry Olympiad.

- Completed a one month internship at a hospital where I learned a lot from doctors in multiple departments.

Pretty mediocre ECs I guess.

I have very small programming experience right now. I have started learning python these days because there are three weeks until my very first semester starts.
I want to do masters in Data Science or in Software Engineering (Still undecided) later in my life.

Now my question is that what should I do and what skills should I learn and master that in two years (right after my fourth semester) I get an internship at Google. What should I prepare in these two years?

And by Google, I mean any of *the* big companies like Amazon, Intel, IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, Apple or preferably Google.

I am in administration.

I am good with people, have some IT knowledge and do have a high interest in programming, development or CAD. I love animals but refuse 12 years of school to be a vet. I like to be busy, be and stay challenged in my work, be able to be creative, and my goal is to ultimately be able to work at home when I start popping out children- ultimate goal to work for myself.

I am a student, and have an extensive intern and school schedule which prevents me from working any more hours or in the morning during the week. School is my main priority but I also need income.

My skills and experience:
-customer service 
-retail experience
-extremely responsible
-organization skills
-able to work alone
-associates degree
-sales experience
-friendly &amp; good verbal and written communication skills
-can manage monetary transactions &amp; register
-basic computer skills (word, excel, etc) 

What I would like:
-job with steady hrs of 18-20 working hours a week (preferably 3 days weekly)
-job where I won’t be completely disrespected on a regular basis (I know this is rare for most part time employment)
-job where I can make above average pay rate. I’m talking minimum wage plus tips or commission and anything extra. 


Please recommend jobs that may fulfill my wishes. I am a hard worker and extremely responsible so I would like something that will compensate me for this. I am open to all suggestions. Thank you for your time and help!

943dj1,5,2018-08-02,How Long Does it Take to Succeed?,theycallmecpk,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/943dj1/how_long_does_it_take_to_succeed/,"Since a teenager, one of the biggest things I worried about was how long it’d take to financially succeed. I saw people who had a lot of money online and I always wondered how long it’d take **me** to get there. I originally told myself that I wanted to be a pharmacist because my cousin was earning 100k+/year right out of college. If it wasn’t that, I figured I could be a dentist and make $200k+/yr by my thirties.

In 2014, I talked to my cousin about what it was like to be a pharmacist. He said that it was the same thing everyday and overall he didn’t seem to recommend it. This scared me because my only other “option” was becoming a dentist, or so I thought.

During one of my dentist appointments, I asked my dentist if he could tell me about the business. He told me he went to school for 12 years and showed me some of the equipment they work with. I knew he made pretty good money, but the idea of being in university for 12 years (or 8 if you don’t specialize) was quite scary to me. He also said he worked as an employee for a number of years before he started his own firm. He described how he built up his client base which sounded the same as any normal business. I began asking myself why I would ever go to school for that long when I could start a normal business and make the same amount as him or even more. I also didn’t want to get in debt (which he said took years to pay off).

In my junior year of high school I joined a leadership program. One day they took us to a hospital and we got to learn from the doctors about their careers. One of the workers in residency said she went to Brown University and collected $200,000+ worth of student debt. She was a 28 year old that had pulled up in an old Toyota Corolla. I knew that was not the car I wanted to drive when I was 28 regardless of whether or not I was eventually going to make a supposed “fortune” from this industry. She told us that her only job during this “in the field” residency was doing paperwork for the hospital. It sounded like they looked at her as nothing more than an intern to take advantage of. I felt bad for her as I could tell from the tone of her voice that she wasn’t sure she had made the right choice.

After these events, I decided I wasn’t going to become a dentist, pharmacist, or even go to college. Beyond that, the seed of dropping out of high school was planted in my mind. My dream was to go big, and I wasn’t going to go home.

I did not become as financially successful as I hoped I would within the timeframe I’d expected. Yes, I did become a millionaire at 19 but I was trying to do that by the age of 18. In 2015, Appsitude only had 70k revenue and around 50k profit. At the end of the year I was disappointed in myself for not having made more money (although it didn’t take a lot of work).

I turned this disappointment into motivation to do better in 2016. Thankfully I ended up making 356k in revenue with around 200k in profit by the end of that year. I was happier but still upset that I hadn’t reached my goal.

I’ve found that success will not usually happen within the original timeframe you **hope for**, but it will definitely happen faster than you **think**. In 2017, my life began to change for the better over and over on different days (in the two previous years it did as well, but even more in 2017). All of a sudden I began to **feel** the light at the end of the tunnel.

In the pursuit of success, it’s good to stay motivated and continue pushing, but do not get mad at yourself if you don’t reach a certain point as quickly as you’d hoped for. Don’t compare yourself to me or anyone else because each of us had different circumstances. It doesn’t matter if you came from wealth or not, **true** success is completely independent of that. There are many broke people with a lot of money.

At the end of the day, you must remember that you cannot wait for future possible events to determine your success. You must create your success **today**. Today, my great friend was telling me that he wanted to wait on submitting a press release until he got a certain contract. I told him that he should do it **now** instead of later because the contract isn’t for certain, but that the journalists receiving and posting the press release is a guarantee (yes I know in certain cases you don’t know if the journalists will post your press release, but in this specific case it is certain). I also mentioned that posting the press release will put more pressure on his potential client because the article will make the client realize he may lose his chance to work with my friend due to the soon-to-come influx of other potential customers.

It’s always best to do something now than later. The only thing between us and success is **time**, and the only thing holding us back is our **fear of success**. I had many moments where I waited on posting something online because I knew it’d had massive results and I felt I wouldn’t be ready to handle what came next. The thing is, life always prepares you for the next steps even when it looks like it won’t to either you or those around you. When you have this in mind, you become unstoppable because you will realize that life is always taking you into the right direction.

It took me from December 2014 till May 2017 to become a millionaire. That’s around 2.5 years of working toward my goal. I did do things for money before then so you could say my journey originally began in May 2013, but I didn’t seriously get into business until the end of 2014. Yes, I did lose most of that money from my ex-business partner stealing it, but I didn’t care (besides the friendship lost) because I knew I can, and will earn far more than what I “lost.”

I feel that true success is the ability to realize that you could lose all of your material things today and not blink because you know you can just as easily earn it again. Once you’ve attained this **feeling** (it’s not just a belief), you’ll notice that everything you want to happen begins to happen. With that being said, I believe that I did not truly become successful until my fiance came into my life after the summer of 2017."

She anticipates that my manager will bring me in sometime next week for the offer. My question is, how much pay should I negotiate for a position like this (if I get the offer, of course)? I'm currently paid a bit below $20/hr; however, I feel that I've been extremely productive for them over the summer. This is my first internship, thus it has been my only professional experience in the field so far.

Struggled from major to major for 3 years until i figured I wanted to be a Game programmer and decided to pick one of the most expensive schools at the time since my college was being paid for for the next upcoming years. 
 
  
Fast forward 3 years ahead and Im finally a senior with only 7 classes left. But it started to dawn on me as I was looking for internships and potential entry level jobs.  
  
Everything is asking for a Computer Science major or something similar. I look at the curriculum for some CS majors at other colleges and while the fundamentals are somewhat the same as my schools', its way more indepth at others with a CS degree.  
  
Its sort of leaving me with a sense of ""Im screwed!"" since I have to compete against others with a better degree to be put on their resumes and with possibly better education then me. While it all comes down to problem solving and algorithms, it makes me feel as though I wont even be glanced at when they see ""Bachelors of Arts in Game Programming"".  
  
**Has anyone else gone through this or can chime in on what I could do to become a more attractive job seeker with my upcoming degree? Even though Im going to school for Game programming I wish to seek a job as a Software developer if I cannot find a studio to work for or if something better comes along.**  
  
**There is also the option of swapping majors and going to a cheaper college, but with only 7 classes left to graduate and potentially being (22k dollars in debt), im in kind of a confused state of where to go with my education.

I'll keep this as short as possible. I'm looking for work and quite frankly more experience in my field. I graduated with a bachelors degree in print journalism in 2013 and since then, finding work and keeping work has been a struggle. 2 months ago, depression pretty much gave me an RKO outta nowhere and the job I had been working at had to cut me off cause I wasn't keeping it under control. I was down for the three count before I knew it.

Fast forward to today, I'm fine now and ready to lace up my boots again. Don't worry I'm not a pro wrestler who's going to give you the people's elbow or anything, but I'm starting to raise an eyebrow and think that office work and being in the newsroom just isn't for me. I figured if I could, I could find some work-at-home positions and try that way, but those are far and few in between.

So, here I am on Reddit.

The bulk of my entire career has dealt with writing, managing and editing content in a fast-paced environment. I started with University of Houston’s newspaper known as The Daily Cougar, where I began contributing story ideas, working with multiple sections of the paper while keeping an added interest in composing articles for the Life &amp; Arts page. It is here where most of my coverage of Houston’s arts and culture scene took flight. I like writing about entertainment, technology, music, and arts, but I'll also say that I'm good at researching topics and being able to write an article based on that.

I grew to be a leader through section editor roles, where I managed story ideas given to me by a roster of 15 to 20 writers and crafted page layouts for both print and online using applications such as WordPress and Adobe InDesign. I’ve learned AP Style during my time as an intern for the Houston Chronicle and freely shared that knowledge with these writers as well.

The internship allowed me to cover Houston’s events and writing profile stories of some of its most inspiring and contributing citizens for the Star section. I worked under the supervision of Diane Cowen, the food and religion editor, who would note on my attention to detail and the ability to work a task until completion.

Other tasks also included learning the language of the business and using social media marketing as a way to gauge how our readers are enjoying the daily content that we produced. With my time at my former job, I learned how to utilize admin tools for Facebook, Twitter, and Wordpress in order to create posts and gauge campaign performance. At the time of this writing, I just started learning Google Analytics and expect to receive my certification soon. I'm familiar with using tools like Hootsuite, Buffer, and Hash.me. I'm not a huge graphic designer, but with Canva, I do what I can.

Get to the point, already? Okay, jabroni.

I will be frank. There is a lot that I still need to learn and I feel like I need to develop more skills in order to be successful as a writer, news writer, copywriter, social media coordinator. In addition to those things, SEO integration and campaign management are some things that I can see myself doing and want to learn more about, and it would be cool if I could work with someone who would allow me to learn on-the-go. 

I understand that at my age, my story and experience, I’m not what most would consider hiring, and honestly, I don't blame you. I'm a little too intimidated to even apply for writing or editing roles in Houston anymore because I don't feel like I'm good enough just yet. That's not to say that I don't apply, but I'm not saying that I'm directly getting any type of looks from these companies either. I don't have 10+ years of experience or anything like that and I can certainly tell you that I'm still pretty susceptible to making plenty of mistakes.

So, I guess what I'm looking for is a company who hires work-at-home writers of all types and is open-minded enough to give me a shot to learn something new. I'll even take a trial run at this point if you're skeptical. If your pay rate isn't huge right off the bat, that's totally fine. So long as you pride yourself on consistency when it comes to payment, I can match that pretty well.

I can provide a full resume and some work samples upon request. I even have a cool little picture of me in a suit if you want to put a face to a name. 

Please shoot me a PM and let me know if you're looking for anything remotely close to what I've been doing on and off for the last 5 years.

Thanks! And remember: Eat your vitamins and say your prayers!

I graduated 2-3 months ago and I can't find any work. I graduated from a fairly good University with a 3.5 in finance (bachelors). I know it's not high, but its okayish. 

I've sent out over 300 jobs already and I've gotten maybe 10 or so phone screens and only 1 actual interview, which gave me an offer. However, due to it being in a different country I couldn't take it. 

I've just been really depressed right now. I mean I knew the job search was going to be hard but damn my success rate is literally less than 0.03%. And it isn't even my resume or cover letter. I paid to have a HR professional look at it. I didn't have many friends at Uni to network with, and since my school is in an expensive city I have been forced to move back in with my parents in another city so I can't just go out and network. 

I feel so worthless. I mean the stats are saying unemployment is at an all time low at 3.8% in the last 17 years, but WHY AM I PART OF THE 3.8%? It's not like I'm not educated or have no experience. I've worked in financial services and in a biotech startup as an intern for a cumulative 1 year of full-time experience before I graduated, and I still can't find squat. I can't go back to the biotech startup because they're not doing so well/not hiring, and I've applied to the financial services company for 15- 20 of their positions and haven't got a call.

Is this a joke? Guys, what can I even do now? I feel like I've done everything I can. It's hard to be optimistic with 30k in student loans and not a prospect in sight. I feel so ashamed and a burden on my family, and just want to run away and go die in a ditch.

tl;dr
Just graduated can't find job. Nothing wrong with resume/cv. Want to die. "

948rlr,1,2018-08-03,"About to start studying film and tv production at university, I am unsure...",Garbashi,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/948rlr/about_to_start_studying_film_and_tv_production_at/,"Hey, so I've been working for two years since I graduated from I guess Sweden's equivalent of high school. Ever since I've started to think about what I wanted to do when growing up which I guess started when I was 14 years old I've had a hard time.  The \*only\* thing I've managed to come up with is working with film. I love movies and I love the idea of being involved in making one. My favourite parts of moviemaking is the photograhy, color grading and editing. But I've always felt that doing it is treading dangerous ground, because it's a hard business to get into, get a job in and do well in. So I've been waiting, hoping that something else peaks my interest. Now I'm 21 and I'm still as unsure as I was 7 years ago. However, after working 2 years I'm really sick of it and want to start studying, and working shitty jobs has made me realized how important it is to enjoy your job because I felt miserable when I was working full time with a job I hated. So I said fuck it and applied to a university with an education called Film and Tv Production. It's three years long and in the last weeks you get to try out an internship which I've heard some people later has landed a job at. 

I feel unsure because I'm not 100% confident that I want to do this, however I can't imagine myself being 100% confident in anything else so I figure this is as close as I'll come. I feel unsure because I'll be taking loans and if I do regret this it'll be costly for me in the long run. I feel unsure because I'm moving away from home, and I worry there'll be no one to support me if I need it. I feel unsure because I'm not really confident in my abilities. I guess I'm going into it with the wrong mindset though, I'm going there to study \*in order\* to develop my abilities.

Also, every worry I have can also be seen as a challenge for myself to overcome. I just have confidence problems and I'm better at seeing the worst part of everything.

I guess what I want to know, or get advice on is: Were you ever unsure of what you were about to study, and did that ever change when you started studying?"

I would appreciate advice on how I should be promoting myself to companies and what jobs I would be a good fit for, i.e. is my minor enough to be a software engineer at a company? Should I try to find opportunities in the mechanical engineering field where I can program instead? I know similar questions like this have been asked before but I felt that my situation was a bit different from others in similar situations. More relevant details about myself: I have completed an internship with a major company as a programmer (without sharing too many details it was a utility/power company), also I have a decent amount of project experience with programming, I've made a simple rock paper scissors game using OpenCV for, and a web based smashbros like game using javascript for example.

How do you win?,Xilc,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/94bcmi/corporate_is_a_very_difficult_place_for_a_new/,"I'll give you the short version. Contacted by recruiter, started working at a company known to be one of the worst in the country to work for according to many Publications and public reports. despite that tried to make the best of it. But I ended up in just about the worst Department in the company. Our team of less than 5 people works with marketing constantly but has no real identity. So basically we deal with all the data for marketing. But we don't get to go to any of the marketing events. We don't get invited to any of the celebrations. We don't go out to eat with them. We don't go out to the bar with them or go out to dinner with them when they celebrate even though we are directly invested in their success. Just this week, everyone starts wearing different team shirts across the company for each department. Asked my supervisor about it but he says ""we don't do that."" we also got a new leader above both of our departments that links us together but we are still supposed to be separate my boss says. 


In essence, we work with marketing but we don't get to have any fun like they do. We also have no identity and don't even act like a team at all. my boss also has this callus don't really care much about anything attitude that makes it hard to be devoted to the job. He's like the only manager that doesn't even work with us at the main location because he's from the other side of the country so he flies around constantly. Meanwhile, marketing has their boss literally right next to us and he's always there. Also, my internship is coming to an end. I was told up front that contingent on my performance I would be hired. So I asked my boss since my internship is coming up what was going to be happening. I've been doing remarkably well, catching on really quickly, and everyone has been giving me feedback that I'm really great. But he says he can't tell me yet if I'm hired. Makes me feel like he doesn't actually take me seriously enough to give me a definitive answer. 



 I'm not sure how I win here. someone also approached me from another department that I really wanted to get into and said that there is an open position there and I should apply. Other people have told me to apply to other positions. Within the company of course. Just not really sure how I win"

94cmea,1,2018-08-03,Grr...psychiatrist won't refill my meds!,cateye_nebula,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/94cmea/grrpsychiatrist_wont_refill_my_meds/,"I am incredibly frustrated with my psychiatrist and want to vent...

I had an appointment with my psychiatrist for August 1st, but I had to reschedule because I made the appointment 2-3 months ago before I started my summer semester of classes. My practicum fell on that day and I couldn't reschedule my clients' appointments...not to mention, I need hours! If I called out that day, I'd be almost 8 hours short by the end of the semester. 

So I called to reschedule and they gave me an appointment date for mid-October...I'm like, ok...I can deal with that. She's pretty busy, I get it. I'm like...no big deal, just refill my meds until I see you in October. I know what my class schedule and internship schedule will be like around that time, so I should be good!

She says no...

I get a little frustrated and ask the receptionist why. The receptionist said that my psychiatrist wants to see me first before refilling any of my medication, so the refill request was denied. So I explained that I understand why she'd like to see me, but if that's the case, she needs to figure out something in her schedule! I'm willing to see her any time and any day that's not Tuesday or Wednesday day/afternoon. The receptionist says, ""Well, we'll see.""

I called back again today and I told them I was willing to see another psychiatrist in the interim until she can see me, just so I can get my meds refilled. She gives me this attitude about rescheduling, so I told her either someone sees me and/or refills my meds, or else I will likely end up hospitalized. I can't just *NOT* take the medication for two months! She fixed her attitude, but then said my psychiatrist is the only one.

I. AM. IRRITATED. And ANXIOUS as all get out.

Thankfully I have about a week before all hell breaks loose and I run out of my medication. But I really don't know what to do when that happens...If I go to the hospital and they try to admit me, that's going to be days of work, school, and my practicum I'm missing...

All I want is my damn medication...:(

TL;DR - My psychiatrist is refusing to refill my medications until I see her in October. I run out of meds next week. I'm anxious and just needed to vent. Thanks!"
94cxys,5,2018-08-03,Maintaining Relationships,CupboardSlang,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/94cxys/maintaining_relationships/,"**TL;DR:** I am well aware of how easily my interest changes and how quickly I get bored with things, but struggle to successfully combat those issues. This causes problems maintaining any sort of platonic or romantic relationship.

\---

For a little bit of background: I am 21 years old and I am about to begin my last year of college. I haven't had trouble managing symptoms when it comes to school work or my internship, but I struggle immensely when it comes to maintaining any sort of relationship.

I am not very open about my ADHD with others for two reasons: First, It is very difficult for someone without ADHD to fully understand what it is like to live with ADHD. Everyone experiences some ADHD symptoms throughout their life so they use those experiences to draw comparisons. Even though they have good intentions and are genuinely trying to relate, this often ends up just discrediting the struggles someone with ADHD goes through on a daily basis. Second, once someone knows about my ADHD, I tend to default to what I call the ""ADHD excuse"". This causes even more frustration whenever a close friend confronts me on one of my shortcomings because it often makes them think that this isn't something that I can change/fix and instead they will just have to adapt and deal with it.

My issue with all of my relationships seems to revolve my issue of getting bored and my constantly changing interests. I have a core group of close friends that all seem to understand my erratic behavior, but not all of my friends are like that. I can't help but feel like a complete failure when I have to reassure someone for the 100th time that I do care about them and enjoy their company, but then fail to acknowledge them or reach out to them for weeks/months because I've suddenly become more interested by something else (another friend group, a personal project, etc). This often results in a lot of friends/friend groups just completely fading from my life after a few months.

Managing friendships is significantly easier than managing romantic relationships. I have gotten myself into an unhealthy cycle when it comes to dating. I am constantly bouncing from girl to girl.  I unintentionally move things extremely fast when I first get involved with a girl because the opportunity for new and interesting experiences is exciting to me. As she becomes attached to me, I begin to distance myself. The time we spend together significantly decreases because my focus has now shifted from her to something else. I'm still attracted to her and still enjoy the time we spend together, but at this point most of the relationship is me reassuring her that I'm not ignoring her/I still do care about her. I start to dread spending time with her and I end up cutting it off. within the next few weeks I am almost always involved with someone new and the cycle continues. This is beginning to weigh on me pretty heavily as  it is essentially me using girls because they are a guaranteed way for novel and exciting experiences.

I am extremely discourages right now because, despite knowing my tendencies when it comes to friendships/relationships, I still haven't been able to effectively change them. I know that if I explained it this way to one of my friends then I would just come off as selfish and apathetic. 

\---

This was mainly just a rant, but if any of you can relate with this or struggle with relationships in other ways I'd love to hear about it."

94drx9,2,2018-08-03,I'm planning on accepting a job offer that pays significantly less than what I make now. What should I do?,sangmundfroid,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/94drx9/im_planning_on_accepting_a_job_offer_that_pays/,"Posting this in multiple places to get advice from different perspectives. Throwaway account just in case.

I have been bartending at a high-end casual restaurant for the past 4 years. I'm in a pretty good spot there; I'm one of the head bartenders, have a mostly set schedule, and average about $32 per hour including my hourly wage + avg tips. I usually only work about 32 hours per week, so this comes out to about $1000/wk. 

I also recently completed an internship in Human Resources as the last requirement for my Bachelor's in Psychology. I plan on beginning a clinical psychology Master's program next year (almost exactly a year from now). Eventual goal is to work in the research sector of forensic psychology. 

I have been offered a full time job by my internship supervisor at $20/hr. In the area I live, this is an unheard of wage for the position I would be working. To begin my employment, my job title would be administrative assistant/hr admin, but she said she would eventually like to move me more towards the role of HR Generalist. This position includes some pretty competitive benefits, some of which I have never had before. I was told that I can choose the amount of hours I'd like to work per week, anywhere from 30-40 to be considered full time and possibly still work my other job. However, insurance doesn't kick in until 90 days from hire and I currently have insurance through my other position. If I were to keep bartending part-time, I would lose my insurance because you have to be considered a full-time employee (30+ hours per week) to have insurance through the company. 

For the most part, I enjoy bartending. I enjoy the job itself, getting to shoot the shit with people and get paid for it, and of course, the money. However, a few people in management/other coworkers are absolutely insufferable. A couple of my managers are literally anxiety inducing. Almost everyone I work with is younger than me, so it is sometimes difficult to answer to people above me that have no additional training and/or skillset beyond what I have. It is very challenging to deal with the lapse in maturity I have with most people there, as well as experience the terrible work ethic of the majority of younger individuals. It might not seem like a big deal to some, but an average 26 year old is much different than a 20-21 year old. Maybe I seem like the asshole here, I don't know. It's kind of hard to capture in words how I feel about the job as a whole. I would say, overall, I'm not happy, but it has very little to do with the requirements of my job and more so with the people I have to pretend to like.

I also know that I cannot and will not bartend forever. On top of it being a high-stress job, it is also unhealthy to stand for 7-8 hours straight, which I often do. 

What should I do? Should I quit now, or go down to a couple shifts a week to ease myself into the new transition? I have a large amount of bills; adjusting to being paid approximately $1500 biweekly would be definitely be difficult. However, I have done virtually nothing but work in a restaurant my entire 10-year working life. I need to do something different and get experience in a new field, but from a financial standpoint, am I making a mistake?"

I graduated from the boot camp and was offered an office manger position at the boot camp to get an income and practice my craft. I later got laid-off since the company needed to take a different route. I was out of the job for a month then got a serving job to meet my ends. I quit that job a month into it cause it was causing a lot of stress. Took another month off and got two jobs as a fitness admin and game master for an escape room. A few months into those two jobs, I then found a another job at an upcoming escape room that was paying really well. I landed that job then two month into it, they offered me an assistant manger position.

Eight months later, here I am, wanting to quit my job, take a month to review and apply for an Internship so I can get my foot in the door in the tech industry.

For the past two years I have not been coding or practicing my algorithms.

I'm hitting mental blocks in quitting my current job and not feeling prepared to apply for internships.

Should I go back to college and try to get a B.S. in computer science?

How should I go about my journey? I know I need to rebuild my resume and portfolio."

I've heard that skills+experience matter more than your major when it comes to jobs. However, being an incoming freshman (and only human), I have a ton of insecurities.

I've heard accounts of tech intern hopefuls allegedly getting nearly immediately turned down at on-campus recruitment fairs just because they aren't a CSE/ECE-related major. Even the requirements for [this Google internship opportunity](https://careers.google.com/jobs#!t=jo&amp;jid=/google/engineering-practicum-intern-summer-2018-345-spear-st-san-francisco-ca-94105-usa-2976100146&amp;) has ""currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or a related technical field"" as a minimum requirement :(

However, I've also heard various accounts of people having friends who are cog sci majors actually getting software internships and landing software engineering jobs, but I've never seemed to find any examples of these people on the Internet (e.g. LinkedIn). I really want to connect with these people, not only to see what they did to get those internships and jobs (to hopefully give me some hope+inspiration), but also to find some kind of community in this situation and not feel alone (ya feel me?) :))

TLDR; if you are/know someone who isn't a CSE/ECE major but still landing software engineering internships/jobs, let's connect! Or at least share a link to a portfolio/resume so I can have some more hope :) Thanks!"
94elpq,97,2018-08-03,"Studying leetcode in groups, rather than alone - my ""different"" strategy for studying for internships from last fall",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/94elpq/studying_leetcode_in_groups_rather_than_alone_my/,"Hey guys,

Since interview season for new grads is coming up, I'd like to share how I studied for interviews the past year. Whenever I read about ""grinding"" leetcode on this sub it sounds like a super painful process that has to be done alone.

I remember when I started to study alone last summer it was super painful. I was just bored after every question and it was pretty unmotivating when I looked at a solution and was like ""jeez I'm actually terrible"".

Instead I just studied with 3 of my close friends that I met in school doing CS related work. Every day after work, we'd hop onto discord at 7:00pm and go through a few questions until 10pm or so. 3 hours sounds like a lot but honestly the time went by pretty fast when you're actively talking to others.

Our process went like this:

For each question, we'd all begin brainstorming together possible ways to solve the question. We'd spew out ideas even if they sounded stupid until we got something that was worth trying.

1. If we agreed on how to approach the question, we'd try to implement it on our own together. After one person gets the correct implementation (or the others are confident they could do the question in an interview) we would go onto the next question.
2. If we didn't agree, we'd try to implement it our own way until someone finished. Again, if everyone is confident they could do the question in an interview with their approach, we would go onto the next question.
3. If we had no clue, after 30 minutes we would look at the solution and code it up separately on our own time.


Our strategy was to just go through as many questions as we could. We thought that if we saw a wide variety of questions, then recognizing patterns in leetcode questions would become easier and easier over time (and it did).

I know this strategy might not work for everyone but for me and my friends, it did because we:

1. Didn't feel alone when we completely bombed leetcode easies
2. Got through a bunch of patterns in leetcode together super fast
3. Sort of mimicked the explanation process during interviews with practice like this

You guys are probably wondering what the final result was:

65 leetcode easies, 76 leetcode mediums, 5 leetcode hards for a total of 146 leetcode questions in about a month. We got offers for FB, Amazon, Google, Uber, Qualtrics, Jump Trading, MSFT, Palantir and a couple others where we took the first 4 for our internships.

TL;DR consider studying in a group! In my opinion its more fun and it can get you through questions just as easily."

The university I'm going to recently gave incoming students access to the job board where internships, part time jobs, and on campus work study positions are posted.

I found a babysitting job near campus I can apply for. It's only for 4 hours a week and pays a few dollars above minimum wage, so I can easily incorporate it into my schedule.

When I told my mom this, she said ""Haha! You're still a child and you're going to babysit another child? How are you going to babysit if you don't even know how to take care of children? You can't babysit if you don't know how to babysit."" She literally laughed at me. The hours are from 5-7 every Monday and Wednesday so my mom also expressed concern for my safety because she thought it was too late in the evening.

She's been this way all my life no matter what I've chosen to do, not that I've been allowed to do much anyway. 

* When I became an assistant teacher (basically a heavily supervised student teacher) for my two favorite science teachers in high school: ""How are you going to teach if you don't know how to teach?"" 

* When I was elected treasurer of my high school's Environmental Club: ""How are you going to be a treasurer if you don't even know how to handle money?"" 

* When I told my mom that I enjoyed picking up recycling as part of my duties for the Environmental Club: ""Why do you want to go around picking up trash?""

I hate it. My mom ruined my self esteem. I have no confidence to try new things. 

I really regret not being more involved in more extracurricular activities in high school. There were some activities and organizations that interested me, but I never joined them because of the fear that my mom instilled in me. She told me that I shouldn't bother trying to do anything because I didn't know how to do it. 

I know that it makes no sense. You try new things so you can get your feet wet and learn how to do what is required of you over time through plenty of mistakes and trial and error. 

I understand that my mom is very fearful of the unknown and overprotective of me. I wish she was encouraging and gave me positive regard. I really want to try new things without feeling like a 5 year old child.

I am going to be studying at a software engineering school that offers a two year program, with a focus on project based learning. It is kind of like a middle ground between a bootcamp and college, with an intensive focus on CS and SE for the two years. I believe that the program will provide me with a sufficient education in CS to enter the job market, as the school has a very good graduate placement rate and there is a substantial amount of media coverage behind it.

My question is, would companies consider my application for an internship if I am studying at this two year program, as opposed to a 4 year college degree. I appreciate that most state ""Must be studying a BSc in Computer Science or related"", but would they be willing to make exceptions if I am clearly prepared for the internship? 

Apologies if this has been asked previously, but I could not find any threads asking exactly these circumstances.

Thanks again!"

My senior year of high school, I feel into a pretty deep depression which eventually led me to seeing a psychiatrist. At the first appointment, my parents were both present (I was a minor at the time), and when the psychiatrist said I had ADHD, my mother openly scoffed at the idea.

I think most of her doubts stemmed from the fact that I was always a straight-A student in high school and college, mostly because math happened to be one of the things that I love and will easily hyperfocus on. English/history/writing took me at least twice as long as my peers, but I had enough anxiety and neuroticism and external pressures to somehow get the work done. What she didn’t get to see was that I was rarely actually paying attention in class and that I would space out about 30 seconds into any conversation.

My psychiatrist ended up prescribing Wellbutrin, since he thought it might help with both problems, and it was good enough for the past four years. It was very effective for my depression, and my ADHD was managed partly by the meds and partly by the fact that I went off to college and was able to pretty much exclusively do math all the time.

More recently, however, I started an internship and found that I once again started to space out 30 seconds into whatever my manager was telling me to do. I told my psychiatrist about this, and he prescribed me Ritalin, which has been helping a lot.

I have no idea how to tell my parents about this. Should I even tell them? Has anyone been through a similar situation or have any advice?"

It was advertised as a junior network admin position but they pretty much just set me up with a client list and threw me to the wolves.  At first I loved it and how much I learned in such a short period of time.  I am very much a self learner.  I am in my mid 30's and just beginning my IT career after the military but I've been doing homelabs and shit since the 90's. 

My first week after a few days shadowing I was sent to deal with a client that got nailed with ransomware.  No proper backups and it was a new client with little documentation.  It was only a small site with two servers and 20ish PCs but I rebuilt the whole thing without any guidance.  The documentation was so jumbled that I just redid everything and got a backup solution in place.

I've been thrown into stuff like this constantly since then.  I seriously don't know how the company exists with a client base that has such f'd up environments.  I've documented the hell out of all of my sites and fixed many of their issues.  I've spent many hours after work on these things just so my visits go more smoothly.  I've implemented PDQ and other things that the company has now adopted.  I can't really point these things out because ""billable hours"" but trying to fix server/network issues while being pelted with password resets and printer issues was driving me crazy. 

With all of the extra hours and how terribly the company is run, I've become burnt out and desperate to get out.  I regularly drive 2 hour morning/evening commutes and another hour over lunch between client sites with only the lunch commute compensated at about $0.20 per mile.  I've put 23k miles on my car since January.  The company pays for no needed tools, I had to buy a laptop, extra hard drives, drive caddies, cables, zip ties, software and pretty much anything I've ever needed at a site.  2 week uncompensated (money or time) on call rotation.  I am done.

I've been looking for a new gig since early May without much luck.  I was having trouble getting the time to interview and recruiters were pushing other MSP positions or $15/hr help desk.  I basically want nothing to do with MSPs ever again.  I actually had to dumb down my job title and some responsibilities because I wasn't getting many offers either due to being over qualified or under, only having 1 year of experience.

I just accepted a position as desktop support at $60k ($10k more than current) and with actual benefits.  I'm now worried that A, I'll be bored out of my mind, and B, it is going to look terrible on my resume so I'd have to continue to dumb it down and just throw all that experience away.  Should I have stuck it out until a higher level job came about or am I just worried about nothing?  I was close to just throwing my hands up and walking out.

i turned 16 last week, me and my family went up to Hershey in Pennsylvania for a few days. it was the most functional we'd been as a family unit in forever. i was so happy, i could finally see a future for myself, and felt like i had my family to support me for the first time in my entire life. of course it didn't last, though. the last leg of our trip home was full of my parents screaming at each other, to the point where we kept nearly crashing and going off the road because my mom was so distracted. 

in that moment, this entire new life that i'd built for myself crumbled. it wasn't really sudden, i've been feeling the depression and anxiety swirling back up inside of me, but i was working so hard. so. fucking. hard. i just wanted to lead a normal life. that's all i ever wanted. but that journey home i realized that that was never going to happen for me.

so i normally get up a lot earlier than the rest of my family. this morning this feeling set in, idk if you could call it paranoia, but i was just sure that my parents were hating on me behind my back. like they didn't really love me, and it was all an act. anyway, my dad left his phone out overnight so i decided to scroll through his messages with my mom. worst decision of my life. turns out for months now all they've been talking about is what a brat i am and how unappreciative i am. my mom called me a bitch. that's the only time i've seen her curse in my entire life, is to call me a bitch. she said that my 'behavior' would be more understandable if i'd been through some sort of hardship in my life, but apparently my life's been nothing but sparkles and rainbows and i'm just a horrible person for no reason.

so to my mom: no hardship? really? don't you remember how dad used to physically throw you around our old apartment? those are my first memories. remember all those nights when you and dad would stay up late into the night screaming at each other? i was laying in my room crying, but you never cared enough to see past your own bullshit and come check on me. and remember my 9th birthday, when you walked out on us and didn't come back until late at night just because my dad got the schedule wrong? that night was the first time i felt truly suicidal. and remember how you completely cut my grandparents out of my life for all those years? when my social anxiety got really bad, they were my only friends in the world. 

anyway, i know my life is great compared to what some people have to go through, so i guess that's another reason why i'm such a piece of shit person. i just thought that i finally had a support system. i thought things were going to be normal. but no, i'm just the family disappointment, always being compared to my perfect angel of a little sister. i'll never be good enough, and i was stupid to ever think that people could love me for who i am. even my therapist spends our whole sessions talking about how i listen to the wrong music, i eat the wrong food, and how my life would be magically better if i could just lose some weight. i don't belong anywhere. i'm a nobody.

so i'm done for. i guess deep down i always knew i was. there's still a part of me that desperately wants to grow up, get my own place, become a pediatric nurse, find my soul mate, and adopt some kids out of the foster care system. but i'm drowning. i'm drowning and i've fought so fucking hard but it's just not meant to be. i don't want to die. i want to grow up and grow old. i want to be happy. i don't want to end it all. but i no longer see any other choice. i'm scared of what i'm going to do to myself. i don't want to die. i'm shaking right now. i've been at war with myself for so long, i thought i was finally winning. but i'm not. i never was.

idk how long i have left. all i know is it's not going to be too very long until i snap. "

2) Work for a reputable company as an embedded developer for 1.5 years and tell them I don't need sponsorship. Then, I can look elsewhere for a company that's willing to sponsor . If I find a good offer, I can ask them to match it, or just leave. 

I can be authorized to work for three years without sponsorship so I'm not sure what to do . What do you guys recommend? Is there anything I'm missing?  If anyone is in the F-1 OPT process as well, what did you guys do ?

94lvvq,10,2018-08-04,"College sophomore curious about engineering, but almost 0 math experience. How should I start, and how do I know if engineering is for me? (long post)",BitterNarwhal,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/94lvvq/college_sophomore_curious_about_engineering_but/,"Long post ahead!

Hi all, I'm currently a sophomore at a very competitive public university, majoring in environmental studies which is a very interdisciplinary degree. As an incoming sophomore, I've started just looking around at internships for next summer and what skills I need to be competitive, and I've noticed a VAST majority of environmental-related internships are for engineering, which has sparked an interest in maybe getting a master's in civil or environmental engineering down the road.

My path now has been total plot twist since graduating high school. In HS, I was told by my teachers and parents that I excelled in English, so I took a bunch of humanities AP's and didn't bother taking anything like AP Bio, Chem, Physics, or Calc. When these classes came around, I took regular bio and chem instead of honors or AP because my HS advisors told me that I should stick to what I was good at, which was English and social sciences, and I was so focused on getting only A's in high school that I didn't want to take a class if there was a chance I could get a B. I also was under the assumption that I was going to double major in English and Psychology and thus saw no need to take stuff like calc and physics. In high school, I was good but not great at math. AP stats was the only advanced math class I took, but I got A's in both Algebra 1 and 2, a B+ in Precalc, and a solid B in AP stats. So I know I'm not a complete idiot at math, but things like calculus are a whole different beast I've never approached before, so I have no idea how I would do in it.

Environmentalism NEVER crossed my mind until I got to college. I took the first class of the Biology sequence at my school and got a solid B in it, which was a decent grade considering it was a weeder class, and was a huge surprise to me since I was so convinced that I wasn't good at science. After taking Bio I went to my advisor to discuss my options about taking Calculus, (which isn't required for my major). My placement test coming into college placed me into Precalc, so I looked into taking that this fall semester at my university, but the average grade is a B-/C+, which... isn't promising. Calc 1 and 2 at my university are the two most failed classes, and my advisor told me that since I don't need it for my major, I should save my GPA and avoid taking it all together, or take it at the local CC which is a few miles from my campus.  So, I looked at taking calc at the CC, and based on my high school ACT math score, I would be placed into College Algebra, then would take Precalc, and then Calc 1, or I'd have to study and take another placement test to see where my level is.

I want to know if I'd be good at engineering, but all of that pretty much depends on how well I do in Calculus, but I don't even know if it's worth it if I have to take 2 (or maybe more) math classes to get myself up to the level of even beginning calculus. I was thinking that if I can get a local internship next summer I could do that and also take a math class at the same time, and slowly work my way up, but is it worth it? I would hate to spend tons of money and two whole semesters taking math classes to prepare me for Calculus, only to finally get to Calc and realize that I absolutely hate it, you know? My other idea is to just sit in on some environmental engineering lectures at my school and see if I find them interesting, but even then that really doesn't get me anywhere since I can't enroll in them because I still don't have the prereqs.

I've looked to see if my local CC has like an intro to engineering course I could take to explore the subject, but they don't have one, so I don't really know what I should do. I'd like to just take a class that introduces the field of engineering broadly just so I could see if it's something I'd be interested in it enough to justify taking all these math classes, but so far I haven't found anything yet. If you discovered engineering later on in life, what did you end up doing about it, and what do you recommend I do??

Lol if you read this whole thing, you're a champ. TL;DR: interested in maybe getting an environmental engineering master's degree, but am several years behind on math and don't know if engineering is for me, and don't know how to go forward."

I have had many internships and co-ops mainly working in hardware development and testing, which is truly my passion and the route I want to take in my future career.

Unfortunately my new job does not have any development really what so ever.  The department mainly works in integration and such.  I jumped into the job because based on the description I got I believed there would be development and lots of hands on Work.  While there is hands on Work it’s not the hands on Work I am used to and enjoy, that is really down to the board and oscilloscope level.

I’m in a really tough spot and don’t really know what to do.  I don’t know have a big blemish on my resume but I also don’t want to fall down a rabbit hole or not doing what I love and cripple my first steps to my future goals.

Has anyone been in a similar situation or have any particular advice?"

I'm about to start Senior year at college, switching to a CS major from Math. Thankfully, I can graduate on time because of the overlap between the two majors at my school. But now I'm in the weird position of having no CS experience whatsoever, just starting my programming courses, and looking for a full-time job at the same time. 

I've had 3 previous internships working in finance companies.

So far I've taken an Intro to Programming course in Java, and am in the middle of doing an Intro to Machine Learning course on Coursera. 

My thinking now is that this ML course might not be the best use of my time, and I should either start preparing for interviews or focus on a project to boost my resume instead of continuing with this course. What steps should I take now to get a full-time software eng job?

Any help at all would be much appreciated."

94mtop,17,2018-08-04,Post-bac career change and job hunt postmortem,landotronic,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/94mtop/postbac_career_change_and_job_hunt_postmortem/,"**TL;DR** New grad with an online post-bac CS degree after career change. Applied to around 280 positions, ended up getting a delayed offer from Amazon, went with an offer from a startup. Went from $55k to $115k in base salary in a little over 2 years.

So I always enjoyed reading other people’s job hunt stories while I was wrapping up my degree and going through the process so I figured I’d throw mine into the mix as well. I also figured since most of the new grad job hunt postmortem threads were for traditional students, I figured it might be nice for those interested in a career change/post-bac route to see my process.

First a little bit of background. I recently completed a post-bac in CS online in May. Before that I worked as a geospatial analyst for an architecture/engineering firm where I used python on an almost daily basis to automate our data cleanup and to conduct analysis. So without further ado, let’s get onto the job hunt!

\[The Job Hunt\]

Near the end of my only summer during my post-bac I figured I better start preparing for the job hunt. I consult the internet like I always do and find r/cscareerquestions. Crap. Looks like I’m super behind. No personal projects, no internship. I’ve got work to do. So I scramble together a few personal projects, and slap together a resume. Looks like major tech companies are going to start accepting application this fall so I try my best to make myself presentable (on paper) and try to leverage my previous work experiences.  Also, my wife and I had a major life change on the horizon, and needed to relocate. We targeted major tech hubs for both of our job hunts.

I start applying to major tech companies and start getting coding challenges. I’m clearly ill prepared for these so I discover places like leetcode, firecode, hackerrank, etc… I shift my focus from school to interview prep. I start doing better on coding challenges, but still struggle with phone screens. More practice. During this time I applied to Amazon for their new grad SDE positions. I ended up doing pretty well on OA1 and OA2, and I ended up with the “easy” onsite. It went really well and I was pretty sure I was going to get an offer. Until pretty much no one got offers…If you were a part of this sub back then, a lot of people were upset that it seemed like headcount changed and they interviewed way too many people.

So I didn’t get the offer. I wasn’t rejected due to performance, and the recruiter let me know that I could apply to standard full time positions if I met the requirements. I took it pretty hard. My first real let down, but it gave me a glimpse that maybe a non-traditional student like myself could someday work at a Big 4.

At this point big tech hiring was wrapping up and the holidays were quickly approaching. These were dark times for me. I sent out TONS of applications with no responses. Coding challenges dried up, and despite a few resume tweaks along the way (and some new personal projects) I wasn’t getting any bites. I almost decided to shelf the whole thing. Just go back to working as a geospatial analyst. Maybe leverage my new found development skills to get a higher salary in that industry.

As the new year rolled around we really needed to settle on a location. We HAD to move somewhere. My wife got a job offer in a medium COL tech hub and we decided to commit. I had zero leads at this point, but we had to take a leap of faith. We budgeted all of our finances on her income (she's in the medical field and can support us if need be). Once we were in the new city around February of 2018 things started to look up. I had a local number, a local address, and started networking with some recruiters at staffing firms that had decent reputations. I also decided to start targeting the startup scene, something I had not been particularly interested in prior. Desperate times call for desperate measures. I started getting call backs and coding challenges again. At least I finally felt like I had options. Coding challenges turned into technical phones screens that turned into onsites. 

Somewhere during this I found an early startup that sounded really neat. The founder was a serial entrepreneur and had some good success in the past, and was leveraging that to jump start this company. The culture seemed aligned with mine so I figured I’d see what their openings were. Nothing on any of the job portals, just a contact email on their site. I “cold call” and send off a cover-letter like email with my resume. Figured I wouldn’t hear anything back. A few days later I get an email response, and a request to set up a call with one of their VP’s. The call goes well and was a mix of background “get to know the candidate/company” questions, technical questions about my resume, and then high level technical/system architecture type questions. He makes the call there on the phone that he wants to bring me onsite for interviews with the lead System Architect, and one of their senior data scientist. The onsite interviews go well, with more technical assessments, some whiteboarding and then another round of system architecture questions. As I leave the VP says that he and the team will review notes and get back to me. 

A week later I get an email that I need to schedule a call with the interim CTO who is currently overseeing hiring of all engineers. I get the call scheduled and then start preparing for salary negotiations. At this point I have yet to hear a single number that would indicate if they intend to pay me peanuts, or a competitive salary. The only preparation I make for this interview is salary prep. I wrote detailed notes on what I wanted to say, then condensed them down to a bulleted list. I rehearsed out loud the various paths the conversation could go a few dozen times over the three days leading up to the call.

The call consisted of more “get to know the candidate/company” type questions, and then went into…salary. I jumped right into what I had been practicing. I tried to sound as confident as possible as I quoted statistics on average salaries, noted major tech company salaries for new grads, and that my previous experience should put me at the high end of new grad salaries. I also brought up that some of the other companies I had been interview at paid low six figures, but never specifically stated a number. He then brings up that at the last company the founder started (where all of upper management came from), they did a 3 month contract to hire period for all employees that the company had no prior engagements with. He framed it as a period where both parties could test the waters to make sure that we were a good fit. My heart sank. All the talk here points to contract to hire as a dead end that never converts to FT. I mention that I was open to idea, but would need some time to discuss with my wife and do additional research. I noted I was aware of the added tax burden contractors face, and he followed with a contract rate should be higher than a salaried rate and said based upon my initial salary conversations he proposed a rate of $60-$70/hr. At least I left the conversation feeling like I could be adequately compensated, but I was still disappointed about the contract to hire portion. 

So that evening I wrote up new justifications for why I’m worth the upper range of the salary with some simple math. Essentially I rehashed why I bring value and then said that everything I’ve read online puts a 1099 rate at least 33% higher than the target FT salary, so my original requested salary of say $105k x 1.33% = $139,650. I then noted that $70 x 40hrs/wk x 50wks/year = $140,000. I used 50 weeks since there is no PTO for a 1099. He seemed agreeable and asked when I could start.

With no other promising leads (only a few scheduled phone screens and one take home), I make some arrangements on start date (which they were really flexible with) and  everything went really well. Everyone is super smart and super friendly. Company culture is great and the office perks are nice. I genuinely enjoy being at work. Maybe I’m just in the honeymoon phase, but really is what I imagined the industry could be like. I’ve been keeping my head down, and busting my butt to do quality work. In the last few months I’ve made meaningful contributions to three projects and learned so much. Every day presents new challenges and I really feel like I’m growing as a developer.

\[Amazon Offer\]

So then about a month or so ago I get an email from Amazon. They want to schedule a call. I had actually already seen a post here on r/cscareerquestions about Amazon reaching back out to people who made it to the final round and offering them a position. So I schedule a call with a pretty good idea that I’d be getting an offer. Turns out I was right, and they list the locations they are sending new grads. Of course the city I just moved to isn’t on the list, even though they have an office here. Ultimately I get slotted for Seattle. I tell them I want to continue the conversation as I speak with my wife about potentially moving AGAIN. I’m not entirely sure how I could turn down Amazon, but I’m also not too sure how I could move across the country, have my wife start the job hunt again, look four housing again, after we had just got settled. I know my contract period is coming to end about in about a month after my offer deadline with Amazon, so I figure I could potentially use it to negotiate a conversion sooner rather than later. It’s my only card.

With the offer letter from Amazon about to expire, I finally decided I can’t take the job. Too many unknowns. I have a decent salary, at job I love, working with great people. Everyone and their mother knows the Amazon reputation (literally my mom and my sister both brought up the potential for Amazon to be a shitty place to work). So I decided I’m going to try and use the offer letter to convert. I wait to officially decline the Amazon offer just in case, and then go into work ready to speak with the new CTO, whom I now know and respect, and have developed a good report with. It might be a little awkward, but this should be a good conversation. 

First thing that morning is a meeting. As I’m walking out of the conference room the CTO pulls me aside and said he needed to talk to me. He grabs a room and smiles and says, “Hey, what do you want your salary to be?” So with a month remaining on my contract and they want to bring me on full time. I say that actually this is a perfect timing, and lead with “this is going to be a good conversation, buuuuut. I actually just got an offer with Amazon.” I follow up with how much I love the company, love the teams, love the projects, and that I want to be here, I just need to know that I’m making the right decision. I note how having Amazon on your resume can really open doors. He asks about their compensation package and I give details on the base, RSUs and sign-on bonus. He says he can’t match that, but he will try. I noted that my contracting rate was based on $105k and that it I’d like to get that as close to Amazon’s total comp as possible, and noted the possibility of bonuses. He said he needs to talk to the CFO, but that he’s sure they can get something together I’d be happy with. Later that day he comes back with base of $115k and a 10% annual bonus paid out at the employment anniversary, so $130k total comp.

So I accepted the offer, and can now get off my wife’s health insurance (saving an addition $300/mo or $3600/yr). The Amazon comp would be better in terms of RSU’s **IF** I could make to vesting. The claw-back clauses on the bonuses and relocation assistance also made me nervous.  The cost of living in Seattle is also much higher, so in the end, I’m happy where this journey took me.

A little over two years ago I was working as a geospatial analyst making $55k/year, and now I’m actually doing what I love for twice the annual salary. 

None of this would have been possible without this sub. The amount of knowledge gained for every step of the way (from school advice, to interview prep, to salary negation) was truly amazing. Sure, sometimes this sub got me down, made me feel like I wasn’t smart enough or good enough to get a job, but in the end it was this sub that got me to where I am today. Let me know if anyone has any questions on my previous career, the post-bac, resume/personal projects, the job hunt, etc… and I’ll do my best to answer them.

Oh, and good luck to those who are about to start the 2019 job hunt! The Big N companies will start opening up the application process soon! You guys (and gals) can do it! Just try stay positive and keep sending out those resumes and practicing those interview questions!

Cheers!"

I'm currently an undergraduate computer science student, and I'm currently looking for internships. I have no previous internship experience, so I'm trying my best to create a resume that will get me interviews and job offers. I appreciate any help that you may provide.

94oyb2,1,2018-08-04,23 and feel like I'm having a quarter life crisis. Math major who can't find a job. Don't know what my next steps are,Shuai_Nerd,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/94oyb2/23_and_feel_like_im_having_a_quarter_life_crisis/,"You can skip to below the horizontal line--the ""life crisis"" part isn't until after the line, the following is just background about myself.

I graduated as an Applied Math major over a year ago. Job prospects haven't been that great and doing contract work making educational math videos and tutoring on the side, living with parents so not paying rent (saving money in the meanwhile) while helping pay for bills. All of my work experience has pretty much been teaching or tutoring, but I don't see myself becoming a teacher. Everything I learned in undergrad is just too vague/broad to be applied practically and I think I need to go back to school, take some bootcamp, classes, or something because I feel like I wasted my time and money getting a math degree, but more than that, I wasted my opportunity in college to do internships and network (only ever just tutoring), so I feel pidgeonholed doing nothing else but education-related jobs that don't pay well at all.

I've ran through different possibilities for what I need to do next and to be honest am hitting dead ends for some reason or another:

- Go back to school in something practical like CS or engineering. I had a good GPA, but no relevant experience (whether for finance/CS/engineering), but don't see how I can get letters of recs to do so.

- Go to a programming bootcamp. I've always regretted not getting into CS like my peers during school; many of them landed solid jobs after graduating and here I am sitting not knowing what to do. Bootcamp seems like a good way to bridge the knowledge gap, but in the end I'm still competing for positions that CS majors also want.

- Try to become an actuary. However I've read that the entry level market is VERY saturated--so many newcomers wanting what can only be so many positions. And these newcomers are in much better shape than I, likely to have passed 2-3 exams in college with relevant internship experience. Whereas I have nothing, even if I sit myself and take to passing 2-3 exams, that's not enough to make up for my zero experience.

---------

I just came back from a trip abroad and after running through those options, I decided I don't want to settle in the US. At least not for some time. I get so depressed thinking about work, and even hearing my friends' plans about staying with their company for X years, saving for retirement etc just makes me even more depressed. Just, ""is that it? Is that all there is to life?"" I know it sounds like a spoiled dream and impractical fantasy, but I want to live and work abroad, especially in Asia (I'm Chinese-American if that's relevant) if possible. Being able to work for a good company as an expat in Asia sounds like the dream. Though I know the most practical option is to just settle for a job in the US, work and save vacation days and do so through there, but I guess I have to figure out what I want to do first.

I know I mentioned not seeing myself as a teacher, but in regards the above I've been considering the TEFL step and getting certified to teach English abroad, though it sounds like I'll be closing a lot of doors that way. People who have done it say it's difficult to relocate/settle back in the US for a job, since it's always just going from company to company and not paying that well either (not the most 'prestigious' or practical experience). But pay is secondary to me at this point, as long as I can be comfortable. I guess I just want to be at least semi-reasonable about my long-term future.

Lastly and unrelated to the career aspect that has made up the majority of this post, I just found out I have type 2 diabetes. And discovered it kind of late, where I'm undergoing diabetic neuropathy (nerves beginning to get damaged/die). My toes have begun to feel numb and that's what prompted me to check it out. It's to a mild extent and not affecting me too much and can be staved if I just begin to watch my diet now. But it's just another factor that's adding to this gloom/depression, and I'm wondering if that would kill my dream for being able to work or live abroad.

My head has been numb from thinking so much the past few days. I feel like a combination of restlessness from overthinking, depression about the past, anxiety about the future has just not not been good for my mental health. Combined with the recent diagnosis, even if for a common condition many people deal with and manage, I'm in this state of suspension where my life has halted and I'm just going through the motions of work and thinking but not really being serious about what I want to do. I'm an indecisive person by nature and I guess just have a lot of self-doubt. I don't think I have what it takes for anything I want to do, if I can even decide what I want to do. 

This post was really messy and didn't really have a direction but I guess I just needed to vent. I've been keeping these thoughts bottled in all day and typing it out helps. So I don't really have any expectations on what kind of responses, whether advice, shared experience, or whatnot, but if you read all of this, thanks for reading."

Any advice helps.,madkracker84,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/94pwjh/in_the_middle_of_a_computer_science_degree_with/,Im in my early 30s and just started in my junior year of a bachelor's in computer science. As the title says I don't have much hands on experience in CS other than basic function and knowledge. CS is something I'm interested in and that's why I chose to do that as a career. Growing up my parents were basically anti tech so that may fuel my interest but didn't help give me any head starts. Is there any advice going into these fields that would help? Or a field in CS that's easier on less experienced people? My fear is graduating or starting an internship and feeling like I know nothing. I want confidence going in that I can do the job and not have to fake it. I know school helps but from what I've heard it's the hands on experience that's more valuable. 
94q17f,4,2018-08-05,Did I choose the wrong school?,confusedthrowaway60,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/94q17f/did_i_choose_the_wrong_school/,"So, I also posted this on r/UGA but I wanted to post it here too for different points of view.

I’m a freshman going to GT in the fall, and even after attending FASET (orientation), I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve chosen the wrong school. My two main choices for college were GT and UGA, and I chose GT because of the location, rankings, and opportunities it would bring. Don’t get me wrong, I love GT and I think it’s an amazing school. But I also love UGA, and needed advice about transferring. Initially, I had said yes to GT and UGA but ended up only paying the commitment deposit to GT. I contacted the UGA department of admissions back in May (after the commitment deadline) because I was having these same feelings and explained that I’d like to enroll after all. They told me that I couldn’t enroll as there were no spots left, and my only option was to transfer in during Summer/Fall 2019 or later. I was planning on spending a year at GT, and if I didn’t like it, I could transfer. This would be fine with me other than the fact that I probably won’t be able to find a great consistent group of friends at UGA since I would be missing out on the freshman experience and most other 2nd years would already have a group. I’d also have to get used to a new campus and location. I tried searching for others who have posted about transferring to UGA from GT but it seems like most people only try and do it the other way around. I thought going to orientation would make me sure in my decision and I’d definitely love it, but I still have a feeling I chose the wrong place. There were some moments that made me love it, like seeing Atlanta (I love cities and atl is a big plus). The campus is beautiful and the people I met were super nice too.

In terms of academics, I’m not set on what I want to do. I’m very heavily leaning towards pre-med right now, but at GT I’d want to major in IE and concentrate in econ because I genuinely love learning about those subjects. I’m also considering neuroscience at GT, because if I transferred to UGA then I’d be interested in their cognitive science major or their double dawgs program. UGA would definitely be better in terms of credits and graduating on time since some of my ap scores aren’t accepted at GT and would be at UGA. I’ve also read that UGA would be better for grad school/med school admissions, because it would be slightly easier to make a higher gpa. GT is noticeable better in terms of opportunities though, and the networking and internship connections are unmatched. It wouldn’t be impossible to make it into a med school from GT either.

I also might be biased because my best friend is going to be a 2nd year there, and I’ve remained close with her and seen her experience at UGA almost first-hand. I don’t know anyone that well at GT and so I can’t speak to the experience there. Transferring would also allow me to stay close to her (but that’s not the biggest factor in my decision).

In short:

Reasons to stay at GT

1. I may end up loving it (I can only see after I actually go there though lol)
2. Atlanta is amazing and there way more things to do (I already bought tickets for so many concerts and events)
3. Tech’s academics and opportunities are unmatched, the possible alumni connections, and the fact that I know I would graduate with a good job if med school doesn’t pan out.
4. I loved the people I met at FASET (a lot of them were like me)
5. Tech's culture of innovation and their dedication to it is amazing
6. Not many people transfer out of GT, or if they do, it's because they couldn't handle the academics. I talked to a current CS major there and he said that most people would not want to leave schools. But I've seen many people want to transfer out of UGA
7. Rankings don't matter much IMO, but tech is ranked really highly in every ranking out there, it's truly among the world's best universities and carries more prestige. I'm not sure how if it would be important in med school admissions though.

Reasons to transfer to UGA

1. Could be easier to get into med school (more specific and dedicated pre-health program and easier to get a higher gpa)
2. Seeing my best friend’s experience assured me that I’d have a good time there. I'd also get to be close to her and another close friend who is transferring.
3. Most UGA grads find a good job after graduation too, and UGA produces many Rhodes/Fulbright/etc Scholars, so it's a school where people can achieve a lot if they want to
4. UGA athletics
5. I know some people at UGA already through my friend, and all of them seem like great people that I’d get along with
6. This might be something small, but UGA's dining, dorms, and parking/transportation services seem to be way better than Tech's. This is what I've gauged from the two schools' subreddits and my friend.
7. It's way easier to get other classes in different fields/majors there. Registering at FASET was hell because most classes are major restricted and I want to explore other areas. And UGA has a bigger variety of classes and fields to choose from.  This is really important to me because I love the humanities just as much as I love STEM.

TL;DR: I’m going to GT but also love UGA. If I don’t like GT I could transfer but I don’t know if I could make a solid group of friends at UGA as a transfer and there’s certain things I love about GT too. Any thoughts, opinions, stories of others in the same situation are appreciated. Thanks :)"

Nothing good will come out of it.

 There are a lot of factors that go into finding an engineering job and there are way too many engineering jobs anyway. Barely anyone will give a shit about your age if he doesnt discover that there are gap years. Get a good GPA, do some internships and projects if possible. There are much more going into a resume than just your age.

 Saying this because i see a lot of people of this age range in here being anxious about it. It would a shame if needless anxiety takes over because an engineering uni needs mental fortitude to be finished

Apologies for the wall of text ahead!

Background: I moved fields a lot in my 20s, went back, did a masters and then was stuck in a series of temp jobs, freelance work and unpaid internships for a while after I finished. 

Managed to get a part time entry level job where I quickly took on responsibilities way beyond my job description due to my past experience. Spent a year on a part-time, hourly paid contract - a good part of this time spent fighting to move to a full time role and a salary equivalent to the responsibilities I had.

Then in the last year, due to changes in the company, my career skyrocketed. I got several promotions, I’m now currently head of a department.

For each of those promotions, I still had to fight. To be paid closer to market rate, to have my level of responsibility acknowledged. E.g. they set up a new department, I was the most senior member, they were not recruiting anyone to lead it. But it took months of pushing for them to acknowledge they had effectively made me head of the department  and give me a corresponding title change and pay rise.

Now I’m in a good position, making decent money and my input and skills are valued and acknowledged. I love my co-workers, the work is interesting, I’m in a position to make concrete change and I’m getting extremely valuable experience.

BUT I am so tired. I don’t know if I can keep doing this. I’ve had to work every holiday I’ve taken in the last year. My inbox has so many unread emails and I have about 200 tasks pending action. I have a team but they have all been hired in the last year, lack experience and still need considerable training (I work in a niche field - experienced employees are hard to come by). 

The last few times I’ve spoken to my manger about this it has been non-committal and it seems like getting more resources is going to be another big battle. And I am just done fighting.

If anyone has advice, I would really welcome it.

Edit: some details."

I need help finding matches, reaches and safeties, while accounting for a likely bump in testing scores. My maths is normally good idk why my SAT ones are low.


Stats:

1440 SAT first try(730/710), retaking in october hoping for something 1500+ which I feel is likely with superscoring especially

790 physics, 730 Math 1, gonna take math 2 in november, assume I can do well here if I study.

4.0 UW GPA, I also take a full IB curriculum and will graduate with both turkish and IB(38-40) diplomas(school doesnt report weighted gpa for some reason)


ECs:

-Started school's FRC club, was programming president, won a 6k$ award which took us to a regional and won the regional as the team's driver, taking us to world championships. This didnt continue into 11th grade because the school didnt allow us.

-Made and released 2(google play+steam) video games, third will be coming out before summer ends, also on GP.

-Did MUN and english debate for two years, did MGE for three years where I was the club president last year and the head of the conference hosted by the club. Also about 4 MUN awards for beong best delegate and 2 for outstanding and honorable mentions.

-Did a paid internship at a big local tech company.


Extra(where do I put this):

-I can speak german, turkish and english and know three programming languages(c#, Java, python) pretty well.


So yeah. I feel that I've got a great pack of EC's and a good GPA(and IB) pulling my testing scores, there is also the problem that I'm applying for CS but currently the reason my scores are low is because of maths sections. 


My dream school is MIT and I've researched a lot of schools in thw 1200-1500 SAT band. The problem is I can't judge where to apply to exactly because of the fact I'm and international and need a scholarship(and most of these are need aware/merit based schools)

I'm a engineering student and I've been using an old powerhouse laptop for the past few years. It's quite good, I replaced the HDD with an SSD and all that, but it's starting to get a little bit dated. I've been working with some relatively large CAD files lately and my laptop has not been able to keep up.  I recently finished an internship and I thought I treat myself a little for the work I did.

I'm thinking maybe a budget of maybe around $1500. It's time I should build a workhorse to do the heavy lifting, but this is my first time building a PC and I'm not that knowledgeable about it, so I thought I'd come here.

I like to get a 4K monitor, mainly because I do a fair amount of media production stuff in 4K and I'd love to actually be able to see what I'm working with, among other reasons. To me that's more important than 144Hz. I'm not a huge PC gamer, so I wouldn't be bothered by downsampling to 1080p or 1440p for a smooth 60fps and I wouldn't really be bothered too much I suppose.

I also currently have a secondary 1080p monitor for my laptop. Suppose I want to hook up the 1080p laptop as a secondary monitor to the 4k one, maybe I got too many chrome tabs open. Is that advised or will be dealing with things like scaling issues and all that stuff?

For the SSD I could just take the one in my laptop and use it, but is the money for an NVMe SSD worth it? After that I'll take my old HDD and use it for extra storage. I've never had an SSD and a HDD in the same system before. Anything I should be aware of?

For graphics maybe a GTX 1080? I've heard a lot of good things about but, my knowledge in graphics cards is a bit lacking. Again, gaming isn't the biggest priority here, I feel like CAD will be the most going forward, but also things such as rendering things is a bit important to me.

As for the other parts I think I know what I'll go for, and when I create a definitive list I'll work out something out on [pcpartpicker.com](https://pcpartpicker.com).

Thanks."

--

**Background**

I'm a Software Engineer (a few years graduated), working at a respectable SV-based tech company doing server-side application development. Prior to this I did some data engineering full-time and some web backend in my internships.

--

**Problem**

I've quickly grown bored of ""product"" development and have learned that it's not the type of software I find enjoyable. Some people get excited shipping new customer-facing product features. I do not.

--

**Interests**

In general, I think my interests tend towards systems and infrastructure. I say *think* because I haven't had a good chance to *actually* work on these things (no internships and the related courses in undergrad were taught poorly).

--

But, I do know that some of the things I've found most intersting are those I learn from fighting fires while oncall (eg. database issues or API latency) or improving some part of our application infrastructure (eg. pub/sub, job queue systems, etc.).

^(Though, maybe systems is too low-level and I just like application level infrastructure and reliability type stuff.)

--

**Job Search Failure**

I tried applying to some systems/infra jobs late last year, but had little luck getting past recruiters due to limited work experience.

--

**Next Steps**

I switched gears and started doing a bit of self-study on the side, in addition to trying to get closer to these things at my current job.

I recently read a lightweight intro to OS textbook to refresh what I learned in school. More topics on the backlog I'd like to dig into are networking, distributed systems, database systems, and more deeply into operating systems.

--

**Dilemma**

I'm now stuck in a loop where I continually postpone applying to new positions because:

1. I know what I don't like
2. I know I don't have systems/infra experience, so I should self-study before interviewing
3. I don't have the experience to say which of the above topics I'd like to actually work on (and therefore self-study)
4. I feel like to make a decision I'd need to study them all, then
5. I don't make much progress because that's daunting and would take many months of study (and it all feels very uncertain)
6. And because I spend too much time researching the types of jobs out there (seeing if by job description rather than by topic, something stands out)
7. I also flip back and forth between ""I need to study this topic"" and ""I need to prep for interviews""

--

I've gone so far as to consider quitting my job outright to focus on self-study and figuring out what I want to do.

--

**Halp?**

Are there jobs that might help me gain the experience to decide where to specialize (like, a general systems/infra job) *and* hire entry-level people? ^(I seem to find that companies welcome interns to infra teams but there seems to be a lack of entry-level full-time listings.)

Would an SRE/Production Engineer position maybe fit the bill?


--

Sadly, I don't know what kind of advice I'm really looking for; it was kind of cathartic just writing it out. But even hearing others' success stories or advice from interviewers / hiring managers / experienced engineers / recruiters would be useful.

I have done some php, but hate it. I might look into other alternatives.  My plan was to learn and practice more with Javascript and continuing improving with solving algorithms until I get hired. I have done one internship. Also, besides my class projects, I do not have any personal projects. Will this adversely impact my job prospects? Any advice will be greatly appreciated."

I will probably try to take more assignments on in next 2-3 weeks and then bring up the topic in a conversation with the manager!"

I know it is almost impossible to get one as a Freshman so i wanted to ask you if i could get one as a consultant, i have made a 2 year course here in Spain that is what everyone does in order to work at companies like Accenture.

At sophomore i would try to intern in a CS related job.

I didn't say any US city or state cause im willing to go everywhere, i would like to go to places like Seattle or the Bay Area to know how a suburbs city works though.

Thanks a lot and i am sorry if this was already answered but i only found US citizens asking about going to Europe."

I'm working as a Software Engineer at a very small startup (\~20 devs and a handful of sales). We are working with very cutting edge tech (Docker, Kubernetes, Golang, etc.) and we move very fast.

I don't have any previous internship experience and this lack of perspective is really setting me back. Furthermore, the company doesn't have any sort of onboarding programs or training for new employees, much less new grads/juniors. My initial manager had a very hands-off approach: I only received guidance and feedback when I asked for it. What's worse is that she never set any expectations for me - even when I asked what they were. Over the past few months I've reached out to other senior engineers on the team for guidance which has been helpful but nowhere near the support I need to kickstart my career.

A few weeks ago, one of the founders of the company took over as my manager and has been providing more hands-on guidance and feedback. However, he is unhappy with the speed at which I accomplish tasks and would rather have me pair with another engineer on the team to get it out the door than for me to spend the extra time learning about the feature or tech behind it.

I don't feel like I'm learning anything here. Have any of you been in this situation? If so, what did you do? I'm looking to apply for New Grad roles at larger companies as I don't think five months really counts as 'industry experience'. "

After freshman year, I would apply to internships and get rejected upfront a lot, but occasionally got an interview. I ended up bombing my initial ones. I think the main drawback was my work experience and project experience: I had very few projects and couldn't really say anything about my prior internship experience other than ""I stored phone numbers in excel"". I ended up removing that internship from my resume and filling my resume instead with more projects; this helped me more in interviews because I was able to talk passionately about the projects and I didn't get hung up on trying to present work experience in a glorified manner. Although I think this helped me with interviews, I still wasn't able to get an internship my sophomore and junior years. 

I am planning to apply for the Masters program at my university, but I'm also looking for jobs/internships and think my chances are starting to dwindle now that I'm a senior with little to no relevant work experience. I've spent the past summer trying out new projects and working on technical interview stuff, but I feel at a disadvantage when I hear of my other peers talking about how they've interned at Google or Amazon and that it's impossible to get a job if you haven't interned previously.

94xymj,2,2018-08-05,What career options exist with a writing component?,nitekite345,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/94xymj/what_career_options_exist_with_a_writing_component/,"I’m entering my junior year of college and I’m worrying about not having a specific career path I’m pursuing.  I want to make more targeted choices towards achieving success in a field. 

Career services have been largely unhelpful so far. 

The biggest thing is, **I’m looking for jobs centered around writing.** Creatively, journalistically, I’m open to anything at this point. 

I worked a PA job in a film production office this summer —  “I’m looking for a job centered around writing.” went right over career service’ heads — It was 12 hour shifts 5 days a week, plus regular overtime. We had no breaks except a 20 minute lunch, and we were expected to cut that short if we were running busy (which was almost every day.)

It really put the fear of God in me about doing my best to not get stuck in a high stress-low pay position if I can help it. I want to plan carefully, not only to be financially secure, but to enjoy my day-to-day activities. 

The big problem is, I’m just not sure what’s out there. My mother is a middle manager at the corporate level of a chain of gas station convenience stores and my father works at a utilities plant and occasionally drives for uber. 

My siblings are younger than I am and don’t really know what they want to do either. 

I want to use these invaluable few years while I’m still in school to try out temp jobs and internships, shadow professionals, network with student organizations, use my school’s resources, and most importantly, pick up another major if need be. 

I don’t want to get stuck in a miserable job due to poor planning. If anybody could suggest some jobs that mainly consist of writing, I’d be deeply appreciative. 

Bonus question - how many relevant new career options would open up to me if I learned a second language? I have the opportunity to do so while I’m here, and if it would be worthwhile, I want to get started right away. 

I’ve provided some information on my background below. Thank you so much in advance. 

*EDUCATION*

• I’m a couple classes away from completing a religious studies degree and I’m on track to graduate with the highest honors my school awards (I picked the subject because it’s something I’m passionate about, but realizing there is no clear connection between it and any jobs outside of academia contributed to this concern.) 

• I have 1/3 of the credits for a comparative literature degree, but many of them could easily be applied to an English degree. 

• I’m at a solidly good state school (the one in my state, that I could best afford). Definitely better known for its graduate programs than undergrad, but respected across the country none the less.  

• I’m not at all opposed to the idea of going back to school for a masters degree, but in all likelihood I’d have to work for a few years in between. (And have a clearer idea of what I’m doing with my life.) 

*PREVIOUS WORK/WRITING EXPERIENCE* 

• Part time waitressing/babysitting in high school 

• Contributed to newspaper in high school 

• Editor and regular columnist in university’s journal of politics and economics 

• Columnist in university’s humor magazine

• Co-authored paper in philosophy journal with professor and two other students 

• Paper awarded school’s first place religious studies prize by college 

• Freshman summer: Worked as bagger/stock girl in supermarket (thanks, career services) 

• Sophomore summer: Film PA 2 months 

*GENERAL HOPES FOR CAREER*

• A job where I could work from home some or most of the time would be *glorious*. A lesser alternative would be a job that takes me different places. I don’t like being cooped up in a small dark space all day if it can be helped. 

• I’m in middle America right now, but don’t care where I live. I worked in a big city this summer and am comfortable relocating anywhere. The cost of living is probably the lowest in an area like where I am now, but there are probably fewer opportunities, too. 

• I like being inside. A job where I’m outside all day wouldn’t be for me (for example, a mail carrier.) 

• I’m the kind of person who would rather spend three hours reading, writing, or researching a topic than ten minutes building/repairing something or working my way through a logistical task (I barely passed the standard core mathematics course and I was the top student in a senior honors English seminar my freshman year. My strengths and weaknesses aren’t subtle, I have to stay in my lane.) 

• I would be willing to sacrifice salary grade if I were able to work mostly from home. 

*tl;dr: I’m in my junior year of college and want to use these last two years to make sure I graduate into a secure job that I’m happy to wake up for every day. I’d ideally like the main function to be writing (whether it’s creatively, journalistically, I’m open to anything.) I’d appreciate some suggestions of what kinds of career options are out there for an undergraduate in writing.*"
94yo74,0,2018-08-06,I kinda gave up on programming after graduating at 22 years old to pursue art but 2 years later I'm thinking of coming back.,kaze_ni_naru,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/94yo74/i_kinda_gave_up_on_programming_after_graduating/,"I get that every career is difficult but right now being a software engineer just seems too good to pass up. I kinda ""gave up"" on it because I wanted to pursue my passion in art/animation. But I guess 2 years into it I realize that pursuing your hobby doesn't always guarantee you'd enjoy the actual job. It kinda fills me with dread to think about my future with art, because I have to live in LA for the most part and it's not exactly a city I like, and I'd have less financial freedom. 

So I'm thinking of going back to programming, which will pay better and allow for more career options especially in terms of where I can live. Right now I'm 24, have a Computer Science BS degree from state uni, proficient with vim and can pretty much learn anything at this point. I'm only playing with this idea right now and I'm not sure if I'm ready to go back.

 So I guess my questions are, 

1) How screwed am I in terms of employment if I do go back to things (I don't have prior work experience other than an internship with a professor from 3 years ago)

2) What's the best way to get back into the groove of things and build up my resume. I figure it’ll be spam my resume with cool projects and stuff.

3) Is it okay to do this in the long run if I'm simply doing it for work?

4) How good is a db admin job? I found out I actually like SQL and backend programming quite a bit. I used to care for exciting jobs in front end but right now I'd rather do backend I think."

Since I want to get back into programming I thought this might be a good refresher or something. I've done programming over 4 years at a 'IT-school' (let's keep it simple here) and finished with an internship as IT-Supporter.  My experience is limited though, I only had some of the basics in C# and some of the advanced stuff in Java and PHP. Over two weeks we installed a test cross-road what seemed to be assembler, but I'm not quite sure about it now, but in the end it did exactly what the fan did.

It's all a while back so my memory is rather rusted, but I could see spending some free time getting back into programming.

But first, would it even be possible to 'reprogram' this usb-fan? Is there a way to get to the code that does the blinking series of the LED ?

**some background:
**

I am 30 years old and was the last five years self employed. I started an IT firm for 1st-Level-Support and developed software.

Created websites with CMS or have done any software projects I could realize in Python.

I manage some server (windows and linux) and I am responsible for over 100 TB of data for another company which scrapes web shops like Amazon, Ebay, etc. (I even wrote the tool which runs on another linux server)

Before the self employed I was working as an intern for a software company - (1st Level Support) - I have no degree except high school.

**The situation:
**

Well, I have found my SO and we want to create a family, but I can not do that while I am working self employed, because I spent far too much time into my firm just to stay alive at the end of the year. Also there is not enough money to support a family.

So I want to get a 'normal' job again to have more time and save some money for my family.

My income per year was nearly ~ 25.000 $. It is not much, but it was my own work and I was happy.

**My plan:
**

Get a decent IT job, save money and maybe getting a bachelor degree in the meantime. I do not have to work on weekends or public holidays anymore. So much more time.

I live in a very big city in Germany and lot of firms are searching for Allround IT guys - So I assume my skills are more than good enough for those jobs, but I do not know how high I can set my salary.

At the moment I want a minimum ~ 37.000 $ per year. I compared a lot of wages for 1st Level Support Guys in my area (They get the least salary to be honest, because you do not need any 'special' degree. Their average is ~ 35.000 $ for their first work year and ~42.000+ after three work years)

**My problem:
**

I do not know if my salary is acceptable, should I demand more or less? I guess I start low and hopefully get a raise after certain time, if not then I change the firm. But for my first step into the normal work life this plan should work?

Does anyone had a similar situation and can give me some hints?"

Doesn't matter what file, we has some very old Macro-Enabled files that are part of a workflow (Yes...

Any Excel build 1806 from what I can tell or older is perfectly fine. My intern solution is to have users re-save the files as XLSX files which are fine, or in some cases remove Office, reinstall from a ISO for 1802 I have, and disable updates.

I'm from Germany, almost 20 years old, and graduated high school in March. I did my senior year twice because I couldn't finish it the first time due to a really bad depressive episode. Went on Zoloft (January 2017) and things got better. My initial post graduation plan was to go to Houston where my grandmother lives and spend a few months there. I have dual citizenship so getting a job (at Taco Bell or whatever) wouldn't have been a problem. I know it sounds weird but my entire life I've wanted nothing more than to live in Houston, at least for a little while. Whenever I'm there I feel amazing and going back home is awful every time.

My plans changed when my parents decided to sell our house in February. I grew up here and love our garden and wanted to spend one last summer appreciating it as we will be moving to an apartment in a pretty nasty area with no garden in October. I figured I'd just go to Houston November to April so I can come back when the weather is nice in Germany because I really hate the winter. Just thinking about it makes me very anxious. 

The problem is that I still don't have a plan as to what exactly I'd be doing in Houston. My grandma lives in a nursing home about half an hour away from her old house (where I would be staying) and I have no other family there. I would have to buy a car and then sell it when I leave, which I guess wouldn't be a problem for anyone else but seems like a huge task to me. I'm extremely easily discouraged. Also, my parents are zero supportive of my ideas. My dad hates his family, he hates being in Houston, and my sister and I were never able to establish a real relationship with our grandparents because he would throw a huge temper tantrum whenever we spoke to them on the phone. Finally after his father died he started talking to his mother again after 20+ years because he's an only child and she has dementia and someone needed to organize the move from her home to the old folks facility.

I've told my mother about twenty times now that I really, REALLY don't want to go to university this year and she acts like it's a huge surprise every time. We fight, then she acts supportive for a few days, and then she freaks out again and calls me a loser or a slob or a disgrace. If I had a convincing plan I could maybe win over my father but he usually just mocks my ideas. He says the house is basically inhabitable (which is a huge lie) and I would just be lazing around. Me staying in Texas is a touchy subject anyway because he never taught me any English (I taught myself though and would say I have a very convincing accent) and apparently thinks it's hilarious that I'm ""sooo German"" and don't belong there at all. And tbh I really don't know what I'd do there. I have no aspirations to do an internship or get a job. I have no aspirations in general, period. What I do have though is a $20k inheritance from my grandfather that I'm free to spend anytime. On a car in Texas for instance.

So, to bring this to an end, I accepted an offer from a local university to start studying psychology in four weeks. Psychology is not easy to get into because you need really good grades and I'm scared they wouldn't accept me again next year. But the thought of dragging through another year of going to school when it's pitch black and freezing outside makes me cry. I do want to study psychology and if I went to Houston now, I'd be back to square one next year because Germany is a cold country, the semester starts in the fall, and that won't suddenly change. My idea was to start college and visit my grandmother during the break in January. Also, the earlier I start, the sooner I can apply for a semester in the states. In Germany ""gap years"" are very popular though and I feel like everyone and their dog are living it up in Australia or south east Asia or wherever and the general consensus seems to be ""Travel now or you'll never get another chance!!!"" Might sound extreme but you do hear that a lot around here.

Anyway, I don't know what to do. By the looks of it, probably college. But I just have this massive lump in my throat and feel like my life is over, which I know is hilariously dramatic of me to say and definitely not true but that's just how I feel."

(reposting because this didn't get any responses yesterday and I'm a bit stressed out right now).

--

**Background**

I'm a Software Engineer (a few years graduated), working at a respectable SV-based tech company doing server-side application development. Prior to this I did some data engineering full-time and some web backend in my internships.

--

**Problem**

I've quickly grown bored of ""product"" development and have learned that it's not the type of software I find enjoyable. Some people get excited shipping new customer-facing product features. I do not.

--

**Interests**

In general, I think my interests tend towards systems and infrastructure. I say *think* because I haven't had a good chance to *actually* work on these things (no internships and the related courses in undergrad were taught poorly).

--

But, I do know that some of the things I've found most intersting are those I learn from fighting fires while oncall (eg. database issues or API latency) or improving some part of our application infrastructure (eg. pub/sub, job queue systems, etc.).

^(Though, maybe systems is too low-level and I just like application level infrastructure and reliability type stuff.)

--

**Job Search Failure**

I tried applying to some systems/infra jobs late last year, but had little luck getting past recruiters due to limited work experience.

--

**Next Steps**

I switched gears and started doing a bit of self-study on the side, in addition to trying to get closer to these things at my current job.

I recently read a lightweight intro to OS textbook to refresh what I learned in school. More topics on the backlog I'd like to dig into are networking, distributed systems, database systems, and more deeply into operating systems.

--

**Dilemma**

I'm now stuck in a loop where I continually postpone applying to new positions because:

1. I know what I don't like
2. I know I don't have systems/infra experience, so I should self-study before interviewing
3. I don't have the experience to say which of the above topics I'd like to actually work on (and therefore self-study)
4. I feel like to make a decision I'd need to study them all, then
5. I don't make much progress because that's daunting and would take many months of study (and it all feels very uncertain)
6. And because I spend too much time researching the types of jobs out there (seeing if by job description rather than by topic, something stands out)
7. I also flip back and forth between ""I need to study this topic"" and ""I need to prep for interviews""

--

I've gone so far as to consider quitting my job outright to focus on self-study and figuring out what I want to do.

--

**Halp?**

Are there jobs that might help me gain the experience to decide where to specialize (like, a general systems/infra job) *and* hire entry-level people? ^(I seem to find that companies welcome interns to infra teams but there seems to be a lack of entry-level full-time listings.)

Would an SRE/Production Engineer position maybe fit the bill?


--

Sadly, I don't know what kind of advice I'm really looking for; it was kind of cathartic just writing it out. But even hearing others' success stories or advice from interviewers / hiring managers / experienced engineers / recruiters would be useful.

Today: How not to support.


Everything written happened a few years ago and I have left behind the workplace for (somehow related) other reasons. 
The first part can be found [here](https://reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/91ifcg/the_cabinet_of_horrors_part_i_discoveries/).


The second part can be found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/92ctmv/the_cabinet_of_horros_part_ii_the_cleaners/).


After the hassle and subsequent crowding of the $boss's office with old prototypes everything was back to normal. The old server did indeed serve. The co-workers were pleased with a set of second monitors (seriously, who is still programming with only one [not ultra wide]?). The interns did their best to get rid of the corporate junk and I could start working again and finished a cost sheet for the new server and installations.


Monday morning before my first tea my company provided phone rings. Nobody would ever call that since I am quite new. On the display some weird foreign number. Preparing to waste time of a scammer I picked it up:


&gt; Hello, this is Luesterklemme from $company, how can I help you on this fine Monday morning?


&gt; Hello, this is $supportingPerson (SP) from you soon to be parent parent company. We will be doing your IT support from now on.


&gt; Oh, nice. I didn't know we were bought. Sounds good, so I can be an engineer again. What do you need of me and when will you start here?


&gt; I will need all the passwords for the network equipment and servers. You don't need to do anything. And what do you mean start? I started already.


&gt; I mean like on premise. In this office. In person.


&gt; Yeah I won't be doing that. We will support you remotely.


&gt; Ok, I think we might run into problems here. This office needs new stuff installed and I can think of a dozent things that can and will go wrong that needs somebody to interact with the problem physically. In the case you don't have the power of telekinesis I am pretty much in doubt.


&gt; Leave that to us. We are professionaly and you are not the first office we are supporting. 


&gt; *metaphorical jazz hands*


After that weird call I got and email matching the name from the phone with a corporate provided email adress. Huh? No scam? Somebody must be playing a joke? Not the first of April either. Shouting to boss he denies any involvment and confirms the buy out story. My week was going to get intersting again but not in a good way. 


So you might suspect where this is going. In this first week the Eldritch Gods tried to purge all sanity from the office. Not only did I lose all the admin accesses (at least officially, of course I made spare accounts beforehand and nobody bothered to check...), the server project got pushed back and as the icing on the Cthulu shaped cake that little Linux server was abruptly shut down because ""it was reachable from the outside"". That's the whole point of a server but I digress. 


As first meaure I got a remote root server I was not intending giving the support guys any access (or even knowledge of the existence) and tried to keep on networking as if nothing changed. Because I am a nice person I tried to make it work full knowing it will end up in an epic supernova of networking FUBAR. Any mentioning that for some work somebody has to be present was ignored and the whole support was plastered with guidelines, tickets and restrictions. The change of some alias email adresses on the SMTP took them the better part of a week and it didn't even work. 


The engineers started to get unhappy and always diligently pointed to the support sitting in another country and after a couple days of ticket ping pong did it myself as support support. I also logged all the wasted hours I spent, faults and wrongs they did and instances where they could do nothing (restarting a network switch. Still no telekinesis?) and readied myself for the final blow.


On the following week Tuesday morning I informed my co-workers there might be network connectivity problems and instructed them to rely on the networks stuff as little as possible. I logged in a provided some critical points with static IPs (except for $boss's laptop of course). From the depth of the abyss then rose a little network switch. Drawing my runes and symbols I connected it to the network. I stirred the sleep of the thing that should not be. I took another network cable, plugged it in and in my satanic ritual plugged it in again. 


What followed was a evil storm of stray DHCP packets. The hail of new and not so new device information kicked and reconnected all DHCP devices in a endless downward spiral until the end of time. I imagined the control dashboard of the supporters I supported like a infernal christmas tree where all lights started blinking red and green and maybe yellow too. My colleagues were warned and I sat back and played the waiting game. 


About 20 minutes later I get a frantic call from the other office.


&gt; Hey, what is happening with you office? I can only sporadically reach you?


Feigning ignorance:
&gt; Oh, I don't know? I've seen it work with some devices. The printers are fine. Internet works for some too? 


&gt; Can you have a look that the firewall is correcly configured or apply a backup?


&gt; Sorry ~~Dave~~ I cannot do that. I have no access. 


&gt; Oh. And is ther server still ok?


&gt; It is still running. Everything else is your job. I can't log in, I have no access. 


&gt; Sh...I will think of something. Talk to you later...  *click*


Smirking I went back to work. $boss came around and asked what was happening and all the pieces of my plan fell together.


&gt; Yeah we have network outages. Can't tell whats happening but I guess today is gonna be no good day to get work done on the shares. Sorry.


&gt; Can't you do something?


&gt; Nope. Not my responsibility. 


After lunch (4 hours of outage so far) I get another call.


&gt; Hey Luesterklemme, I've got a solution: You get you cell phone and tether the cell service to a laptop, you connect the RS232 to the firewall and I remote in to solve the problem!


&gt; Okay.


I really wanted to see that since the storage cabinet had barely any reception but I gave it my best shot. After setting everything up $SP went to work and after a few hours of agonizingly slow debugging went home after calling and telling he found nothing (no, really?) and we should all tether our phones. I waited another 30 minutes and put Cthulu back in its slumber. 


The deed was done. The storm was over. Sluggish DHCP packeges oozed back to their place. And none of the remote support where any wiser what caused the outage. I readied my weapons for the full frontal assault and got the accesses back and the renewals of the plans for the new server in about 2 weeks of discussions and my biggest backer was $boss after I calculated (in management calculations) what that outage had cost us and will in the future when the server follows Cthulu and loses its mind.


And of course that was not the final part since that little server that could still served and now also the parent parent company wanted to play ball. But that is another story for another time.

But we're also aware that a PhD can lead to a variety of good jobs outside academia, both in the humanities and the sciences. So a PhD can still be valuable outside academia, depending on your career. 

But students looking to transition away from academia get basically zero support from their programs. Your PhD alone isn't often enough to land a job: employers want to see relevant job experience. I've heard a lot of non-ac PhDs say that it wasn't their PhD that landed them a job: it was an internship, or volunteer work, or hobby, etc. outside the lab. 

Currently, it's completely up to the students to get job experience. I was lucky to attend a school with the ""BEST"" program, which allows students to do a professional internship in grad school. But these programs are few, far between, and only funded temporarily by the NIH. There's no permanent institutional mechanism that helps students get the job experience they need to get hired.

Plus, a lot of mentors are happy to let their students do an internship, as long as it ""doesn't come at the expense of their lab work"". Grad school already devastates your work-life balance, and expecting a student to prepare for a career transition in their limited free time isn't reasonable.

I can think of a number of solutions that might help:

* Students should have the right to spend 3-6 months outside the lab for an internship. 
* Universities should offer classes on leadership, budget management, teamwork, and other skills employers look for. 
* Universities should form partnerships, networks, etc with industry, government, etc.
* Graduate training itself should be shortened for those not pursuing an academic career.
* etc. 

The problem is that universities are in *no way* incentivized to make these changes. University leadership knows about the job crisis, but as long as they get grant funding and have enough graduate students to do the actual research, they don't really care. When they do implement changes, they're slow and insufficient. 

Can universities be forced to make changes? What changes should they make?"

During my time there I was not able to get any relevant internship. I did work during my last year as a dishwasher for a local restaurant. I'm starting to apply for jobs, but I'm afraid that my resume is bad and I'll just get passed over. I'm mostly submitting for software engineers or something in the field.

Here is my [resume](https://imgur.com/gallery/oAJSloM)

Here are my thoughts to what I put on my resume.

**Education**

* I put my education stuff first as I think that is the most important.
* I included my senior project as that seems relevant to the type of jobs I'm going to apply for.
* I only put the time I graduated for the date of education.
* Relevant courses was put there when I was applying for internships. I see how it can be pretty irrelevant as employers won't know what those courses entails. I mostly put it to show that I have some experience in those fields.

**Technical Skills**

* Put my languages there. Seems sort of irrelevant, but a skill that I have.
* I also put all the computing languages that I know in this section. I tried to sort them to indicated which skills I'm better at.
* Some of these skills I am extremely rusty at, such as Haskell and Matlab. Not sure if I should include those or just put them in a separate category such as ""Knowledge of"" or something.

**Professional Experience**

* I tried to give some detail of what I did as a dishwasher, but there is only so much I can talk about washing dishes.
* Not sure if I should put my managers information there or not. If I do should in a references section, or should I just have in the experiences section?
* This section felt really lacking to me, but I don't have any internship experience in my field so this is the best it's probably gonna get for now.

**Engineering Project**

* Sadly I do not have any projects that I have done myself. These are all class project.
* Since my resume feels like it is lacking content, I tried to give the employer a little more knowledge as to what skills I have.
* Tried to get the main point across with these bullet points.

**Misc**

* The upload kind of messed up my resume formatting. The line after *Game Database - Course Project* is supposed to be right after the last bullet point. There is not that much white space after the bullet point.
* This whole resume is one page. The white space after the last line is extra, and not suppose to be there.

I still have a lot more classes to take for computer science. My top choice is Johns Hopkins. I don't know if a 3.0 or 3.5+ GPA in computer science and physics is needed to get accepted into grad school, but I'm aiming for at least a 3.5 GPA.

*I'll re-post what I mentioned in the comments up here and rearrange the information in this description box.*

**\~Last Update\~:** I got a B in the math course I originally failed in, and an A for the other math course. (TuT)

&amp;#x200B;

**(Studies / Predicted Graduation Date):** I'm going into my 4th year as an undergrad, not graduating anytime soon (maybe I'll graduate in 2020/21), majoring in computer science, and hoping to minor in physics.

I'm not exactly sure what I wanna do with computer science and physics. All I know is that I've looked into ""computational physics"", AI, and AR.

**Update:** I'm retaking a math class right now, and realistically I might get a C or an F now that I saw my second midterm grade. I guess I did deserve the discouragement from you guys. I don't even know why my professor is encouraging me at this point because I'm the only student that shows up to his office and the only student that's bound to fail his class. :(

**(Transfer / Grading Systems / GPAs / Credit Count):** I don't know if some of the info here is helpful for you guys, but I included them here just in case.

I attended two universities. At my first college, I got around a 2.4 GPA. At my current college, I have a 2.378 GPA with 2 F's and 3 W's. I'm retaking one of the classes I failed right now, and the other one during the upcoming fall semester.

Whenever someone has attended multiple colleges, the GPAs for each college are supposed to be reported separately, not averaged together (unless you transfer to a sister school). So, the grades I had at my previous institution aren't accounted for in my current GPA - 2.3.

I transferred with 60 credits, and I've just completed 39 credits (plus more credits that will be counted after I'm done with the classes I'm taking right now).

The GPA I had previously was actually the result of grade inflation - extremely curved grades so that everyone can pass the college's historically difficult classes. So in reality, I got C's in classes where I and a handful of students actually failed in, and continued on to the next course.

My current GPA is the result of grade deflation - rounding grades down to a solid A/B/C/D (4.0/3.0/2.0/1.0) and no grade curving based on the class average or the course's previous class averages. (ex. a grade of 89.99% would result in a B.) And my GPA is the result of an even mix between B's and C's, some A's, and two F's.

I'm retaking one of the classes I got an F in, one math class that's optional for my major but beneficial for physics (since I wanna convince the physics department that I wanna study physics), and other summer courses.

The goal right now is to improve my studies so that I can get a student internship as soon as possible.

**(Gaining Research Experience):** I've been a member of an AI research group since the end of spring semester. I haven't written any publications yet since I joined the group really late, but I spent my time understanding everyone's AI projects. I might be able to work on a publication this upcoming fall semester.

**(I Want Advice):** Why am I getting negative points on comments when I'm clarifying my situation and admitting my failures? I updated my original post and reply to you guys. Few of you aren't even giving helpful advice; just saying rude things like ""I should change my career path"" and ""I don't have a chance to go to grad school"". I can overcome my failures. I'm not giving up computer science and physics. If you're not here to offer advice, then leave."

I recently graduated with a double major in pure mathematics and theoretical physics.

I as curious as to how I can get a job as a financial analyst without having an finance degree or experience.

I am learning languages such as Python and SQL for their data analysis and visualization uses.

Would the best step be to first apply to internships and then after gaining experience apply to full time jobs? How and where can I find these internships? I've applied to a few found on LinkedIn and Indeed.

Also, if a source for cover letters for applying to finance from this background could be provided that would be awesome.

Thank you in advanced."

I'm looking to apply to 5-10 (what do you guys think) schools and I want to know which ones would be a good idea to drop because of (presumable) bad fit and/or no chance of getting in.

I'm thinking of majoring in econ and going into finance (hopefully I-Banking, maybe an MBA later) but that's not set in stone as law school is an option too.

Demographics:

White. Male. 150k+ income. Go to a small (&lt;300 kids) private school in California.

Stats:

GPA is like 3.95 

(/4.00, both uw and w because my school doesn't have AP or honor classes)

SAT 1550 (800 rw 750 m)

SAT II haven't taken but probaly like 750+ in Math 700 in Physics. I need to study a lot for Physics.

No APs at my school like I said.

ECs:

\*Debate team 4 years and team captain 2 years, developed curriculum to teach debate to new kids and grew team

\*Varsity baseball 4 years, varsity soccer 2 years.

\*Soph. year student council, jr. and sr. year class treasurer

\*Did an internship program at the state capital

\*Summer job with state government

Other:

Don't think my essays will be great, because I can't think of anything interesting to write about

Recs probably good, I have great relationships with a couple of teachers at my school both of whom have PhDs.

What I want in a school:

\*Good prestige/career opportunities

\*Lots of opportunities for clubs/extracurricular

\*Econ program that's more quantitative and finance-focused rather than on public policy stuff

\*Decent or better social life

\*I like tradition and history, but not required

\*Preferably a place where Greek life is prevalent, but not super-duper elitist (again not that important)

Schools I'm considering:

High reaches:

\-HYP (Harvard yale princeton)-These are all big, prestigious schools with great traditions and career opportunity. I love Harvard but idk if it's worth applying.

\-UPenn-Wharton and also a good social life. Considering ED because it seems way easier to get in

\-MIT-Probably unrealistic but I really like the data science and econ major and the academic rigor

Middle Reaches:

\-Dartmouth-I love the tradition, small campus, school pride, greek life, wall st. connections. Also considering ED.

\-Amherst and Williams-Don't know much about these schools but seem like good places with strong econ and a bit more realistic to get into than Ivies.

\-Duke (?)-Idk, seems pretty elitist though, but good school

(Maybe) Matches (?):

\-UVA-I like how it reminds me of the Ivies, good career opportunities, Greek life (maybe a bit elitist), seems pretty chill too.

\-UC Berkeley-Not a huge fan of culture, but it's the best public school in country

\-UCLA-Finance too weak? It seems like a cool place to live though

\-UCSD-Good econ for a lower-tier school and seems like a cool place as well

\-Cal Poly-I love the campus and all, but idk if there's anything good but eng.

Safety-ish:

\-UCSB-I love the campus, not the academics though

\-UCD-Close to my home, I do like Davis, not sure what I'd study

\-SDSU-idk it's a safety lol

\-ASU-free tuition if I get NMS.

EDIT: also stanford

Pleas help me narrow down list, decide where to ea/ed, thanks"

Thing is, i have no idea if this title has any weight to it. I would be obtaining an Associates of Applied Science degree if i were to major in this, which i have read can only get you so far in CompSci fields opposed to a bachelors degree. The college also offers Certificates of Achievements for things like Network Infrastructure Analyst, which i assume is for people who complete the associates?  Im mostly worried about getting a job after i graduate. I'm aware that internships are the way to go in these types of fields so im expecting to intern first. I just wanna be sure i have a realistic chance in this field if i were to pursue this.

Will majoring at this school offer me a better education in cybersecurity opposed to a community college with no fancy 'Excellence in Cyber Defense' title? What can i expect from this program? Just a bit worried about the ability to get a job/internship after all is said and done. I've done some researching for jobs and internships and reading on their requirements and a lot of them seem to require you to have or be pursing a Bachelors in university for CompSci. Kinda freaks me out because what good am I to them when all i would have is an Associates.

95abxf,8,2018-08-07,From developer to entrepreneur: learning to build an indie startup,yesnoornext,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/95abxf/from_developer_to_entrepreneur_learning_to_build/,"Hey, recently I launched a [blog](https://twomakers.io/) with my partner Marie about our entrepreneurial journey.I learnt to code when I was really young. I started making websites at 13. But without realizing it, the regular life caught me and for 2 years I got sucked into normal jobs. I wasn’t happy.

Then I made the decision to quit my job and we built an iOS app. Unfortunately it failed. But it didn’t stop us. A few months ago, we decided to fully commit ourselves to the indie maker lifestyle.

\- - -

I always liked to build, to make stuff. When I was a teen, I use to spend all my free time studying networks and computers. I wanted to be a cyberpunk, hack things and write sci-fi novels. I was the typical shy geek. One day, I met a guy at school who was working at Microsoft during the summer and he started to develop aesthetic websites. I also had done web development for companies and startups during unpaid internships at the age of 13/14. To be honest, it was not my cup of tea. But I saw the possibility to build something for other people to help them share their knowledge, while building something fun at the same time.

My friend had launched a website which went viral in France. “ProfduBahut.com” was a platform where students could audio record their teachers and spread their best punchlines. I started to spend more and more time to coding/building websites. My biggest fear before every launch was the reaction of the people. It made me anxious to see how my friends would react to what I’ve build. I think it’s a serious problem in our generation. As a young entrepreneur, you can spend a lot of time learning to code or reading books. Sometimes it’s easier and reassuring to avoid the reaction of others by postponing your deadline.

This hesitation and the fear pushed me to wait a long time, to mute my ambitions. Instead of launching products, I tried to do normal things and have a normal job. I wasn’t as shy anymore but I felt sick about what I was doing with my life. Somehow I knew I wasn’t on the right path.

A mid-sized town in France has usually one or two life-paths for young people. If you are lucky, you either go to college or pursue medicine. Being an entrepreneur is definitely not something people would pursue, or even consider/support. All I know of entrepreneurship was from my parents’ experience. They ran several flower stores and their business failed. I felt pain from financial issues early on. While the flower stores of my parents weren’t successful my brother opened a restaurant. He showed me the positive impact a successful business can have on the people’s life.

France is a country where failure is a taboo. People see it as unwise to start anything and will try to discourage you. The government isn’t helping by painting a very one-sides picture of entrepreneurs who go on television or get press coverage about the big money they raised. Sometimes this attention can be helpful because it gives you some courage to do what you do. You feel validated. You think you have a proof that what you do is important. You can show it to your family and friends. But this is not real. And with this strategy, toxic people are attracted to it and want to be a part of this hype.

It’s absolutely fine if you don’t want to connect with these people. You’ll find more than enough sparring-partners entrepreneurs on the Internet than at any tech conference worldwide. You don’t need to take selfies with Emmanuel Macron or be invited to the station F (the largest European startup incubator founded by a famous French entrepreneur, Xavier Niel) to be a true startup. It’s fine (and probably better for your business) if you prefer to stay focused on your product while others prefer charming investors.

Nowadays, some people put a lot of effort into letting people think this is the only option. But there are actually others. And take money from other people don’t make you a more credible person. This doesn’t mean I don’t respect entrepreneurs who are VC backed. I want to work on hacky things and ship cool products. With [Marie,](https://twitter.com/marie_dm_)my partner in crime, we decided only bootstrapping our startups could give us the freedom to create and build what we believe in, make our users happy and earn a living from it.

At the very beginning, we worked on our first project for over one year. “Many” was a messaging app allowing you to automatically record short videos when opening the app. We had big ambitions and our goal was very clear: build something better than Snapchat or Instagram. We wanted to prove that two people in a little apartment could build a better service than billion dollar companies. It was our first mobile product and by far the hardest thing we built.

Check the demo of ""Many"" here: [https://vimeo.com/218461444](https://vimeo.com/218461444).

After the launch, Many got featured by Apple. Our hashtag was in the top trend of Twitter. We saw a huge spike of downloads. But, as so often in the app space, the user retention was very low and we lost the motivation to fix this at the end. Honestly, we felt we’ve spent too much time on the app. Shipping it was our last move to get rid of it.

We were kind of exhausted actually, for several reasons. I mentioned the time spent on it, that’s the first one. We also knew that there is basically only one business model for social networks and we didn’t want to raise money after all, even though that was our objective at first. We also discovered a field where the founders of these messaging apps don’t hesitate to spam address books or inflate their growth’s numbers. It seemed like this was actually pretty common and this was definitely not on our roadmap. We always cared about the privacy of the users and always made clean products.

It’s also difficult when you’re talking about the same project every day for more than a year, we were a bit tired of it. You could think that after finally launching it we would be ready for the next step. But we couldn’t. We both needed change. And I think it’s actually fine. “Many” was probably a necessary step so we can continue our journey. We never launched it on Product Hunt or other platforms. Heavy-hearted we decided it was time to shut it down to be able to move to something new.

In July 2017, while “Many” was live, I saw a guy on the Internet shipping a project named Hoodmaps in public. He live streamed all his work on Twitch. I was deeply impressed and couldn’t believe my eyes. You can see a 2 minutes time lapse of this work here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN144KdOIGM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN144KdOIGM).

This is how I discovered [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/), which I guess most of you know. His lifestyle and work methods promised an alternative to my way of doing things. Paris felt more and more like a prison where I didn’t see any future. A few weeks later we decided to leave Paris. We sold and stored our furniture and began to plan a road trip to discover our country.

One important takeaway of this trip is you can improvise things. You can start without knowing how to do everything. Learning as you go is possible and often the better approach. You don’t need to have all the skills to make it work. You’ll learn on the way. Two Makers will be the place where we share our story of being digital nomads. We will share what we are working on and what we have learned.

95agzz,3,2018-08-07,Trying to get into the IT industry - where do I go to learn more as a student?,QuickITThrowaway,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/95agzz/trying_to_get_into_the_it_industry_where_do_i_go/,"I am currently near the end of an IT program in Canada. In a few months time, I will be placed in an internship. Previously I was working in database development, for lack of a better term.

An explanation of my background: I am one of those people in their mid 20s - mid 30s who really liked tinkering with computers while growing up. While I knew a lot of stuff, I had never actually formalized my knowledge, so decided to go back to school (already have my degree).

I am trying to make best of the last few month's and learn some material on my own time.

The contents of my course involves covering the CCNA, the Linux+, Security+ and Server 2016 exams. Without going into too much detail (and getting off-track), it also covers stuff like scripting, configuration management, virtualization, storage technologies, etc. The main idea is to learn the technologies, and automate them. I have my CCNA, and will be planning to obtain the other certifications in the next two months.

Anyways, my main question, having not actually worked in the industry yet - is there a way to know if the syllabus covered in an exam is ""useful""?

I mean, I can find numerous posts about how the A+ exam is great and all, and it is - it gets you through the door. But looking at the actual content of the exam, it is really lacking (rant incoming, it probably sounds very arrogant).

I'm not even going to mention the fact that it's ridiculous that you have to memorize the number of pins on certain families of CPU chips, or the number of pins in DIMMs. With modern PCs being more like Lego than anything else, needing to know this sort of esoteric knowledge is baffling.

Somehow, you are supposed to know about random ports for the likes of ssh and ftp, without any real understanding of the OSI or TCP/IP models. You are supposed to know about IRQs, but if you are manually assigning IRQ addresses, you are overqualified for entry level work.

It seems, browsing various sites, that the general response is one of... passive learning. Instead of contributing to active discussions about important technologies, people choose to make various threads about how they just passed an exam, and that it was a difficult exam, because everyone said it was a difficult exam.

Similarly, while the Linux+ exam could have been interesting if we were asked to configure or write a script to do something, the exam asked questions in the worst possible way - ""what are the options for this command to do such and such"". I had similar feelings with the CCNA.

It seems that these certifications are sold in the worst way possible - ""This certification is important and prestigious because I am telling you so. Others told me that it is important and prestigious, but I can't actually say why."" So they are ostensibly prestigious, and hold acclaim for no real reason. Vendors are now giving ""badges"" when you obtain a certain combination of certifications, as though it were a video game. It is ridiculous.

I want to learn more as a student, but having no actual industry experience, it is rather difficult to separate ""this certification will help you get past HR but is otherwise useless"" vs ""you really need to know the content of this certification, it will help in your professional development"".

It seems that it is not difficult to find people who say certifications are useful, but it is also not difficult to find people in the top of their field say that they are useless. Disregarding all of that, are their any skills and technologies I should pick up within the next year? I already have some programming experience through my degree (though it was never really formal, but that's another story), but am I write to assume that it pretty much never hurts to learn more programming?

I am also looking into taking the OSCP. I realize that this is ambitious given my lack of actual experience, but the content seems interesting. Like all the other certifications, I see tons of praise for it, but digging deeper, it is not too difficult to find various issues with it. I am not sure if there is a large market for the OSCP in Canada either. Is PWK worth taking now, or should I put it later down the line?"

I was doing decently until my junior year. Before junior year, I had a 3.3 UW GPA and had taken only 2 honors courses, the only ones offered at my school to 9th and 10th. During my junior year, I jumped into 3 AP classes without understanding how big the increase in workload was. During the school year, I had many issues at home. My parents got divorced, we had money issues, my then-girlfriend attempted suicide, and I started to use a few kinds of drugs. I say all of this because I think its relevant to my application in explaining the dramatic drop in my GPA, and it may be worth explaining in my application in some way.

My common app essay focuses on how I developed my passion for community work, social justice, leadership, etc. through a story about unexpectedly joining the weightlifting club. If you'd like to read it, please leave a comment and I'll DM it. I plan to write a supplemental essay answering either: why I want to go to Brandeis, or about how I would want to implement radical societal change. I'll be getting at least two *glowing* letters of rec. One is from a core subject teacher who I worked closely with for some ECs, and the other is from the director of a district department that created the two district groups I am a part of.

Rising sophomore looking to go into corporate finance but as of right now I am unsure what I should be looking for as far as internships go for next year. What kinds of positions should I be looking out for? I know it is such a broad field but what do you recommend I look for to gain valuable experience? I don't see a career in IB for me due to the lack of work/life balance. In addition, are there any computer programs I should be learning in my spare time, not necessarily for an internship but to increase my marketability? I am already learning the obvious ones like the Microsoft Suite but what about programming applications like Python that I have seen people talk about in this sub?

I was thinking perhaps gaining some more proficiency in the ML field and try to land an internship in that space, spending lots of time on quantitative finance and aiming for Jane Street/Two Sigma, maybe trying to find a placement in Europe just for fun, or trying out a different Big N, but these are all shots in the dark here.

Without getting into specifics, I'll be leaving college with a 3 year (level 7) degree in Computer Science and do still want to work in the field. I've a decent internship under my belt and some interesting projects done also. 


Should I put down the full truth regarding my degree on my CV for applications? Or if not how should I phrase an education portion of it, as it is, it's the first thing that'd be seen. 

Or would I be better off getting any work I can to try gather some funds and somehow complete a level 8. I don't know many avenues to complete this other than mutterings about Open University.

I would like to get an internship in a company which deals with cybersecurity. They deal with penetration testing, but also other stuff. Anyhow, I'd like to get that internship.

Here is a list of priorities I think is valid. The first priority gets the most attention/depth, while others get less. If something is separated with a '/', that means it is equal priority. The list is incomplete and thus I would like your help.

    1. Computer networks
    2. Operating systems / Computer architecture
    3. Algorithms / Specific operating systems (how is Linux implemented, how is Windows
       implemented) / Debugging and memory analysis
    4. Linux command line (side note about Linux command line: I started learning this, but dropped
       this since I do not use the command line)

I would also add a book about how the compiler translates the program to assembly - surely I need to know this (and am also interested in this).

So my questions:

 - Is my list of priorities valid? If it is to be amended, how would you do so?
 - What do I really need to know about the Linux command line (the most fundamental things, nothing 
   too fancy; GUI is enough for me as a user)

Thanks in advance!"

I live in CT and I work a full-time job that does two seasonal shutdowns a year. My work pays us unemployment as compensation during the shutdowns. I was laid off on 6/29 with a return to work date of 9/10. I applied for unemployment in my state on 7/3, was mailed hearing forms to fill out, and I mailed them back on 7/10. I never heard back from the CT DOL and instead ended up going to the ""job center"" after a month that they utilize here and was told my claim was denied because I had an active claim in Florida, a claim I never opened.

I contacted the FL DOL and told them I believe a fraudulent claim was opened with my SS number. All they informed me to do was to send a letter to their payment issues unit. They would not provide me with any other information such as an address where the claim was filed for since I want to legally find out where the claimant resides so I can report them to their local jurisdiction.

I do have wages in Florida, so this is where things get tricky. I worked at Disney for an internship from January 2017 until December 24th 2017. My CT DOL is saying until Florida restores the wages from Disney I am unable to collect here in CT. CT DOL said the claim was opened sometime between April of 2018 and July. I couldn't of opened the claim myself to collect because I would legally fall under reemployment fraud since I work full-time so I'd have to be an idiot. CT DOL also tells me to collect from FL but I don't want to risk that if it is fraud because I'm no a out to go to prison because of some asshole who thinks he's slick stealing SS information.

There has to be an address assigned to the FL claim, there has to be some name and some DOB but they don't even verify that information so essentially anyone could have this happen to them and not know it. What is my best course of action?  Since I have a month until I go back to work I'm at the point I just want this sorted so when I have my second shutdown in December-Feb I will be able to claim the wages I made.

Thanks for any input.

I did well there for 4 months, and parlayed that into a mid-level position (full-time) at another place.

Of course, on my second week at my new job, I got an unsolicited email from what is essentially my dream job (doing communications for an international gaming company), saying they wanted to interview me for a manager position. Yay, right!? I had a phone interview, it went really well, and they want me to come in tomorrow morning to meet in person.  

Here's the rub - I have two kids, am running low on funds due to re-settling my life, and the new job, while it pays slightly more, is only a 6-month contract. I get benefits through my wife's job, so the benefits aren't the scary thing; it's the ""what if I have to look for another job in 6 months"" feeling, after spending the better part of the past year mired in instability. 

The good: I have been subscribed to the ""Jobs at this Company"" e-mail list for 12 years. Never been anything close to an opportunity there for me. Mentioned before, but it is a manger position (which is insane considering I was teaching high school last year). 

The bad: No stability. When asked, the interviewer told me that he couldn't legally say I was guaranteed a job, but if I did an excellent job, there was a ""good chance"" to either be extended to another 6 month contract, or hired full-time. Also, this means no PTO in case the babies get sick. And, in a first for me, it creates and awkward ""burning of bridges"" moment that I have never had before (I have only been at my current job for right at a month now). 

The offsetting: Commute sucks for both, but it will be 5-10 minutes more for the ""new"" job. ""new"" job will pay about $1,000 more, so that doesn't matter.

there will be a TL:DR at the bottom. 

so I had worked from 1am-6am about 30 mins away from the city. in the afternoon i did my internship, but was there from 3:30 PM-12:30am. essentially being late to my job. drove to work, parked haphazardly at the park and ride near the train station. 

as i get into my job and i ask the front desk if she could page the department i was contracted to work with and she frantically called security. rude. 

work ends, it sucks. i’m tired. i realized i don’t have enough in my bank account to pay for the parking, so i take the train home and take my long board. i board from the train station home, 7am. tired but enjoying seeing people wake up. little beauties in life. 

i fall asleep at 8. sleep till 2. see my paychecks came in, dope. 

i start skating back to the train. it’s hot as hell and i’m going fairly fast at this point (around 15-20mph). i lost my footing on my leading left foot (i skate regular, push with my right foot) and i jumped off ran and tried to tuck and roll. 

sad thing is, i only remember before i went for it, then tumbling then rolling into a sitting position. i see road rash on my hand, elbow and ankle. feel pain there but am still holding onto my paychecks and another letter. thought i was awake the whole time. skated to a store and cleaned the wounds. it made a scene but i had an anxiety attack cuz of everyone stopping and cars slamming on their brakes (last thing i remembered before going down) and skated off, mad at myself i made a scene.  

my body (in shock of what happening but me not knowing and people looking at me crazy) i call my mom, try to act like nothing happened then play it off. 

as i’m driving home about an hour later after depositing the checks, my adrenaline comes off and all the pain sets in. i went to a friends to smoke a joint for the pain and make food cuz i didn’t eat all day. 

flash forward; i’m in the ER. as i’m arriving i get a migraine so bad i can’t have my eyes look at light. they kept saying i hit my head. i kept trying to convince them i didn’t. i get a CT scan. 

X rays show no broken bones and CT scan revealed no immediate damage (on the report they were looking for if i had a stroke) so they gave me a strong NSAID and sent me home. 

in a lot of pain the next day. CT scan reveals more info, in full report, leading to an MRI of my brain on Sunday  and a recommendation to get x rays on my skull and spine. they came out negative. 

the doctor pressed on a spot on the back of my head that left me in tears. 

later on today i am rubbing icy hot on the spot on my neck. i was talking to my friend earlier. he said i probably blacked out on impact. i feel the bump where my doc touched that left me in tears and pain for awhile. i feel down to the left and i realize the bruising goes down my neck all down to my shoulder. 

I tell my roommate feel that knot? “yeah” 

okay so i guess i really knocked myself out. 

then i thought about it, had i hit harder or any other way i could’ve easily broken my neck. thank goodness i got into rolling formation before i hit the pavement. 

TL; dr - i was skating too fast, lost my footing, tried to tuck and roll but didn’t tuck well enough, landed on the left side of the back of my head and neck and briefly knocked myself out then came to and i was rolling to a stop. argued with doctors i wasn’t unconscious but couldn’t describe how i fell although i had a migraine. realized two days later i did knock myself unconscious.

I've had some  experience with CS in high school but never anything major or extensive. However I really want to get an internship this summer to see if I wanna keep going on a CS path while building a resume. 

What's some advice you have regarding this?  Are there any clubs or classes I should look into?  What is the process of applying to internships? Should I google and apply to them or is there a recruiting process? What are project teams? I've heard about them but still confused about what exactly they do.  What do they even look for in a resume?  Did gpa matter much?

If you're reading this then thank you so much for listening to my rambling. I just want to make the most of my time and with around a week before school starts, I just wanted to prepare. Again, thanks in advance for your help!! :))"
95jf2t,164,2018-08-08,Solving a Mystery as an EC?,Squiddlydoo,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/95jf2t/solving_a_mystery_as_an_ec/,"So I got an internship this summer with a detective agency. I worked in the forensics department and we spent a lot of time on the scene, looking for evidence and documenting all of the clues. I was tasked with simply organizing all the paperwork, but I started to read closer and closer over the 6 weeks. I was surprised at how inefficient the whole agency was. Five of us took the case full time, and it was way more of a time commitment than I realized. Long hours spent driving from house to house in the company van, while I fiddled on my phone and read the case info again and again. Technically, I wasn't supposed to see some of the information on the suspects, but there was a guy there I befriended early on that spilled the tea for me whenever I asked about it. Which was often. It was easy to get things out of him, considering he was high most of the time. Not sure how he still has a job. Then again the agency did hire a 17 year old for a summer. Anyway, I watched the hills roll by in the window, and the driver watched my eyes roll by in the rear view mirror whenever I mentioned a change in our plans. ""Just keep those papers organized kid. And here, keep him fed,"" he tossed me a box of treats for the dog that sat in the seat next to me.

Anyway, it was probably the fourth week in that I started to notice things. There was a recurring suspect who, while protected behind a solid alibi, was found in the transcript of almost every conversation we'd had since the day it happened. After all my attempts to contact said suspect failed, I convinced my team to procure a search warrant. 

We arrived at the house, and we were surprised to find no one was home. We almost turned around, before I decided to try the door. ""Guys. It's unlocked.""

Now I'm no legal expert. I don't know if what we did next would stand in a court of law, or whether we'd get qualified immunity (I'd doubt it, since the agency is a private organization), but at that moment, after getting no leads whatsoever - it didn't matter. I had a personal stake in this. 

The six of us entered the house. I led the way down the dark front hallway. It wasn't nighttime, but the sun was setting. We needed flashlights. The old floorboards creaked violently with each of our careful steps. The sound echoed through the house like the boards were moaning for help. 

A scream. A cacophony of cries from the wood underneath our feet as one of the two women in our team crashed to the floor. My heart was racing, there was no avoiding it; if anyone was in this house, they knew we were here. 

Her glasses had flown off her face. I found them nestled under an expensive vase, holding a single white flower. A single crack ran down the lens. I went to go give her back her glasses (she was blind as a bat without them), but I noticed something. I did a double take. The dirt in the vase was wet. It was freshly watered. Our suspect was here. 

We didn't know where to head next. We turned, as always, to the director of the agency. We huddled up, and our collective BPM was somewhere in the 700s. But it lowered, when he got that look. That look, like he knew what was going on, that everything would be okay, that this was all a part of a bigger plan. I aspire to have that look. He said only 4 words: ""Let's split up, gang."" It was a good plan, but we never got to execute it. 

Above us. Creaking. Six heads turned to look at the ceiling. We couldn't hide. It was too late. He was coming downstairs. Every step coming down the stairs was agonizing. I accepted that I might not leave this house. 

A man in his late fifties appeared at the bottom of the stairwell. He wore a set of pajamas, a head of gray hair, and an expression of amusement. We were grabbing on to each other for our lives. A puddle of urine spread underneath my Newbalance sneakers. Stupid dog. I stepped in front of him, but I was terrified too.

The man clapped his hands together, and the sound rippled through the peeling wallpaper. Slowly, he brought his hands together again. ""So you caught me."" He laughed. ""You caught me red handed."" 

We looked at each other. I spoke up, my voice trembling. ""Yes."" I started to record on my phone, for evidence.

""Well you caught me. That's right, I did it. I did everything I could to cover it up. But you got me. I did lie. I did cheat. But you can't prove it.""

I took another step toward him, hesitantly. It was too late to stop now. ""I can actually."" Simultaneously, four of my friends tried to pull me back, but I turned around, and I put on that look. A look that held back a flood of fear, a look that war heroes have held before battle, a look of such unwavering confidence that it could convince you that Cornell is an Ivy. A look that I will never again be able to replicate.

I reached into my pocket, and pulled out a slip of paper. ""I can prove it. I have all the evidence I need right here.""

Fear momentarily ran across his face. ""Is that... is that my application?""

""Yep. Harvard University. Class of '83. It says it right here. You applied as a Native American. There isn't an ounce of Aboriginal American blood in you, is there?""

""But... how?""

""You, my friend, waived your FERPA rights.""

At this, the man fell to his knees and yelled in agony. ""No! No! Nooo! This can't be right!""

I looked back at my team and smiled. 

""Tell it to the judge."" I snapped a pair of handcuffs on his grubby wrists and led him out the front door to the police car that waited.

He yelled when I forced him into the seat. ""I graduated from Harvard! Harvard! I don't deserve this! Get your hands off me!""

As I went to slam the door closed, he yelled one final line, that I'll never forget. ""I would've gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!""

So my question is, is this a good EC? Shooting for T20s if it matters"

95kn0l,16,2018-08-08,Some Monsters among the Spirits,AdvancedAccounting98,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/95kn0l/some_monsters_among_the_spirits/,"All the male lines in my family can see Spirits when we turn eighteen. Given that the world is already a couple of millennia, I had imagined more than just a few has this sight. Through observation however it became apparent that seeing Spirits was a rather rare gene.

In Bacolod City, around forty of us have transitioned into the para-realm (half the number are close relatives). My transition got me into liking Spirits—basically because one of them saved my life. Months after my sight, I found that Spirits are actually cool. I’ve witnessed them play hide and seek, run fashion shows, and read other people’s text messages from their backs. Spirits can touch stuff, but the contact hurts them intensely—so they’d almost always choose to just smoke through objects. You’ll know if a Spirit is new to the para-realm because they usually forget that touching stuff hurts them (hence, the moving chairs) and that they can pass through walls (hence, the groaning doors).

The transition granted us vision, but all other sensory functions with the Spirits were not given—we cannot hear, feel, smell, or taste them. One does not need these other functions, however; Spirits are easily distinguished because of their glow and foggy color.

And then there are the Swine.

Aside from the cuckoos (our label to Spirits that takeover living bodies), there are those Spirits who were so vile, so cruel, so monstrous, that the para-realm granted them a smell. A stink of their own. A wafting odor that follows them, marking them. All infirmities disappear upon death. In exchange, the para-realm imposed these monsters a stench.

I heard about these Swine from one of my uncles. Where the cuckoos inhabit bodies of the living who intentionally projected themselves out, Swine are like parasites. They latch themselves to hosts and eat off their joy and hopes, more often than not resulting to the psychological breakdown of the host. The Swine’s stink is so strong that even non-transitioners tend to stay away from the attached host, as if they themselves can see and smell the Swine.

My first experience with Swine was months after my transition. During that time I was already told about these Spirits but since I have never seen one, I badly underestimated their monstrosity. The Swine that I saw was latched onto the back of a jeepney driver that I rode to school, locked so tight that I initially thought it was a conjoined twin. I got down from the vehicle about ten seconds since I stepped into it. There was an instance when a garbage truck crashed against a siphoning septic truck, their heaps unloaded along the sidewalk—I gagged each time I passed that crash location. Compared to the Swine, that heap was like mint.

Why were the Swine so accursed? The rule throughout time was simple. There was only one basis for a Spirit to become Swine. One sin. A Swine is a Spirit who has eaten human meat in life.

Now, there was this encounter that was rather odd.

It began when I was applying for a student internship in the Commission on Audit. I was pretty late given the storm, but managed to arrive just in time to see the last applicant leave the interview room. She was fuming, wisps of tears sparkling at the corner of her eyes. I quivered as I imagined what might have produced such an emotion in an internship application.

Upon entering the room, I was greeted by two Commission officers. The petite lady in the black blazer was sighing deeply as she checked the previous girl’s application form, apparently regretting the incident that had occurred before my entrance. To her side was a robust man grinning arrogantly. I quickly confirmed without a shadow of doubt who caused the disagreement.

I handed my application documents as soon as the lady, Miss Rochelle, extended her welcome. The interview turned out to be pleasant, with the man, Sir Vince, simply staring at my resume in boredom. Sir Vince said very little during the interview. I later found out that the pervert was only interested in talking to girls. 

With the little that he had said, I could never forget the one statement that went out of his filthy mouth: “That young girl sure looked tasty”. I decided that time that there was no way Vince was ever getting my respect.

My hate was fueled intensely during our first day as interns. A girl reported how Vince was telling her obscene japes. Another remarked how Vince had purposely dropped items on the floor for her to pick up, with the intention of catching a peek of her insides. The man was so vile that I actually witnessed female Spirits glaring at him.

Days turned into weeks, and our hate worsened. One of the interns, Josephine, experienced the worst of his perversions. We witnessed how Vince once tried to follow her inside the female’s comfort room (that was also the first time we saw Miss Rochelle burst), how he once touched her thigh, how he sneered at her dress every morning. Truth be told, I actually got the feeling that Josephine was suffering more than she was telling. Vince was immune to our complaints, however. He was, after all, the Mayor’s brother.

A month through our internship, Josephine asked me to walk her to her stop. She told me how Vince had been following her for days already. In no account did I look strong enough to protect her, but I readily told her I’d stick by her until she felt safe. Josephine thanked me with all her heart.

The first week went well, until I had to leave the office early because of an emergency. Josephine understood, of course—she even joked she’d brought a knife with her just in case.

Damn that emergency.

The day after that, Josephine did not come to work. Nor did Vince.

On the second day of her absence, we received a visit from her poor parents. They were farmers who managed to find a scholarship for their only child. Miss Rochelle entertained them. After their closed-door discussion, the couple exited the office grieving. Miss Rochelle had confirmed the couple’s fears—their daughter had been stalked by the Mayor’s brother before her disappearance.

The even more cruel thing was despite the fact that Josephine had continued to be missing, there had been no public uproar. The media and the police force were all controlled by the Mayor.

Months passed by, and my internship ended with still no clue about her disappearance. I was in the mall with a friend discussing about plastic disposal when an overpowering stench filled the area. My head went dizzy as I gagged for air. I looked around and saw Spirits scurrying to escape the mall, a certain fear displayed on their foggy faces.

And then I saw Vince.

I choked in my own breath as I stared at him. He limped like an empty zombie, his jaw hanging low. He crouched hollowly, exactly as a dead person would crouch. Then the odor. It was unmistakably Swine, and I realized I should get out of the mall myself. I did not have that chance though—Vince began shooting people.

Four people died during that incident. I and my friend managed to survive the ordeal unscathed, but were in no good shape for days. As for Vince, the police threw him in prison for good. One of the four people who died was actually the son of a rich and influential businessman, so the Mayor had no way around the law for that case.

The court hearing for Vince was shown live in TV after different allegations of rape and molest topped the homicide filed by the businessman. I was still bothered by the stench during the shootout—

Spirits roam everywhere, but they usually reside on the place where strong memories are attached. For most convicts, that place is the justice court—where their death sentence was granted to them, guilty or not, deserved or otherwise. Upon Vince’s hearing however, the court was empty of Spirits. Except for one.

Josephine.

As hopeful as I had been, I was already expecting her to be dead. But not in that state. She was clinging onto Vince’s back, her face a distorted twist of horror and grief and nothingness. Josephine had become a Swine.

Vince admitted to all allegations against him. When prodded with Josephine’s disappearance, he informed the court of how he had followed her one night and eventually raped her in his car. Josephine had fought like hell though—forcing Vince to bash her head numerous times until she died.

Since then, Vince confessed, he had been feeling empty; depressed until the point when he decided to end his life. This actually confused him as well. He said he had come to the mall to shoot his brains out; the civilian killing was not in his agenda. He was as surprised as everyone.

The court’s verdict was four counts of homicide, seven counts of rape, sexual misconduct, murder, and other legalities I’d care to list down. Josephine’s parents retrieved her body from where Vince hid it and gave her a proper burial. I and the COA staff mourned with them.

“A hundred years in hell will never be enough for that scum,” Josephine’s mother told us. “Even a million.”

Miss Rochelle stood beside me during the funeral. Her husband was a police officer, privy of the information surrounding Vince’s case. “My husband tells me the businessman arranged for a special cell to be assigned to Vince. With five other rapists to join him,” Miss Rochelle confided to me. She tried to hide a smile. “That man is already broken, though. Josephine made sure of that herself.”

I was about to ask her to clarify what she meant when she added: “Josephine ate his manhood off.”"

I know this question has been asked before but I could't find any threads with a suitable answer so I thought I might ask here again.

I'm currently a CS major in the US, rising Junior, and I'm looking to study abroad. Here's a little bit about my situation:

* I have enough credits to graduate early and so, I can take off one or two semesters to study abroad. Ideally, I would love to study abroad one semester in one country, and another semester in a different country.
* This fall semester, I'll be taking classes the last few classes to complete my graduation requirements - except one, but I can take that my senior year.
* I want to study abroad in the Spring and/or during my senior year.
* No, I don't have an internship secured. I'm hoping that I'll be able to secure one for Summer 2019 when applications start opening up.
* I do have experience working in two computer science-oriented research labs.
* I really want to get into game development.

Does anyone have any suggestions for schools that have a solid computer science program? Preferably, I want to continue my CS studies abroad.

I'm really interested in possibly studying somewhere in Europe or South Korea and would love it if anyone had any input for these countries!"

My Canadian taxes up to and including 2017 have been filed without issue. I have yet to file my American taxes for any years prior, and I turned 18 in 2014 so I'm a few years behind. I made about $12000 CAD in 2016, $24000 CAD in 2017, and now $18000 USD these past 10 weeks during a summer internship in the states.

As far as I can tell I don't have any of the things that could make this complicated, I've never opened a TFSA or anything like that (all my money goes into tuition).

I don't think back filing for the last 4 years of taxes will be much of an issue since I only lived in Canada and made purely Canadian income. I'm worried about filing for the next year however, and how it'll work since I've now made American income. I won't be moving to the States permanently until next year when I graduate, so I'll still need file Canadian taxes as well. I'm assuming with $18000 of income and the crazy NY taxes I'm paying, I'd be in line for a significant tax refund next year.

So the question: Can I still handle this myself, or should I be paying for an accountant to do it for me?

Thanks!"
95mmrw,3,2018-08-08,How to combat a helicopter/bubble-wrap parenting?,forgottensteamuser,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/95mmrw/how_to_combat_a_helicopterbubblewrap_parenting/,"My mom doesn't trust me to do a single thing, and when I manage to accomplish something, she praises it as a huge achievement. Like when I cooked a meal for myself the other day, she was like: ""Wow, I can't believe you're able to do that, I couldn't boil an egg until I was 22."" That's not it, when I'm going to college she's like: ""Don't go too far, we won't be able to help you when you're sick,"" insinuating that I WILL be sick, and not the likelihood of becoming sick. Another incident, I told her I was hanging out with a friend and eating out with them. My mom PULLED UP TO MY FRIEND'S HOUSE, ASKED HIS DAD IF I WAS WITH THEM, and then had the parent CALL MY FRIEND, to verify I was with him. At the night when I was still hanging out, she walked to my house again at 10:00 PM, and knocked on his door because she clearly believed I could not walk back home which is less than 1 minute away...

She is in constant fear of me not being able to find a job, and then becoming homeless and a vagrant on the street. The reality is I'm a straight A student, in spite of that belief...I went to a college counselor and she was like: your son is very bright, and to no avail she continued to drone about my possibility of being homeless. Like, no FUCKING SHIT, everyone has a chance of becoming homeless, but it takes a lot of misfortune to accomplish that. We're in an upper-middle class household in the United States, with like a million dollars, and parents making more than 300k in total, so I think we SHOULD be fine.

ALSO, whenever I study a new class, she AUTOMATICALLY purchases workbooks for them, and get it she DOES THEM HERSELF, for ""her own knowledge"" when it is in reality she fears I will fail the class, and buys them. She bought four books on accounting (the easiest business class might I mention), and I didn't even need her help. I got an A by my own strength. Like how the fuck is she so insecure? When questioned she says: WELL YOUR COUSIN SPENT 10K ON TUTORING AND SHE IS STILL WORKING AT A DMV. ...The reason for that is because my cousin partied instead of taking an internship, and failed out of half her classes, maybe.

When I did research for a major I wanted to do for my consultant, or in general, she IMMEDIATELY did research and cherry-picked the lowest salary, and the respective WORST scenario possible for that job. For UI Design, which the median salary is like 80k, she IMMEDIATELY found some run-down website, and was like ""they make 40k!"" they're on food stamps! Like shut the fuck up!

I don't want my parents to come to my safety EVERY fucking time there is an issue in my life. My employers won't like that, so surely they should honestly stop as soon as possible. Like they are clingy as fuck, and really annoying.

Whenever anything contrary to her opinion is brought up she brings up a non-sequitur...eg when I was like psychologists have good exit ops, she was like: ""You can't have it well-off in America, you're Chinese."" - I walked away at that because yes while I am I am CHINESE AMERICAN. She was like: It's my money, and I won't let you go into a useless major, and then I was like: ""Well I'll pay it off myself, and use my own scholarships (which I have applied for."", then she goes silent. She refuses to listen to anything except things that reinforce her opinion, and anything else she takes it as an attack on her opinion, and her.

She needs to stop gaslighting me with bullshit, and playing the victim. It is so fucking annoying. I just stay in my room and steer clear of her...  She asks my grandma advice on EVERYTHING. Like sweetie...grandma doesn't have all the answers to your problems. (No I don't take this tone with my mom, but I'm so fucking PISSED that she is this headstrong for no good reason.)"

(I'll be taking EECS 280 this fall as I already have credit for EECS 183 &amp; 203 from my previous university, MSU). I will be staying off campus with a few friends that I knew from high-school, but I'm just worried about the following things:

\-EECS 280 being difficult, although I do have experience in C++ besides the pointers/memory management stuff.

\-Social life. Since I didn't have the luxury of spending my freshman year at UMich in the dorms, i feel like it'll be really hard to meet new people. I'm thinking of joining a social frat, but I'm not sure yet. I will be in a business frat though as I was in one from my past university.

\-Leadership opportunities. I'm not sure how important leadership roles are in the CS world since I believe that employers look at more at what projects one has completed, but since I am already a year behind, I feel like it'll already be harder to gain a leadership opportunity if I were to join some type of club/org. I did manage to pull off an internship for this summer after my freshman year, but it wasn't a software engineering internship.

Hope someone can shed some light on these things above!

I am brazilian, and learned all I know of english on my own. Although I can understand it pretty well (I've been reading nosleep for months now) and I present myself as a fluent speaker on my resumee, I find it kinda hard to write a formal text, and writing this story to post on /r/nosleep was no easier than that. I always wanted to post here, but never had the guts to. Especially because I see a lot of people complaining about grammar in the comments, and I know I have a lot of flaws in my writing. The grammar police scare me a lot.

So, I live in the very south of Brazil. I don't really know if it is the same on other countries, but here there are always two employees on the buses, the driver and the ticket revisor. The last one is often taken on by interns, very young people probably on their first job, just trying to make some money to spend with friends in one of the thousands of pubs we have here in the town. Today, I am 22 y/o, and on a slow rising software developer career, but when I was 16, I was one of these interns.

My last year at high school had just started (it was around april, so it was summer here). My shift was from 00:00 to 06:00, and school was in the morning, so I slept through the whole afternoon. It was a really shitty schedule, but the money was worth it, so I just didn't complain.

The driver who worked was a man around his sixties: a very nice old man, with more than forty years in the company. Everyone on the crew knew him. He was like a legend among us. His name was Jonas. Our bus route was the busiest during daylight, but since our shift was during dawn it was very slow. The greatest emotions on the job were some drunken teens laughing out loud and drinking, or an occasional hobo trying to ride the bus for free, so instead of sitting on the chair designed for the ticket revisor, I spent most of the shift at the side of the driver's seat, talking to Jonas and playing games on my phone. Because of the time, most of my friends were sleeping, so I had no one to talk to.

Near april's ending, I was reaching two full weeks on the job, and it was when it started getting weird.

It was around 02:50AM. I was hearing some jokes from Jonas, and laughing at them, when he suddenly stopped talking. Jonas adjusted his glasses and leaned forward, focusing on the road. ""Go to your place, boy. Whatever happens, don't talk to him. Don't look at him."" Jonas said. I was about to ask the obvious questions, but his voice had that urgency tone, and it was enough to make me shut my mouth and sit at the revisor chair.

The bus slowed down and eventually stopped at the next bus stop. 

I saw the door open, but no one came inside the bus. I was about to call it bullshit, so when the bus stopped at a red light, I looked to Jonas and when I opened my mouth to crack some joke I saw his face in the rearview mirror, looking at me over his glasses. 

He was dead serious. He made a silent ""shh"" to me, so I looked forward and swallowed hard.

With the corner of my eye, I noticed something I had not before.

There was a leg in my sight of view, in the seat immediately at my left, the closest one. How could this be possible? I saw no one enter the bus on the previous stop. Actually, I saw no one enter since the shift started. I was about to take a look, when I heard Jonas voice.

""Don't do that, boy. Don't look."" his voice was serious. Too serious. I started sweating in my forehead. Apparently, Jonas voice startled whatever was at the seat in my left, and it made a sound like the bleat of a goat (is it called bleat?), but it was very low, just low enough to be heard by whoever was on that nearly empty bus. 

At this point, my hands were shaking. I barely could take my phone from the pocket in my pants to look at the time; 03:00AM. I put the phone back in my pocket, still shaking and sweating. I could still see the leg with the corner of my eye, I could not see much, but I could tell the leg was enormous, and very fat.

The creature at my left made the sound again. I could literally feel it staring at me. It's stare felt very heavy and dense, as if it was begging me to stare back.

Then, suddenly, as fast as it started, it ended. 

I heard the sound the bus makes when someone presses the button to warn the driver they want to get off on the next stop, then I heard weird footsteps through the corridor between the bus seats. It was like the creature was struggling to get to the back door of the bus, and I could clearly distinguish the footsteps. It was a ""clack"" like the sound of a goat hull, followed by the sound of something being dragged on the floor, something soft.

I heard the door open, then the frightening goat sound once more, then it was gone.

""It's all good now, boy, you can speak."" Jonas said in a calming voice. But I didn't replied, I was still trying to understand what just happened. I kept staring forward for what it seemed like  hours, when I heard Jonas park the bus at the company garage. The shift was over.

Jonas got off his sit, stretched a bit, and helped me off mine. We got off the bus, I didn't really knew what to do. I was still sweating and shaking. Jonas said something in the lines of ""You will get used to it, just be calm."". I wanted to ask questions, but I couldn't. That could not be serious. It must have been some kind of prank. The kind of  prank the older employees do to the interns. Right?

At the time, I didn't knew that the leg-dragging goat was only the start of what I would meet in that job. 

I ran, ran the fastest I could, ran to my house, ran like I had met the devil himself.

And god knows, that maybe I had."

I am a rising senior in high school and this coming school year I will be an IT intern for a company in my area. I have the choice to do specific things within the IT department such as help desk, networking, cybersecurity and more. Although I do enjoy computers and what IT people do, I don't have a wide knowledge of IT because I am still in high school.

I am entering my 4th year. I want to decide whether I want to apply for an internship position in the industry next summer. 

The reasons for considering an internship are the followings: 

**1)** I would like to get some skills needed in the industry (which are not sufficiently provided in my research topic), 

**2)** I want to work in the industry. I am thinking this would be good for networking, learning the culture, and hopefully learn to plan better to work in the industry (e.g if I take a post-doc for whatever reason after graduation, I can learn which academic lab works with the company and maybe take the postoc, hoping that my career decisions will eventually lead to an industry position down the road).

**3)**I want to take a break and come back to my grad study with fresh mind and eye.

These are all given the fact that it may delay my graduation. I probably won't expect my PI to pay either.

So given all of my reasons and hopes for the internship, I would love to hear some of you who have done internship. Do my hopes and dreams about internship come true? (are these somewhat accurate expectations to receive in return from my internship experience?) **Or are my reasons worth taking the internship? or would it be better to do some temporary post doc instead?**"

I am a backend developer, and I am taking a kid of a soccer friend of mine into my company for a small internship. Little guy is 13 years old, and the *small internship* is not really a work contract, it is just to show kids what they can expect in a certain field where they consider getting an education in.

I knew I was heading for trouble when I asked which IT topic interested him most, as it was almost certain a kid picks games/apps. I am not a game dev, but I considered that showing him the basic concept of coding and the thought processes behind it is not too much different from business logic and OOP, so why not make it fun and rewarding.

My question is, what kind of game would you suggest to work on, that is easily understandable, and can be worked on in one week?

We don't expect it to be a finished game, but the thing that matters to me is making a little progress in a weeks time to show the kid what it is about. We won't be creating assets, so it will be ""just"" the programming part.

Any thoughts are really appreciated! And thanks in advance!"

Tomorrow will be the last day of a 10-week summer internship in software dev. I do not think there is any planned official meeting per-se between my boss and myself, but I will have the opportunity to talk with him tomorrow.

He can be an aloof guy, but is someone I very much respect and admire and as a result, I really value his opinion. Because he can be quite the a-social bird, I doubt he will go out of his way to give me any super concrete feedback because I assume he might be worried about me receiving the feedback the wrong way. 

This summer was my first real position in tech, so this is all quite out of my comfort zone. Do any of you have any experience asking others for feedback and if so, how would you go about it? I am trying to be a bit more targeted than just saying ""hey, do you have any input or feedback for me?""

Budget can go as high as USD 300 but realistically, since I would be using my scholarship funds to purchase it, I'd like to go frugal if possible. USD 1000-2000 ish unless its something deal breaking. Hong Kong. [We have this student discount thing but I dont have details on it yet](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/price/special/)

\* \*\*Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.\*\*

2-in-1 form factor is fine. I don't think I have specific preferences when it comes to that. A good battery life is great but I don't mind carrying around a battery pack. Good specs yes.

\* \*\*How important is weight and thinness to you?\*\*

On a scale of 0-10, about a 6.5

\* \*\*Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.\*\*

Windows but I'll probably switch to a linus distro pretty quick

\* \*\*Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\*\*

13""+

\* \*\*Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\*\*

Very low probability of intensive or even moderate media editing. Gaming will be limited. I lost interest in it but I will need good enough specs in case i want to test something or need to do something very computing intensive.

\* \*\*If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\*\*

n/a

\* \*\*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\*\*

ports. many ports. reliable build quality. finger-print reader is what i'd like. good input devices. great display and viewing angles.

\* \*\*Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\*\*

See the thing is I've been using a pentium processor PC for the past decade almost so my expectations aren't exactly way up there. I'm looking for a very decent bang-for-buck type of laptop.

Would probably try internships so being able to carry it to places should be important. I don't game much so that isn't exactly an issue, and spending too much would not be frugal. I want it to be future proof and last for a while.

Is it legal for me to fly to the states first AS A VISITOR, then get someone to mail me the DS-2019 in the states, and declare myself as being on J1 visa after I've already entered the country? And if so, how would I go about doing this? Would I still be able to start my internship before I declare the J1?

Background info:

Basically, I am working in the states for my fall internship, however for whatever reason, I still have not received my J1 VISA yet. This wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that I will be travelling in Europe from Aug 12 - Aug 26th, and my workterm starts on Aug 27th.

My original plan was to fly directly from Europe to the states with the DS-2019, however since I don't have the visa yet, I would need to waste a day flying back to Canada just to get my visa before flying to the USA. I'm wondering if there is a way for me to get around this and still fly directly to the US from Europe. From my knowledge, I need to have the original DS-2019 so getting a photocopy of it wouldn't work either.

UPDATE: I ended up directly contacting my visa sponsor and requested them to rush and overnight ship my application, so it looks like I should be able to receive it before I leave Canada. Thanks everyone for your responses!"

My year will be the first class that has optional ""specializations"" that be taken within the ECE department. Specifically in my case, I'm looking at Chip Scale Integration within Computer Engineering. I want to focus a little more on the hardware side of things (at least in terms of logic gates and such. I actually loathe doing full on EE stuff with voltages and currents and what have you outside basic examples). Given my electives that I want to take anyway, my only switch would be rather than taking Intro to UNIX and getting a computer engineering degree, I would take AC Circuit Analysis and get a computer engineering degree ""with a specialization in Chip Scale Integration.""

I'm not really looking forward to taking AC Circuits, so I'm wondering if it's worth putting myself through it just for an extra ""specialization."" My university is pushing these things, claiming that employers want people to have a given focus along with the general knowledge of a EE or CPE degree. Makes sense. However, rumor has it among a few friends of mine with internships that said ""specializations"" are either worthless or actually detrimental, because it can imply that sure, you know one subject a little better, but that you don't have as strong a general knowledge of your major. Unfortunately being the first year with these options, I can't look up how previous classes did with and without these things.

I don't know as any other universities do something similar or not, but as I said, just wanted feedback from folks that have real-person jobs about what their employers look for degree-wise.

The problem is getting further past that and landing that interview.

A little background about myself and my job search:

I have an aerospace engineering degree but pretty much all of my practical experience (anything that isn't some small project for a class) is in programming (pretty much all self-taught). That presents a bit of an issue as I obviously want to break into the aerospace industry but most job applications for that industry are looking for other skills and experiences. And conversely, if I look for programming jobs, most of those require a CS degree (which I don't have), not to mention all the other topics and skills that I never learned about since I never took any programming classes outside of an introductory course that was required for my degree. It doesn't help that I don't have much experience since I've only had one internship in the time I was in school.

If anyone has any pointers about how I could fix my resume I'd greatly appreciate it.

Basically anything your average 21st century intern would be stuck doing that the other full-time employees don't have time to do or don't know how to do.

I'm going into my fourth year of university in September and therefore can't hold a full-time job but they offered me part-time to do website maintenance and keep up with the SEO and other digital marketing duties. My degree will be Media Production with a minor in Marketing if that makes any difference. My job is the perfect mix of both areas.

So my question now is should I negotiate something higher, prove my worth and try to milk them for everything they've got? Or keep my mouth shut and realize I'm lucky to be in the position I'm in at all. I was pretty happy I was offered this position at all because I know they don't ever usually offer interns jobs after their internship is up.

We run an ecommerce site and because all of my other coworkers have 0 experience with web dev, I've been learning on the go how to edit and add to the website. 

I'm going into my fourth year of university in September and therefore can't hold a full-time job but they offered me part-time to do website maintenance and keep up with the SEO and other digital marketing duties. My degree will be Media Production with a minor in Marketing if that makes any difference. My job is the perfect mix of both areas. There's no exact number of hours I would be working but probably somewhere between 8-12 hours a week. With this part-time gig, they've offered me $18/hr which is quite a bit lower than what I'm making now (~$23/hr broken down) but I know they're paying me through a grant for the summer and as a startup they have super limited funds. 

So my question now is should I negotiate something higher, prove my worth and try to milk them for everything they've got? Or keep my mouth shut and realize I'm lucky to be in the position I'm in at all. I was pretty happy I was offered this position at all because I know they don't ever usually offer interns jobs after their internship is up. I guess I'm having a hard time evaluating my worth as I've only ever worked part-time retail jobs (always got paid more than minimum wage at these because of my performance but never more than $2-$3 more).

95u5hw,8,2018-08-09,Stories from the park Part 1,StateParks204,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/95u5hw/stories_from_the_park_part_1/,"The following are going to be stories that I am putting out there now just to give me some peace of mind, after years of having shit go down in the park where I work that still has zero explanation.  I am going to try and describe what has happened as best as I can remember, or what I can remember my coworkers telling me.  These will probably not scare most of you, what can I say except my life does not translate well in creep factor.   These aren't being posted for the reader but for the writer so, if you get some enjoyment out of them, great, if not, well, you can look up *Tales from the Gas Station* or *My Property Isn't Normal* as they are a good read.  Honestly, they have a way more interesting life than me, and I would like to keep it that way.

Now that we have that out of the way, I should probably introduce and describe myself.  Due to the fact that I have yet to decide whether to use my real name or not, just due to issues with work, you can just call me 204, as that is my call-sign anyway.  I am a 5'11"" guy of mainly German and Swedish descent, 240 pounds, brown haired, broad chested and with eyes that can be blue, green, brown, or any combination of the three (though blue and brown happens very rarely).  I am decently muscled, but honestly you would probably think I am either a teddy bear or a soldier.  No, I have never been the latter, but I did try multiple times with multiple branches, who all said no.  I am not a scared person by nature, my older brother ensured that I no longer have a flight response growing up, and I have been camping, hiking, climbing, caving, and most of the other adrenaline junkie shit except sky diving and bungee jumping since I was 6 (at least it started there, not all at once).  At this point in my life I just don't have too many fucks to give.  Now I am going to tell you, there are places in the park I work at that scare ME.  A lot just are creepy, but some shit makes me drink when I get home.  I'll start out with a couple stories about the shadows.

I work maintenance at a State Park, and mostly, I work closing shift, AKA Night Shift at this point.  I like it fine, I get to sleep in, as I am a night owl, and I know that shit gets done right at night.  Weekdays I am there an hour after close, so an hour after the sun goes down, and weekends two and a half hours after the sun goes down. You would think that this would be scary in and of itself, dark park, surrounded by trees, knowing that there is all sorts of stuff out there, but, it actually is pretty chill, minus a couple of locations, most of which I will talk about in future posts.  The only natural predators we have are foxes and coyotes, and foxes are more scared of you than you are of them, and the coyotes stay in the heavily wooded areas that only have trails running through them, so I don't have to worry about that.  If you are on one of my trails long enough after dark that you might end up on the business end of a coyote hunt I just have to say, ""Fuck you, I hope you are a good runner or a good fighter.""  Seriously, don't be stupid, that is trespassing to begin with, consider the coyotes our equivalent of bouncers on the trails.  Anyway, the stories I want to tell right now aren't even down in the park.  They are back at the Maintenance Shop.

The first one happened about two years ago now.  I had just finished all of my duties down in the park, flipped off Speedy at Shelter 4 (story for another day) and come back to the Shop yard to drop off the truck and clock out for the night.  As I was pulling into the shop yard, I saw what I thought was one of our volunteers walking by the side of the shop, let's call him Manny.  I was basically just seeing his form as the absence of light in one section, a shadow against the light on the side of the building, not out of the ordinary since that light was dying and barely giving off enough light to see by when you were there.  I started rolling down the window to say ""Hi"" to Manny with a smile on my face when I saw something that wiped it away faster than a drunk getting shot down by a model, I saw Manny, standing over by the Pole Barn, wearing a reflective vest and unloading the Club Car (essentially a golf cart with 4 wheel drive, off road tires and a lift bed).  He had been doing some work down in the park into the night to try and stay out of the heat, and had just gotten done for the night and was putting tools away.  I looked back and saw nothing by the shop.  I was sure I saw him, and even thought, ""He must be going over to use the hose.""  Anyway I parked the car and went over to talk to him.  There were the normal formalities, the ""Hey, how is it going"" but then I asked if he had been over on the side of the building just now, or if someone was helping him.  He told me, ""Nope, just been me here for hours.""  I explained what I saw to him and he just shook his head and said, ""I don't know, but I've seen stuff like that too.""  Yeah, it wasn't my first time either.

A few weeks before this I had been working with what amounted to a State Parks intern.  I won't say exactly which program he was going through, because that would make it way too easy to figure out where I work, but he was normally doing stuff like trail building and boundary marking, and crap like that.  He was temporarily lent over to maintenance as we needed help and he needed to finish his hours, so win-win.  I had sent him off to check the bathrooms in the park while I checked all the trash cans.  Honestly, the day was pretty much like any other until I got my truck into the shop yard and parked it.  I got out of my truck and saw him walking next to the truck he had driven on the passenger side, just a silhouette against the security lights of the building.  Thinking he had just left something in the truck I kept walking and looked down to grab my work keys so I could open the door to the shop.

  I looked up at the shop proper and saw him at the door, unlocking it and heading in.  I looked back over to the truck and there was nothing.  Let me be blunt about this when I say nothing, I am still active in the Boy Scouts and have taken  a lot of instruction in tracking, and have honed those skill in the woods.  The parking lot is gravel and I could easily tell where he had driven in, how many turns it took him to back up into the spot, and the path he took walking from the truck to the door.  On the passenger side the newest tracks I could see were days old at least and weren't in the right place anyway.  There was just no sign that ANYTHING had been walking there.  I went into the shop and asked him about it.  He thought I was fucking with him.  He told me, no, he hadn't been walking on the side of the truck, he had grabbed his shit and headed straight for the door.  It was 10:30 and he was finishing out the end of a 10 hour shift so there also was no way he was going to be running the 20 yards from the truck to the door.

After all this happened there is not much to report on it, except Manny is not working into the night alone anymore.  He said he had seen too many of those... shadows and hearing a few too many things in the shop yard late at night, so he is willing to take the heat if it means not having to deal with that anymore.  In case you are wondering, no I don't know what the hell these things are, and no, these aren't the things I am scared of.  Don't get me wrong, they aren't my favorite things to deal with, but compared to some of the other shit, they are practically background noise.

Until next time 204 signing off."

I'm having issues trying to find an internship just so I can graduate (300 hours needed) with my Bachelor's. The problem is that a lot of companies don't seem to like anyone without hands-on experience (even an intern trying) so I decided to try and build a portfolio.

Obligatory this didnt happen today, but roughly 10yrs ago.

In Germany, school students around age 13-16 have to do an obligatory internship for 4-6weeks at a job you choose. For me, I wanted to try out nursing at the local hospital for this time, so I put in an application and got accepted. The first 3 of the 4 weeks were awesome fun and I learned a lot, but the last week was fairly stressful, and this is where my FU happened.

I usually always bought food at the local kiosk/cafeteria for lunch break, but the day before this FU my Grandma cooked an amazingly good, massive dinner so I had enough left over to bring with me for my lunch break. Now we never had a microwave at home and I was used to heating stuff back up in a pot/pan on the stovetop instead of in a microwave, but our breakroom ONLY had a microwave. So during the morning break I mentioned that someone needs to explain to me how this magical device that heats up food instantly works and how to use it. Everyone joked and left back for work saying theyll explain it later.

Now shortly before lunch break, my Boss came up to me, put a Bloodbag into my hand saying ""go warm it up for transfusion, please"" and walked on into his office. Me being the naive, dumb intern who has not performed this meaningful task yet, thought of ways of heating up a bloodbag in a fast, safe way. And then the great thought struck my mind, ""The microwave in the break room!"" Now some of you can probably see where this is heading. Me being the naive intern idiot, that never has experienced the magic of microwaves thought to myself ""I bet thats how they always do it! Super fast, super efficient... if it works for food it should work for blood!"" and strolled over into the break room with my important task at hand. I reached the wonderful machine, put in the bloodbag, waited for a minute, thinking about how to operate this wonder of modern technology that was somehow built in the 80's according to its look, then decided to press the 2minutes button and closed the door. And heureka the machine sprung to live, emitting a steady humming sound with a lamp inside turned on so I could watch the blood slowly rotate on the little plate. Now I of course was not up to stand around staring at blood for 2 minutes so I sat down and took out my phone. around a minute later my Boss walked in for his break and asked me, if ""This is this amazing Dinner my grandma cooked, in the microwave"" and ""if he could try any if its as good as I claimed"" Now I just looked up from my phone, smiled and stated ""Nono, its the bloodbag you wanted me to heat up!"" and he stopped dead in his track, looked at me and asked ""Youre joking, right?!"" to which I replied ""No? I thought if it works for food, it works for blood. How else was I supposed to do it?!""

As soon as he heard that I could watch the color drain from his face and after a few miliseconds of his brain processing this information, he darted over to the microwave. But as fate, much like Karma, can be a fucking bitch, as soon as he pressed the button to open the door and it sprung open, there was sudden a loud BANG, and my Boss started screaming in agonizing Pain! When I reached him his pants and arm were covered in Blood, as was the entire Microwave and pretty much everything in a radius of ~2m around said machine. I felt sick to my stomach thinking that I made a mistake in operating the machine so it took revenge by injuring my Boss so hard that everything was immediately covered in Blood! He was squirming on the ground in the big blood puddle asking for help, so I ran out of the room and alerted the other Nurses of the incident. The first Nurse who reacted to my calls for help arrived and applied first aid, then the others stormed in, asking about what happened, so I started explaining: ""I was supposed to warm up the bloodbag so I put it in the microwave and turned it on but must have done something wrong and the microwave exploded!"" My colleages were suddenly all looking at me with shock and confusion in their eyes until one simply yelled out ""you did WHAT?!"" after explaining again how I must have misoperated the microwave they yelled at me that you cannot heat up a bloodbag in a damn microwave or the blood bag will build up pressure and explode like an egg! They then told me that they warm it up using a small Tub of warm water in the sink.

The rest of the Nurses were treating our Boss who turns out is not the cause of this gore-fest in our break room, but only has burned his arm and slightly his legs due to the piping hot, sticky, gewy blood that shot at him as soon as he opened the damned machine. In the end I was tasked by the Janitorial staff to clean up the mess that I created because they (understandably) flat out refused to clean Blood from the floor, Ceiling, Wall, Furniture and a lot more. After an hour of watching me clean, they realized that it takes more than one person to clean and said that I had my punishment and helped me clean (thank god!). It still took us from 1pm to 8pm to clean everything. If you want to imagine the mess I created: think about a vial filled with red paint, and think about how much you can cover with that single vial. That vial is at most 15ml. An average bloodbag has 300ml, soo yea... quite the mess.

All in all, I didnt get into any trouble, neither did anyone of the staff for ""not supervising an intern"". The bloodbag costs, cleaning, microwave etc. was all covered by my work-insurance. And my Boss got a nice two week holidays out of it to take care of his burnt arm.

Tl:dr Was tasked with warming up a bloodbag and shoved it unknowingly of the possible outcome into the microwave. The hot blood (when the bag exploded) covered my Boss, burning him and basically 90% of the break room"

I later found a job at a different company doing devops/SRE work, but the transition from doing research to active firefighting turned out to be too much for me.

I'm currently trying to find another position (I'm based in Silicon Valley). I love doing research, but unfortunately it's very difficult to find a research position without a PhD; I only have an MS in computer science, and the PhD is the union card for being a researcher. I've had some successful software engineering internships in the past, but the interview process for full-time software engineering roles has always been very difficult for me. I can answer FizzBuzz questions just fine, and I can also answer straightforward questions about algorithms and data structures, but I have a hard time with the more puzzle-like programming questions found on sites like Codility and HackerRank. I also don't have any side projects or open source work to show since I spent my undergrad years focused on preparing for grad school, and I spent my grad school years focused on coursework and research.

What other types of positions would be good for someone in my situation? I would love a research position, but it will be difficult without a PhD. I've thought about becoming a lecturer at a community college or a university, teaching computer science courses; while it's too late for the fall semester/quarter, it may be possible for the spring semester/winter quarter.

Any advice is appreciated!,NonSupportiveCup,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/95yhyh/halp_looking_for_a_job_only_with_certs_any_advice/,"Backstory: I have an associates, two actually! One in science(Biology) and another in a somewhat useless computer programming curriculum. I let the community college talk me in to finishing this since I was already taking their basic introductory C++ and Java classes along side the transfer Associates requirements. 

At this point in my education I am working very slowly (1 or 2 classes a semester) at a 4-year in their CS curriculum. I will be at least 45 by the time I complete this (will be 43 in 2 months. I feel insane for making a career change at this point, let alone one I've been working on slowly for 5 years already). My goal has always been to finish my education and get out manufacturing for a programming career. Nowadays, I am very concerned about age discimination. Feeling too old for a development job. I have some decisions to make.

Either way, I need to escape manufacturing. The bad hours, and pay, are too much of a hindrance. I'm exhausted all the time from the hours and working conditions. This affects my grades, sleeping schedule, family life, etc and I am having too much trouble reaching my goals while working this kind of work.   


Finally the point! I want a shitty help desk job!   
So, I will be buying A+ vouchers this weekend with my student discount. With the intention of taking the test very soon and completing Net+ and Sec+ by October. If not sooner.   
I have one semester of 'help desk' experience. Federal work study had placed me in a public library where I basically helped residents with any problem they came with. Cellphones, reclaiming yahoo emails, job boards, not applying for jobs on scam sites, resumes, word. So many yahoo emails. Basic computer usage and Office programs stuff.   


After I get my resume reviewed and updated, probably tomorrow, I will be ready to send out applications.   


Should I wait till I have at least A+ completed? How can I sell myself to a place successfully with this experience (or lack thereof) and just my intentions for a better life?  
Today I will be heading into my current workplace to feel out human resources for any IT related positions. Any suggestions on how to sell them on even an internship?  


Another branch of questions (I know, I know. Bear with me)  
What can I be doing in my limited personal time to prepare for an IT environment. I have some HD space I can partition and install Linux on. Can I use virtualization to emulate a network to practice admin type things? I'm not going to stop coding entirely, I know it will be useful in any branch, but what can I do at home on my own network to prepare for an IT career? For the future!  


Thanks for reading my plea. Thanks if you made it this far. Any halp advice, or even criticism, is greatly appreciated.   
Off to work. So I will not be able to respond for at least 9 hours. "

I've also taken the important math classes like discrete and linear and stuff. Their using python and I guess I'm just overwhelmed. My programming skills aren't that great, although both of the classes were easy. I'm going to UCSD in the fall as a transfer and the engineers working with me went to like MIT and got PHDs. How do I do well when I know nothing? I guess my beast strength is learning a bit quick thanks to the math courses, but even then I'm still rusty cause I've been surfing everyday. Any tips?"

My medication and therapy lasped when I ended my internship and May, and I didn't get insurance until this month. I won't be able to go back on medication until early september. Like many of us do at least once a year, I thought I could go without medication, even after my doctor said that I was one of the more severe cases he's worked with! My dumb ass thought because I had a curated to-do list and was smart that I could try and do everything by myself. But I can't. My ADHD is a real god damn disability and for some reason I just can't grasp that. I live in a very small apartment without a focused ""work space"", and the library across the street has private study rooms, but they are only available for two hours and I generally need them 4-6 hours. I think I should rent an office of some kind if i'm going to keep freelancing. 

All that being said, I am about 4 weeks in to a deep fuck up and I need to un-fuck that. I got sick with a severe flu that made it impossble to do anything I needed to do for about 12 days, and before that I was juggling being extremely broke and navigating bills and debt collector calls. 

I am now financially in the black, but I still have a lot of chores to do and I'm paralyzed in which I need to do, even though I drank a liter of coffee and took one of my old ritalin pills to try and focus today. I really need a second opinion on what I need to do between now and tomorrow afternoon. 

I also am experiencing technical based road blocks- my drawing tablet has malfunctioned, and my keyboard is missing keys. In order to take it to get fixed and cleaned, it costs money. But I have no money because I can't finish these projects. But I can't finish these projects because my tablet is fried!!! I'm ready to just apply for a terrible interest credit card just so that I can get my stuff fixed so that i can actually finish my work, but I'm too embarrassed to reach out to my clients and say that my old hardware has malfunctioned to the point that I can't finish things on time, but I still need that money. I feel like such a failure because I've already had to issue refunds because I recognized that I dropped the ball, bad, and I don't want to harm relationships with clients. I have no one I can ask for help from. s

I'm a cs student at the end of my undergrad studies. I didn't know where to post it exactly so I've decided to post in a cs career related sub.

I've had a couple of rough years behind me loosing focus on my studies, mounting problems at home and general laziness, I've crept slowly back up again, but I'm now behind my peers who I've started with by almost 2 and a half years. I have little work experience (well that once internship ages ago doesn't count for much), my grades fell from really good to average at best and I haven't done that much extra CS stuff outside of school. I've recently started to get into hardware programming and was also starting to read some intro works for the linux kernel but I still haven't recovered the burning passion I've started with.

Seeing so many of my peers advancing and starting their careers in really good positions, seeing other cs people seemingly spend so much time on interesting stuff and reading about hiring requirements of software developers makes me feel like I am lazy and wasting my life. At this point, I don't even know why anyone would hire me...

Family is already pressuring every day about finishing and a job and I honestly feel ashamed by telling people increasingly far-fetched justifications.

Now the application deadline for an entry into a graduate program next term have either passed for some universities or are about to expire and I haven't even started with my thesis, yet organized it. So there might be another term wasted by just.....not doing well enough apparently.

962itm,2,2018-08-09,Feeling nervous / under qualified about a new position offered to me. I'm a sophomore in College who's been coding for &lt; 1 year.,johnjk456,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/962itm/feeling_nervous_under_qualified_about_a_new/,"Hello,

Sorry if this has been asked and answered already, but currently I feel under qualified for a position I'll most likely be accepting, and I don't know what to do or how to feel about it. I'm wondering if this is a normal dilemma for people to go through when they accept their first *real* developer position.

In the fall, I'll be a second year Computer Science student. Before I came to University, I didn't know anything about code, but I've been told by many that I'm a quick learner and that I'm ahead of others my age. I don't mean to sound like I'm boasting since I'm actually looking for legitimate advice, so **here's my question:**

My problem is that I feel under qualified for this position since it is in a language that isn't particularly my strongest (Python) and uses many micro-service technologies that I'm not very familiar with. However, at the same time I feel like I could do really well at this new company and learn a lot. The offer is a part time position that pays double what I currently make at my shitty part time job I worked last year during school, and offers work from home since I will be going back to school at the time of my start date.

I just finished my first internship at a bank in upstate NY, and although I felt like it was slightly unfulfilling (doing SQL work in an outdated query language, using closed license software, very boring project, etc.), my older friends who have gone off to graduate and receive full time positions at companies like Amazon, Bloomberg, Cisco, etc. have told me it was a really good start, and that I should use it as a ""stepping stone"" for the rest of my career.  

Is this a normal feeling for people when they get their first *legitimate* position, or any new position for that matter? Should I be nervous? How can I make the most out of my new job if/when I accept it while trying to balance a heavy course load during school?"

Won't bore you with extended story. So, I graduated last year with a BSc in CS and Math. Honestly, barely finished it. Average grades, did well on my math and theoretical CS courses but sucked at all coding involved courses.

Fast forward, got hired early 2018 and started working as full stack dev in a small company. They put me in a already developed project and asked me to add certain new features. The project has been built using technologies like ASP .NET , C#, Javascript, Kendo UI etc. The project is building Outlook Add-ins so a lot of Outlook REST API involved.

After 2-3 months I finally managed to complete some tasks. Then another struggle begin when I started extending Kendo UI components and adding new controllers etc. Sometimes I don't finish a simple tasks for days or weeks. It gets really frustrated. Most days it is 90% i don't know what the hell I am doing and feel lost.

They assigned a senior dev to me , but there is so many questions I can ask him on lunch time or whenever he has time.

Having no prior experience , no internship, doing poor in undergrad, I feel like I have been thrown to huge jungle with no tools to cut off branches to get off.

I dont like giving excuses for my circumstances but I think it would be better if started little slow, under some guidance , maybe watching someone doing stuff, maybe working on project with senior dev, watch him lead, at least for one project. That would be a little slow but in 6 months I could have learn a ton. Now all I do try to make things work somehow so I can make it to deadline. No efficiency, no good practice of coding, not that someone stops me doing all those, but I barely make the deadlines.

I am sure somebody has been there too. What do you guys think of my situation. How can I make most out of it."

I'm a canadian student at McGill Computer Engineering. I want to do a masters degree in computer science in AI/ML (particularly interested in computer vision). I am entering fourth year with two years left in my degree (extra year because of internship and extra philosophy/computer science classes). I currently have a 3.46 GPA which is improving. The goal is to have somewhere between 3.5-3.6 by the time I graduate. I also have 12 months of internship experience. I have 4 computer science classes that I took that I have A/A- in besides data structures and algorithms which I got a B in. This includes a graduate level class in machine learning that I got an A in. I plan to take more computer science courses including a course in AI next year. 

  
Next summer I have the option of doing an internship or trying to get research experience. Optimally i'd get both but I'm not as competitive as others. Ideally i'd like paid computer science research but since I'm in engineering with a lower end GPA, it would be really hard for me to get such a position from my school. I also don't have any computer science classes in the fall and i'm not even sure who to talk to about getting research other than just applying, which would likely not work out. I would probably have to take out a loan to finish my degree if I did research over the summer, and if I worked i'd be well off without stress. I probably wouldn't get a paid research position, so research would cost me more than 20,000 in lost income over the summer. I  have money saved up, but I pay for my apartment, food, car, everything. I also have a girlfriend which is also expensive! (even though we split everything). 

My goal is to work in automation. I want to free up labour. I want to be equipped with AI/ML to do this professionally. Do you think it's possible for me to get into a graduate school without research experience in Canada? I would also be inclined to do research after undergrad somewhere if it was paid before applying to graduate school. I just don't know if I can actually find this unicorn. 

Thanks for reading. I'd appreciate your advice :)"

Went to get my MS in Information Technology right after and did great at it and graduated. 

I have been actively doing interviews over the summer to get the interview process down better and hopefully find a mid to entry level job as I don’t have any enterprise experience or a great resume builder, mainly internships and freelance work. 

I had an interview for a state job and it went better than expected and they offered me 2 hours after I had the interview. The job is basically to use the newest version of Angular to develop a new app for the company. I have low level experience with Angular but I am great with HTML5/CSS3 and some what good with JavaScript but need to learn more jQuery as well. 

I want to take the offer, but I’m a little fearful that I might be lacking some of the Angular skills they really want. I did say that I have made only 2 basic Angular apps and my experience with that and they must of liked it and my other answers. It’s offering a good amount of money, but I am going through a recruiting firm for the first 6 months with them. 

My main question is, should I not be so worried and just give it all I can? I keep thinking I lack some of the skills and I don’t want to lose this opportunity. They want me to start at the end of August so that gives me some time to get Angular more under my belt, but am I just worrying to much or should I take the offer? 

Any advise would be very much appreciated!"
968iwq,2,2018-08-10,Chances? With networking,joshuak1045,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/968iwq/chances_with_networking/,"Trying to figure out my chances of getting into a big 4 company, and would really appreciate any advice/help/input. It may be a lot but I wanted to put the details out there to see my chances.

Im currently going into my senior year at a huge huge state school with a pretty well known accounting program that all 4 big 4 recruits heavily from (this I know for sure). However, as great as that sounds, I'm actually majoring in economics and business administration, since I only switched into accounting my junior year and it was too late to switch my major without having to stay like 4+ years. So here I am. On top of that, my GPA isn't that great (3.2 thanks to my previous pre med classes).

However, hopefully not all hope is lost. I do plan on doing an MBA, MAcc or MST to get that CPA, and I made that really clear in my resume and my networks. I have some pretty good experience. I started in a regional public accounting firm in their tax department. I prepared all different types of returns during this past busy season and my resume definitely details that. If all hope is lost and I don't get a big 4 internship/offer, this firm invited me back to their next tax season, so at least I can fall back on that. I also am currently working at a well-known luxury brand's tax accounting department and so I have a good amount of public and private experience, which I personally think is not bad for only being one year in accounting as a junior.

Here's ultimately where my chance thing comes in. I am getting very close to my VP, who previously was a director of tax at PwC and was with that company for 8+ years. That same PwC office also audits us, and so she's in really close contact with that office and still keeps in touch with them since she is now technically their client. I asked her if she could help me get any kind of position at PwC (audit, tax, etc.) at any level (intern or associate) and she said she was totally willing and had me send her my resume with the positions PwC posted that I was interested in, so I did. She told me she would directly give my information to the tax partner she works directly with, and has known for her 8+ career. People told me she's gotten other interns into big 4 before, but my pessimistic mind is thinking they probably had 3.9s and were accounting majors haha. A coworker of mine also said she knows an auditor at PwC in NY and can put in a good word for me, but I'm not sure what position that auditor is and it's also different offices so it couldn't hurt to try that route too.

I also had a family friend who retired from KPMG put in a word and my resume with my campus recruiter. The recruiter said she would reach out to me once the fall semester recruitment starts, but I'm not sure if that's just an empty promise or could be something.

Ultimately, I'm wondering how important these networks are and if they are enough to cover some weaknesses in my application (not accounting, semi-low GPA). I know PwC can be very strict/traditional with their recruitment, but I'm hoping getting a direct in from the VP of tax from one of their top clients that also worked 8+ years with them as a director will help...I'm just desperate to get into big 4 haha and would love any opinions! thanks for sticking it out! lol"
969b8a,2,2018-08-10,"Is leetcoding an ""efficient"" use of my time if I'm learning as I go?",baddad25,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/969b8a/is_leetcoding_an_efficient_use_of_my_time_if_im/,"As the title suggests, no formal CS education yet. I'm a finance major (senior) who just recently picked up a CS minor. I've taken one CS course so far which taught C and to build scripts that print to the console.  I discovered the CS field 3 years too late, but I'm doing whatever I can to get into it without doing 4 more years of school since there's barely any overlap between CS and finance majors. 

I'm trying to prepare for technical interviews since I'm trying to get a 2019 internship. I’ll have my CS minor done by the end of the spring semester, however interviews will be sooner than that. I'd ideally like to be ""prepared enough"" to interview successfully in about two months - my school (midsize state school, not a huge CS school but near Boston) has a career fair in the beginning of October.

Basically, I'm wondering if solving leetcode problems and learning the data structures/algorithms as I attempt to solve the problems is a smart way to become relatively good at interviewing, quickly. I know that as I progress through the CS minor (course titles below) I'll become more familiar with the concepts, however I need a solid baseline to be able to interview with companies in a few short months.

I understand any concern that I may be ""cheating myself"" in terms of not actually learning the material, but I'm able to treat it academically, take notes, study the actual ComSci behind the DS&amp;A's used, etc. The point is to make sure that I'm able to do these problems without any resources, so I'd just be wasting precious time by cheating myself!

CS courses that will be taken before Summer 2019: Computing 1 – computing 4 (implementation of data structures, performance analysis, OOP and related CS concepts, OOP analysis and design, APIs and program design.), assembly languages, and algorithm analysis.

*EDIT*:
First comment pointed out that my goals weren't clear, I agree so I'd like to clarify. My end goal is to work as a software developer rather than in the finance field. I don't have a specific type of tech that I'm set to work on, however I've taken a interest in full stack web apps over other areas so far. Cloud apps also intrigue me but I haven't taken the time to learn about them yet. I know a lot about ERP software (and how awful it is for the most part) from my finance background so I could leverage that. I would like to work on tech that scales and is available to lots of people. 

**Tl;dr**

Finance major in senior year, just picked up a CS minor. Really good work ethic and soft skills but lacking CS fundamentals right now. CS minor will be done by summer 2019 when I’d intern. Have to interview in a few months for internships, wondering if it’s smart to keep leetcoding and teaching myself why/how each problem works, or if there’s a better way.

So I recently had a phone interview for an internship with a big cloud-managed networking company in the Bay Area and it went really well (mainly personality questions and some basic questions about DHCP, DNS, TCP vs UDP, etc.). 

They told me they plan on having me do a 60-minute WebEx interview with one of their Network Support Engineers and it'll delve much deeper into networking fundamentals/troubleshooting procedure. Do you guys have tips on what to focus on/know for the interview? I'm mainly concerned about the troubleshooting aspect as I do have a lot of desktop support experience but not as much hands-on networking experience. 

Any advice from you guys would be extremely helpful! Thank you!"

The semester is starting soon and it's giving me anxiety! It feels like each semester I am constantly telling myself to not let the competitiveness at Cal get to me, and to not get jaded and start hating everything.

I could go on and on about what I struggle with at Cal... My one best friend graduated last semester and moved to the other side of the country. I struggle with feeling lonely despite being really social and generally well liked. I feel like I don't belong in the STEM/tech because I've never had a internship or I don't know what block chain is (lol). The list could go on... 

I'm involved in a few student organizations that I really really love but it feels like they are not enough to make up for all the struggles I've had in my two years at Cal. I'm studying abroad (not this fall) as a way to get away from campus for a semester, but I also don't want to spend the rest of my time at Berkeley with the ""I just got to get out in 2 years""  or ""the pain is almost over"" mindset.

I'm currently pursuing a bachelors in computer science from a fairly reputable private Indian college and I graduate July 2019. I have a GPA of 8 (out of 10). About a year ago, I decided to pursue Data science as my career option simply because its the only thing I won't do just for they money (I fucking love it, actually).

So, I decided to work in R and was able to get a remote summer internship at a London based startup. I have built 2 projects, working on the 3rd, and I'm working for another side project on a CNN (that's pretty much all my CV, even though I plan to finish with 5 projects by the end of August)

I want to pursue Masters in Data Science in Europe right after graduation. I've been preparing for GRE as well - which I'll give by the end of September. 

I simply don't know which countries and universities to aim for/ choose. I'm not considering US because of the political scene and much higher cost across the whole degree.

So, can anybody please advice me on which colleges I'm likely to get into? And which would be unlikely but possible? Everything counts while choosing which countries to go to - finances, expected salaries, taxes, medical costs, standard of living, everything.

96d1ur,212,2018-08-10,Job search post mortem (new grad),FitBasil,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/96d1ur/job_search_post_mortem_new_grad/,"### Basic Information

* I applied to a total of 33 job postings.
* I received a positive response from 10 companies or recruiters.
* Out of those 10:
 * 1 companies ghosted me after expressing interest and did not reply to further emails.
 * 1 company changed the job description.
 * 3 companies rejected me after multiple technical interviews.
 * 3 companies were still doing interviews with me when I received an offer.
 * 2 companies invited me to an onsite after multiple technical interviews.

### Job Boards
Out of the 10 companies I received positive responses from:

* 4/10 were from StackOverflow Jobs.
* 2/10 were from BuiltInNYC.com
* 3/10 were from indeed.com
* 1/10 was from a recruiter contacting me from LinkedIn.

Out of all 33 job postings I applied to:

* 10/33 were from Indeed.
* 6/33 were from BuiltInNYC
* 7/33 were from StackOverflow Jobs.

**TLDR; I had a response rate of 57% from Stackoverflow, 33% from BuiltInNYC, and 30% from Indeed. I did not receive responses from any others.**

### Company Details

* Every company I received a response from was a small to midsized startup.
* I applied to 7 companies with employee counts close to or greater than 100, and did not receive a response from any.
* The only well-known company I applied to was JP MorganChase. 


### Job Posting Details

* 8/33 jobs I applied to were explicitly marked JUNIOR.
 * 2/8 progressed to technical interviews that I did not pass.
 * 1/8 ghosted me after expressing interest.
 * 1/8 was still interviewing me when I finally received an offer.
* 25/33 jobs I applied either did not specify a required experience level, or required 3+ years of experience. Of these, I received interest from 6.
 * 2/6 progressed to technical interviews that I did not pass.
 * 2/6 were still interviewing me when I finally received an offer.
 * 1/6 progressed to an onsite.
 * 1/6 changed the job description during interviews, but wanted to continue with my candidacy. 

**TLDR; I had a much higher response rate (50%) from jobs marked JUNIOR than other jobs, but subjectively felt they were less interested in me and was not successfully in securing an onsite from them. I had a lower response rate (25%) from mid-level jobs, but a much higher success rate (got 2 onsites and was still interviewing at other places).**


### About Me
I just graduated college. I completed 3 internships in college. I was looking for Python or JS jobs, primarily backend/frontend/fullstack webdev. I am not from a ""target"" school but my college wasn't bad either. It has a good reputation regionally. I began looking for jobs at the beginning of May, and stopped at the end of June. I wrote custom cover letters for the first 10 jobs I applied to, then began to reuse them. I sent a cover letter with every application. 



### My Thoughts &amp; Main Takeaways

* Applying on StackOverflow Jobs felt better and resulted in a higher response rates. It felt like the companies on SO were more professional and considerate overall.
* It seems like junior positions get so many applications that it might not even be worth applying to them. I saw this in effect on AngelList, where junior postings got upwards of 100+ apps while midlevel and senior postings got around 20. 
* Applying to large companies feels like throwing your resume into a black hole.
* LeetCode prep helped me somewhat but the person interviewing me was by far the biggest factor in whether I did well or not.
* If you are a student or jobseeker, you should **ABSOLUTELY** go to career fairs or any place where you can physically make sure a human sees your resume. Alternatively, directly contact recruiters or hiring managers on LinkedIn with a short note, your resume, and the role you are interested in. I wish I had done this because online applications are a crapshoot.
* Location matters, a lot. Some companies I spoke with were reluctant to bring me in for onsite (pay for flight, hotel, etc) so they just kept on scheduling video call after video call. I had a feeling that if I lived there it would be way easier to get an onsite.


Hope this helps someone. Feel free to ask any questions."
96d3ot,7,2018-08-10,I feel betrayed by people I thought were friends,AdministrativeAerie8,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/96d3ot/i_feel_betrayed_by_people_i_thought_were_friends/,"Background:

I am currently a summer marking intern at a relatively small company in New York City. Basically, all the interns (there are about twelve of us) get together every Thursday night for drinks at a local bar. At first, I was never invited to these meet-ups because I was relatively shy and lacked confidence. I then became friendly over time with one of the other interns who worked as a sales analysis intern, as we worked on a few projects together. I get an invitation at the middle of July to join them for drinks. I am super excited as I do not have many friends through school or work. As a PSA, I do not drink alcohol, so I have been having club soda. 

Anyhow, the first three weeks go by and I feel real comfortable with the eight other interns in this 'Thursday Night Bar Group' (it's the name of the GroupMe). It is at a point where I even get lunch with them too, although I do not see many of them throughout the day because they are working in different floors of the office building. 

Fast forward to this past Monday and I asked my group what time and where we should meet for lunch. No one responds, not even the sales analyst intern. I figured everyone must be busy, so I eat lunch by myself. Then the next day, Tuesday, I ask the same question. No response. I then go to a local deli that we tend to go to and I notice the Thursday Group all sitting together eating their sandwiches. I pretend like I am not upset or anything and try to converse with them. 

So, last night I asked the group through GroupMe where we are going for drinks tonight. One of the interns even asked if everyone is okay with going to this bar (that is about 15-20 minutes away walking distance). I figured everything is back to normal, as I proceed to ask what time we should leave. I did not get a single response from any of the interns. 

I have been quite upset recently and I have turned myself into an anti-social person to all my co-workers. I just feel betrayed as I do not know what I did wrong. I do not think I portrayed myself as being needy, wanted, or annoying. I asked a couple interns for their social media links, but they did not accept or follow me back on Facebook and Instagram.

96dqca,3,2018-08-10,Will a product management internship be looked at less favorably than an SWE role for future SWE internships/jobs?,swepmcsthrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/96dqca/will_a_product_management_internship_be_looked_at/,"Hi! For some backstory, I'm an incoming sophomore CS and business double major female student at a good university (and is top \~25 in CS). I was a software engineering intern this past summer at a small sized company that's respected within the tech industry. I am okay with programming most of the day and did fine in the internship but I've figured out I don't truly enjoy programming as a career and was unable to relate to a lot of the other developer interns (who excitedly talked about new technologies, pursuing side projects, and studying for technical interviews). Also, compounded by the fact that I still don't have a lot of experience and have not taken the majority of the classes in my school for my CS major, I do not think I am naturally the best/brightest programmer... just kind of average, and I don't think I have the innate drive to become the best programmer I can be by constantly learning and refreshing my existing knowledge. Honestly I've tried and even though I like CS, I feel like I lack a natural spark. I'm hoping further CS classes in the upcoming semester will help me change this mindset. 

Because of this, in conjunction with my background and that I like working with people, I've been seeking business analyst and product management roles for next summer (I'm still looking for SWE roles as well), as I think I may be a better fit for them. However, I do have some concerns in the event that I end up in one of those roles as opposed to a dev role:

* Since these are less technical roles, will a sophomore internship as a business analyst or product management intern be looked down upon as opposed to a sophomore software engineering role in the event that I enjoy those fields less, and decide to go back to pursuing software engineering internships my junior year/full time? (In conjunction with the fact that I was an SWE intern already after freshman year).
* As I'm also majoring in business, my opportunities are still pretty open and I'm also considering going into consulting/similar fields that deviate further from tech. In that case, on the other hand would a business analyst or product management role help me get those opportunities better than a software engineering role?

I know the main point of internships are to try new opportunities out, but I'm afraid my indecisiveness and desire to try multiple roles out will prevent me from taking a solid path that might be more reliably achieved by honing in on a specific role (SWE). What should I do, and be thinking about from here?

Thanks everyone!"

This wasn't a big tech company, but a bank where they hire most interns. First let me give you some backstory.

I have always doubted whether I would be a successful programmer; in high school I excelled in history and politics. I pursued a BA, not a BS, in CS in college, and am doing reasonably well because of my efforts. I have had some rough spots where I considered changing majors, but stuck with it, and learned some c,java,python, and sql in the process. However, my general skills at reasoning and logic are wanting, so I am weak on concepts like algorithmic efficiency and design patterns. I am currently a rising senior.

Two months ago I started my second Internship, and I messed it up terribly. The first two weeks I was not given a lot of work because my team was already in the middle of a huge project. My mentor told me to read the codebase. I did, but was slow to start, because I did not know where to begin, and slow to understand. By 3 weeks, I understood some of what junit tests and what spring was, two concepts heavily used in the code base, but I could not really contribute. However, I would volunteer for a few little tasks each week. Feeling that I was not doing enough, I started staying behind late to be with the team, who would stay until late, asking questions. This ended up leading to a habit of staying up late and showing up exhausted the next day, and many days going by wasted.  At work, without any hard deadlines or tasks, I held myself to a low standard and distracted myself with my phone for hours, looking up theology and history books. My manager was so stressed with the project that I could get away with this. So I was listless and useless for many weeks-I think around 3. I would go to work and be mentally disengaged. I tried to give myself goals to do, but never fulfilled them, and no one held me accountable to any objective. I did end up learning about, in a general sense, the overall flow of control in the code, the Spring framework, JUNIT testing, JDBC Templates, Jms Templates, and dataGrid Caches, and but at a slow and extremely inefficient pace.  Towards the end, my manager gave me two small projects, and I did each, although I was not good at keeping tabs with him each day about my progress. He also observed me use my phone for breaks during the weeks I had these tasks assigned, which annoyed him. When I finished each, I wanted to show him, but he was not interested. 

Another sort of bad tendency, throughout the internship, was staying in my own little bubble. I was sort of intimidated by my coworkers because I did not want to annoy them-they seemed busy. But eventually I just wanted to stay in my own little lane of laziness, and obvs. they noticed whenever they came by my desk that I was browsing my phone or chewing gum.

I learned today that during the weeks where I would lazily “read code,” he was expecting me to take initiative and come up with ideas. I regret sleeping late, which made me tardy some days, but overall made me unproductive. I regret not taking this internship for the gift it was. I just blew a six figure job away. I feel stupid and entitled (why was I so sure I would get a return offer?), but now feel the need for personal discipline and to really start coding and reading coding books in my free time. Essentially, I was exhausted for many days and spent my hours distracted and not working. I sort of dislike school though, and am afraid, with my BA, that I blew my lucky break. Overall, I am thinking that this profession may not be for me. My plan is to start doing leetCode every day ( I have done some problems), to read books on CS, and to finish a personal project website in my free time. I don't know if I will get as great of an opportunity as this one again, or if I am cut out for industry. Most of all,  I am pissed that this first real test-the culmination of all my effort in school-is one I completely wasted and did not take seriously."
96ea5e,71,2018-08-11,Kobe Beef: A Delicacy,cycloppotamis,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/96ea5e/kobe_beef_a_delicacy/,"Anyone in the service industry can tell you that the general public sucks. Especially in the more urban areas, where the white people are pretentious and entitled if they tip well, and everyone else has a chip in their shoulder and barely tips, if at all. It certainly doesn’t help that we’re right down the hill from the projects.

This is gonna be a long story, so bear with me, but all of this is relevant so it’s kinda necessary. It started innocently enough; calling the tow truck on a regular that parked illegally because he treats our staff like shit and never tips. Making the Shirly Temple for the snot-nosed brats with 90% grenadine and 10% Sierra Mist so they’re literally bouncing off the goddamn walls by the time the chef leaves the hibachi table. Only God can help the bitch mother with 3 sugar-high kids when it comes time to strap those ungrateful should-have-been-abortions into the car as they practically convulse. And I doubt even God, if there is one, has sympathy for the stupid bitch after treating their server like some fucking second-rate citizen for a $5 tip on her $80 check. Fuckin’ people, man. The petty revenge, though, I honestly didn’t mind. Sugar up that crotch-fruit. Tell that asshole parking is free and then call the tow your damn self. Anything to get a little satisfaction, knowing that karma can sneak up on ya once in a while. 

 To clarify, I manage a hibachi restaurant. It doesn’t pay that well and all I hear are problems that I have to solve all day long, but hey, it pays the bills. I worked my way up with this company, starting out as a host, and progressively to management, which I wouldn’t have accepted in the first place if it weren’t for the benefits. Naturally, with my experience, I have empathy for my employees. I’ve been on the inside of that hibachi table, smiling at those resting-bitch faces. Now I get to tell people “no,” and be the bad guy so my front-of-house staff members don’t have to and then see a big fat zero on the tip line as a result. 

 Moving on, my staff started off doing this passive-aggressive shit to the especially shitty clientele. I really didn’t care, until it started to become destructive. That started with Dave, one of our chefs. Dave is an older dude, late thirties or early forties. Not bad lookin’ for his age, but not that good lookin’ either. Anyway, he was seeing one of our servers, Rachel. That’s not important right now, but it will be later. 

One lunch Dave got into a tiff with a customer, some asshat claiming that he wanted his filet “well done, but extra juicy.” Dave was pretty much like “dude, you can’t have it both ways, if its cooked all the way through it’s going to be less tender and juicy” and then this guy got all jacked off and insisted that a *chef* in a *steakhouse* doesn’t know how to prepare a *steak*. I get called over. I tell Dave to throw extra butter on it. Problem solved, for now at least. Later, during the last big fire that Dave does at the table before leaving, he “accidentally” overshot the oil from the squeeze bottle so that it streamed across the table and all over this guy’s Gucci shirt. Of fucking course it was Gucci. Couldn’t be rocking a normal white polo to go out to lunch, gotta flex a little, right? 

So, we paid his fuckin’ dry-cleaning bill. I have a talk with Dave and he insists it was an accident, but I don’t buy it for a fucking second. Anyway, shit like this continues to happen every once in a while. One time, Dave even caught this lady’s wig on fire. That, honestly, was fucking hilarious. This bitch’s friends couldn’t even contain their laughter after it happened. The fact that her friends laughed at her helped us out, because she was low-key pissed about that wig but didn’t wanna look like a mega-bitch in front of her friends. I probably would have complained if it were me, but the restaurant Gods smiled upon me that day, because by some miracle she didn’t ask to see me about it. 

The problem was, though, that by getting away with it, Dave was starting to get the rest of the chefs in on it. Til one day Joe, another hibachi chef, *literally* set a motherfucker on fire. Like, intentionally. The fire department was called, we had to evacuate, then paramedics, the owner got sued and I was ripped a new asshole because it happened on MY shift. Fuckin’ Joe. Goddamn. So, we fired Joe. I mean, petty revenge is fine, but that guy’s face is never gonna look the same again. Yeah, maybe he’ll think twice before cussing out a dude with sharp objects, vodka, and a lighter within reach, but what the actual fuck, dude, that’s not okay. 

It wasn’t long after Joe left us that I noticed a change in the staff. It was hard to put my finger on at first, though. If you’ve worked in a restaurant before, you know that servers and chefs have a high turn-over rate. But dude, we started losing people left and right. And It wasn’t like it was the normal “oh, I found something else, sorry for the inconvenience,” or “I just got my first internship. I need some time off indefinitely.” It was like, the stronger servers, the ones that were always there to pick up a shift, and likewise with our chefs, would stay and the people we tried to train wouldn’t stay for more than a month, nine times out of ten. The people that stayed, I either saw a huge change in their everyday demeanor or they were fucking weird. They were either miserable or… strange. 

I started to notice other red flags. We had notoriously shitty clientele, but we had our shitty regulars that would come in every Monday night for the fucking Monday night special. Progressively, the shitty regulars just stopped coming. I wasn’t receiving any more complaints than usual, and I always found a way to make these shitty customers happy before they left but for some reason they all stopped showing up. I had chalked it up to another hibachi place opening on the other side of town, but then other weird shit was happening. 

The holidays started to roll around, which is great for hibachi business. Family in town and shitty weather typically means a good hibachi night. The dads in town decide that shitty little Timmy is gonna try some of his first kobe beef and a shot of sake. Bar sales go up, upgrade sales go up, it’s all good for business. We typically have a meeting as business picks up in October with the servers to try to get them to push for the more expensive entrees and drinks. 

“Would you like to upgrade to filet?” 

“Are you sure you don’t wanna try our lobster?”

“Why don’t you just get the bottle of Chardonnay if three of you are drinking it?”

“Have you ever done a sake bomb?”

“We have real certified Kobe from Japan, fresh every day!”

All that good shit. The last of these is a bold-faced lie, though. Most states don’t even have access to real Kobe beef, and we don’t live in one that does, but we still push it because it’s the most expensive item on the menu. I never had a customer call us on it, though there’s a first for everything. 

Anyway, I’m the one that does inventory on all the food, so I pay attention when we run the reports at night. Give my good servers a pat on the back if I notice they’re consistently upselling and then make a mental note of what we’re selling more or less of, so I know what to put in for our next shipment. I noticed that Rachel and a couple other servers that she and Dave hung out with were selling nearly twice as much Kobe as the rest of our staff on a monthly basis, and their alcohol sales were moderately impressive as well. We hadn’t had the meeting yet, and it was approaching November, so I decided that this was a perfect opportunity to praise their hard work and while providing incentive for my under-performing employees to do better. 

I ended up having a meeting, promising the chefs that the guy who cooked for the most tables the following Saturday between 6 &amp; 8pm would get a $100 visa, and the servers the same reward to whomever sold the most kobe in a week. The staff was thoroughly motivated. Sunday night, I went down to the freezers to do some inventory, so we’d be ready for the following weekend. As I was doing inventory and going through last week’s order, I realized that there was no way that we’d sold the amount of kobe reported because there hadn’t been enough in inventory. Curious, I went to Dave about it, as he was the second chef. Jeff, the head chef, would have been my go-to, but he wasn’t there today.

“Hey man, so I noticed something weird about the stock. Apparently, we only ordered two cases of kobe beef last week?” Dave raised his eyebrows at my inquiry and shuffled from foot to foot. 

“Uh… yeah… Jeff and I ended up having to make a personal trip on one of your days off to get some more cause we ran out. Should be in the records somewhere, I think. I gave Yuto the receipt and he paid me for it.” He grumbled. I let out an exasperated sigh. Yuto was a manager, the son of the owner and worked mostly morning shifts because his English wasn’t great and he had trouble interacting with problematic customers due to this. Yuto’s dad, the owner, wasn’t around most of the time and pretty much had left the handling of the restaurant to Yuto and his wife, Kanna. Yuto was also a little bit clueless when it came to shit like this. Knowing him, he probably just pulled the money out of the drawer through a fuckin’ No Sale instead of a cash pull, and the receipt Dave gave him was crumpled in a pocket of his dirty pants. Kanna, who spoke much better English (though sometimes when really frustrated she would mother-fuck at you in Japanese) was the one to go to for anything involving money. She understood the operation much better than Yuto. At least I had an explanation. 

I went through the records from that week, and, surprise! No cash pull noted for a kobe run. Whatever. What struck me as odd, though, is that the drawer was never short. I shrugged it off, figuring maybe Yuto gave him money from the safe, or even out of his own pocket. Either way, not my fuckin’ problem. 

Saturday comes, and fuckin’ weird shit happened that day, dude. Honestly I don’t really have a logical explanation. Earlier that morning, I guess Dave was in the prep area downstairs, cutting up the meat for the day. He comes upstairs and sends everyone in a panic. This idiot cut his fuckin’ pinky off using the slicer. Fuck me, right? Over 300 reservations on a Saturday night and my second chef has to go to the fuckin’ emergency room. Great. 

IT GETS BETTER, THOUGH!

So, I’m up front, in the middle of the dinner rush, trying to help my cute, but clueless hosts seat 200 people in just over 2 hours, and Clarissa, a sweet doe-eyed, nineteen-year-old hostess in her second year of college, comes to me with all the color drained from her face. Her most recent task had been to set up take-out orders with soups, salads, and white rice from the back. 

  
  “Um, so like, I think you need to see this,” she says to me in a hushed voice, motioning to the back of the restaurant where the server station is. Frustrated, I go to the back, and all the servers are milling about hurriedly, no doubt in the weeds, but a couple are standing there with concerned expressions.

 “What the hell is going on?” I demand as I turn the corner. Clarissa walks over to the rice warmer where we keep the steamed rice and opens it. I took a few steps closer. A slender finger poked up out of the rice. I shrieked and jumped back.

 “Jesus motherfucking Christ! HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN SERVING THIS? WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? Eighty-six white rice, tell your friends. Fried rice comes with all entrees for the rest of the night and if they don’t want it then tell ‘em to eat a dick. Or I guess a finger in this scenario. Un-fuckin’-believable, in all of my fuckin’ years here…”

 Naturally, I ended up being the one to dump the fucking rice while everyone else ran around like headless chickens. I pulled out the finger to put it in a baggie for the freezer because I’m pretty sure that’s what you’re supposed to do if you lose an appendage. But, as I pulled it out, I realized that this finger was really… I don’t know, feminine? It was slender, and the nail wasn’t painted or anything but it was pretty well-manicured otherwise and a bit on the small side. Like, I’ve never inspected Dave’s hands up close and personal, but this did not look like the finger of a thirty or forty-somethin’ year old man that’s been cooking most of his goddamn life, okay? But I was busy, and I couldn’t come up with any other short-term explanation since I hadn’t heard of any female staff members losing a fuckin’ finger in the rice warmer today somehow. I put that bitch in a bag and tossed it in the freezer, so I could tend to my job, and then I forgot about it in the Saturday night rush.

 Then there was this 8-top of middle-aged ladies that were giving one of my more attractive male servers a hard time. Maybe that’s the wrong verbiage. I’m pretty sure a couple of them wanted to show him a *good*time, if you know what I mean. Based on what he told me, it was inappropriate, but I stayed out of it and told him he deserved it for all the creepy shit he’s said to Clarissa in the past, and to only come and get me if they touched him at all in a sexual manner that was unsolicited, or if it became an R-rated kind of conversation. Eventually one of them said that they wanted to lick some yum yum sauce off a certain body part of his, so I had to go over and shut that shit right down. Fucking lovely. 

 At this point another member of the same party felt it was the appropriate time to complain about the noodles. I’m not gonna lie, it was toward the end of the rush, and I was a little curt with them at this point, but I still apologized and comped it off their bill. But not before taking it away, because fuck that, you ain’t getting shit for free after sexually harassing one of my servers. So, he transfers the table to another server because he’s uncomfortable, and one of my girls takes over. Tara pulls the short straw.

 I don’t know if there was a miscommunication or what between my servers but basically somehow these women’s checks got totally fucked up. Tara’s shaking like a leaf because these ladies are *pissed*and want to go, and she can’t figure it out. We eventually figure it out, but not before I have to go back over there to talk them down and try to diffuse the situation. It doesn’t work and one of them threatens to knock me out. Long story short, they tried to walk out on their bills, we had to call the cops, they paid the bill, and I got called a whole rainbow of expletives before they finally all paid, and I kindly told them to “Get the fuck out of my restaurant and don’t ever fucking come back.” 

 The shift finally ends, and after that shit show I tell all my staff over 21 that they can do a single shot of their choice on the house (because everyone needed a fucking drink) but they have to present their clock-out slip to get it, mostly because it takes an extra 15 minutes for me to adjust hours at the end of the night because of people that forget to clock out. And so I know they’re not still working with Jame-o on their breath, I guess.

 Sunday, I finally have a day off and go hang out with my brother. We’re just hanging out, having beers, and I’m telling him about my fucking circus job when a clip from the news catches our attention. 

 *Then, later at 11, tune in and hear about how 8 women go missing after an outing on the south side of town!*

 The picture from the clip are the exact eight women I just fuckin’ told you about. My jaw drops. My brother looks at me, puzzled. 

 “Dude, you okay?”

“Alex, those fuckin bitches! Shit, I guess that’s a little fucked up to call them bitches since they’re missing but those are the old bitches from last night!” I exclaimed, pointing at the screen.

 “What? The ladies? Molls, they’re hardly the old creepy cougars you described. But yeah, that’s kinda weird. Whatcha think happened to them?” he asked.

 I furrowed my brow and brought the beer bottle to my lips as a string of pretty fucked up scenarios rolled across my mind. I took a big gulp and smacked my lips.

 “I don’t know. Hopefully something bad, but like, not so bad that they can’t walk away from. Like, I hope they got on the wrong bus and ended up getting mugged and lost but that like, physically, they’re okay, and emotionally they’re a complete fucking mess after that garbage last night.” I ranted. Alex laughed. 

 “That was a really politically correct way to say, ‘I hope that they die, but not actually die.’”

“Exactly!” I huffed. 

Weird though, right? The next day, I go into work, and I’m just chilling, talking to Jeff, and Dave walks up to us.

 “Fuck! Dave! I totally forgot but we found your fuckin finger in the rice warmer the other night! I put it in the walk-in freezer by the ice cream because I’m pretty sure you’re supposed to keep them on ice ‘til you can reattach them.” I proclaimed.

 “Yeah, I know. Rach brought it back for me and they were able to sew it back on. Thankfully it’s my left hand though, so as long as I wear gloves I should be fine to keep cooking.” He replied quietly. 

 “They were able to save it then?” I asked. “Lemme see.” I reached out for his left hand and he instinctively jerked it away from me. I gave him a puzzled look and then he apprehensively gave me his hand. It was wrapped in gauze and shit, but I got a good look at the rest of his hand and… Dude. Remember how I told you that finger looked slender and delicate? I was definitely right. It didn’t match the rest of his fingers. His fingernails were chewed down to the pink, and the one I tossed in the freezer was well manicured. I slowly gave him back his hand, speechless. 

 “Well… um, I-I’m glad you kept all ten, dude.” I stammered. 

 After that, I knew something was wrong. I almost asked Clarissa if she remembered what the finger looked like but resisted that urge. I mean, what the fuck was I thinking anyway? I decided to make some kind of excuse to leave and investigate the freezer and get this: The finger was still fucking there.

What the fuck. How the fuck. Who the fuck’s finger was this? Why was it in my rice warmer? As the Manager on Duty, it’s kind of my job to know if someone in the building loses a mother fuckin’ finger, is it not!? Something told me that I needed to nope the fuck out of there, so I left the frozen finger and sat in the office, alone with my thoughts and the soft hum of the camera feed monitors. I was more-so staring off into space than actually surveying the restaurant but then I saw something interesting. On the video feed, I saw Rachel run down to the walk-in freezer, look around, and then go inside, before emerging not long after and going back upstairs. Was I being paranoid? Maybe. But that wasn’t gonna stop me from checking. 

Sure enough, upon going back into the walk-in, the finger was fucking gone. The only reason it was still there today was because I forgot to tell anyone where I put it, and we have a lot of freezers and coolers. No one knew where the finger was but me until ten minutes ago. He had no reason to go into the ice cream freezer, but she did, as a server. It looked less suspicious if she did it. I’m speculating here, but it makes sense.

Jesus fucking Christ. What did this mean? I didn’t know what to make of it. Should I call the cops? Should I tell the owner? Should I confront them about it? Probably not the last one, if this wasn’t a prank (which it most certainly isn’t) then I should just stay out of it… maybe? Does that make me an accessory to something if I kind of maybe know about it? FUCK! I needed more information. This was too much fuckery and I didn’t know what to think. That’s not true. I knew what I thought, but you need more to go on than this to accuse someone of… ugh I don’t even wanna say it.

I didn’t really know what else to do, so I decided to try to do my job and keep a closer eye on the whole staff and restaurant. Maybe that’s stupid, but that’s what I decided to do. I kept tabs on Rachel the most, and she was upselling like crazy. Significantly pushing the kobe more than the other servers. Being borderline pushy about it at times, but it was working. I decided to do a table touch on her third table that evening, after the chef left the table. It was a group of older to middle aged folks, clearly a business outing of some sort. I could smell Chanel No. 5, which is basically what arrogance and pretentiousness would smell like if it had an aroma, coming off those white ladies from more than 10 feet away.

“Evening, folks, how is everything for ya tonight?” I asked politely, taking on the bubbly persona of the server I used to be. 

“It’s great! Let me tell you, I’ve only had kobe beef a couple of times, but I think this is the first time I’ve had the real thing. I can understand now why they call it a delicacy!” The older gentlemen with bright blue eyes at the table exclaimed. He was clearly the man paying the tab, which you could have guessed by his entrée already, but the nicely tailored suit and shiny $1500 watch were other dead giveaways.  I froze, and it felt like my stomach was doing cartwheels. Suddenly something had clicked. It was instantaneous and probably only a flash of an indiscernible emotion that flittered across my face before I was right back to server mode. 

“I’m so happy to hear that. Well, my name is Molly, I’m the manager here, and if there’s anything you folks need, feel free to ask me or your server. You guys enjoy your meal.” I smiled just hard enough so it looked genuine before walking away. My heart hammered in my chest at my sudden realization. Oh fuck. How could I have not seen it before? Jesus, fuck. No, I must be crazy. I had to get to the bottom of this. 

I made it through the rest of the shift, doing random table touches. Being fake nice made me feel a little better until closing time. I needed a plan. I wasn’t sure what I was going to do if the plan worked exactly, though. 

I was supposed to be off tomorrow. It would be Tuesday, so the order made on Sunday should have been coming in. Yuto should have done inventory yesterday, but he’s not even remotely reliable. Sure enough, I checked, and he didn’t take inventory or even put in an order for the next shipment. What the fuck would this place even do without me, honestly? 

You probably think I’m a fuckin’ idiot and that I should just call the cops about my suspicions and be done with it, but I didn’t. I needed to be 100% certain.

The chefs typically come in pretty early, like 8 am, to start prepping shit for the day/week. I decided I would move my car to another lot and sleep in the office that night. Nobody but management has keys, so I would be safe and unseen, with my own private bathroom down there, watching everyone work through the camera feed until about 9:30 when Kanna would get there. 

Unfortunately, there’s only cameras in the more common areas, and not in the actual freezers/coolers or bathrooms. We have a few on the street looking out at people that walk by, one directed at every cash drawer in the building, one directed at the safe, and then a few scattered about the dining room and basement. I didn’t have the password to roll back the video and see what happened previously, and I wasn’t even certain that Yuto or Kanna would know it if I asked them for the password, but I had the live feeds to know roughly about anyone or anything that entered or exited the restaurant. 

So, I camped out and set an alarm for 7:30 in the morning, just in case anyone decided to show up early. I shut off the camera monitors to sleep because the light bothered me. I awoke around 4am to thumping down the stairs next to the office, which is one of two entries to the basement. As I rubbed the sleep from my eyes I realized this wasn’t right. No one should be here for quite some time. If they were here, that meant they had a key to the restaurant. Shit. How would I explain to Kanna that I was camping out in the office, if that’s who this turned out to be? My heart raced, and I flicked on the monitors. Much to my relief, it wasn’t Kanna, who would have had a lot of questions that I wasn’t prepared to answer. Instead it was Dave who’d come thundering down the stairs, unaware of the sleeping person 20 feet from him, behind a locked door. 

He flicked some lights on and started getting tools together as though he was already about to start prepping food for the day. He got out the huge meat slicer, several filet knives, a couple of the big bins that we typically toss the steaks into before we wrap them up to freeze for later use, a trash bin, and a couple dish aprons that are plastic to prevent you from getting wet. Now, I’ve seen people come to work up to two hours early before, but this was honestly not necessary. In four hours’ time, he would probably complete all the prep work for the whole day, before the rest of the prep chefs even got there. So what the fuck was he doing here this early? I was about to walk out and ask him myself when he seemed satisfied with his set up and went back up the stairs. I looked at another feed. Outside was Rachel’s black SUV. Was she with him or was she letting him borrow her car?

Dave popped his head out the door, and I’m assuming, since I could only see a small corner of his balding head on the video feed, yelled something out to the person that was apparently in the SUV. And who hops out? Joe. The chef we’d fired *months* ago for setting someone on fire. What the hell was he doing here? More importantly, how the fuck was he not locked up? Joe waves him over and opens up the back of the SUV. Together, they pull out and start carrying a large contractor bag full of something long, and apparently heavy based on the way they were struggling. 

I’m no fool. Sure, I’m kind of a shitty manager and maybe a little bit of a shitty person too, but I’m not an idiot. I knew what they were carrying. I was in disbelief. I don’t know if I stayed to watch the rest out of morbid curiosity or to verify my suspicions. They ended up tossing the bag into one of the freezers, and then they went back out to the car. As they ascended the stairs right next to the office door, I could hear them talking.

“This next one will take a while for us to cut up,” Joe grumbled. Dave mumbled something in agreement.

I watched them struggle to get this one out of the SUV and decided I had enough time to make a mad dash to the freezer and confirm my suspicions before they even made it to the stairs. 

Hands trembling, adrenaline rushing, heart pounding, I crept the door open and quickly, but quietly, ran for it to that freezer. I threw open the heavy door and laid my eyes upon the large contractor bag. In person it was probably 5 or 6 feet long. I found the opening and pulled it back. 

Lifeless, bulging out, bloodshot blue eyes looked back at me. It was the older gentleman I’d spoken to earlier in the evening. His mouth was agape, bruising along his face and dried blood under his left nostril. He’d taken a beating since I’d spoken to him last. I yelped, then covered my mouth, realizing I might have just given myself away. In a flash, I tossed the bag back over his face and was out of that freezer, then back in the office. In the heat of the moment, not only had I *slammed* the office door but I’d forgotten to shut the door to the freezer. FUCK. I had realized my mistake, but it was too late; the boys were running down the stairs already. 

I dialed 911 and on the first ring I realized I was too scared to speak, or even whisper. What if they heard me? What if they saw the light from the room under the door and tried to get in? What would they do to me if they found out I knew their secret?

They argued with each other in the basement about the open freezer door as the emergency operator on the other line continued to attempt soliciting a response from me. I suddenly found enough courage to whisper, reassuring myself that at the volume they were arguing, there was no way they would hear me on the other side of a concrete wall. 

“Send the cops to (name of restaurant) on (street name) in (town). Please make sure they check the basement. I found something I wasn’t supposed to, and I’m trapped. I have to go because they might find me. Please hurry.” I hissed into the phone. 

“Ma’am-“ was all the operator got out before I hung up. I have no idea if 911 calls back or not but I set my phone to complete silence, because the last thing I needed was for them to call back and give my position away. I imagine they don’t for this reason, but I’d rather be safe than sorry. 

I stared at the video feed and I made out the image of the two, still arguing across the basement from where the closest camera was located. 

I looked out at the street, and a single cruiser was parked not far behind the SUV, which made me breathe a sigh of relief. Thankfully, the station wasn’t far away. There was an officer inspecting Rachel’s black SUV. Those idiots had left the hatch wide open, and he was peering in with a flashlight. 

It was so quick I almost missed it. The video feed is pretty pixelated, so all I really saw was movement, and then the officer fell to his knees, a foreign object impaling him straight through his torso and poking out of his back, before he fell forward, causing his face to hit the back fender of the car. A figure crawled out of the back of the SUV. It was Rachel. She sprinted to the door, and my eyes flew to the next video feed as she scaled down the stairs. 

“Guys, we have a fucking problem, but I think I fixed it... at least for now.” She spat, her voice only wavering slightly. Despite that, her attitude in general was pretty cavalier for having just killed a fucking cop. I devised a plan to run like hell for the opposite entry to the basement. It was further away, but it was closer to the front door, which would put more distance between me and these fucking psychopaths if they noticed me dashing to my car, which was highly likely considering they were parked on the street just to the side of the restaurant. We were placed on the corner of the block. I suddenly regretted moving my car to a farther lot. I’d have to run four blocks, and I smoke like a fucking chimney, so I would certainly be winded after the first. 

The three of them went back outside, and I zipped my purse closed, then opened the door. I quickly and quietly made it to the other side of the basement and then dashed up the stairs. The building is a little old, so the stairs groaned in protest under my weight. 

“Who’s there?” Rachel’s voice demanded from the other side of the basement. I guess she’d come back in for some reason and left the heavy lifting to the guys. Oh *fuck* no. I took the rest of the stairs two at a time, which is moderately impressive since I’m all of 5’1”. I heard her feet race to my side of the basement as I made it to the top, opened the door and fuckin’ *slammed* that shit behind me. The stairs lead up to the cashier booth, which is just a really small room with a register and a coat rack by the bar. The front door was 30 feet away, but I had to unlock it before I could make it out safely. To buy myself some time, I wedged the cashier’s chair under the doorknob. Due to the lack of space in the room, there was no way she would make it through the door, considering the wall opposite of the door was too close to allow her enough room to knock over the chair. She would have to go around and climb the other set of stairs next to the dish pit in the kitchen, on the other side of the building.

When I’d packed all my shit into my bag, I hadn’t considered the fact that I would need to use the keys, because I’m a fucking idiot. I definitely didn’t anticipate that I would be rummaging for them with my life depending on it. I could hear them jingling at the bottom of my seemingly bottomless bag as I moved shit around. In the stillness of the night, I heard thumping on the stairs in the back of the restaurant. I didn’t have time for this shit. I dumped out my purse, the keys falling on top since they were fucking buried at the bottom. I sifted through them, quickly finding the key I required and shoved it into the lock. 

As I heard the series of metal doors slam, meaning she had officially made it into the kitchen, I grabbed the important shit I’d just dumped out, leaving behind a bunch of shit that I *might*miss but really wasn’t all that necessary under the circumstances, and stuffed those important items back into my purse before fleeing out the big glass doors like a bat out of hell. For half a second, I considered locking the door behind me. Maybe it would slow her down, but then I thought *fuck it,*and just started sprinting in the direction of my car. My purse bounced against my hip as I stepped, but I’d balled the keys up in my fist, so they didn’t jingle as I ran.

Of course, the boys were already on their way to try to cut me off. They’d spotted me, and were chasing after me, calling my name. 

“Molly! Wait, please, we need to talk about this! We can make you understand!” Dave shouted. I didn’t wanna understand. I don’t care how fucking shitty this job is, I’ve been called a bitch to my face by customers more times than I’ve said “fuck” in this recount of events, and I *never once*plotted to kill people. Sure, I might have joked about it and wished shitty things upon them, but that’s different from fucking killing people and chopping them up in the basement to serve to other shitty customers. I mean I can’t *prove*that’s exactly how this was going down, but I’d seen enough to draw that conclusion.

Joe was only a few paces behind me. He had the advantage. Even if I was significantly younger, Joe was at least 6’2”. His stride was remarkably longer than mine. The soles of my shoes slapped against the pavement so hard that I knew I would feel it in my knees tomorrow. If I even made it to tomorrow. I silently thanked God (and Dr. Scholl’s) that I’d stuck with the tread-safe shoes with insoles for work, unlike Kanna who usually wore 3” heels.

With his long reach, Joe was able to grab the handle of my purse that was slung around my elbow. It yanked me back, but I spun on my heel and let the handle slide off my arm, pushing it into him so that he lost his balance and fell on his ass. It was all one fluid motion, which transitioned to me spinning the remaining 180 degrees, stumbling a bit, I must admit, but my legs didn’t fail me. I went as fast as I could. My high school gym teacher would have been proud to see me run as fast as I did, had I not been running for my fucking life. If there is a Guinness World Record for “Most Distance Ran by an Active Chain-smoker in 10 Seconds,” I’m sure I’ve broken it. I only slowed to a jog when I reached the parking lot all those blocks away. Before getting into my car, I laid down on the pavement between my car and the one next to it, catching my breath.

Fuck, I was out of shape. I was far enough away and well hidden in the darkness of this ungodly fucking hour. They weren’t going to find me laying on the pavement between cars four blocks away. I felt safe enough to rest. After my heart slowed to a rate that wasn’t aneurysm-inducing, I picked myself up and got into my car. Fortunately, though I’d lost my purse, phone, wallet, and most of my other important belongings, I still had the fucking car keys since I’d never put them back in that god-forsaken purse. Hands shaking, I turned the key and my engine roared to life. 

I went straight to the police station. Normally, I would have to drive past my workplace to get there, but I went the long way and drove two streets parallel to the normal route. I didn’t even really park properly next to the station. I just threw my blinkers on and got out of the car, leaving it running in the street. Who would steal a car right in front of a police station, right? I gave my statement. At first they didn’t believe me, assumed this was some elaborate prank, but eventually they saw that I was shaking like a leaf and frantic, that I was genuinely scared. It certainly helped that they hadn’t heard back from the first cop they sent to the scene yet. They started to take me seriously, and this time they dispatched quite a few officers to the restaurant. 

I was asked a lot of questions. I don’t even remember what most of them were. The ones I do remember were the more infuriating ones, where they were trying to gauge if I was out of my mind on drugs or insane. 

“Ma’am, can you tell me the date and who is currently the President?”

“Have you had anything to drink tonight?”

“Do you take any medications on a daily basis?”

Yeah, fuck you, too, Officer Dickhead. I cried a lot when I told them what happened. My hysterics probably didn’t help the I’m-not-crazy case I was trying to make, but eventually they stopped making light of me. 

I don’t really know what happened after all that. I’m assuming they got arrested. I mean, afterward I left the station to go get some sleep at my brother’s (I didn’t feel safe at home) and they didn’t call me back in to ask me more questions. I called Kanna the next morning and told her, “I can’t fucking do this shit anymore.” 

I didn’t give her more explanation than that. Haven’t been back to work since. I’ll probably never step foot in another hibachi place, that much I can assure you. I gave my resume to a new vegan place down the road that was seeking managers. Got an interview on the spot. 

The owner is this hipster-looking black girl named Theresa. She was pretty nice. Young, pretty, with dreadlocks that reached the middle of her back and tattoos decorating her arms. The company is pretty new, but it’s supposed to be a champion for animal rights or some shit. I could give a fuck less, I just don’t want any red meat near me for the foreseeable future. I didn’t tell her that, though. I told her I was new to being a vegetarian, (ended up being a lie; I started eating chicken a week later) and wanted to surround myself with like-minded people to ease the transition. She was really friendly, and the interview went well. I thanked her for taking the time, and she told me someone would call me in the upcoming days to set up a second interview. 

I’d saved the store’s number in my new SmartTalk phone, courtesy of Walmart. I’ve been sleeping a lot these past couple days, I guess cause I’m exhausted by this whole ordeal, and I didn’t want to answer that phone call sounding groggy, or accidentally screen it. Well, the call finally came. 

“Hello!” I said cheerfully into the phone. 

“Why, hello! May I speak to Molly?” a familiar, faux friendly male voice requested. 

“This is she.” I responded. There was a moment of silence on the other end, and I pulled the phone from my ear momentarily to ensure the call hadn’t dropped. 

“This is Joe from Vegalike,” the fake cheeriness proclaimed. “Nice hearing your voice again, boss. How ya been?” He uttered this sarcastically, every word dripping with malice in a way that sent chills up my spine. I hung up the phone and threw it as though it bit me.

I didn’t know where to work next, but sure as shit not there. I’m really not sure how this fucker got out of jail, or if he ever even made it there in the first place, but I didn’t stay in town long enough to see it through. 

The next morning, I paid the landlord for the next 30 days and told him he could keep the security deposit. I’ve been traveling across the country since. I ran out of money not far in, but panhandling has gotten me this far. I haven’t been to a hibachi place since. It’s almost been a year.

So, I pass this advice onto you, for the next time you go to a Japanese steakhouse, as I’ll never set foot in one again.

Be polite, tip your servers well since they have to split it with the chef, and don’t order the kobe fucking beef. "
96ebsj,5,2018-08-11,How to stay positive when coworkers make fun of you,asnnoodle,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/96ebsj/how_to_stay_positive_when_coworkers_make_fun_of/,"I’ve been dealing with SA ever since grade school, when it was crippling and couldn’t even talk to my teachers, and it got a lot better in college. At my internship in college I still had issues with talking to superiors, and my SA felt full force being in a professional office for the first time as a 20 year old. I had a coworker tell me “you don’t talk much, what social problems do you have?” And I responded with “uh ya I’m shy in new situations”, but that comment killed my confidence in how far I’ve come in overcoming SA. 

Fast forward I’m 25 now and have little to no problem talking to people, unless it’s someone I seriously want to impress (I.e, dating is still hard) but everyday interactions like with coworkers I feel good about. I do still off days when I say something awkward but I quickly move past it and don’t dwell. Well I just played a cards against humanity but with memes, and my coworkers put down a card to me that said “When you’d like to talk to someone but ran out of Xanax”. And I know I shouldn’t care, but little jabs like this I take extremely personally.

How do you all cope with staying positive when people make comments about your SA? "
96egtv,2,2018-08-11,Blew an internship,1883456,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/96egtv/blew_an_internship/,"I posted this on CSMajors, but more input is better:

I screwed up an internship at a big corporate bank. This wasn't a big tech company, but a bank where they hire most interns. First let me give you some backstory.

I have always doubted whether I would be a successful programmer; in high school I excelled in history and politics. I pursued a BA, not a BS, in CS in college, and am doing reasonably well because of my efforts. I have had some rough spots where I considered changing majors, but stuck with it, and learned some c,java,python, and sql in the process. However, my general skills at reasoning and logic are wanting, so I am weak on concepts like algorithmic efficiency and design patterns. I am currently a rising senior.

Two months ago I started my second Internship, and I messed it up terribly. The first two weeks I was not given a lot of work because my team was already in the middle of a huge project. My mentor told me to read the codebase. I did, but was slow to start, because I did not know where to begin, and slow to understand. By 3 weeks, I understood some of what junit tests and what spring was, two concepts heavily used in the code base, but I could not really contribute. However, I would volunteer for a few little tasks each week. Feeling that I was not doing enough, I started staying behind late to be with the team, who would stay until late, asking questions. This ended up leading to a habit of staying up late and showing up exhausted the next day, and many days going by wasted. At work, without any hard deadlines or tasks, I held myself to a low standard and distracted myself with my phone for hours, looking up theology and history books. I literally did this for 3 weeks. My manager was so stressed with the project that I could get away with this. I was listless and useless because I thought I had nothing to do. I did end up learning about, in a general sense, the overall flow of control in the code, the Spring framework, JUNIT testing, JDBC Templates, Jms Templates, and dataGrid Caches, and but at a slow and extremely inefficient pace.  Towards the end, my manager gave me two small projects, and I did each, although I was not good at keeping tabs with him each day about my progress. He also observed me use my phone for breaks during the weeks I had these tasks assigned, which annoyed him. When I finished each, I wanted to show him, but he was not interested. 

Another sort of bad tendency, throughout the internship, was staying in my own little bubble. I was sort of intimidated by my coworkers because I did not want to annoy them-they seemed busy. But eventually I just wanted to stay in my own little lane of laziness, and obvs. they noticed whenever they came by my desk that I was browsing my phone or chewing gum.

I learned today that during the weeks where I would lazily “read code,” he was expecting me to take initiative and come up with ideas. I regret sleeping late, which made me tardy some days, but overall made me unproductive. I regret not taking this internship for the gift it was. I just blew a six figure job away, one that many people would kill to get. I feel stupid and entitled (why was I so sure I would get a return offer?), but now feel the need for personal discipline and to really start coding and reading coding books in my free time. Essentially, I was exhausted for many days and spent my hours distracted and not working. I sort of dislike school though, and am afraid, with my BA, that I blew my lucky break. Overall, I am thinking that this profession may not be for me. My plan is to start doing leetCode every day ( I have done some problems), to read books on CS, and to finish a personal project website in my free time. I don't know if I will get as great of an opportunity as this one again, or if I am cut out for industry. Most of all,  I am pissed that this first real test-the culmination of all my effort in school-is one I completely wasted and did not take seriously."
96estp,10,2018-08-11,Help with Fizz Buzz interview question where output doesn't fit into memory,Brewster312,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/96estp/help_with_fizz_buzz_interview_question_where/,"I was doing an internship phone screen and got asked Fizz Buzz as a warm up question (had the version where you returned the result as an array). After that I got asked a bunch of follow ups about how to handle the situation where the input number is very large, like over a billion, so the output wouldn't fit into memory. For this I said I'd alter the function to have a write to disk function that writes the output to disk after a certain range is computed. I then got asked what data structure I'd use to optimize this, so I tried to get some more details and the interviewer threw out some ideas like if you had multiple computers or used multiple threads. I really wasn't sure so my answer was using a hashmap where the key is the starting of the range and the value is the location on disk. Then you could sort the keys, and you would have the ordered locations on disk of your result.  

I was kinda caught off guard with these memory questions/follow ups since I focused all my efforts on algorithm prep. I have a third interview with this company so I'd like to be better prepared for these type of questions. I'm not really sure what to look into though, since searching the topic is so broad, and I was wondering if there were resources out there that focused on these types of interview questions, or just anything really that would let me be better prepared. I was thinking of looking into map reduce, streaming algorithms, and maybe online algorithms? Any other ideas?"

I'm currently pursuing a bachelors in computer science from a fairly reputable private Indian college and I graduate July 2019. I have a GPA of 8 (out of 10). About a year ago, I decided to pursue Data science as my career option simply because its the only thing I won't do just for they money (I fucking love it, actually).

So, I decided to work in R and was able to get a remote summer internship at a London based startup. I have built 2 projects, working on the 3rd, and I'm working for another side project on a CNN (that's pretty much all my CV, even though I plan to finish with 5 projects by the end of August)

I want to pursue Masters in Data Science in Europe right after graduation. I've been preparing for GRE as well - which I'll give by the end of September. 

I simply don't know which countries and universities to aim for/ choose. I'm not considering US because of the political scene and much higher cost across the whole degree.

So, can anybody please advice me on which colleges I'm likely to get into? And which would be unlikely but possible? Everything counts while choosing which countries to go to - finances, expected salaries, taxes, medical costs, standard of living, everything.

I know this is rather long text, so thank you very much for reading it and answering it!"

Also, I need financial aid

**List**: Northwestern, WashU st. Louis, Cornell, Stanford, Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Yale and UChicago (open to suggestions as well)

**GPA**: 3.3 UW (massive grade deflation - the average mark is ~2.0)

**Rank**: 1/68

**Curriculum**: Took IB classes only offered to top students - LangA portuguese HL 7/7, LangB english HL 7/7, LangB spanish HL 7/7, Math SL 7/7, Physics SL 7/7, Hist SL 6/7, EE A and TOK C (will ask for a remark, as I was predicted an A). The resf of my curriculum was composed of bio, chem and geography for the national curriculum. There are no electives in my country, so every student takes the same classes (the only choice is between IB or not - there are only 6 IB courses available)

**ACT:** Still didn't take it, but i scored 35 in a mock without preparation so I expect scoring between 34 and 36

**SUBJECT SAT**: didn't take them either. I'm taking math II, chem and physics or bio.

**ECs:**

- Member of the school's debate club since sophomore, promoted to director on Junior (organized an internal MUN and biweekly debates about current issues, among other things). This is the only student-run extracurricular besides a feminist activist group (which oficialy has no ties to the school), so it is kind of a big deal inside the institution (although idk how that would translate to the app). I expanded its activity and ran a non-partisan political conscientization campaign for the elections this year in my country

- 3 awards in the biggest MUN conferences in my state
- bronze medal in state chem olympiads and in a math competition
- volunteer work in a local homeless shelter for 2 months
- science camp (the biggest in Brazil, modeled after Harvard's Science Clubs)
- drama classes through high school
- class ""president"" (we call it representative here, as we are elected to represent the class' interests in the school and articulate projects with other representatives). Had an important role on IB implementation in the school
- participated in a bunch of livestreamed interviews with presidential candidates (i'm not sure this will be relevant to the app but still pretty cool)
- CS50x (plan on finishing before ED)
- I speak 3 languages, working on the fourth one
- I'm a private tutor for some stuents in my school (also not sure if relevant, but helped me land the research assistant position)

**Recommendation letters:** Mathematics, chemstry, philosophy (my EE advisor), history (also CAS coordinator) and my councelor. I know I'm very well liked by the teachers that are writing my letters, but I'm afraid of the language barrier

**Essay:** I'll try to tie up the ECs that were most meaningful to me (volunteer work, debates club, science camp and, if everything goes well, a lab/research internship in this comming semester) in a coherent narrative about having a positive impact in my comunity - both inside school and at large. I'll talk about how my perspective changed from emphasizing discussion to wanting to devote my life to action through medical research, as to have a more meaningful impact on the lives of the ones that need it the most. I'll probably also mention how I changed my major from history (in freshman) to philosophy (in sophomore and a bit of junior) and finaly to something more biology-oriented (biomedical computing or something related to biochem/molecular biology), and how this afected me.

Should I take the ""safe"" bet and ED to northwestern, or go full gamble and apply early to Stanford? Remember that these are reach/high match schools, so its not the end of the world if I don't get into any of them

So my question is whether it is worth sticking it out to have Apple on my resume and also having a somewhat more tech related job? I'm just looking for different perspectives because I'm on the fence of staying or not. Thank you for reading :)

**Some background is that my previous jobs have been the complete opposite of anything tech related. However, I also recently got a part-time for teaching programming to kids.

96jfyu,3,2018-08-11,Should I continue as a senior of systems engineering or accept a virtual job in technical troubleshooting now?,papasconputo,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/96jfyu/should_i_continue_as_a_senior_of_systems/,"Okay, so I'll add a bit of background to let you know where I stand and why I am stuck at this fork.

I'm currently a senior studying systems engineering, I'll graduate within the next year (if all goes well). I have tried my absolute best to find an internship within the past year to apply my skills and gain hands-on experience in one of the fields I would eventually like to pursue after graduation. I have received no offers, and hardly any response from companies overall. I have even applied for co-ops and full time jobs which I would have accepted if I felt as though they would offer better skills than the classes I have taken up to this point. I feel as though my major has a lot to do with it since it is not a specialty. (It's very difficult to market this type of degree unless you have extensive work experience in one field or a minor in a relating field such as computer science, petroleum, etc). The school I attend does, in fact, offer these types of specialties, but I am unable to pursue them if I want to graduate on time.

One of the fields that I would be interested in is IT, with entry jobs starting as sales representatives, troubleshooting, etc. Until recently, I haven't been able to find work in this field. Right now, I am going through the hiring process of becoming a technical support representative. I am currently on the 2nd phase (out of 3), and am almost sure that I will be offered a position because I have quite a bit of personal experience with troubleshooting both hardware and software and I already surpass the basic technical aptitude for the position.

I am stuck between finishing my degree just to kind of get it over with, and accepting the job which would require me to be flexible all days and hours of the week. With the job requirements, scheduling, and privacy required, there is no way I could do both. I would have to put school on hold completely and maybe indefinitely. Up until this point, I was set on finishing my degree, not just to appease my father, but to open up other positions that require a bachelors, but now I am reconsidering all of it. Besides the bachelors certificate at face value, I truly feel that this degree will not open up any career opportunities for me the way this position would.

 tl;dr: stuck between choosing an entry-level technical troubleshooting position or continuing towards a bachelors in systems engineering"

96jp89,2,2018-08-11,Recruiter Looking for Guidance,FCS_,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/96jp89/recruiter_looking_for_guidance/,"Hey everyone,

I have been at my job for 6 months as a recruiter and it has had its ups and downs like any job (I think). This is my first job out of college and I have really no idea what to expect for normal hours and what a good company culture is like. I wanted to see what some of your thoughts were because I really do not enjoy my job, yet perform very well. I do not enjoy my job for a few reasons: 1. I am micromanaged to the maximum despite being the #2 recruiter in the company 2. The hours are ridiculous typically being 7-7 and working more at home from 9pm-11pm. 3. They are pushing me into sales which is fine, but I do not believe in their model and think staffing is too volatile because you depend on other people to perform for jobs you place them in which is not guaranteed. 4. There is no work life balance.

Some backstory on me: I graduated with my degree in Marketing and struggled to find a position that was related to my degree and ended up being contacted by my current company. I performed well in school and had 2 internships that were a good mix of marketing, digital marketing, and sales, but didn't find a position that was in line with what I enjoy. 

I'm at the point now where I do not want to appear jumpy from job to job when future employers look at my resume and experience, but I want to leave ASAP. I make great money for this being a first job out of school which is roughly 75k, but I feel like I only stick around for the paychecks. I am really not sure what to do with my future because I do not want to be in staffing forever and I think if I stay any longer I will have very few transferable skills for other positions. 

With all that being said, I wanted to know how to deal with this. Do I leave my current job without a job lined up? Do I take a significant pay cut to be happier each day? How can I get into marketing when basically starting at square one?

Any feedback is appreciated!"

I am a rising third-year university student in the US majoring in computer science. This summer, I was fortunate to be accepted into an internship program at one of the world's five largest software companies that is set to last for two years right up to my college graduation. This program is also specifically designed to present its participants with a job offer upon graduation, so basically as long as you don't make any major screw-ups and do your assigned work you'll get a job. 

So far the internship has been pretty great: the campus is incredibly beautiful with in-house subsidized dining facilities (usually I pay $0-2 USD for a delicious made-to-order lunch), amazing benefits such as a matched 401K plan that starts once you've been at the company for a short period of time even as an intern, and a sizable hourly rate. My role here is as a traditional software developer, but next summer I have the opportunity to work in a different department pretty much of my choosing, and the company has basically any area you could think of to work in.

However, I just received a tempting offer from one of the ""big four"" accounting firms in their tech consulting wing as a tech consulting intern for next summer. I'm still not 100% sure what I would be doing in this role, but from those that I have talked to consulting sounds like a very exciting (albeit stressful and time-consuming) career, not to mention a great salary as an employee. While I am very happy to have received this offer, it has given me a challenging decision to make, which I have to make within the next week. 

My biggest concern is which route would offer me the best foundation to start a career in the realm of computer science, more specifically software development/engineering? I can see that staying at my current company would most likely provide me with much more traditional development experience, but the idea of consulting sounds so different and exciting to me. Additionally, I have heard that some people go into consulting for a few years to fast track both their careers as well as their salaries. There is a chance that I could do a similar consulting role next summer at my current employer if they are able to place me in such a department, however I don't believe I can take that as guaranteed. Bottom line, ignoring all of the pros and cons of which route offers a better **internship** experience (because I believe my current company wins there), which opportunity do you think would offer me the best starting point for a fruitful career path in the future in the realm of software/tech?

Thanks in advance!

PS - my current employment is on an at-will basis, so there's no issues of breach of contract or anything if I decide to leave (at least as far as I can tell)."

96kqg0,2,2018-08-11,Disgruntled Networking Sales Engineer Looking for Career Advice. Please Help!,liljohn8d,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/96kqg0/disgruntled_networking_sales_engineer_looking_for/,"I'm at a complete loss as to what I should do for my career and I could really appreciate some advice. Here's my background: I've been working at a well-known Tier 1 ISP as a sales engineer\* for almost 5 years now after graduating with an electrical engineering degree and I'm at a complete loss in terms of what I ought to do to advance my career. The reason I placed an asterisk to my title is because the position is not necessarily a sales engineering position but an associate/apprentice to the actual pre/post sales (field) engineer who's responsible for interacting with our customers. My role consists of helping with the backend support of onboarding the customers to our network products and solutions; this would help remove ease the workload of the field engineers and have them focus strictly on the customer interaction. Being in this role however has helped me realize that I have a strong distaste for sales and working with sales reps. Secondly, I feel like being a sales engineer for a company who sells everything from private networking (MPLS), SIP, Dedicated Internet Access, Security, Cloud Exchange, to SD-WAN makes you a generalist, and not a specialist. And as we partner with more and more vendors, the product portfolio continues to expand. You are relegated to being a jack of all trades, and a master of none. Not only that, but the world of IT and networking itself is overwhelming; new information/technology is coming out like rapid fire and the need to stay current is always present. Don't get me wrong, I love problem-solving, taking on new challenges, and learning new things everyday. But I feel extremely limited in my current role to do so. The majority of my time spent at work has been spent mastering our proprietary systems and tools which are horrendous and constantly changing due to migrations. Despite my apprehension as to whether the field sales engineering position was right for me, I’m inspired by the sales engineers I support and I aspire to be as knowledgeable as them. I’ve asked for guidance and mentorship from many of the senior field engineers, but unfortunately most of them are not interested, which makes sense since it’s heavily one-sided. In terms of industry knowledge, I’ve been able to muster up a CCENT, CMNA, and some sales certifications in Broadsoft UC and Zscaler (benefits of being a partner company) in the past year or so. I’m looking to get the Fortinet NSE 1-3 as well, simply because I can. I can dig into company resources such as webinars and training and spend weeks learning about SD-WAN. I can also read all of our white papers and product briefs, but none of this comes close in value to hands-on exposure. And again, the lack of being in a role that warrants a regurgitating of that information or using that information to make a sale is so limiting. 

Now, you may ask, why not just move into the field sales engineering role if you want the exposure? Well, I’ve tried, and getting promoted to that role has proved to be an obstacle. Management has overlooked my applications when the positions opened up and instead, I've become a team lead in my current role and my responsibility now lies in training interns (some who have moved on to the field role ahead of me). Is my work ethic at fault? Well, management constantly tells me that I'm the best on the team, I've received a few recognition awards at the company, and I’m constantly asking for feedback on what I can do to improve. Yet, I've been denied the field sales engineering role and I remain in my entry-level support sales engineering role. 

With that said, my question for you guys is what I should do to prepare for my next move? Staying at this company does not seem like the path I'd like to stay on for reasons stated above. However, job searching to another position has come to no avail as well since I lack in both sales and networking expertise. Despite my aversion towards sales, I feel like the only way I can make a lateral or upward move is to leverage my title and the soft skills I’ve gained and look for another sales engineering position. 

Should I forego sales completely and build upon the little networking experience I have and forge a path towards obtaining a CCNA and a CCNP? Or should I hop on current trends and have my eyes set on the AWS certifications, or perhaps even Salesforce? Even if I were to obtain those certifications, I still need to decide on what I want to do. I feel like the correct progression to my career should have been Help Desk &gt; Sys Admin &gt; DevOps/Engineer &gt; Post Sales Engineer/Architect so that I could gain experience/knowledge from the ground-up instead of being high-level from the start. If taking a step back in salary is what I ultimately need to do, then so be it. My apologies for this convoluted post, but writing this out was somewhat therapeutic and again, I would appreciate any sort of feedback and advice. "

96l50s,1,2018-08-11,roommate issues,doingpianostuff,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/96l50s/roommate_issues/,"Hello reddit, so I’m currently having issues with my roommate. A little backstory – before she went abroad for her internship for the summer, she was super nice. However, once she came back, she basically became a bitch. However… there are a number of reasons why. Before she left, her had signed her lease to her boyfriend even though in our roommate agreement she was supposed to provide an opportunity for me to lease the place again for the upcoming year. However, she didn’t do it, and instead, leased it to her bf, and only told me after it was signed. After I found that out, I emailed my landlord that she had did that, and then the landlord forwarded the email to my roommate, which she wasn’t very happy about, and here we are today. 

When she came back, she brought up a lot of things (the email being one of them) and then also brought up that cleaning was an issue and that I needed to “act like an adult and act like one”, referring to that she often cleaned the place but I didn’t do so for certain areas (for example, the hallway where you walk back and forth and dust can accumulate) but I would clean up the areas that I used and that it bothered her. Though, she cleans frequently, and she never really brought it up ever that it was an issue, and I only found out in August, (I’m moving out at the end of August) and so it was too late to bring up for it to be completely fixed now. If she had brought it up months ago when it became an issue for her, I could have been able to adjust and fix them whenever it happens. However, both of these are not very relevant anymore as the next lease is still signed to her bf, the cleaning issue was from months ago, and the email was more than a month old as well, none of which are issues as of right now. As for the email, she could still contact me via email, but acted like nothing happened throughout her internship abroad, and only exploded once she got home. 

Through our texts, she’s been very aggressive towards me while bringing up those issues, saying things such as “you’re an adult, act like one”, “we’re not your friends”, and there were a few others, however I don’t want to look at my texts. After I had explained that she should have brought these things up when they were issues, she said those things, and continued to argue about other things and it didn’t seem to end, at some point I simply blocked her because I hated waking up to angry texts and seeing angry texts before bed. Since then, her behavior has changed: she has put many cleaning product bottles on the bathroom counter so that I couldn’t put things on them, overfilled the kitchen sink so I couldn’t use it, moved things around in the fridge so that I have very minimal room on the shelves of the fridge (on the shelf where people typically place sauce bottles, etc. there are 3 rows – I have access to only 1 row, and it’s only 1/3 of that 1 row, otherwise, I have no other space on the rows, but I have half the space in the fridge itself) she removes anything of mine on the kitchen counter (ex. rice cooker and multivitamins), and whenever my alarm goes off at 5:30am (I have to be at work for 7 so I wake up early to get ready) she wakes up at the same time and showers before me. (She doesn’t work, doesn’t have classes for the summer, and she just came back from her internship at the beginning of August, so it’s assumed that she doesn’t have any responsibilities to do and so I’m guessing that she showered right before I showered in order to slow me down from going to work) Because of her new behavior, she’s made me very uncomfortable for me to be at home, and she always has her boyfriend staying at the apartment as well, meaning that if I argue with them, I have to argue with both of them at once. 

I don’t want to tell her that I blocked her (eventually she’ll figure it out) and I don’t want to talk to her in-person because I generally don’t like conflicts in person and I’m not confident in arguing against 2 people at once. Since she's come back and her behavior changed, I've been avoiding her and have blocked her via text. I’ve talked to the landlord and he says he won’t help me, despite knowing of her behavior towards me. At this point, I can only assume that she’ll continue to do these things, and find new ways to make my life not great while I’m in the apartment for the last month I’m here.

Is there anything I can do in this situation since I have basically no support from the landlord and basically have to go against 2 people? Would this count as intimidation or harassment? Thank you reddit, and advice is greatly appreciated

\&gt; My reasons for choosing an international internship: I would like to gain more experience outside of Atlanta (as I'm born and raised here), It gives me the opportunity to learn a new language (if I go to a non-English speaking country), Overall, it's more interesting to me.

\&gt; ""Why not do a study abroad?"": International internships are longer, I'm getting paid rather than the other way around, I can develop a better sense of living in that country as a resident rather than a visitor (hence, giving me more opportunities to meet the locals, etc.)

I didn't have any luck with dev internships and with this being my last option I saw it as a good way to get my foot in the door. 

I am now dreading my decision as I've come to believe that my time is a bit wasted and it would be a better use of it to develop my skills and work on side projects that might appeal to actual legitimate positions that would further my career.

My Concerns:

I am wondering if my initial thoughts are correct regarding working on coding skills / projects rather than building some basic troubleshooting experience with literally 0 coding while on the job. 

I am worried that leaving this job (which is supposed to be part-time not an internship) before a year (currently 5 months) might look bad on my resume and affect my chances of landing internships/jobs in the future. 

I was wondering if anybody was ever in a similar situation or could provide some good advice on how to proceed? I appreciate any advice regarding my options. "

I like to think of it as the ""catch all"" of engineering disciplines.

I'm looking for a switch into the IT/ IT security industry mainly because I have a large interest in technology mainly. The past two years were just mainly me working in retail / a small role in a finance dept. of an entertainment company.

I'd like to believe that I'm technically adept, I've built computers, set up networking, I'm seen as the tech-support guy in my friend groups.

Currently, I'm taking a certificate program at a university that involves computer security and digital forensics, it's essentially the basics of IT security (Kali, wireshark, etc.). I'm trying to find a job that would complement with what I'm learning so that I can build up my skills and hopefully launch some sort of career for myself in this industry.

I've been applying to all kinds of IT related jobs, from help desk, desktop support, to networking analyst/engineer roles. But not having any luck in regards to landing interviews. Should I be applying to specific kinds of jobs?

Any advice on what to do in regards to changing up my resume and/or cover letter? My resume mainly has my projects I've done in university, which were all engineering based, involving hardware such as microprocessors.

96mukf,51,2018-08-12,"Internship ended yesterday, job not offered. Advice on next steps?",heeyyyyyy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/96mukf/internship_ended_yesterday_job_not_offered_advice/,"I'd been interning at an NYC hedge fund for 2 summer months. I joined this firm as a first step in a prospective career at trading systems, with hope to ascend from there in the same industry. The company pays well, has good industry reputation, and sponsors US work visa - all of which is pretty much all that matters to me at my first US employment after masters (I graduate end of 2018). I should note I have 2.5 years of prior full time experience.    

I had a great 2 months - learnt a ton and met many people. Worked on a niche area of an overall high-tech trading system. I was never assigned dev work, it was mostly analysis and engineering work. I was originally tasked with building an application, but over time I was mostly just given analysis work and when I enquired, was told to continue the analysis as it was very critical, and forget building the application that I originally set out to. I was kind of bummed as I had hoped to build something, but I made peace with it and diligently did my analysis.   

Analysis involved evaluation of 3rd party messaging platform (fast and robust messaging needed since the trading system is of distributed nature), and its integration to current trading architecture. Deliverables were excel sheets, wireshark dumps and message sequence interactions explained, docs explaining messaging platform's service policies (such as congestion control), Q-A format knowledge sharing, presentations to various teams regarding integration issues+solutions. My final deliverable was to create a story for upcoming sprint that leverages all this knowledge shared and gained (by our team as a whole) and set out to build the application that I was originally tasked with.   

So alright - all is good. I demonstrated good work ethics, smiled and kissed asses (to an extent), my presentations were bomb, and my documentation was precise (what else can you expect off analysis work?). There was a ton of messaging domain knowledge that I gained (of the 3rd party tool I mentioned earlier) that was scattered all over my brain, and I was ready to answer any technical questions other teams might have about it as they integrate their microservices to the messaging platform, but that never happened. I was told it would happen, since the messaging is critical to our system - but it never happened.  

Over the 2 months - I had a good relationship with everyone. Got positive feedback all the time from manager (which I questioned too because I wanted some criticism, but I never got any). He even discussed me coming back in the fall, and checked my availability. Often added stories to our backlog and said I can pick it up when I come back full time. My junior team-mates (s/w engg 1s) also gave positive feedback to me and said they were looking forward to working together when I came back full time. They said my work was promising and that it tied up into a few other teams, so coordination would be great. Given all this - I was hopeful and also tried working with the long term picture in mind, you know - investing in learning and getting into division meetings (as invited to by my manager) that improved my overall system knowledge to reap benefits in near future (not always immediate and not necessarily during internship tenure).   

Come last day of internship, HR tells me they cannot offer. Reasons given was that I was lazy, did not push enough and missed a sprint deadline. First I was hearing of all this critical feedback! I go pack my desk, walk over to my manager who stalls me for 2 hours (he suddenly had meetings!), but finally get a hold of him. We took a walk. I was told that I missed a sprint deadline (sprint, as in scrum, as in fucking *agile*!). To which I reminded him that the story's scope was changed by him in middle of sprint, which he agreed but then said I was expected to burn the midnight oil and complete things by sprint end whatever it takes. I told him that I worked an average 9.5 hours a day (1.5 hr free work over contract), since I kept track of my in/out. While my company contract listed overtime pay, my manager suggested since day 1 that I do not punch in any overtime for internship since it was my learning phase. Which I thought was fair and happily obliged to. Anyhow, coming back to the grave failure of missed sprint deadline - I was advised that hedge fund is a super fast pace industry and that since I don't burn the midnight oil and miss sprint deadline, hence am not a good fit. This is coming from a manager who works 12+ hours daily on average.  

That being said, the manager is a senior technical guy. He is very smart and analytical, and I respect him. I will continue to maintain a good relationship with him, and get his recommendations in securing future positions. My only bummer was late feedback of being laid-back which, if they are being honest, was the one and only deal breaker in my getting a full time. If that really is an honest feedback, it was quite fixable if I had gotten it few weeks back. We here are all good at slapping together things and marking stories ""done"" if needed. That being said, I have never gotten the feedback of being laid-back, and I am personally quite self aware. I am one of the most uptight people out there, and try to be efficient+productive in every which way (that being the reason I do not work beyond 9-10 hours, although I have worked 11 hours few days towards the last few weeks - again, for no overtime pay).   

As I see it - the internship was poorly planned. Feedback system was terrible. When the tenure ended, the boss and his boss concluded that I hadn't pushed enough story points across the kanban board because I started work at 6 AM (since we have a team in Asia) and left at 3 PM (before most others left). Much of my work was never credited for on the scrum tool (I never cared too much for story points since my manager was always aware of my actual work through daily updates, and he was the one who updated the kanban board for me).   

**Question:** I feel bummed out having put so much effort into this for no return. I got in this for a longer haul, built relationships, worked my ass off, took 2 whole notebooks worth of notes/analysis (which is trash now) - and now have to start at square 1 at a new company.   

But that is enough lamenting. What advice do you have for me - in regards to my experience and what next steps I take? This sub has been my bible for the past few years - thank you so much everyone!! Will my market value be somewhat higher coming out of this internship? How can I tackle full time search now? I am thinking NYC, since it is the heart of finance and I am set on building a career in trading systems. What job hunt strategies can you recommend? If, based on the readup, you can think of areas I could do better at professionally - please criticize harshly and give suggestions openly. Immense thank you!"

Ive been working on quitting medical school for a software job for a few months now. I wanted to get independent from an abusive father (severely abusive- 3-4 bipolar fits a day with physical beatings every now and then)

I started with an online bootcamp focused in Python and Java during the nights. I got a few small projects done (small web pages, a blog, a forum, a robotics project on my own moving some controllers)

I kind of figured I needed a CS degree of some sort unless I was a super god at coding (my undergrad is bioengineering).

Im currently in georgia tech's omscs program. (masters in cs)

Today was a pretty bad day where he just said leave the house you have 30 minutes to pack your things over a cucumber that had rotten in the fridge at the bottom shelf. While things may calm down I definitely want to full gear ahead and jump on being independent and fast forward my job search

Any recommendations?

1) Ive decided to stick to the CA, OR, WA area, currently a silicon valley resident.

2) I currently have around 150-200 k to my name

I have one DBA internship 

3) Ideally I would like to start working October or later, I need August to brush up my code interview skills for now.

And I would really like to move somewhere with a lower cost of living than silicon valley, which shouldnt be hard because all the other locations are cheaper. (My eye has been on seattle for a while)

I have academic experience in Economics, Statistics, and Computer Science.

- I'm in the Bay area currently with a $30/hour salary as a QA/devops intern

- I'm getting it extended by a few weeks, but probably not by enough to get it to count as another co-op

- I have a few interviews for other positions which are all really interesting to me (data science roles), but I'm not super confident I would get any of them

I'm a student about to move to Tokyo in a short while for a journalistic internship and therefor I finally have to say goodbye to my beloved desktop PC. I will have my own computer at work but for mobile writing and for my personal use I am looking for a very portable and reliable laptop/netbook/ultrabook.

My budget is quite limited (under 300€) so I am currently searching at the used market. So far chromebooks and refurbished Thinkbooks (like the x220, 30) have caught my eye. Chromebooks would offer amazing battery and portability for a great prize but I worry that only depending on the Chrome OS and Webstore and not owning a 'real' computer to install programs and save files on could cause me problems in the long run (for example if I would have to use programs like Photoshop etc.)? The Thinkpad on the other hand would may be competent enough to function as a light work station and be yet very handy. However I heard that the battery isn\&amp;#39;t that great and of course the components are older overall.

What do you guys think? I would be very happy about any recommendations :) Thanks!

* **Total budget and country of purchase:**

Germany 300€

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.**

I am not sure about that...

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**

Important

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**

Any is fine for me but I don't have any experience with Linux

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**

&lt; 13 Inches would be great. 10-11 ideal

**Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**

No. But maybe will have to use Photoshop

**If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**

No.

**Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**

A fair enough keyboard. Not sure if a touch screen would be necessary but it would be nice. The others are not needed"

My career goal has always been to shortly do SE at a top company and then transition to PM.  I feel as though I have three options at this point:

1. If I take classes at a CC this fall, the school has said they will let me back in for winter and I can finish my degree in 2 years.  My grades are good when I'm healthy so I'm confident I can finish it out.  However, I was supposed to graduate this year so I'll be 24 when I'm finally done. Top companies recruit at my school very heavily for both SE and PM.
2. I can try to get a job as a dropout. I do have several internships at large non-tech companies but no other experience so I'm not sure who would hire me and I'm pretty sure Big 4 is out of the question. I suppose it may be possible to work myself up to a better company but I have no idea if that's possible/likely.
3. I can dropout and do a bootcamp, I'm thinking one with a good rep like App Academy. From what I've seen, bootcamp grads take pretty significant pay cuts but at least most programs are only 3 months long. Once again though, not sure if it would be possible to work up to a top company or become a PM with only a bootcamp on my resume.

I have always been interested in mathematics and really loved learning linear algebra and calculus. Going in depth into concepts like optimisation and computational geometry really interest me. 

On the other hand I feel that the internship would give me a different exposure. At the moment, I am unsure about whether I want to pursue further education (probably a master's degree) or if I want to work after my bachelor's degree. The internship would probably allow me to decide if I want to study more or work.

96q1eb,8,2018-08-12,"Working at Front Desk in a very popular hotel chain. Was excited about the job, but Red Flags. Should I leave my job? Or am I crazy?",Spam-The-Ham,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/96q1eb/working_at_front_desk_in_a_very_popular_hotel/,"Hello ~ Im not sure if this thread is appropriate but I do need some advice. I have experience in accounts and customer services. I recently joined a huge hotel chain at the front desk because it really appealed to me, but there’s a lot of red flags. I started under two months ago, and staff are telling me this is normal. I feel like it’s not.

1. Work hours are terrible. Im prepared for long hours. BUT. Im not paid for going OT on a daily basis. (Even though I am new and I understand that I am slow). I work 9-6:30, I’m not done closings cashier until past 7. Basically I can’t go in until the next person arrives to even close my money box, even if we are busy and they are late. (I also wear heels at work, and don’t sit for almost the entire time).

2. Pay is terrible. Post taxes/retirement fund etc, I average 7 USD per hour (no I don’t work in the states). So our money has to come from up-selling which is hard in a full hotel. [Which is fine. I get it and is in my contract. Need to mention I was expecting a pay cut when I signed up for this job. However the problem is that] OT has to be approved; if you don’t finish on time its just the way things are. I asked my friend, she thinks that you closing your cashier isn't really part of your paid shift. [Also this relates to point #10 later.]

3. I cry after I come home from work usually. The stress is a lot [given that I live in a popular city], and I’m expected to be able to learn at a fast pace, plus a steep learning curve. [Should have mentioned that I am prepared to learn, but] I have so much fear from this job alone. I don't care when i enter work.

4. I don’t fit in at work. I am usually a sociable person. BUT. Everyone usually speaks Chinese and when I ask about what they are discussing, people usually wave me off and say not to worry. (English is our Primary Language) I think it pays to know what’s going on at the front desk. Also I’m not a social media person, so most of my commonalities are gone.

5. Stupid high turn over. Due to the timing of the year, a lot of people have been recently hired. We have some interns who leave every couple of months; so MONTHLY turn over. Atm, about 50% of our staff at the Front Desk have been working for 3 months or less, and we are still under staffed/people are leaving. [I understand high turnover, but is THIS high normal?]

6. Im not a fan of management. My managers do their job well, don’t get me wrong. But, some of their handling just makes me question things. E.g. they yelled at my friend (who is also new) in front of the entire back office for her mistake, instead of taking her back to discuss it. Im not sure how to make an effort with them but I also I feel like they just don't make the effort with me unless im doing something wrong.

7. I don’t find management very encouraging. I want to i improve and Im usually good at taking criticism. But I get ‘told’ on what to improve more than encouraged. E.g I panic a bit because Im so nervous, so I need to fix that. Despite best efforts on working on it, Ive also been told: “Don’t forget you’re still on your probation period. Later, things will be difficult for us, If you don’t improve.” I didn’t think that was very encouraging.

8. I don't fit 'the look'. Just so many things that Im told that I need to improve on. e.g My hair has too much volume (I have short slightly wavy asian hair) so I’m expected to ‘fix it’ despite using a stupid amount of gel and hairspray. I should wear contacts because apparently Im not as pretty in glasses etc. Pain in ass but I get it. **The icing on the cake** is when I was told that the way I speak is ‘too polite’ and I need to fix it by choosing my words carefully. (I have a clear American accent by the way). So I need to speak LESS politely. Which is pretty ridiculous. [As one Redditor mentioned, I go into work worried if I look and behave like a model.]

9. Don’t get my roster until Sunday night. [Like I literally don't know my work week until the night before I start.] We can’t choose our shifts [which I understood when I signed up for the job. It just makes it hard if you're getting your roster last-minute plus not being able to choose your shift]. Either, so theres no regular work-life balance. So its hard planning my life, unless I ask for days off. I also have no sleeping pattern, which I assume is normal in this industry? [I've worked in restaurants alot, so getting used to this.]

10. The real alarm bell: We have a membership program that we need to enrol people in. Majority of our guests are already members so it’s really hard. Some times we forget to ask, but we are understaffed and often push 95% occupancy. At first, manager started encouraging us, saying that our pay raise depended on it. (Ie we don’t get raises if we don’t meet it). Not much changed. Then one of my seniors above me (but below my boss) started implementing a ‘coin jar’ where if we are caught not getting people to join, we HAVE to put a dollar into this jar. Managers know whats going on but didn't say anything. It’s shit. I got called out, and I thought you’re kidding right? They weren’t. In the end it wasn’t me who forgot, but it’s still shit.

I get that I’m new. But I feel like Im seeing red flags. Please tell me if I am crazy. Career advancement is good in this company, and I'm willing to put in the hard work if its reasonable and paid. Hence I don’t want to just give it up. Nor do I want to quit too soon. I feel very disappointed, since I was looking forward to this role. Im at work for about 50+ hrs a week, But its causing me to [unnecessarily and unfairly] lose time with family.

TL;DR: Want to quit my front desk job that I was excited about joining. Red flags everywhere. The work is interesting, but not enjoying this actual work environment. Sorry for the long post.

-------------------------
Edit: Thank you for the replies! I wrote this on my phone, so I apologise if I sound like a spoon-fed baby. I should have read over it again. I think I need to mention that I was prepared for the hard work and crap that this industry has, but the last thing that I wanted was to be taken advantage of. I study my notes at home, and watch youtube on the systems when i need to.

The question: I'm wondering whether the ER, or WM position would open more doors in the future.  The ER internship is more analytical and has opportunities for me to experiment and have my own projects, in addition to contributing towards reports, but it's a smaller name. On the other hand, the WM internship is for a name brand which may lead to better connections and a nice addition to the resume, but after some research on Glassdoor it seems like a lot of grunt and administrative work.

Also would it be easier to transition from WM to ER, or vice versa?"

* UIL Computer Science team (10th-12th), team leader (11th-12th), I held 2 hours meetings after school weekly. 
Got 1st place individual district level both years, 1st and 2nd place team programming both years. UIL is a Texas competition with lots of different subjects, and is popular only in Texas schools.

* Built a 3D printed arduino drone, code and tuning is all done by me. Planning to make a maker portfolio from this.

* USACO Gold level

* 1 long month competitive programming camp

* ~750 hours of volunteer work, almost all from being a counselor at a camp for kids with special needs

* NHS (lol)

**Rec Letters:** Planning to get one letter from English teacher (will likely be generic), one from CS teacher (we're buddies, I can write it myself and he'll sign and send it), one from NASA mentor (also my robotics coach, apparently writes killer letters of recs)


**Questions:**

* Should I apply to MIT early? I want to rack up more activities and better scores before I submit my application, but having an extra chance if I'm deferred sounds pretty good.


I know my scores and GPA/class rank is trash, but I think my ECs seem pretty good. I really want to get into MIT, not sure I have a chance with these scores.
If you have school recommendations, I will definitely take them. I really need more fits ;-;
Please be mean and brutally honest. Thank you!

Sure enough, the officer spotted the open container in the back and the cup up front, along with an empty gatorade bottle for our mixer. They registered it as two cups and gave me an MIC, and my driver a DWI. I am not sure whether my ticket says there was an Admission of guilt. I never admitted to drinking, nor did the officer test me, but i am not sure what my driver said. I had a drink earlier on in the night, however. 

The person I was with later got her whole case dismissed because her BAC was .06, under the legal limit for Texas. I still have my ticket to deal with, however.

I really want to know what the best move is to take care of this.  Should I seek a lawyer now or do whatever the state wants me to do for a dismissal and get it expunged later on?

(I think I am suffering from imposter syndrome),orangepylon5354,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/96tg4h/career_advice_for_a_new_hire_that_hates_software/,"I recently graduated from an electrical engineering program and am currently one month into working for a large semiconductor company in a software engineering type role. I did my internship with this company and they wanted to hire me back after graduation. At the time I was going through a rough patch and made a questionable choice to accept the offer for all the wrong reasons (big company, decent salary, felt good to be wanted, hard to find another job).

Now I am finding that I have actually become very miserable because I severely struggle everyday with understanding how code works. I'm suffering from imposter syndrome, where I feel like a fraud and that I have only gotten as far as I have by a significant amount of luck and deceiving people into thinking I'm a lot smarter than I actually am. For example, in my internship I once wrote a 1000 line function that did not include other function calls and was almost completely unreadable (but somehow it worked). I also got almost all of my technical interview questions wrong (which were supposed to be easy). They knew all of this this and still hired me back.

But I feel that the problem is bigger than just struggling and not liking what I am currently working on. The bigger problem is that I simply hate software. I have so much admiration for people who love software and are good at it, but it just isn't for me.

My current plan is to try and continue to do my best and try to tough it out for at least a year and then go back to school to do something different if I still feel the same way. My passion is in working with numbers, mathematical/statistical models and some sort of analysis. I really enjoyed R programming in university that involved statistical simulation of stochastic processes. I know that I probably can't get away from writing code completely because it is a very useful skill in many fields; I'd just prefer to have a job that isn't solely about software.

96ugsc,1,2018-08-12,MBA in strategic management from GA Tech?,HumbleRaspberry15,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/96ugsc/mba_in_strategic_management_from_ga_tech/,"Hey everyone - posted this under /r/gatech but was advised to post here as well :)

I'm looking into applying for the strategic management MBA at Tech - where I secretly always wished I had gone for undergrad instead of UGA. :) I'm not sure if I'd be able to get in or not (I'm DETERMINED, but I'm also realistic); can you guys tell me if I should try to apply or go get some experience?

\- Purpose for applying: after many career pursuits I've realized strategic consulting is my business calling. My greatest passion is using my ability to think big and strategically work backwards to create execution plans to build great businesses. I also possess natural talent in many areas needed to do this: web design for conversions, copywriting for both advertising and internal communications, creative marketing, photography, leadership, team building, communications, quick and creative problem solving, passion for data and analytics (using it strategically.. I'm not great with the actual math and numbers) etc. I'm an extrovert who is warm, disarming and truly cares about what the other person has to say, and I'm just flat out DRIVEN. However, I have heavily avoided corporate America, believing that my outside-the-box thinking would be frowned upon, and also not loving structure and schedule. I've grown up a bit and realized some structure is necessary for a well-lived life. Tech's program seems, more than any other in Georgia, to offer the best learning environment for someone who was meant to specifically be a strategic consultant. I'm also looking for intensive education in the areas I can't teach myself.

\- My job experience, while unique, may not be what they look for: I worked in the music industry for five years, fully taking the reigns in a regional powerhouse that lacked internal leadership and I created almost every department that exists in its marketing to this day. Our biggest competitor was always copying the ideas I was implementing in our marketing. The company was better off for it, but didn't grow like I was aiming for; there were much deeper management and product issues above me that nobody below could fix... including the fact that I was exploited for my naive passion and made $125 per week working near full time (very common in entertainment industry). I also pursued an entrepreneurial artist management job with my creative equal and we hustled to say the least, and began to grow regional results. He moved to LA and I experienced severe psychological trauma soon after we began creating real fans. Since he moved and I left that toxic industry I have been working as an assistant to an interior designer and developing infrastructure for my own luxury photography business, but haven't launched yet.

\- I transformed completely as a person and stepped up to the plate after the trauma (lots of rewiring my brain, etc), but because of it the last year has been a little lacking on paper as far as strategic management.

\- 3.28 GPA from UGA marketing undergrad + music business certification. Many music business internships.

\- No GRE/GMAT scores yet, but I had strong ACT/SAT scores so I'm confident in my standardized testing skills

\- I have options for strong recommendation letters, but would it be strange to get one from my direct supervisor in the music industry? Numerous other professional recommendations available but my direct supervisor was not responsible for my exploitation and would give me a great one. It was my longest and strongest experience in the field.

\- My real competitive advantage as a person is that I see what nobody else can, I will find solutions nobody else will, and I will create excellence for a business owner every step of the way. I think bigger than competitors, I connect and generate ideas faster than anyone, I come up with solutions that nobody else does, and I'm an excellent communicator and strong leader. I work my ass off and when someone is invested in my expertise, I am fully immersed in their potential and the combination is (historically) ALWAYS ahead of the others.

I just don't know how much Tech would look at POTENTIAL versus PAST. My life hasn't gone the way I thought it would, but I'm ready to make up for lost years. This is what I am BEST at, and this is how I want to change the landscape of local, national, and global business. (Not in the entertainment industry.. NEVER again.)

Someone suggested a marketing or entrepreneurship path - I'm honestly tired of working with businesses who see marketing as a necessary evil rather than golden opportunity, and I'd be hesitant to work with more startups. I've only ever worked with ones who were bootstrapping and had nothing they could truly offer for my expertise. Kind of swore off of them honestly.

Thanks for advice - I know that got long :)"

Right after I finished HS, I started learning Python from *'How to Automate the Boring Stuff with python"".* ( I  already knew C++ and GameDev with Unity3D before that and  I also had published some apps out there too ) .

&amp;nbsp;



So I attended this internship interview at a local company in my city that does freelance Web and App development. The thing is I've only learnt Python by doing a lot of practical stuff...GUI, Games and recently learnt a bit of Django. The internship position was a junior Django Developer, the company said they'd train me in Django and I only needed to know Python. So when I went there and after all the formalities and paperwork, I was given a '**test'.** Basically, they made me create a fucking **UpWork** account ( online freelance site ) and went over to the tests tab and make me take a multiple choice test of 50 questions.( Not even sure if UpWork allows this)

&amp;nbsp;



Not one question was about Django and they were all ambiguous..about many things  I didn't even want to learn..Like neural networks...super threading and all that. It gave me a rating of 3 out of 5 stars and it's supposedly **good enough** for someone my age ( pretty sure they tell that to everyone ). And since I couldn't pass the test I'll have to pay 100$$ every month to attend the internship ( You see how stupid this is going ) for a certificate in the end.  **I wasn't made to write a single Python program, not even one nor did they bother to ask about my experience or my GitHub projects.** Only the upwork test.

The fact that I was stuck in Ithaca while 99% of my friends were in big cities working at awesome jobs makes it even worse.

I recently graduated with a degree in computer science from a top university. I didn't do any internships or year-in-industry as we call them because I wanted to graduate sooner. 

I have worked on personal projects during my time at university and kept an up to date github page. On top of university, I learnt web development to the point where I can comfortably create website that I am genuinely happy with. HTML, CSS, Javascript along with couple libraries.

I know a variety of languages, version control systems, software development methodologies, testing and databases.

I've applied for shit ton of graduate level software dev jobs. Out of 50 odd jobs I applied for on indeed.co.uk only 2, yes, 2 employers even opened my application. roughly 96% of employers haven't even looked at my application. Where else can I look for jobs? What can I do to get employers to even look at my application? 

I feel like I have all the skills and confidence to get those jobs but I'm not even being considered. 

I'm not picky, I'm in a fortune position where my parents are still supporting me financially, I'm willing to work for minimal wage, just to get more experience. 

Software Devs in UK, where do you look for employment?

- ME: developers often start working on features and define the details later on, and this is the essence of agile programming.

- HE (mockingly): I'm sorry but I'm not the only one...

I was so angry at him after that. He stop what he was doing and forced us to complete the analysis part before I move on with the work. 

A few days later, we had another disagreement regarding the way one of the modules was being written. He didn't know of the tech choice I made (I thought he knew), so he had a talk with me about the fact he was the lead architect and, because he's responsible for the outcome of the project, he wants to be involved (or aware) of every decision that has an impact on the software's architecture. Then we wasted 3 more hours redefining how we were going to do that module, forcing me to change the way I was working because he deemed it ""unsafe"" and didn't trust the tech I chose.

I ended up on this company because it's near my home, but it's a small company (20 people) and this guy is the company's rock star, and acts with total impunity because nobody from upper management says anything to him, ever.

I know there's no single good answer to these questions, but here goes:
If I'm finishing college in the next two years having obtained 
- BS in Computer Science
- CCNA
- 1 or 2 internships

What positions should I be applying for? If my goal is to get a SysAdmin or NetAdmin position right after graduation, would these qualifications be enough to skip help desk? If not, should I even bother spending my last two years of uni seeking internships, or instead take the next couple months to get my A+ cert and apply for help desk jobs while I'm finishing my degree?

I'm not too confident about figuring out a career path, so if I'm not thinking about this the right way, please go ahead and lay into me."

It is very back and forth, and even the other interns are only assigned to their single projects. I got the internship extended into the next semester with hopes of working here full time once I graduate; I am just curious as to how normal this is in the industry and if I should be worried in any sort of capacity.

Although I do hang out in my school's ACM office a lot, I am the only person usually who never had an interview with a Big N company, while all my friends/acquiantances usually have at least a couple of interviews with them, and honestly, it's pretty disheartening.

I was lucky enough to get an internship at a well-known company starting my sophomore year, which I enjoyed and managed to get a return offer. Junior year, I only interviewed with 3 decent, but not great companies (granted I tried to not aim lower than what I had) but despite getting an offer from 2 of them, I accepted the return offer. I just finished the same internship again and I don't think I'll do it full-time tbh. 

And honestly, I've been told my resume isn't bad either by multiple critiques, and that it should be able to at least get my foot in the door to some companies, but nada. I've practiced a lot over the past year and I've completed all the firecode problems and I've also done over 100 leetcode problems by now. I think I can kill technical interviews, even at some of the Big N. The interview problems that I've done the past year felt like a cakewalk. My ACM peers talk about the interviews they've had and the questions they couldn't figure out at some of these companies, which if I'm being honest, don't seem to be hard to me. And it irritates me because I feel like I could at least do well in the technical questions, but I'm just never given opportunities in the first place. Sorry if this comes off as arrogant.

I honestly don't know how to deal with this whole idea of feeling inferior to all my friends. How could I get an interview at some of these good companies?"

97282e,2,2018-08-13,Job Offer vs. Current,goamash,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/97282e/job_offer_vs_current/,"Background: I was hired on at my current company early 2017. Took two months maternity leave at the begining of 2018. While on leave I was asked if I could attend a videoconference call with the President/CEO and my boss (a VP) to discuss an opportunity. This opportunity was that my boss is retiring early/ again and they offered for me to take the helm at my divisional office. At the time it was only my boss, myself, and another guy. Other guy wasn't working out so he was let go and I was told to get to hiring, which I've done over the last few months. 2 hires and an intern on deck for the fall and this rounds out my team for now.


Last week I got an email from someone I had interviewed with when last looking for a job (when I settled on where I currently work) and due to timing and circumstances on both parties part we couldn't quite make it work, which I lameneted because this company does more of what is in my wheel house and interests (I work in construction with numbers, so project type and company portfolio of work matters when it comes to what you're good at and like to do). Per his email, he definitely regrets not having hired me at that time. I like my current job and while its not a factor for everyone, I weigh in that they have been very good to me. 

So I respond back thanks for thinking of me and it was kind of a former boss of mine to tell the offeror (they are old friends) that he was an idiot. 

Fast forward to this week and I got a wall of text saying he can appreciate that, sounds like you have a good set up, but I'd be remiss if I didn't make my offer hard to say no to. The current company I work for is big, does work nationally. The prospective company is a juggernaut and there was a very open ended tell me what it would take and could we even convince you to come have coffee with us (people with owner or a ""C"" in their title). Its a position with similar weight to what I have and I'm sure I could go knock it out of the park. Perhaps relevant or not, I'm young to have found myself with the particular title I have in my industry - usually its guys in their 40s- 50s (which is how our other offices are structured/staffed) and I'm a few years off of 30 yet. 

I'm conflicted on whether even entertain this. There is an off chance that if I went through the interview circus and got everything I wanted (which I know they can afford and I could name my price) I might be causing people that I just hired their jobs. That and not wanting to scorn people who were good to me and put a lot of faith in me. On the flip side, there is a lot to gain and day to day content I'd be happier doing (I do like my job here, I just like project type and dollar value of prospective company's projects better).


What would anyone else do? Is it worth hearing them out in person? Am I letting an emotional component (seriously, if this panned out and I left there would be some major guilt) possibly over ride something that could be yet another big jump up in my career hold me back, or are those things valid?

Thanks in advance for any advice you may have.

I have two possible offers this fall for jobs. The first job is a co-op for a Large Company non-tech enterprise in Atlanta (rail transport) in their IT department open source group for 3 months (I am not exactly sure what I will be doing but they said configuring and setting up Apache Servers that host a lot of applications). Second is for a full on React developer contractor for a small company (5 people ) which will last 1-1.5 months project where I will be a sole developer working alongside a remote team on a modern project. So far I had an internship in react-native this summer and a front-end developer contracting project back in Spring with some React. My goal is to become a frontend/full-stack developer for a mid size startup in the bay area. I really love working in React/React-Native but I have to make a choice of having a good project with small name on my resume with a cool project or having a big name with the possibility of not working on a cool project. The part I am unsure about with the Large Company is it sounds like a lot of devops/IT work (software development is under the IT department). If I go to the big company should I ask to do a side project in React/Front end ? After all they are the open source group. The pay for contracting is higher but it is shorter so the co-op ends up paying the same over three months.

If you were in my shoes what would you choose?

Also I am worried if I deny the offer from the large company, and the small company decides to scrap the project before I start that could be a possibility because they both start mid September and a lot can happen between now and then. "
972l9p,1,2018-08-13,Looking for an upgrade ~€1100/$1200 (Europe),Revenaant,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/972l9p/looking_for_an_upgrade_11001200_europe/,"Hey there, I'm a game development student abroad in the Netherlands, going into 3rd year. I've recently come into the chance of upgrading from my Lenovo y700 GTX 960m, i7-6700HQ into something better because while it still holds up with how I use it, it definitely gets pushed hard(mainly gpu). It has to be a laptop because I move between places quite often. My family is helping in with 1000 USD and whatever I have saved up, which ain't a whole lot. Here's the form:

* **Total budget and country of purchase:**

Netherlands, \~€1100/$1200, I could go a couple hundred higher if needed but as a student I'm rummaging as I can.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.**

Best specs, battery is nice but laptop will be plugged most of the time so not very important.

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**

Not much.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**

Windows.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**

15-17""

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**

Gaming, game development. I do mostly programming in Visual Studio and work in Unity (possibly moving into other game engines soon) but I often crack up Maya, Photoshop, Adobe Audition, Substance Painter, etc. as needed. I'm not usually the one doing rendering, except for tasks like Light baking in Unity maybe.

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**

Monster Hunter World, The Witcher 3, Stellaris, Overwatch. I usually play rpgs. Mid-High settings at \~40fps would make me more than happy.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**

I'd like the keyboard to be decent and I care about the build quality. I move almost daily walking/biking between home and University and will soon have an internship.. somewhere. A display with better Hz or colours would be a plus.No need for optical drive or touchscreen.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

So I'm asking for advice after a couple of hard research days as I recently discovered Clevo laptops are a thing. I've read about a bunch of nice keywords like ""P models are better than N models"" for build quality and heat management, and the almighty Prema Bios which I personally don't think I'd take much advantage of. From my conclusions HIDevolution and Obsidian are the places to go because of top tier support and care for their products. Being in the Netherlands Obsidian seems like the choice to go for. However I'm still unsure if I should go for a Clevo laptop (since all the nice things make it pricier) or stick to the common brands.P.S. I'm Scared of Acer and HP laptops from what I read of their build quality.P.S.S. And how bad are Dell displays? In comparison to, say, my Lenovo y700 (which I know doesn't have the best colours).

I really appreciate any help you may be able to provide and any advice that may clear up my head. I know I'm a bad poor because I have expensive tastes with this kind of stuff and hardware creep is a thing when I get enticed from comparing how better a gtx 1060 is over a 1050ti and such.

Sorry for the long post, I hope it's alright."
972lcb,2,2018-08-13,Offered permanent role at dream job but with unfair salary?,LewisAy,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/972lcb/offered_permanent_role_at_dream_job_but_with/,"Hi,

I recently graduated from university and was fortunate enough to achieve a first class degree in aerospace engineering. On top of this I managed to secure an interview as a graduate design engineer at my dream company in the space sector. Unfortunately I was turned down due to lack of experience, however I pestered them for more detailed feedback and out of the blue they changed their mind and offered me a summer internship instead. I accepted and a week after my last exam I started with other summer interns who have not graduated and who will return to university in September. The company was not prepared to offer me a graduate salary (60% more than an internship) as I was a risk due to my lack of experience. But said I may be able to secure a permanent graduate role to start with other graduates in September after my internship had finished - provided my performance was up to scratch. This I completely understood, I just felt so fortunate to be given a chance.

I had also been offered a role on a 2 year graduate scheme with graduate salary at an advanced manufacturing research centre to start in September. I always figured this as my back-up incase I did not get the permanent offer at my current company. However, today my line manager approached me and told me how he had been approached by several of my colleagues who have mentioned how well I had been performing and how they need to find a way to keep me on permanently. He then proceeded to offer me a permanent role, but said the company could not afford another graduate salary so I'd continue at an intern's wage until March. Where my performance will be reviewed again and a salary change can be discussed as this is the time when the budgets can be reallocated or something along those lines.

Now I don't want people to think I am only about the money, because that is not the case, but my mind is seriously divided right now. I am not exactly living comfortably, I have little expendable income as the rent in the area is very high for an internship salary. The other manufacturing role have offered to pay me 60% more than I'm earning right now, the company and the role also both interest me, the area is far cheaper, I have friends who are local, I have not experienced any other engineering company and the company is offering me a graduate scheme where I cycle through departments, which sounds really good.

But I really, really enjoy the work at the company I'm working for now, they have given me tons of responsibility and I feel like I'm learning a lot. I also feel in debt to them as they gave me a chance early in my career. But I feel like I'm worth more than an intern, I do require guidance occasionally, but I'm doing the same jobs as any other non-senior design engineer. Come September the other interns will return to university and the new batch of graduate engineers will arrive, they will be doing identical work to me and I will very likely be showing them the ropes on their first weeks. And yet they will be earning significantly more than me for 6 months, and who's to say I will guaranteed get a salary to match theirs in March? The company may delay a salary change even further, or worse; go bust. (The company makes no money and is entirely funded by large investments dependent on technology milestones).

So my question is this:

Is my dream job worth living in cheap shared accommodation in a boring town where I don't know anyone, where it takes me an hour to get to work with trains which get delayed everyday for up to an hour sometimes, for a life style which is hardly more financially stable than being a student? And I'll have to work everyday with people who are doing the exact same work and are just as qualified but will earn 60% more than me for an unforeseeable amount of time? I'd be turning down an alternative well paid graduate scheme at an *alright* company where everything but the work is superior?

Or should I take this other graduate offer? Or maybe negotiation is an option in my position? Or am I just being a spoilt brat?

Thanks for reading."

I’m sorry if this doesn’t belong in this sub. 

Here’s a little background about me: I’m going into my junior year of university in NYC and my major is CS. I took a class in C++ when I was a senior in high school and have taken 2 programming courses in Java in college. I really just learned the basics of the C++ language and don’t remember much, but I would say I’m proficient in Java. This is because my university uses Java to teach OOP and DS&amp;A. 

I don’t really have much more technical knowledge and experience. I’ve learned a little bit of HTML &amp; CSS, but definitely not enough to add them as skills on my resume or LinkedIn. I haven’t had an internship yet nor have I done any real personal projects. I’ve done very small, meaningless academic projects that I’ve listed on my resume.

With all of that being said, I love coding... except when I can’t find a bug in my code! But seriously, I really enjoy creating and improving stuff. I’ve always been passionate about tech and the amazing things that are possible with it. I’m ready to do whatever it takes to gain knowledge and experience. I’m ready to take the next step.

Please let me know if I left out anything important or if you’d like to get a better picture of me and what’s going on.

Thank you!

I've been working on the same project for most of this time, with little guidance other than some basic requirements and some notes on direction/scope from an engineer I am working relatively closely with. So my part in this company is not very impactful, which I think is to be expected for an intern.

But I came across something that's concerning to me, a job posting from my company looking to take on another intern, where the job description matches closely with the role I currently fill. It consists of the same core requirements of my position, plus a few additional, like Javascript experience (something I don't have). 

This is my first internship, and from what I've read companies typically don't cut internships short,  they usually let the internship expire and simply don't extend an offer to stay afterwards. But this is still disconcerting. Is this an indication that I could be replaced soon? Or is it more likely they're just looking for more interns to work in this area?

I haven't had any real feedback during my time here, nor have I been placed on any kind of employee improvement plan.

Any perspectives, insight and/or experiences would be deeply appreciated, as I'm not sure what my next steps should be."

I had initially planned on going through with the general Associate of Science, as that is typically what the Collin advisors recommend if you’re showing any uncertainty in your major choice. But after some further reading of my own, I’m getting the idea it would be better to just take the courses I know will transfer, up to the point that I become eligible for assured transfer admission (42+ hrs, 3.0+, etc.). **Would simply meeting the assured admission criteria be the optimal use of my time?** I would hate to waste time and money on courses that didn’t provide any progress toward my BS.

As well, if I should go the AS route, **I’m wondering if you guys think it would be valuable to complete an AS in Computer Science rather than General Studies with the idea of it being a small enhancement to my resume when it comes time for internships** or other CS-centric work before obtaining a BS. I don’t know if that would be the case, and I’m not married to the idea or anything, I’ve just been brainstorming ways to get the most value from my time at community college aside from extracurriculars.

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you!!

So last night I came home at about 10:00pm and parked across the street from my house.  At about 5:00 pm I came home and realized my car was missing.  After various hoops and phone calls and an attempted police report I found out at 9:00pm that my car had been towed and that the cost is $205 but will increase to $235 (increases $30 a day) tomorrow  by 8:00 Am (when they open). 

From what I read in the police report/print out they gave me at my local police precinct it looks like they towed me because I was blocking someone’s driveway. There is only one driveway on that street and I was definitely not in any way blocking it.  I was close to where this “driveway” is but I was not parked in front of it or near a sign or any colored curb.  

Tomorrow I’m getting a ride down and forking over the money to get my car back and to stop any more fees.  

I really want to fight this but it couldn’t have come at a worse time.  I am scheduled to leave the country in 2 weeks to start a semester abroad.  

Is there anything I should do?  What should my course of action be?  Is it bad to fork over the money now instead of just trying to fight it?

So here's my question Is it really important to have a LinkedIn profile. As I have seen mostly developers are usually found on Twitter or they have their own blogs or they are found on Reddit Dev Communities. I believe LinkedIn is great for recruiters but if you want to learn more and get exposure to tech world then I think dev communities play an important role especially I have learned a lot from Reddit and famous devs sharing knowledge on twitter. Long story short let's say you barely engage on LinkedIn but you are actively maintaining your blog writing about software or anything you have learned or even using your spare time contributing to open source on GitHub then is it important to have LinkedIn does it play important role while getting hired or can our blog/ Github profile play they same role what LinkedIn does ?

At my Uni, we have to apply to a Lab for a one year research position to do research and write our master thesis there. I had found a very interesting project about ADHD and applied. During my interview I mentioned my ADHD as one of the reasons I’m interested in the project. I got the position but should have been evaluated first by my lab team during an internship I wanted to do anyways.

To make it short, the lab is a shit show. The team is great! But unfortunately the prof lied to the other employees about the actual status of the project (which is causing one by one to leave), doesn’t think the old methods are problematic (which they are) and the prof talks bad behind the back of others etc. I also realized that the work I would be able to do for my master thesis would be very boring for me. That’s why I went to the prof yesterday to explain to her that I’m rejecting her offer (which I had confirmed by her after she found out I also applied to another master position the week before). I focused my reasoning on my lack of interest in the work I would do and that I wouldn’t feel it’s fair to work on a project I’m not 100% committed to. After asking if I had another offer (which I hadn’t thanks to her meddling), she then basically told me that I don’t know what research is about and that I should be careful because of my ADHD as every project sounds exiting on paper but gets boring after 2 months. I then clearly said that Im not rejecting her offer due to my (fucking) ADHD but that I want to be passionate about my project and I don’t think this would be the case here and that wouldn’t be fair for the whole project. She dismissed my reasoning completely and just said again: “yeah, yeah but just be careful.” I thanked her for her ‘input’ but told her again my reasoning and ensured her this is not an impulsive decision for me. As I have said, she likes to talk bad behind the back of her employees about them and she is working in a field I’m interested in in general at Uni. So, it could be possible that my future employers know her and will contact her for reference. I know she told my direct supervisor than I'm an example master student and that she is looking for people like me but I’m worried that she will now talk bad behind my back to other professors and say I’m flaky, not dependable, inconsistent etc. (she did that to another master student that had left her lab after a few weeks of being there).

I still have one month of my internship left and I see her every day during lunch. Should I talk with her sooner or later and tell her that I appreciate her wanting to advice me but that I thought it was inappropriate of her to mention my ADHD as my reason of leaving or should I just leave it be? I’m quite mad but I think I should be able to talk with her about this calmly. I’m tempted to do it as soon as possible.

975s58,3,2018-08-14,Catfished by company - Want to quit but I haven't been there a full year yet. Actively in burn out mode.,thisjobisgarbage23,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/975s58/catfished_by_company_want_to_quit_but_i_havent/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

The job interview promised learning opportunities, a solid work life balance, and the managers went on and on about their career training. I was told I'd be doing things that I was already doing at my internships and in previous positions, and I was super excited to start.

Cut to today, almost-ish a year later - Near constant turnover has rendered my position to that of a data entry clerk. In between the mindless data entry work I'm also tasked with handling all collections calls, the majority of technical support calls, and the lions share of check-ins with raging clients. The most stimulating thing I do during my workday requires the same amount of brain power as making a piece of toast.

Aside from the boring work, my workload is too much for somebody earning my wage. I work 55hrs per week (meant to work 40, salary so no OT), and take no actual time off because I can't anymore. I always cover for my supervisors when they take their PTO (which is often) so they can come back to smooth sailing but they don't typically extend the same courtesy so I'll just come back to a mess and a 60hr work week. 

Additionally, I have the most work any single employee has ever had in my position, and I don't know why it isn't a red flag that a single person is doing the job of 2.5 employees (if we're speaking quantitatively I'm handling the volume of 2.5 of my coworkers). I've found efficiencies but it's not enough. 

I have also been thrown under the bus multiple times by a certain manager. Throughout this process I've learned that it literally does not matter who is at fault - management can throw entry level employees under the bus at will with zero consequence. Our chain of command is such that I can't speak for myself either - I need my manager to speak for me, and I hate it. I makes me feel voiceless.

The open culture is a facade, and the backwards employment practices are so blatant it's hard to sit through all the meetings that encourage camaraderie and company pride. Why would I be hyped about working for a business where the cheapest employees are worked to the point of burnout and then cycled through at the end of their 1 year mark? Like why would I be proud to work somewhere where decent (livable) promotions are only given after a person threatens to quit? I've been told multiple times the only way to a decent pay-raise is to go out and get another offer and threaten to leave the company in a lurch.

The last guy that held my position was eventually ""promoted,"" but has also been shat on so many times in the past few months that I don't know why he's still at the company. He was promised a promotion only to make a lateral move (same title) with more work and a minuscule pay bump. Our department is the most dismal place though and it's shocking he made it out at all - other sectors of the company have clearly defined pathways towards higher positions, but our department doesn't have the funds (or areas of growth for that matter) to move people up and out after they've surpassed their current job title so people sit stagnant for years doing the same things over and over again.

I've had to take a second job so that I can 1. afford to live in this city and 2. stay up to date with best practices in this industry because I'm not learning much in my current position (my side hustle job is within this industry, it's just very part time and remote).

I've drowning and I'm not coming off as chipper as I normally do because I can't hide the stress anymore. I'm sure I appear erratic but I'm just so over it. I feel so out of control and disassociated. 

The only reason I'm still here is because I'm trying to get to the 1 year mark so I can tick the box and hopefully position myself better for the future. The clients I work with will also look really good to a mid-sized company with a reasonable client load. I can tough it out 3 more months but I feel like I'm going to walk out of this experience with PTSD or something. How do I recover from this? I feel like I'd be a fumbling mess in an interview right now. I've literally developed social anxiety since I started here. This isn't me. How do I cope with this?

If anybody can relate let me know! I've never experienced this before and I feel like I'm going crazy. All I want to do is walk out of work and I have to talk myself into staying multiple times per week. My other job is such a breeze - this job is just sucking the life out of me.

TLDR: Intense job burn out. Job isn't what I expected, long hours and mind numbing work. Toxic management. Emotionally exhausted and don't know what to do. I want to quit but it hasn't been a year yet. I've also developed social anxiety since being here? Don't know how to cope."

As I continued to walk through this fair I approached a stand of a company refering to themselves as ""An Electronic Engineering company"", their title and all the cool tech displayed at their stand immediately caught my attention and I started talking to the senior electronic engineer that was representing the company. To my surprise when I told him that I study conputer engineering he immediately answered with ""We want people who can actually do electronics"" and ""We have one computer engineer working for us but he struggles"". 

I immediately felt insulted because I have had all the electronic subjects with the electronic and electrical engineering students.

I love electronics and programming is my life, and all of the computer engineers in my digital systems module are out performing the electronic engineers due to our beter understanding of logic and programming, everything that was needed for the devices on display at the stand that the man was sitting at.

Was this man correct in saying electronic engineers are more into electronics or was he just a misinformed and mean?


TLDR: what is the difference between computer engineers and electronic engineers. Where is the line drawn and are electronic engineers superior when it comes down to something like the design of a motherboard or other integrated circuits used in computers?"

What do I have to show for it? One internship of 6 months as a full-stack developer on a team of a dozen people at a fairly large company. How did I get it? My dad talked to someone in another department and they were willing to interview me and I got the position. Unfortunately, they were ""looking for a senior developer"" in the end, so it was all for naught.

Now I'm back to the grindstone, job application after job application, phone interview after phone interview. And it always ends up the same exact way - ""we're looking for someone with **more experience**"" or ""we're only looking for **senior developers**"" or ""we might have positions open for junior/entry level positions at the beginning of the next quarter, send me a message in 6-9 months"".

I live in the Bay Area so I know competition is rough, but I'm focusing on my medical issues as well, so I can't exactly pack up and leave. I feel worthless and like there's no light at the end of this tunnel. I've worked on my own independent projects, I've got a good resume, I've rehearsed when it comes to talking about my experience at my previous internship. So, why is it **so fucking hard**? Every passing day is just another dent in my already-fragile psyche. I feel like at some point I'll lose all motivation and will end up making a rash decision that will cost me my life. And that honestly doesn't sound all that bad right about now."

Yes, I've been lazy past few years. I originally enrolled as a business major back in '14.  Back then, i just thought since my dads got his own business running i might as well make the most of the opportunity and just do the same thing. 

I  got bored however,  (penn state) being a public school had classes that are waayyy too big and it seemed to me like everyone was just there to party and enjoy the college experience.  Me on the other hand, thought college had to be about learning and preparing myself to the big world so then i decided to move to west coast. 

Having attended USC, I was actually surprised by the educational gap and I think being around so many people asians in particular. I spent too much time socializing and doing the same dumb thing a college student would do. Being that always late to class, heavy procrastination, IDGAF attitude etc. during the 1 1/2 years i spent after i transferred, I have a 3.26 gpa with nothing out of the ordinary. I decided that i needed to break this toxic mindset and place that i was in so I joined the military. Yes, I am korean. I have served for nearly 1 1/2 years and next fall I will head back to college. 

I dont know what i want to do in life. I did 3 months of internship in a mediocre marketing firm (product placement, script breakdowns and social media marketing). Although i found it interesting i dont think i want to do marketing. So ive been thinking Finance / consulting seems like a really good place to start exploring. 

I am tryna get my level 1 cfa next june and maybe apply for internship for the summer in seoul. 

So i made a list of things that i may need in order to get into the research/finance related internship placings 

the list goes

Updating CV/resume

TOEIC 990 (to demonstrate english proficiency)

TOEIC speaking level 7\~8 

 Certified Investment Manager  (not a job its a qualification in korean)

MOS (microsoft office proficiency) 

1st grade in business Korean-english Interpretation  

What more should i work for?

977a5w,1,2018-08-14,Stress breakdown/burnout - permanent brain changes?,youknowwhocph88,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/977a5w/stress_breakdownburnout_permanent_brain_changes/,"Hello.

Early this year I had a stress breakdown with depression and suicide thoughts that resulted me being away from work in two months and in the end resulted in me quitting my job. I realised that it wasn't going to get better, because I and my workplace already had tried several things over a course of one year (bi-weekly touch base meetings to alter priorities, down priorities a lot of tasks, I went to a stress coach, we hired interns to take some of the work load etc.). However I had been severely stressed on/off for several years, also at my previous workplace, so this stress breakdown/burnout was long overdue.

Today I'm overall OK. I now work as a self employed consultant (very flexible and not as much work as before, but a bit of a struggle when it comes to finances). But what I'm concerned is if this long term severe stress has altered my brain permanently or at least changed my personality in some way. I don't feel like I'm the same person anymore. If I compare myself to before the severe stress begun I'm much different. I'm easily annoyed, often a bit pessimistic and negative, and I don't think I enjoy life the way I did before. I do enjoy some things, but overall it seems very different. I do feel ""damaged"" and my boyfriend notice the change as well. I know it sounds a lot like depressing, but I don't think I'm clinically depressed as I do enjoy some things (my bf and cat, walking in nature, cooking, studying languages, video games, tv series etc.), but I do have ups and downs quite often and when something bad happens it hits me way harder than it would have a couple of years ago. It doesn't take much for me to begin thinking living is pointless. Not that I get suicidal thoughts again, but it just seems a bit pointless. All in all I'm worried if this change will persist, especially because I don't think I'm a fun person to be around anymore.

Have any of you experienced something similar and did you overcome it? If not, how do you cope with it then?"

However I am dedicating a lot of time into pursing a demanding degree full time (CS). Ive applied to a bunch of internships to not get anything. Truth be told I've had A LOT of trouble in the past balancing both work and school its just too hard for me to do both even when both are part time. Even without work I've barely passed some of those classes and have barely managed a 3.0. It makes me feel like hard STEM majors really aren't for me but I'm too close to finishing to change majors. I also feel like I'm really falling behind without adequete work experience and a very average school performance and also socially as only my needs are taken care of.

9790n1,11,2018-08-14,My Private Blog: Dealing with Anxiety and Making New Friends,I_am_not_a_Cat_meow,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9790n1/my_private_blog_dealing_with_anxiety_and_making/,"We've all been paranoid about something at one point or another, haven’t we?

Like wondering if that security guard following you around the store thinks you're shoplifting.

Or if the people sitting behind you on the train are reading your text messages over your shoulder.

Or if any of your friends actually like you.

I've lived on my own for many years but my anxiety has lived me a lot longer. I finally made the decision to move away from my parents when I was in my early twenties; ready for adventure, a new career and with a head full of naivety. I'd convinced myself that living independently was the sort of milestone that meant my life was falling into place and would show I was capable of making adult decisions. That's how I arrived at a small apartment in the middle of a busy but quaint English town.

At the time I moved out I was in a serious relationship, one that was probably overbearing on my part and became long-distance when he decided to start working on the other side of the world. It only took a week to prove me foolish for ever thinking I could cope on my own and without someone to help me organise my life. The start-up company I was due to work for let me know that they could no longer afford to hire a paid intern, apparently something to do with financial instability.

It was probably the depression that encouraged my boyfriend to give up on me too, apparently something to do with emotional instability.

*I wonder if he has a prettier girlfriend now?*

Naturally, I hid all of this information from my family and played the part of thriving millennial like a professionally trained actress. I didn't want them talking about my failures behind my back, and I certainly didn't want to prove their scepticism of my decisions to have been right all along.

So I used my savings to continue paying rent, bought enough food to fill my fridge and cupboards for the next couple of weeks and I sat at my laptop by the window every day updating my private blog and quietly watching the people passing by as though I was one of them. It's amazing what you can learn about people when you observe their routine and they don't even know you're watching.

I developed a keen interest in watching the shop across the road every few hours, my third floor window giving me an advantageous view of the comings and goings on the street. I would wait for the young blonde cashier to arrive early in the morning, a good half an hour before she opened the store, and watch as she piled the shelves with fresh bread and over-priced cakes which made me salivate with sweet imagination.

There was a jealousy that ached in me as I watched; these people going about their lives were so much more successful than they even knew. Steady jobs, a comfortable income, an organised pattern of movement and routine. I began to flirt with the idea of handing in a job application, questioning whether a chance of normality outweighed another blow of rejection.

*What would my family and friends think if they could see me now?*

It took me another couple of days before I decided to brave the vulnerability of being outside with other people. I walked slowly along the road outside my apartment block, taking careful glances at the shop and waiting for the staff to arrive and unlock the door. I hid my eyes behind a pair of oversized sunglasses and my body beneath a thick black coat, perching myself on a bench about ten yards away. I'd gotten used to anxiety attacks by now but something about the way my heart pulsed and my mind raced told me that there was more to this – an excitement I hadn't felt in a long while.

A few moments later I saw her. The girl with the blonde hair and enviable smile moving towards me, like she was dancing along the pavement to a song I couldn't hear. She stopped to unlock the store doors and took out her earphones when she noticed me approaching her.

""Hey there, you're here bright and early! Anything I can help with?"" she practically sang when she spoke. I couldn't comprehend how anyone could feel this happy before sunrise and suddenly became self-conscious of my appearance and absent gaze.

I stuttered for a few seconds and then spoke as eloquently as I could, ""Hello. I am new around here and would like to apply for a job"".

She gasped and beamed at me, ""Oh that's great, we don't get many people around here besides tourists so it's nice to see another young face"". She looked me up and down and raised an eyebrow, ""are you feeling okay? It's early but it's still definitely not cold enough to wear a coat!"". She touched my shoulder and smiled again, and asked ""Where is it you're living?""

*Why is she being so friendly?*

I pointed to the window of my apartment across the street and flinched as I realised I'd pulled the safety net away from my secret space.

The girl told me that the manager wasn't accepting job applications anymore but that she'd love to show me around the town once she finished work, which I anxiously agreed to. She gave me her mobile number and told me she'd text me if her shift overran. So I went home and waited.

It was early afternoon when a sickness came over me.

It was like a wave of all of my self-doubts and insecurities had bubbled up to the surface of my skin at once. I couldn't face the idea of stepping outside of my apartment again but I longed to see the blonde girl who had unwittingly become an icon of all the qualities I yearned for. I sent her a simple text, ""Hi. Can we meet at my place instead when you're ready. We can leave from here together?""

She replied within a few minutes, ""Sounds great! See U in an hour xo"".

In no time at all there was a knock at the door and I was inviting the blonde girl into my apartment. She looked different now, more beautiful than I thought fair, and with skin that glowed even in the dimness of my flickering apartment light.

*Surely no one can be this perfect?*

She gave me a hug and moved back slightly, spinning as she took in the crowded and dusty appearance of my home. ""Wow, someone seriously needs to unpack and start cleaning"", she laughed and ran her finger through a layer of dust that had congregated on top of a cardboard box. I forced a smile back and explained to her how I'd been so busy since I arrived, which was a lie of course, but still she looked at me warmly and promised to help me unpack next time she had a weekend free.

Suddenly she asked if I was ready to head out.

The idea of leaving my safe space again unnerved me and I started to wobble as another wave of dread crept through my bones. The blonde girl quickly stepped forwards and placed both of her hands on my arms as though to hold me steady and looked me in the eyes, ""Is everything okay?""

I blinked slowly, trying to clean away blurred streams of visions from my eyes, but I was blinded by this feeling brewing inside me. I fixed my eyes back on hers and grabbed her hands,

""You know I think it's best if we stay here now"".

\*\*\*

It was a few days later that I realised my cupboards were empty and my hunger was growling from the insides of my stomach. I had invited the blonde girl to stay at my apartment with me and was just about to ask about her favourite food when through the window I noticed some unusual activity happening within the store.

It was still early but the manager was pacing around the shop. There were police officers writing in small flip books who appeared to be asking him questions. I decided to ask the blonde girl if she knew what was happening down there and what they might be investigating.

I walked over to where she was sitting on the floor of my apartment and spoke softly, ""I'm sorry but I might need to wait until tomorrow to get us some food. The store looks busy at the moment, do you know what's going on?"" She looked distracted and didn't respond when I spoke to her, her eyes pointed towards the door and a gaze that told me she was as hungry as I was.

For the first time I didn't think she looked as beautiful as I originally recalled.

I was much happier having someone around to keep me company and I spent the afternoon with a spring in my step and decided to unpack some of my boxes. The blonde girl looked tired so I told her to rest and tidied around her, making sure to reiterate how pleased I was that was staying.

By the evening I had noticed that she was starting to smell, like an odour which reminded me of rotten fruit, so I encouraged her to take a shower and freshen up. She was too weak to hold up her own arms so I helped to wash her hair and wipe away the make-up that dripped down her face and down her chest.

The blonde girl looked even more ghastly when I dried her off. I didn't want anyone to notice how bad she looked, how her skin looked older and paler, so I brushed her hair, sprayed her with deodorant and applied some blusher to her cheeks to make her feel better.

Unfortunately not even the showers or sprays of perfumes could disguise how foul she smelled. How ugly she looked.

I decided to make her a bed underneath the floorboards of my clothes closet, using a thick rug to hold the panels down and to block some of the smell. Of course I would still speak to her every now and again, asking her if she was comfortable or if she needed anything, but she gradually became more quiet and I was left with no choice but to try and forget about her all together.

\*\*\*

It’s been a week or so since I last thought about the blonde girl sleeping under my closet.

I realise now that it's been about the same amount of time since I last ate anything. I had caught a glimpse of my reflection in the window earlier and have to admit I was taken aback. I have lost a substantial amount of weight since I first arrived in this town, my clothes hang more loosely each day and my face is much slimmer than I once recognised it.

I forced myself to look beyond my reflection in the window and forwards towards the view I enjoy the most: the street below me and its inhabitants.

But it's a funny thing isn't it, when you notice something for the first time? Right above the store I realised that someone new was occupying a flat that had been for sale since I'd arrived. An adult, slightly older than me, sat at a computer by the window typing, absorbed in their world and completely oblivious to my eyes.

I wonder what they sound like, what they would think of me, if we could be friends. I have decided that I should introduce myself to them, but first I needed to carry on observing. I need to study them and watch them when they think that no one else is watching.

It's actually quite easy when you know how.

I'm a student in the 11th grade (the penultimate year before graduating) at a top-ranked high-school in Romania and I'm very passionate about Computer Science. In fact, I'm passionate about everything that involves technology, computers etc. and that's why I've chosen Mathematics and Computer Science academic program. It provides more classes of Math and Computer programming. I'm doing very well in high-school.

So, I want to build a successful career in Computer Science. I'm glad I found my passion, but I want to be more specific. I want to decide on what to specialize in. I want to get a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science / Computer Engineering, but I want to decide on what subfield to focus on. I've got a lot of time for thinking, because I will probably get my first internship / part-time / full-time job during university.

I have some programming knowledge (statements, loops, arrays, vectors, matrices, functions, classes, pointers), but I'm not sure if I want to become a software developer. However, I know programming is not the only field of Computer Science. I want to build a career in some field which is future-proof. I've heard a lot of great things about Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI and it seems like this is the future.

Also, I want to mention that I'm not afraid of difficulties. It's never too hard to achieve a goal if you fight for it. Sure, it may take some time, but in the end you can successfully achieve your goal. I'm very determined, motivated and disciplined. These are the three very (most) important weapons, aren't they?

I know any decision made now won't really affect negatively my future career, because we (as humans) always change our minds and plans during our life, but I want to have a good perspective of my future.

Regarding ML, DL and AI, I don't know if I can self-study these now. I've heard (and read) it's early to get into these fields during high-school. However, I'm feeling prepared. I love challenges. I'm not afraid of the hard way of doing things if that's the best solution of achieving some goals. 

I'm open to any suggestions, advice and so on. Thank you in advance for spending time reading this post and writing your insights!

I will be a senior in two weeks, pursuing a BA in CS. I will be taking a course in algorithims and linear algebra, but I cannot have a senior project. I never had the sort of college experience other CS majors had because whenever I had a hard class, I would make my schedule around it easier. My first semester sophomore year, my grade suffered when I took two programming courses with calc 2. I tried to overload my second semester sophomore year, and that went disastorously. So my junior year, I took Operating Systems with statistics and a few easy classes, and my second semester I took databases, network security, and two easy courses. So although I would put a lot of time into classes like Operating Systems or System Architecture, I could afford to. I also did not have that rigorous a background in math. I've had two internships, but the first I took the backseat and did work my partner, who sort of masterminded the project, assigned me. My 2nd one I just blew entirely - I became lazy after not being assigned work and being caught in a stupid cycle of a lack of sleep. I would like to think the 2nd internship went badly due to behaviors I can work on and fix, but is the way I got through college-making sure I surrounded hard CS courses with easier courses so I could devote time to the hard ones-one that makes me a poor programmer? Is it a sign that I am not cut out for this kind of field if I gave myself more time for programming classes and to understand theory? I need time for both, but I enjoy writing programs that take info as input and do things with it more than learning about np completeness and other theoretical subjects. I am good at memorizing information and spending hours coding (although maybe I rely too much on brute force), but terrible at math, proofs, and logical reasoning"

I have tried calling both companies and pretending to work at a hotel to learn more about how things work but I haven't gotten an answer.  

Basically, I have a few questions:

\- They mainly generate revenue through a service fee that gets tacked onto the shipping fee for the customer.  Usually \~$2 per item.  Does it seem as though they price things based off of how willing the customer is to get back that item?  I.e there might be incentive to charge more for a nice pair of sunglasses than a pair of flip flops.  What would be a good pricing model for this if it were to work?

\- Shipping partner - USPS, FedEx or UPS, how is a partnership like this structured?

\- PCI Compliance - Both use at least PCI compliant vendors .  Does this mean the hotel is liable?  The company that makes the software is liable or just the vendor?  Is there any way to avoid PCI compliance?

I'm 20 years old, recently finished my 2nd year in university. I live in (Eastern Europe), and I found myself a paid 6-month internship, with the promise of continuing on in the company immediately afterwards as a Junior Developer. The company primarily deals with outsourcing, and I ( along with 7 other interns ) are learning how to work with the Spring Framework, and a bunch of other frameworks/libraries to go along with it. We work with Java, though that much ought to be obvious by now.

Anyway, as interns, our mentor split us up into 2 teams of 4 people, where each of us had 3 weeks to develop from scratch using Spring a web application. Some requirements were made up, something akin to user stories, and so we got to work and at the end of the 3 weeks each team delivered what was a very basic version of the software required from us.

After this, our mentor told us that nobody in the company is really clammering to get their hands on an intern to help out on their project, so there really is nothing for us to do right now but to keep working on our projects, improving them bit by bit. They've started giving us tasks to implement specific technologies into our projects to accomplish some arbitrary functionality. Really, it's more of a learning thing than anything.

\*\*Here's the thing\*\*. I don't know if they do this intentionally, but the time frames they give us to implement some of this stuff is ridiculously long. For example, our team had a task to create an archival system using MongoDB, where older entries in the database would be purged and instead stored in Mongo. They gave us a week to do this. We managed to do it in a day, and it worked too. Architecturally, it made sense, it wasn't just thrown on there.

So, for the rest of the week, we just got on and did the task we were suppose to be given the week after that. And we managed to get that done as well. And now, both teams were given the task of connecting with eachother's applications via JMS. We were given 2 weeks to accomplish this task, and by all accounts, it looks like we're going to get it done by the end of this week.

Can someone explain to me if this is intentional? If so, why are our mentors giving us ridiculously long time frames for something which can be accomplished in a shorter time?

I've considered asking my mentor if it would be alright to be included in some sort of internal company project or something of the sort, to keep myself busier. Would this be an acceptable thing to do? Should I bring this up?"

I will be a senior in two weeks, pursuing a BA in CS. I will be taking a course in algorithims and linear algebra, but I cannot have a senior project. I never had the sort of college experience other CS majors had because whenever I had a hard class, I would make my schedule around it easier. My first semester sophomore year, my grade suffered when I took two programming courses with calc 2. I tried to overload my second semester sophomore year, and that went disastorously. So my junior year, I took Operating Systems with statistics and a few easy classes, and my second semester I took databases, network security, and two easy courses. So although I would put a lot of time into classes like Operating Systems or System Architecture, I could afford to. I also did not have that rigorous a background in math. I've had two internships, but the first I took the backseat and did work my partner, who sort of masterminded the project, assigned me. My 2nd one I just blew entirely - I became lazy after not being assigned work and being caught in a stupid cycle of a lack of sleep. I would like to think the 2nd internship went badly due to behaviors I can work on and fix, but is the way I got through college-making sure I surrounded hard CS courses with easier courses so I could devote time to the hard ones-one that makes me a poor programmer? Is it a sign that I am not cut out for this kind of field if I gave myself more time for programming classes and to understand theory? I need time for both, but I enjoy writing programs that take info as input and do things with it more than learning about np completeness and other theoretical subjects. I am good at memorizing information and spending hours coding (although maybe I rely too much on brute force), but terrible at math, proofs, and logical reasoning"

My coworkers used to be on my team until management reassigned her.

Both me and my manager agreed it was the best thing to do, for everyone. My coworker had gotten to a point where, in meetings with my manager, she would try to lie about how complex a feature was and say “I’m not capable of doing it!”. When I showed her the way to do those “impossible tasks”, she would complain I was an “asshole who always needs to get his way”. Not once was she worried about the quality of the product.

She went straight to my manager a few times saying I wasn’t fit for the job of team leader and she didn’t want me telling her stuff about performance or skills, but she expected the manager to do so...

Anyway, she got out. However, yesterday I had a disagreement with a team member, nothing too serious. This person shared the issue with my ex team member, and she immediately passed it on to my manager saying something along the lines of “see? He always needs to get his way... who is he to treat us like we are interns? He isn’t the boss...”

She did this on a group chat where a close friend of mine saw everything.

This person had gone directly to my manager when she was on my team to try to get me to do things her way or get me demoted. Now she’s out, and she still goes to my manager to say negative things about me.

This is deliberate. How can I protect myself? I’m inclined to proceed as if nothing happened, but why do I have to tolerate this from a coworker?"

What I did: 

I created a program in Microsoft visual studio that daily calls to the slack web api using zappyssys  to return a list of conversations, users, etc.(where the first bullet comes from). From there I wrote C# programs that converted unix epox times to EST and added missing columns of data to the return of the slack api. Then, I created a producer, consumer, and neutral data model in qlik sense; so that I had all of the desired functionality when creating analytics(where the second bullet comes from). Finally I built analytics though the usage of graphs in qlik sense that displayed and diagnosed the data (the 3rd bullet). 

Why I don't like this:

I feel like it reads like a list and is far too in depth, along with awkward phrasing and the potential to sound like I have no idea what I am talking about. 

Potential Changes:

1. I could turn bullet one and two into one bullet point so it would read like this:
designed and build an automated data gathering program from which I cleaned the data and created a functional model
1. If there is a well know high level process that includes the data gathering, cleaning, and data model creating step I could just include all of these bullets in that process
1. Change the phrasing to make it sound more professional 
1. Leave it alone because I am over thinking everything

Thanks to those of you who have made it this far, it means a lot to have people out there who want you to succeed. Once again if you guys have any questions for me I would be happy to help.

97bsvz,2,2018-08-14,Graduating college this year - which certification?,TalkingCrayon,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/97bsvz/graduating_college_this_year_which_certification/,"Greetings all. I am graduating at the end of this year with a degree in Network and Computer Security. I only have one short internship under my belt (did it for 1 month over winter break one year), so I figured that I need a little more experience to qualify for entry level jobs. I figured that a certification would be a good route to take. 

My question is, which certification do you guys think is best for an entry level job? There are so many out there. I am interested in the network infrastructure side of things and also (obviously) security. But, I understand that one doesn't simply get an entry level job in computer security, rather, it is a job that someone advances to after years of related IT work.Comptia A+ seems like a waste to me because of how basic and easy it is. I would think that my degree would speak louder than this cert. I was considering Network+ based on my interest in the IT field. Any suggestions?

Also, do you think that having a 4 year degree, a 1 month long internship, and a certification will be enough to be hired to an entry level job? What else could I be doing to impress employers? I'm not really super passionate about tech so I don't want to create my own projects, I just want to get a job and pay the bills.

Thanks for the help."

I'm currently about to start my last semester at my university and I will be graduating with a bachelor's in computer science. After taking some security courses, I've decided I want to persue security as a career path. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get an internship this summer due to being in three summer school classes and I feel like this is going come back and bite me. 

Now here's my dilemma. I've read a lot online and here about the importance of certifications however I don't know if that's how I should tackle this. I've purchased a book by Darril Gibson to study for CompTIA's Security+ 501 exam however when I google jr level security analyst, they often require at least a year of working at a help desk or something of the sort. I've also read that a lot of the time, companies will pay for you to take this certification, which sounds amazing.  


So for an individual like myself who hasn't had an internship, has zero certifications, but is determined to do whatever it takes to succeed, how should I start? I want to eventually be a part of a blue team but don't know if I'll be eligible to even apply for these positions after I graduate. Most of these ""junior"" level positions require certifications on top of professional workplace experience, at least that's what I see from googling around Chicago. I've already finished the certification preparation book which helped solidified many of the concepts I've learned in the classroom. Should I be applying as a jr security analyst or just try to find a helpdesk job and make that transition? I just don't want to waste time working for a help desk job if I can get a job in my desired field. Lastly, I don't know if this matters much but my GPA &gt; 3.6 ATM.

Any advice is super appreciated! Thank you all. "
97c8be,1,2018-08-14,We're Gonna Need a Bigger Boat (Intern Questions),MyUshanka,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/97c8be/were_gonna_need_a_bigger_boat_intern_questions/,"Okay so this is kind of an extended conundrum that probably has an easy answer, but I'm naught but an intern, green as grass.

My mother is management at a local small business, about 35-40 employees or so. She currently has no IT staff. Everything was set up by an independent contractor who is in over his head and is, at best, difficult to reach. So that means I get called in after my current job/internship to do work for her. Usually setting up new computers or fixing issues with the existing ones, as well as being consulted on hardware purchases and developing small VBA macros for the boys on the shop floor. Generally speaking I'm good about saying when something is over my head.

She is aware of the need for dedicated IT staff but doesn't have the budget for it apparently? Meanwhile there are talks to expand to another city a few hours away for a satellite location that would likely also need computers/IT-related equipment.

My issue is this: I don't think I know enough and I don't have the time to start from scratch. However, there's a lot with their current setup that needs work.

* The server is a T310 running Server 2012. It is the domain controller and main file server. This was set up long ago and basically left to run.

* No users have accounts connected to the domain. Instead, they all have local accounts and log into the server using one of a few generic accounts.

* Password practices are terrifying. Reuse is rampant, with many of the computers still using the temporary passwords I set them up with. When passwords aren't being reused, they're stuck to the monitor. One employee has all of his personal passwords in a Word doc on his work desktop. He keeps this computer unlocked.

* The domain is actually unreachable for new computers. It's been awhile since I've tried, but there was some network error that would have required I basically scrap the whole thing and start over. The contracted IT set up the mesh with Unifi routers but I don't know the passwords to them. I'm not sure he does either. This is why they use local accounts.

I'm sure there's more if I think hard but you get the gist. There's a lot of cleaning up to do and I don't think I'm anywhere near qualified, even if I had the time, to work on it. Every time I'm called in to help, I do but I mention that they need to get an administrator of some sort in ASAP. She agrees, but kicks the can down the road a ways.

Any thoughts on what I should do? On one hand -- not my circus, not my clowns. On the other -- I really don't feel right leaving their computers and network in as sorry shape as they are

I was 18 when I first fell in love with my sweet heart (let's call her V) when I was a freshman at my University. Sure I had my crushes and feelings of attraction to some girls earlier then that but V was my actual first love. We first met as friends and it took us 7 months for us to actually start dating. In those seven months we exchanged memories and details of each other's lives from past to present. We both being part of an Ivy league University of your nation , it was not hard for us to cherish discussions which required science , logic , astronomy , what not! Our frequencies were resonating on intellectual level. We both got attracted to each other soon and we started dating.

In the initial 2 years we were spending 5-6 hours every day alone time. This time included good amount of talk, spending time with each other and physical intimacy. We both were so happy with each other and it looked like nothing could stop us. But in end of my second year of University I started to spend a little time with my boys in the dorm a little more and was eventually introduced to a PC game which is a MoBA known to be highly addictive. My 5-6 hours with her every day turned into 30-40 minutes soon. I would not pick up her phone, I would lie to her at 20:00 hours telling that I'm sleeping and cannot spend time with her but go on to play my MoBA till 03:00 the next day. 

Down to the final year of my University I would spend probably 15 minutes with her and say her to go away back to her dorm (both are dorms need to walked quite a bit to reach one another). I knew that she missed my company. I did not spend time with her, talking to her , making her feel good and spending physical time with her. I knew it all but the addiction had taken over me. She tried her ways to spend time with me trying to learn my MoBA and even trying to spend time when ever possible.

I was sincerely and honestly in love with V and she was madly in love with me. We even were sure to have a bright life together with a happy, stable family. We both knew it and we had spoke about it. I may have been addicted but only I knew how much I loved her.

Soon we arrived to the final semester of my under-grad program, it was time to go to Internships. On the last day on the pen-ultimate semester we sat down and spoke about the issues we faced. I have never cheated on her and neither did she. We knew how much pure our love was to each other and how much we meant to each other. But that night last night we mutually knew our road was bumpy in recent past. That night I said to her that we were not going to be with each other anymore and I did not see ourselves together in future so we took a break for a while.

During our internships working at good firms we got good exposure and were occupied with work. It is now when I realized that when working professionally, I did not face any sort of video game addiction. That was great news for me. I went on to have a great internship, so did V (at a different firm).

Let me remind you how sincere and pure our love for each other was in former years. But during my Intern days I earned laurals at my work. At the same time she started talking about a guy she met recently at her internship. Soon they were dating. Initially for a few weeks I was cool with it because I knew we were on a break and anyways I did not provide her time earlier. Now time had come for my internship to end and slowly I got used to professional routine. Now I started the need and feel to have a person/human in my life , a companion. But I knew what was happening on her side, though she was only having flings and hookups.

Now I smiled at my past with her and started to look ahead towards my life. I met few amazing women soon. They were really good people , some smart, some attractive, what not! I dated, been in short term relationships, tried to make some long term relationships, hooked up. But the only reason I did that was because I was never happy. I was never satisfied. I didn't feel love. I know what love feels like, that was not being felt now.

I stopped dating in all forms with women because of what I was feeling. I started to feel lonely and soon fell into depression. Every day I begged for the love, which I once felt somewhere to be found. I started to die from within. I was teethotaler all my life till this point. Strong depression and loneliness hit me and I started to drink, smoke and did few drugs. Im the same guy who once promoted being sober and found intellectual/social achievements to be cool, now doing all the bad habits mentioned above.

There is not a single day now where I don't get flashes of memories of me and V together and all our moments. This only made my depression worse. To overcome this I removed her from all my social media to lessen the thoughts of her. It did help a little.

I am mildly depressed these days and am still well away from seeing any other woman. I think would not get love I wanted any time soon. I am fine with it. Last Sunday was our last day in University after being back from the internship and it was the convocation. I saw her first time again after 8 long months. I am sure she is happy and really satisfied with her life. I was totally happy to see her being happy. She had the natural glow of good life back on her now.

Last 5 minutes in the University when everyone were leaving I was  happy that we literally crossed roads once. My depression got a little less when I said Hi and she responded with a Hi and she had the happy look. I wanted wanted to ask how are you and she said bye a second later and swiftly walked away. This event, this trivial event. I do not know if she meant to be rude/ was in a hurry to leave back or just in a high energy of just being graduated. This event which is so small has been the reason I am writing today.

Post that event memory flashes of me and V flooded my brain like never even before in last 1 and half years. I started questioning myself. I knew this path. I know was going to get fucked by depression again, this time the flood was too intense and let me tell you, I cried like never before within minutes. I can assure for that in my 22 years of being alive I had never cried like yesterday. I am afraid what I'll think or do to myself if this continues. I am starting to feel mild chest pain and headache.

I know I did not spend time with her when it mattered. I know we mutually broke up. I tried to find my love again. All the past has happened and all I can control is my future.

This depression seems to not reduce at all. I am having all kinds of nasty and harmful thoughts all again now but with a greater force. I have taken 3 hours to write my story just because my body was shivering uncontrollably all this time. Today is her birthday. It made me come out and take a step to seek advice even though I never did. I am depressed to that extent.

Please , if you know how I can snap out of this, have a simple Happy and successful life kindly help me out. I just want to live and let live.  I know she's happy with whomever and where ever she is. I have no issues. But please I just want forget, I just don't want  these memories. I just want to live again, I just want to love again. Thanks you for reading.

It was not easy, I have worked my ass off and networked until I was blue in the face, but I MADE IT.

You can make it too. I remember seeing posts on this very sub similar to this one and remembering the hope and reassurance they gave me. I am here to tell you, it will all work out. Put in the work and you will be rewarded."

I'm about to start an internship during the Fall 2018 term (so that would be this September), and plan on starting to apply to some Summer 2019 internships. I noticed that some companies have already started posting listings, and I was wondering if it would be worth waiting until I start my internship so I can list it on my resume (and hopefully do at least one thing worth noting on my resume) and apply then, or to start applying now without my upcoming internship on my resume.

Thanks!"

97fea1,2,2018-08-15,My story. My mental health hit rock bottom recently. Advice appropriated. (Long),real_kig,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/97fea1/my_story_my_mental_health_hit_rock_bottom/,"Hello ,

I was 18 when I first fell in love with my sweet heart (let's call her V) when I was a freshman at my University. Sure I had my crushes and feelings of attraction to some girls earlier then that but V was my actual first love. We first met as friends and it took us 7 months for us to actually start dating. In those seven months we exchanged memories and details of each other's lives from past to present. We both being part of an Ivy league University of your nation , it was not hard for us to cherish discussions which required science , logic , astronomy , what not! Our frequencies were resonating on intellectual level. We both got attracted to each other soon and we started dating.

In the initial 2 years we were spending 5-6 hours every day alone time. This time included good amount of talk, spending time with each other and physical intimacy. We both were so happy with each other and it looked like nothing could stop us. But in end of my second year of University I started to spend a little time with my boys in the dorm a little more and was eventually introduced to a PC game which is a MoBA known to be highly addictive. My 5-6 hours with her every day turned into 30-40 minutes soon. I would not pick up her phone, I would lie to her at 20:00 hours telling that I'm sleeping and cannot spend time with her but go on to play my MoBA till 03:00 the next day. 

Down to the final year of my University I would spend probably 15 minutes with her and say her to go away back to her dorm (both are dorms need to walked quite a bit to reach one another). I knew that she missed my company. I did not spend time with her, talking to her , making her feel good and spending physical time with her. I knew it all but the addiction had taken over me. She tried her ways to spend time with me trying to learn my MoBA and even trying to spend time when ever possible.

I was sincerely and honestly in love with V and she was madly in love with me. We even were sure to have a bright life together with a happy, stable family. We both knew it and we had spoke about it. I may have been addicted but only I knew how much I loved her.

Soon we arrived to the final semester of my under-grad program, it was time to go to Internships. On the last day on the pen-ultimate semester we sat down and spoke about the issues we faced. I have never cheated on her and neither did she. We knew how much pure our love was to each other and how much we meant to each other. But that night last night we mutually knew our road was bumpy in recent past. That night I said to her that we were not going to be with each other anymore and I did not see ourselves together in future so we took a break for a while.

During our internships working at good firms we got good exposure and were occupied with work. It is now when I realized that when working professionally, I did not face any sort of video game addiction. That was great news for me. I went on to have a great internship, so did V (at a different firm).

Let me remind you how sincere and pure our love for each other was in former years. But during my Intern days I earned laurals at my work. At the same time she started talking about a guy she met recently at her internship. Soon they were dating. Initially for a few weeks I was cool with it because I knew we were on a break and anyways I did not provide her time earlier. Now time had come for my internship to end and slowly I got used to professional routine. Now I started the need and feel to have a person/human in my life , a companion. But I knew what was happening on her side, though she was only having flings and hookups.

Now I smiled at my past with her and started to look ahead towards my life. I met few amazing women soon. They were really good people , some smart, some attractive, what not! I dated, been in short term relationships, tried to make some long term relationships, hooked up. But the only reason I did that was because I was never happy. I was never satisfied. I didn't feel love. I know what love feels like, that was not being felt now.

I stopped dating in all forms with women because of what I was feeling. I started to feel lonely and soon fell into depression. Every day I begged for the love, which I once felt somewhere to be found. I started to die from within. I was teethotaler all my life till this point. Strong depression and loneliness hit me and I started to drink, smoke and did few drugs. Im the same guy who once promoted being sober and found intellectual/social achievements to be cool, now doing all the bad habits mentioned above.

There is not a single day now where I don't get flashes of memories of me and V together and all our moments. This only made my depression worse. To overcome this I removed her from all my social media to lessen the thoughts of her. It did help a little.

I am mildly depressed these days and am still well away from seeing any other woman. I think would not get love I wanted any time soon. I am fine with it. Last Sunday was our last day in University after being back from the internship and it was the convocation. I saw her first time again after 8 long months. I am sure she is happy and really satisfied with her life. I was totally happy to see her being happy. She had the natural glow of good life back on her now.

Last 5 minutes in the University when everyone were leaving I was  happy that we literally crossed roads once. My depression got a little less when I said Hi and she responded with a Hi and she had the happy look. I wanted wanted to ask how are you and she said bye a second later and swiftly walked away. This event, this trivial event. I do not know if she meant to be rude/ was in a hurry to leave back or just in a high energy of just being graduated. This event which is so small has been the reason I am writing today.

Post that event memory flashes of me and V flooded my brain like never even before in last 1 and half years. I started questioning myself. I knew this path. I know was going to get fucked by depression again, this time the flood was too intense and let me tell you, I cried like never before within minutes. I can assure for that in my 22 years of being alive I had never cried like yesterday. I am afraid what I'll think or do to myself if this continues. I am starting to feel mild chest pain and headache.

I know I did not spend time with her when it mattered. I know we mutually broke up. I tried to find my love again. All the past has happened and all I can control is my future.

This depression seems to not reduce at all. I am having all kinds of nasty and harmful thoughts all again now but with a greater force. I have taken 3 hours to write my story just because my body was shivering uncontrollably all this time. Today is her birthday. It made me come out and take a step to seek advice even though I never did. I am depressed to that extent.

Please , if you know how I can snap out of this, have a simple Happy and successful life kindly help me out. I just want to live and let live.  I know she's happy with whomever and where ever she is. I have no issues. But please I just want forget, I just don't want  these memories. I just want to live again, I just want to love again. Thanks you for reading.

I had just transferred from A CC, which I spent 2 years at. I switched my major my first semester and had to repeat some Math classes as I hadnt studied seriously enough at that time. I just found out from the university im attending that it will take 3 years to graduate, and in addition I am starting back at intro to programming, until I test out of it. (they didnt transfer my programming courses) 

I dont feel like thatll be too much of a problem, but I feel unsure of what to do. My goal was to start applying for 2019 internships and be prepared in what I need to know. However, since I have to wait till spring to even start data structures for my programming class (If I test into Programming 3/OOP). 


Do you think its best to not apply to any internships until you get those classes knocked out, even if you do self study and are prepared for it?;

Thanks for any help."

I am trying to get into a graduate program for Fall 2019 in  a field that is totally different from what I studied and I was hoping I could get some help.

A little about me. I am an international student and have been in the USA for over 10 years. I got my bachelor's in Finance with a fairly low GPA of 2.7 Cumulative. Unable to find a job and in an effort to save my status I joined a masters program (again Finance) at another State School and started learning  some programming on my own. Got an internship during my stay there which was semi relevant. After graduation with a mere 3.0 I applied for numerous jobs and got an entry level job. Got a few promotions in the 2 years I stayed there and finally managed to get into a Fortune 500 company where I am in cyber security and programming full time. Now my work visa is expiring and I am having to go back to school to maintain my status. 

This time however, I want to study something that is more aligned with what I do on a day to day basis. The most embarrassing thing for me is that, after  getting a bachelors and masters in Finance I have realized that I am not capable of doing much in the field and therefore want to change my subject. I also have a fairly low GPA which was a result of a combination of having to support myself, laziness, and a lack of interest. 

For the first time I want to study something that I am really interested in because of the work experience I am much more confident about what I want to do moving forward and what I want to get from the program.

My main problem is, how do I explain my low GPA and my sudden departure from my main domain which is finance. I am going to take the GRE pretty soon and hope to be around the 70th percentile.

Also, I have managed to overcome the speaking problem by mimicking native speakers and watching a lot of movies and listening to songs but my writing sucks . Any tips to improve that would be most appreciated.

TLDR: Studied Finance, Low GPA, Got to work a little bit, Wanting to go back to school, But dk how to start."

I was a nursing major but before starting my first semester I thought I might want to switch to CS. During my first semester of nursing school I took a python class and decided to make the switch because I never realized my love for technology could actually be a career path. 

Now I’m in a position that I have almost every pre req completed so I’ll be graduating in 5 semesters. But I understand most CS students don’t have the bet luck in finding first year internships. As I would have to apply soon for next year with no classes. 

Would it maybe be best to find research opportunities with my professors vs an internship? Or maybe try to apply late and squeeze into a small internship? I just didn’t think I’d have any luck in the  2019 summer finding one without any real CS semesters under my belt yet.

A quick background, I am currently entering my second year of graduate school studying electrical engineering. The company where I currently intern has extended an offer for full-time employment after the completion of my degree in the spring of 2019.

After doing some research about their offer, and how it stands versus other companies and my estimated ""worth"", I feel that I am being paid a bit lower than average. Am I in a position to negotiate a slight bump in the yearly salary ($1.05 extra per hour)?

Besides the research for estimated ""worth"", I also did a pros and cons list of the situation. On the positive side, the career is in something I am passionate about (cyber security), the pay is competitive, and I really like the person I would working for and the division within the company. For negatives, besides the lower payment, my main takeaway is that coming out of college is one of the few times where a person can really choose their career path and be selfish. As a primary example, I have spent my entire life in the state where I work, including college, but wasn't necessarily thrilled with staying here for work as well. One thing I was looking forward to when hunting for careers was to try and travel away for at least a few years.

While debating the pros and cons, I am still in a state of confusion as to what would be the best plan of action going forward. Ultimately it is up to me to decide, but would greatly appreciate input from others who have been in my shoes before. Please feel free to PM me if you are willing, or just comment what your thoughts are. Thank you so much."

I'll jump straight to the breakup points. 

This bitch got hungry for some ""fun experiences"" and basically pressured me into an open relationship. I was stupid enough to say yes and even say that I won't be considering it an open relationship. Shit lasted 6 months like that and she never played around with anyone. 

Drove across 5 states to visit her during an internship and **while I was treating her out to a $70 per person meal** she fucking casually brings up the fact that she ***just fucking had a hookup with some random dude last night***. I instantly wrote her off in my brain but I needed a place to stay for the 5 remaining days I would be there. I didn't feel sad, just pissed off, disrespected. She wasn't anywhere close to a good girlfriend and I definitely wasn't questioning that anymore. 

Fucking big mistake. Saw a condom filled with fucking cum on the floor near her trashcan, apparently the dude threw it out in the wrong area. Yeah way to rub it in. Usually I'd cry from that but I pretty much wrote her off already, completely ready to break up and never speak to the bitch again. 

Over the next couple weeks I started going on some Tinder dates (was completely honest about it) and she continued to beg for me back. She had her mom call me and tell me how she was crying at work and shit. I finally agreed to a skype call and she was just sitting there tits out trying to get me to be turned on or something. This is a civilized girl making $30 an hour as a college junior, trying to pull this crazy shit. 

Hung up, blocked her on everything. 2 years later, have a much better girlfriend (issues of her own so still deciding on whether to stay together) but at least she respects me. 

I have no sadness coming from that last relationship - every time I think about it, it's not pain. It's just fucking disrespect. Who the fuck does that shit? Legitimate hatred there. Hope this bitch burns in hell. She still tries to contact me every few months through fake emails and shit. Not going for that bait. She will never see me again. And if she does she will get the full ignore treatment."

I am a middle eastern male looking for schools which offer generous financial aid for internationals. I can pay $20k - $30k a year or if the whole cost of attendance does not exceed $50k, I may be able to pay it all (per my parents). 

**Major:** Electrical Engineering

**SAT:** 1250 (650M/600R). Yes, this is not good at all, however, I am retaking in October and I'm consistently scoring 1450+ in my practice tests. 

**SAT II:**  Math Level II, Physics. Taking in November, scoring 750+ in Barron's for both.

**Courses:** I am currently doing the full IB diploma and we have no received any solid predicted grades yet because we have only finished first year. So far I probably have 35 - 37 points because I have scored some 7s, 6s, and mostly 5s in my finals. My classes are: Mathematics HL, Physics HL, Chemistry HL, Economics HL, English A SL, and Arabic B SL. I consider this a very rigorous load especially for IB. I have not taken any AP classes, but taken 2 honors classes before IB.

**Rank:** Based on my grades and class load I would say top 15-20% of my IB class, though it is not a competitive class I must say. My school also doesn't show/record rank.

**Activities:** 

1) 6 Week long Software Engineering internship for a small company. I was involved in actual development and I believe it will make good material for more technical college essays.

2) International Particle Physics competition - part of it for 3 years. It's basically an international competition with CERN where teams write experiment proposals. I am the head scientific writer and we placed top 20 and top 30 in recent years.

3) Varsity/Junior Varsity Basketball. Even though I will not be applying for any college athletics or anything like that, I think this activity is relevant because I did it for 3 years. Consistently placed top 2 in regional tournament for the last couple of years.

4) Senior mentorship team - part of a team which mentors younger students in academia.

5) Model United Nations - won a committee internationally.

6) Educational &amp; projects website - personal website run by me which includes lots of educational content and personal open-source projects of mine. It includes projects which I have spent large amounts of time on and they may impress certain people.

7) Building an internet-based company in its early stages. I don't think it will be big enough to really boost my application by the time I apply.

**Awards/Honors:** 

  \- 2 Academic Achievement awards in 11th grade

 \- Award for a core subject in IB

**Schools:** Here is what I'm going to apply to so far, I ask you to recommend more schools to me because these seem too high reach.

EA: MIT.

RD: Purdue, Stanford, Rose-Hulman, Worcester Polytechnic, Drexel, Vanderbilt, Johns Hopkins, Dartmouth, Princeton.

Canadian Universities: University of Toronto, UWaterloo, McMaster, Queens, McGill, and UBC.

**LORs:** I have two solid letters already, and I can probably get two more and decide which ones to send.

**Essays:** I believe I have the capacity to write exceptional essays in terms of tying personality traits and achievements with what that certain school offers if that makes any sense.

Final note: I am aware that most of these colleges are high reaches and that, for now, my test scores are subpar. However, I truly believe I have that final push which will allow me to score a good SAT, SAT II, and a great IB predicted. I am also writing most of my internal assessments and extended essay on very advanced topics which may provide something to talk about in the essays or wherever. Thank you and please recommend more schools for me."

Where do I buy a top of the line computer?""",Gezeni,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/97ijtc/the_owner_of_my_company_im_tired_of_this_slow/,"TL;DR: No budget workstation built from consumer parts. Build and photos at bottom.

Back story: I work at a family owned engineering company. One of the siblings that owns it stopped doing design work some years ago because he got tired of his computer being all slow and unresponsive (It's a good machine. Solid Xeon, SSD, Nvidia Quadro K4000. Just needed reformatting and a *decade* of dust removed.). [This](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNTUyODU4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTU2NTgwMw@@._V1_SY1000_CR0,0,1521,1000_AL_.jpg) is kinda what he pictured himself as in his situation.

I'm a mechanical engineer/designer, and an electical engineer. I do software development for in-house CAD tools on top of my design work. He came to me for help with his machine. And it went something like this.

Supervisor: ""I'm tired of this slow piece of crap. Where do I buy a top of the line work computer? Like a Dell or an Alienware?""

Me, citing a post I saw on /r/BuildAPc that week: ""A $2300 alienware has $900 in assembly and branding fees.""

Super: ""So, like, where do I buy? What should I buy? What's top right now?"" 

Me: ""I wouldn't buy, I'd build. GPU prices coming down. And the amount for what your asking for would just go farther building yourself.""

Supervisor: ""Ok. Plan something and get me a shopping list.""

Me: ""What kind of budget?""

Supervisor: ""Oh, I don't know. $4000? $5000? What do you need? Just be able to justify it.""

Oh. Damn. We mostly work in SolidWorks. So I started there and double checked what all kind of stuff is important to running SolidWorks at its peak. It's a single core process, and just really loves that clock speed. As much as you can give. He only requested I stick to Intel and Nvidia, and at least 8 years relevance. ""Spare no Expense"" kind of situation. He wanted whatever I thought was best for the work we do. Here were my top concerns.

* i7-8086K because it was the best OC on the market this summer.

* AIO watercooling, 360mm radiator. Cause we gon' OC this bitch, and I'm not going to be responsible for daily wear and care, so no custom solution.

* Mobo with plenty of fine tuning options for the overclock.

* I asked him about storage. He insisted 2 TB. Dear God, what am I doing.

* I saw his current machine had a Blu-ray player. So, I can't have a build without one. God forbid, functionality be lost in an upgrade.

I made a build. I defended it to him. He responded by giving me the company credit. I really thought it was more a joke or a fleeting fancy. I'm actually building this? I had to tweak my build for availability of parts. I forgot that part during my process. I ended up with the following build:

I'l send the intern to clean it later today probably. Duckie, if you read this before I get down the hill, you know what you have to do.

Edit: I got asked about the cooling. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/3BNCQHL.png) is where the radiator is mounted, push configuration.

97imay,1,2018-08-15,So confused about my choices,MasQueUnNom,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/97imay/so_confused_about_my_choices/,"Hey Reddit!

I am a final year undergraduate studying Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering with a minor in Physics at the University of Mumbai. I am extremely interested in pursuing an integrated MS/PhD programme with my research interests lying in the field of quantum technologies, quantum photonics or quantum computation. After researching quite a bit on the colleges that do have a presence in this domain, I tried to prepare a list of colleges segragated in three leagues (1,2,3) numbered according to decreasing difficulty of admission. 

Now, here is the perplexity I face: Programmes that I really like, with amazing research groups working around the subjects, are almost always at league 1 schools, with a small number falling in league 2 and almost nothing in league 3. For instance, PhD. in CMS at Caltech or a PhD. at Princeton in Applied Physics are amazing programmes, however, with a diminutive promise for a successful application for me. While, if we move to some weaker programmes concentrated around quantum technologies, the odds fall in my favour significantly with an equally significant question of whether I want to culminate my PhD research there.

Also, why PhD? Because I don't think I can pay for a Master's degree without a scholarship or some sort of support. 


Profile wise, I have a GPA of about 8.3 but I have research experience with 4 publications and a research internship at The Niels Bohr Institute. I would project my GRE score to fall somewhere between 328-337(based on the output range of results of mock tests and allowing roughly a 2% error band above and below the worst and best scores). I also do have  accomplishments at national level technical competitions and I believe I can garner strong recommendations.

If anyone can help me with picking a list of colleges with a certain degree of safety to it, I shall be immensely grateful!  

It goes without saying that I do not discourage any critical thoughts. Feel free to advise in any way possible, for I need every bit of guidance here. 

Thank you!"

I'd be willing to take pretty much any job offer (internship, part-time, $50,000 pay).

I've become interested in a career in scientific computing, particularly in simulation. The aerospace industry interests me in partcular. 

What would be the best way to put myself on this path? What type of research or internships should I pursue in my undergrad? The school I'll be attending offers a masters degree in Scientific Computing and Applied Math, but very few schools in my state offer this type of degree specifically. Would a masters in CS suffice?

I'm working on a project to help students make informed decisions regarding their career, education, etc. I wanted to share my university story in hopes that I can inspire those of you who are in a position similar to where I was when I first started college.

Around this time 3 years ago, I was working manual labour in a warehouse and flunking my way through a biochemistry degree (which I absolutely hated). I had to confront the fact that I was completely lost and had no idea what to do about it.

Course selection was looming and a few friends of mine were looking for some elective courses to round out our semesters. Tbh, I'm not even sure why we decided to enrol in an introductory CS course, but we did and to my surprise I really enjoyed it. I really wish it was one of those: ""I've found my true calling, drop-everything-and-quit"" sort of experiences, but it wasn't. Programming was fun, but in reality, I just fucking hated biochem. The grass seemed greener on the other side, so the next year I decided to switch majors. It was the best decision I've ever made.

Being a year older than my classmates, I constantly felt ""behind"" when it came to my programming abilities. I spent 2nd year taking on unpaid web development projects (with on-campus clubs, societies, etc) to fast-track my programming skills. I managed to make some connections which led to some freelance work. The experience looked great on my resume and the cash didn't hurt either. As summer approached, I started applying for internships and after many many rejected applications and several interviews, I managed to get an internship at a small startup in Toronto.

Up until this point, I wasn't doing well in any of my classes. During my internship, I decided that I needed to develop a healthy work ethic if I wanted to get a decent job by the time I graduated. I read some great books (see: Mastery by Robert Greene and similar) and made a commitment to go hard in my final year. This was also around the same time I started lurking this sub and learning about the insane amount of time people were spending on leetcode before their interviews.

Following the canon advice on this sub, I grinded leetcode &amp; CTCI hard for the majority of my last year. The funny thing was, I also started to do really well in school, for the first time ever. I noticed that as I got better at committing to leetcode, I also got better at committing to studying. Not to mention the content kind of complimented my courses.

All in all, it ended up working in my favour and since then I've done internships at 2 Big N companies, one of which was in Silicon Valley. Even though I'm just at the beginning of my career, the road so far has not been easy. I attribute a lot of the victories I've had to older students, who have sacrificed their time to answer my questions and give me mentorship. I also owe a lot to the people on this sub. Barring the occasional toxic shit-posting, this really is a goldmine of tips and inspiration for aspiring software engineers. Posts like this helped me out a lot.

Now, I'd like to repay the favour and help out students at the beginning of their college careers. If any of you are looking for guidance on things such as: education options (degrees, diplomas, bootcamps), internships, startup life vs corporate life, interviewing, etc, please feel free to PM me and I'd be happy to get in touch!"

I've searched through Glassdoor to get some ideas on the interview questions. The questions that people post seem quite difficult as they involve system designs and algorithm optimizations. In my previous internships, I didn't receive projects that involved a lot of important modern technologies, such as cloud computing, designing APIs, distributed databases, etc. (I know how they work on high level, but probably not enough to thoroughly answer a design problem) 

I've been reviewing data structures and algorithms as well as practicing popular questions from LeetCode. But when you're at the interview site, I assume that you will encounter a question that you've never seen before. 

Tips on your first full-time s/w engineering interviews, how to divide up studying, how much to know, and any other things that might be useful, I would like to know.

I've been working for this company for a few years now. Originally it was a summer coop. The next summer they rehired me and since then I worked part-time for them for 2 years. This past summer they moved me from part time to full time as an intern.

The original plan I had with my boss was I was going to go to university, get my bachelors in power and energy engineering then come back and work for the company as a full-time assessor. This was never agreed upon in writing or anything but it was assumed.

It includes a lot of traveling within Ontario and a bit of traveling to other countries like the US or England. 2 weeks out traveling then generally 2 weeks back home. All paid for by the company

I used to think this would be great, I would get to travel and see new places. However, this summer I got to experience what it's like and I'm not sure if it's for me. It's a lot of time by yourself, generally, you finish your work by 2:00 PM then you have the rest of the day to yourself. I tried to make the most out of it by going out places and getting to see stuff but I just found it very lonely. After work I really look forward to hanging out with friends, signing up for classes, and going to the gym. I can't really do that if I'm traveling.

It's a good company so I don't really want to leave it, I also feel like I owe them since they stuck with me through university and kept me on as part-time. One of my coworkers said they are thinking of hiring for an assistant project manager position. I would be very interested in that position as it's pretty much what I am currently doing as an intern but with more responsibility. My boss doesn't think I'm qualified for it though and wants to hire someone with more experience for it. So it seems like if I don't take the first position then I might have to start looking somewhere else for a job. Any advice?"

Let's say that as soon as I graduate I get a full time job offer or long term contract or internship from a place that I'm willing to work at, but I think that it's reasonable that I might hear back from a better place/job if I wait it out another month or two. 

How do I handle this? What's appropriate? It's easy to say I need a day or two think about it, or even to just stall for maybe up to a week. But there must be some expectations by recruiters? I do NOT want to close any doors or be rude if I don't have to.

What's considered reasonable when ""playing the field""? Especially in terms of time between communications and the communications themselves? Hah. Thanks."

As a requirement for the university to continue to the fourth year, I should take a certificate in my field of study in summer vacation (either by having an internship in a company or by taking courses, online or at local study groups).  

So I applied to a course in web development (full stack), however I did not like the field much.  

Prior to taking the web dev course, I finished Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree free courses (did not take a certificate). And I found that Android was much better than the current course I'm enrolled in.  

All those aside, I have always wanted to enter the AI field and to know more about machine learning.

**How am I supposed to choose which path to continue?**

* Web Development (I hated the instructor and the whole thing, but I really need the certificate that I paid for - the course will end in November)
* Android Development (Should I take the Advanced Nanodegree? Should I start building apps with my current minimal knowledge.)
* Artificial Intelligence (Once I start a course in this field, I will not focus on the current web dev course, nor will I have time to develop Android Apps and start building some experience within the field).

97mmr6,5,2018-08-15,Is it safe to have this on my GitHub?,actinidia-deliciosa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/97mmr6/is_it_safe_to_have_this_on_my_github/,"I'm a rising sophomore applying for hackathons and internships, and I'm double majoring in math and computer science. Although I know how to program, I don't have personal projects and I essentially have no SWE-related credentials. (Yeah, I'm only just now realizing the extent to which (and the earliness with which) you need to build your resume in order to get into top companies after college.) This is because I don't really code for fun unless I'm processing data, automating a process, simulating an algorithm I've formulated, etc.

Now that I'm applying to a hackathon (but really my question is more concerned with internships), there's a field where I should link my GitHub, which is pretty much empty. However, I do have one project from junior year saved on my computer. Long story short, this program was used to parse HTML, do a bit of processing, and simulate requests to do my Spanish homework (which was hosted on a 3rd-party site). Kind of like if Duolingo asked more complex questions than it does now, graded you on your responses, and I made a bot that answers the questions correctly.

Does the fact that the majority of the program was HTML parsing make the project too trivial for me to pin on my GitHub? Additionally, if not, will presenting a program that I used in high school to complete hours' worth of homework in minutes raise red flags in any way?

Lastly, the only version control I had on the project was the likes of ""project\_version\_n.py,"" so even if I upload it, there won't be any git history; that would be bad, right? I imagine people would see it as me using GitHub as a substitute for Dropbox."

I am currently a CS major in college and will be entering my second year next month. I am looking to find an internship for next summer and I was just wondering when the best time to apply should be? Would it be in December or January or can you/should you start applying for summer internships before that? Are there any specific companies where it isn't too difficult to get an internship? Also, is it easy to find internships only for the summer or are most internships simply advertised as proper jobs with no end dates? I have looked at some internships available on glassdoor and very few specify a time period for which they last (e.g, for the Summer). 

Also, does anyone have any advice on what I should do to try and get an internship? I have done a few coding projects but none are too significant/they are pretty basic. I was thinking that I might post them all to my git hub for the heck of it but I'm not sure how helpful they will be. My GPA isn't that amazing either (in the low 3's). I have a basic knowledge of Java, Python and C, and I am hoping to improve my knowledge and ability in Java and Python in the coming months. I am also looking to learn some things about web development, but I am not sure how far I will be able to get by the end of this year.

So I graduated in May and started a software dev job. I've read about imposter syndrome time and time again on this sub and it's affecting me now. I did really well in school, always had clean-ish code compared to peers, loved learning about this stuff etc. but had no internships, so I feel lucky that I got a job out of school in the first place.

My first couple weeks was on front end UI stuff and minor backend changes (add some fields to a table, update the backend to handle it etc.). I was actually able to accomplish these tasks and got my code approved and pushed. I was doing really well on my tasks for these few weeks. Then I had a family emergency and took a month off which they were totally cool with (I was just gonna take a week off, but he said if I needed a month (which I absolutely did) that it is totally okay)). I got back and they put me on this new feature of the app where there wasn't much direction on it, and the answers I was getting to the questions I was asking about it were just making me more confused. After a week of struggling and getting nowhere, they decided to move me to a different thing. This different thing is harder than that first one I was struggling with, and my manager noticed I was struggling with it too. It was basically implement a new microservice (our web app backend is easily 30+ microservices... I'm new to huge projects with an actual architecture, we never did anything like this in school) for a piece of this app. I tried looking at how the other ones worked but this one was a lot different compared to those, and all the answers I was getting to the questions I was asking were confusing me more. So they moved me back to the front end UI stuff and minor backend changes again, which I'm comfortable with and can actually accomplish tasks with. However, my worry is that it looks bad that I was unable to do these two projects they assigned me. How bad does it look? I'm still new to software development (comp sci in college taught me none of this stuff lol) and I didn't have any internships.

Sorry for the wall of text. But yeah. Does it look as bad as it's making me feel? I felt useless for those two weeks where I didn't know what I was doing. At one point my boss said ""this microservice would take me a day to write"" and that made me feel like he was bragging? But I think he was just saying that to demonstrate how ""easy"" it is? Not sure."

In the summer of 2017, I was an intern for Company A. I worked there for three months and had a great experience. I learned a lot about my field, got paid, and met some truly nice and amazing people. However, when it was time for school to start, I left to finish my senior year.

I graduated college in May and when I got out, I applied only for jobs in the specific field I wanted to get into. After two months of not hearing back from the places I applied to and pressure from my mother, I caved in when I saw Company A was hiring again and I applied. The next morning I had an email from my old boss asking when I could come in for an interview. I felt wanted and set up an interview. 

I was confident that I was going to be hired back, but the Saturday before my interview (was on Monday), my mom sent me an email that Company B (my dream company) was hiring for the same position as Company A. I franticly applied hoping to hear back by the time of the interview or before I was offered the job at Company A. 

Time came and went. The interview happened on Monday and on Tuesday I had a job offer to return. I accepted and started the next week. 

Here is the catch. I've been back at Company A for two weeks and getting use to being back, and so far I've enjoyed it. The people are still really sweet, and even people I didn't know too well still remembered me. I had a feeling of being home. **BUT**, at 6:45 pm today, I get a call and answer it. It was Company B gauging my interest in the position I applied to in July. 

I went through with the interview and was clear that I recently went back to Company A. I told the talent recruiter that I would have to consider whether to pursue the next stages of interviewing and she said she understood and gave me a deadline of Friday on letting her know if I wanted to pursue or not.

For more background, company B is offering more money per hour and similar hours, so if anything it is a step up in the that department to go along with my aspirations of working there. 

I am truly leaning on interviewing, because it is my dream situation. I've wanted to work for this company since I was 5, but I feel guilty leaving Company A. My family and friends say that it is no big deal interviewing with Company B since both positions are part-time, but I wanted to know your opinion Reddit. 

Should I interview? How bad does it look leaving this job so soon, if I was offered this position at Company B? What or how much do I tell Company A?

TL;DR: I was recently rehired at a company that I feel loved and wanted at, but my dream company just asked if I wanted to interview for the same position at their company. What do you think my plan should be?"

Do I need to ask professors who are more senior or are my choices okay? 

Please give me some advice

Thanks!"

I am a computer science graduate from India. 

I have Intermediate skills in Python and has worked as an intern for 2 months on a project and built few modules for the same. Which I left to pursue higher education. 

I am planning on entering the network and security industry after my masters as right now I think that I have interest in that field.

Can someone guide me as to which industry I should enter and that how should I decide what is better for me?

Any help is welcomed.

Thank you"

Assembly Language and Computer Organization

Description: This course covers the organization and structure of the major components of a modern computer: combinational circuits, sequential circuits, simulation of circuits, coding, computer organization and architecture, including a detailed study of a micro-computer or minicomputer and the use of Assembly language. 

Computer Architecture

Description: This course is an in-depth analysis of one or more operating systems, system data structure, hardware architecture,
interrupt handling. Other topics may include parallel hardware architectures and performance analysis. 

Now these would be helpful in meeting upper division graduation requirements, but I'd like to spend my money on the more useful 'internship' classes: 4-credit classes that give me a guaranteed semester-long internship. But would employers ask for my transcript and check if I took these two courses?

If these two classes aren't crucial like DS&amp;A in my career as a developer, I'd like to just skip them. If they are, I'd prefer to pick up some of the books at teachyourselfcs.com. I'll be going to sleep now, but I'd like to hear opinions on whether I should take these two classes."

Apologies, if there is already a thread you can point me to regarding this, please feel free to do so.  
  
I am a CS undergrad currently working in the Audio/Visual industry at 26 yrs old. I thought I could work and do school and self-educate at the same time, but my job is simply too demanding. My programming skills progression is being slowed down too much by my job and I have decided to quit.  
  
I have enough saved to make it about a month, maybe two. I know they say find a job before you quit, but I don’t think my skills are marketable enough at this point to apply or interview anywhere. To be able to build my portfolio and gain the knowledge and skills necessary, I’m deciding to quit to free up the bandwidth to really buckle down and focus.  
  
Has anyone you know done this? Have you done this? What are my options to find freelance work? I know about Upwork and Fiverr, are they my best options for getting work and building a portfolio? Should I go for an internship instead? Should I spend this month trying to specifically study and pass an interview?  
  
I have a working knowledge of Java, not really an employable knowledge. I can do HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. I have no knowledge of Angular or React.  
  
Any insight will be helpful. Let me know if I need to clarify or expand on anything. "

I wanted to contest this ticket in court, specifically so I don't get 4 points on my license (I don't mind paying the fees). Plus, I thought it was ridiculous to get a speeding ticket in a parking lot where I didn't think I was going that fast because I had to turn into the lot; the officer didn't even chase me down, he was a few feet away from the entrance of the lot and he waited until I was parked to issue the ticket. I was scheduled a court date back in June but it was rescheduled for August 8th, and I accidentally missed it (I've been preoccupied with a new internship and I thought the date was August 20th).

I've contacted both the Jersey City municipal court and the NJDMV. Here's what I know:

1) They've issued another court date

2) No warrant has been issued 

3) My license is not supposed to be suspended (unless paid off, contested, or whatever) until October 12 this year

4) My next court date HAS to be before October otherwise I'll have to do a whole process so my license doesn't get suspended.

At this point I'm just really tired of all this hassle and I'm freaking out and I just want to know my options.

1) Are there any fees I will have to pay for missing the court date? If so, how much will the fee cost?

2) If I plead guilty, how do the points and the tickets affect my license/driving record? Also, how does this affect my insurance? I have Geico (I will not contact them for this information) and currently have no points on my license.

3) What are the chances I could possibly get the points taken off or reduced now that I had missed the court date?

tl;dr - I missed a court date for a speeding ticket and I'm not sure whether it's best to just pay it off or appear in another court date?"

I am currently trying to decide on a career path and I'd love your advice! I'm trying to decide if I should go to become a special education teacher or go into product management. Here are the details or my situation:

So I am currently in a bit of a dilemma. I am going into my last year of college as an English major and psych minor and have to decide what I want to do with the rest of my life. Last year I decided that I wanted to go into teaching. Where I live (in MA) you have to go for your masters in teaching and after that program must also take additional classes to maintain your liscence. You also have to pass many exams in order to gain your liscence as a teacher, and because my undergrad degree is not in special education (the area I would love to teach) I would have to do some mentoring. I've already passed two of my five exams but have stopped studying for a bit because it was just too overwhelming with work and I felt like I needed a mental break to figure out my life (haven't even been able to look at the study guides). I think teaching would be amazing and I love the idea of working with kids and helping others, but at the same time I feel like I'll become so burnt out from teaching and not sure I can handle the workload and stress. In my head, here are the pros and cons:

Pros

- helping children learn and watching them grow and develop, being a support system for them. This is a really big thing for me! In order to feel fufilled at my job, really think I need to do something that helps other. Especially if it's hands on. 

- I will get to have summers off that I can travel during or spend time with my future kids (although will probably always have to work through these breaks for the money)

- working with others who share the same passion as me

Cons 

- the crazy workload that teachers have, have heard of many teachers who work 50 to 70 hour work weeks, which to me is insane. (I have a family member who works in special education at the high school level and she says she had lots of work the first few years but nothing that bad and now she mostly works 40 hours a week, heard another English teacher who only works 50) Don't mind working very hard, especially at first, but a work life balance when I have a family with be very important to me. 

- the pay; although the pay isn't terrible in MA, it isn't the highest paying job in the world (eapecially for a job where you have to have your masters degree) I don't want lots of expensive or fancy things either, just don't want to constantly worry about money and would love to have the ability to travel to other countries and see the world (even if it's on a very tight budget)

- not being able to move around too much with my job. Teaching jobs in the New England area are pretty decent from what I know, but I have heard crazy stories about how bad teaching situations/pay is in many other states, which keeps me kind of locked down to this region

- not many positions to move to within the teaching world. Feel like once your teaching the only other higher up jobs to move to are becoming a principle or writing curriculum, neither of which I really have an interest in

- feeling drained from the job :/ so many people I have heard from quit teaching after a few years. They say they love the kids but always feel physically/mentally drained from the workload and stress of the job. **Also in order to have some of my masters student loans forgiven I would need to stay at a teaching job for 5 years....and I know I'll have to be locked into that position for the time. 

Since Ive read articles online and been told by people that I should never ever go into teaching  due to many of the reasons on the ""cons"" list, I decided to see what else there was out there that I could get a job with just my English degree and some senior year internships. This is when I came across Product Management. I am a very creative yet organized person and found that many people said they could find a good work life balance with this job so I thought it was pretty interesting. While I still need to research this job a bit more, and don't really have a pros or cons list for it, here are some of my thoughts:

- think it would be a great job because I've heard people say that they can actually work 40 hour weeks (if they find the right company) and not have to take work home. This is such a big deal to me because (although I will work extremely hard) I don't want my whole life just to be me at the office for 60 or 70 hours a week. It also seems to combine a bunch of skills together and I love the idea of having a job that is always exciting and ever changing. Also heard that the pay can be really good as well, which is always nice. 

- however, I'm a little nervous about how to break into this feild and wonder if it will be fufilling? I've never been the suit and tie girl, and have never pictured myself in a big business job, working to make money for a big industry dosent really interest me, but I heard you could also work at a non-profit, but I'm sure that come with pay cuts and more work as well. 

Overall I'm a bit confused as you can see, lol. Want to go into teaching but not sure if I can mentally handle taking/studying for all those tests and an additional 2 years of school (part time night classes), possible crazy work hours, the stressful job/possible burnout. At the same time could I be fufilled working at an office job doing project management? Would I wish I had just gone to be a teacher? How hard will it be to find a job?

**Sorry for the crazy ramble! At the end of the day I know it's my own personal decision, just looking for some advice either way. Teacher and PM opinions would be amazing!! Thank you so much!!"

I graduated in December 2018. I worked at a small boutique Investment Bank that mainly specialized in ESOP. I had an offer but I did not want to go back because I have no interest in ESOP.

Since my graduation I have struggled with health issues and have been working on that. They were so bad that it took a toll on my mental health as well.

Here I am now.. a non finance grad (Art History, honestly didn't have a choice with my major, long story) with finance experience, from a target school.
I havent really networked in months.
at times I am a bit insecure about my major and I just don't know what to do.

As far as internship recruiting, I killed it at recruiting events, and phone interviews, I had multiple super days (final round interviews where I was flown to headquarters)  with some great firms, but I did not secure a summer analyst position and ended up at a small firm in Chicago.

Right now, I am feeling like there is no hope. Maybe I am being cynical... I need someone to kick my ass.

Any words of wisdom will help, please. I am a bit overwhelmed."

I am looking for any leads on companies anywhere in the US for junior iOS dev jobs. I am patient, love to learn, and love to solve problems. I am wanting something to where I am constantly learning, and growing everyday. 

This summer I worked on a basic iOS application integrated with Salesforce. The application allows the user to login into their Salesforce account, once logged in user is able to query contacts, then once there, user is able to click on contacts, and view contact details. I have learned all about JSON data, REST API’s, Networking requests in iOS, and so much more. I want to keep learning and never stop. 

Unfortunately I do NOT have a lot of experience, and that is very important to companies, but I can prove that I can do it. I am willing to do it, and it’s what I need to do. I know people are going to tell me that I just need to work on side projects, and such, and I will. But I would also love a job within the next month, so I’m not just stuck SERVING ungrateful people. I would love to make an employer happy with the work that I know that I can do. I am committed, and loyal to any company that  I work for. 

Programming is such a great feeling when you complete something you’ve been working on for so long, and then it’s done. You literally feel like a million bucks. I know that there are so many opportunities out there for me, and I just have to search, but I have been searching and coming up short. If you/employers are looking for junior iOS developers, please contact me. And again please remember I do not have a lot of experience, but I am willing to learn, and make a difference.

However, since I only have one semester of math coursework left, I've been considering (mostly for financial reasons) graduating early as a math major, philosophy minor. 

I'm guessing that dropping the philosophy major won't have much of an impact on the job search. But how important would having that CS minor be, as far as getting past a resume screen? For context, I have no industry internships, but worked as a software development / algorithm design research assistant, and my GPA is good for what that's worth. I would spend the spring semester (or at least try to) studying algorithms, working on Leetcode problems and side projects, applying &amp; interviewing for jobs.

Since I have 2 classes left, it's possible that I could finish the CS minor in the fall as well, but 1. all the classes are full, so I'd have to get on a wait list, and 2. it would make my schedule busy enough that it might be challenging to balance coursework with career prep.

Any advice on this would appreciated!"

Do I look for a job, as I have no work experience (I will probably get a job on campus now), or look for an internship for next year?

This job is a 8-5 office job with no opportunity to work on the weekends as the office is closed.While in my last semester of school I have taken on an unpaid internship and being that i need very specific classes to finish my degree I have to make my work schedule fit around my school schedule. This will make my work schedule very awkward as I will only be able to be there mon - half day/ wed - half day/ Fridays - full days. Even more background when they realized I was on my last leg in college at the beginning of the summer they had a meeting with me and asked when i planned on leaving, stupidly I replied I may be out by September (at that time I was planning on getting a paid internship when the semester started). They don't really invest in me and there is no opportunity to work up in the company and I am receiving minimum wage. 

Recently, in my attempt to still make some money for personal/school/living expenses I decided that I need a job that will allow me to work awkward shifts and weekends when i have the most availability to maximize the amount of money I could be making throughout the semester while i finish up the last of classes and do my internship. It's a retail job at the mall also minimum wage about 10 minutes from my university. I went to the interview and got the job all within the last week and now for some reason i'm having second thoughts about taking the job.  

I guess my main questions is: Should I make my office job work for the last 4 months of school I have left and accept that I might have a smaller pay check and may be put on the chopping block soon but if they do work with my schedule I will have guaranteed hours for the week. Or take on the new job get some experience in another work environment, have flexible but not guaranteed hours and some opportunity to move up?

I only have 1 semester of college left. I might decide to go to grad school in a couple years, but for now I’m gonna use the laptop for 1 semester of programming classes and then won’t be using it as much (maybe for some side projects)

I’ve also thought about getting a used MacBook Pro (2015) instead of a new laptop. I used one during my internship and really liked it buts its a bit pricey. Is it worth buying a used one over a new Windows laptop?

Thanks!"
97vp08,0,2018-08-16,How to get that first internship?,FearlessSeat5,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/97vp08/how_to_get_that_first_internship/,"I'm a rising sophomore at a top 5 CS program in the US. I saw on this sub that many people were able to get that one great internship and from then on, they were pretty much set since recruiters would practically be begging them to join their companies on LinkedIn. However, I have had zero luck getting any bites on my resume. Here is some info on me:

1) I have a few personal projects that I have worked on and that are featured on my Github. One of my best projects is an extremely simple port scanning web app (which somehow has 6 stars on Github??? I don't really know why/how people even came across this) which just goes to show you the rather low caliber of my work. Another thing I am proud of is my website which I think looks pretty aesthetically pleasing and well-designed. My most ambitious project is some proprietary software that I am working on and potentially planning on building into a startup. It is probably the project I am most proud of and as a result, I have included it on my resume. However, there is very limited proof that it even exists as I am still working on polishing up the PoC but I still include it on my resume as it is my baby and I would love to talk with recruiters about it.

2) I don't have a LinkedIn. The first reason was that people would keep harassing me back when I did have a LinkedIn as my dad is a pretty well-known figure in the software development community and people would keep trying to use me to get through to him. Even though I tried to block these efforts, people would still manage to find a way and as a result, I deleted my LinkedIn (this was back in high school when LinkedIn didn't matter as much). The reason why I don't create an account now is that frankly, I wouldn't really have anything to show on it other than my skills and courses I took. I lack internship experience so I wouldn't have anything major to put on the experience section. I could reset my LinkedIn and have it be pretty much empty if that is the consensus advice but I don't see how that would be much better than not having a LinkedIn at all. However, I do have an account on pretty much anything else you can name: Indeed, Handshake, WayUp, AngelList, JumpStart etc. (if you guys know any more, that would be much appreciated)

3) I have a great GPA (~4.0) which I would like to maintain as I would like to go to grad school. I have not yet done research which is something I would like to do. I cannot do research this semester as I have already bitten off more than I can chew in terms of classes and extracurriculars, and I am uncertain if I will be able to find any opportunities in the spring as at our school as most of the good research positions are occupied fall. I was going to reach out to some professors to see if I could do research over the summer (this was my initial plan for Summer 2019). However, many people have been deterring me from that as a) it is not paid and I would pretty much be actively paying to work and b) if I change my mind and decide I want to go into industry right away, internships are much more valued than research. I will be applying to a few paid research programs over the summer but those are highly competitive so I don't know what my chances are.

4) I really don't know what the baseline for getting internships is as last year I had other plans for summer (Summer 2018) that didn't involve internships so I pretty much only applied for like 6 internships in total from very well known companies through their application portal (no wonder I was rejected!) This time around, I am more prepared. I have a Google Doc to keep track of where I applied and the application's status but no bites so far (it's still early). However, looking on this sub makes me so worried because it seems like everyone and their mom has an internship with the Big 4 or some major personal project or some other big plans and it is really depressing knowing I have to compete with people who are so much more talented and connected than me. It really seems like everyone knows wholeheartedly what they're doing and people are already in touch with recruiters lining up their cushy paid internship for Summer 2019 and I really don't know if I have the skill, time, and emotional energy to keep up.

People who have lived through this or had similar experiences, how were you able to get your first internship? Do you have any advice for me?

So, I start my first semester of my CS degree in a few days. I'm 2 years deep in my degree with no internships. I have no projects and would like to get an internship for next summer. It seems like now is the right time to apply, but as of two weeks ago I started to learn html/css/javascript. I'm not sure if I even have a chance at getting an internship. Is it possible to get an internship with no projects? I'm starting my CS degree, so I don't even have a gpa to brag about.

Online University:

I'm attending University of Illinois Springfield. This is a completely online degree, which is great for flexibility, but bad for networking and job fairs. They have a school website that lists current jobs, but I'm not sure that it's enough. How can I network with an online presence?

I'm just a bit lost on what I should do. I need an internship, I need to be employable. What steps can I take? Am I jumping the gun and trying to do too much too early? Should I wait until after Spring semester to look into internships?

97xltz,5,2018-08-16,"Accounting student entering third year, thought I had my career planned well, but a bankers academy I am attending has me questioning my future. Could anyone shed some light on my situation?",silentkiller000,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/97xltz/accounting_student_entering_third_year_thought_i/,"Sorry for the long-winded and very detailed explanation, but please bare with me!

I began my college career at a state university and declared finance; I knew I wanted business but just chose this for the time being. I just know I love numbers and working with people. I transferred to a different state university with a much more reputable business school and things are going extremely well. I declared accounting once I transferred, having taken one class in high school and enjoyed it so I picked what I knew. Plus, I don’t know much about careers in accounting or finance except becoming a CPA, so that’s what I planned to do. 

I’ve completed my first two years, taking general and core business courses, which consisted of two basic accounting classes but no exposure to finance. I am pretty active around campus, including serving as the VP of the student body, serving on budget and finance committees, I’m a member of a professional business fraternity, and I work at the university credit union. I’ve been lucky enough to attend programs with local businesses, such as a small accounting firm in the area. After the program, they wanted to interview me for a spring tax internship. I’ve gone through the interview and I am waiting to hear back. 

However, I am currently in a weeklong bankers academy program hosted by my state department of banking and securities, bankers and community bankers associations, and three community banks in my area (ranging from $700M-$1.6B in assets) I applied because it seemed like a great opportunity to build some relationships and learn more about the industry. When the time came closer to begin, it seemed like more of a drag to me as I realized the time commitment and all of the things I have deadlines to complete that I had to set aside to attend this program. I just got home from the fourth day of the program and I am reevaluating the career track I had originally planned. 

I knew practically nothing about banking, and mostly just saw the execs as greedy elites ruining people’s lives with debt. But after visiting three community banks this week, I am glad I decided to go. I stress community because from what I’ve learned it is a very different environment than a PNC or Bank of America. These banks hold many community events, donate to charity, and give back. They serve clients and business in the area and generally seek to build up the community. There are also many areas to explore, whether it’s lending, operations, sales, trusts and wealth management, and more. Some of the high ups there didn’t even start with a degree in business, just met the right person and got adequate training to prove their aptitude and succeed. I learned that many professionals move companies multiple times until they found what was best for them. The big banks (from what they’ve told me) offer positions that focus solely on one area with little opportunity to explore and have not so great work-life balance or care for employees. There so many alum from my school that have reached out, and others who are willing to help anyone succeed if they have the work ethic. 

This accounting firm I have the hook up with basically told me and stressed in the interview that they are looking for someone to intern, hire on, and stay with the company. Then from there I see it as staff position, get a CPA and eventually become a partner “or you’ll be pushed out of the firm” (words of a banker). They have around 5 regional locations and revenues of around $1-2M and also community based and friendly in the workplace, but I find it hard to agree to such a commitment when I don’t really know what either careers are like. They interviewed me on Aug 6 for an internship that will begin in Jan 2019. There are career fairs at my university that I planned on going to meet businesses but what would be the point if I’m already taken in the spring? I fear finding something that better suits me after I commit. Also, I haven’t even really explored other firms in the area, which is what I’d do at a career fair. 

Another factor is that the only way I can see being able to finance my masters so I can sit for the CPA is if I stay another year and work as a grad assistant at the university, which is a highly selective process. I haven’t even taken intermediate so I don’t really know if I have what it takes. Other than being a grad assistant, I’m sure there are loans and all but the 4+1 program my school offers consists of more classes a semester and summer courses, which I’m not sure if I can get funding for. My EFC is 0 and I have been doing this all myself. Of course my GPA and student activities help me win outside scholarships but it’s never a guarantee I will get them. Graduating with an accounting or finance degree seems suitable to go into banking, as it seems advancement is possible for someone who has the ability and drive and I can always go back if I wish. 

So sorry this was long winded, I am just looking for someone to give a bit of input on either industry or a personal experience. It seems like there is much more room for growth in banking and I can decide what I like. I don’t want to be selling myself short with this firm, but I can’t know until I experience other things. 

TLDR: had a career plan to intern at an accounting firm, get my CPA, get hired on and work my way from there. I have explored the banking industry and see many opportunities outside of accounting. What can I do?"
97xo6e,1,2018-08-16,Not sure if I should take hardware return offer.,iking96,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/97xo6e/not_sure_if_i_should_take_hardware_return_offer/,"I am sure there have been posts on this topic in the past, but I’d really like to get some opinions on my current situation.

I am an American student studying in Canada and am just about to finish up my internship at AMDs Canadian offices. They have extended a return offer to me and are even pushing for me to work in the American offices (yay me!). The problem is I don’t really know what I want career-wise (hardware vs software).

TAKING THE OFFER: The main reason I took this internship was the experience a hardware position. I worked in a front-end team doing synthesis and timing-closer and even got to do some design work. I really enjoyed most of it, but would want to steer closer to design verification and design work.

My fear is that I will be closing myself to software. My plan, until recently, was to aim for a software dev job. I enjoy coding, have made a few apps, and I think I would lose this.

Also I’ve Hurd hardware typically pays less and slightly less job security.

REJECT OFFER AND HOPE FOR SOMETHING BETTER: I think I could get other offers if I try. I had been looking into SAP, Lockheed Martin, and others before i got this news. One “mistake” I may have made is to have not gotten a software internship while still studying. So I don’t truly know what it would be like to work in software. But with my grades and app development I think I could get in.

My fear is that I may be chasing the greener grass that may not exist. Or worse that I don’t get many good offers, could be throwing away a good thing.

People who have worked in tech (and everyone else). What are your thoughts on this? I am not sure I’ll take the offer, may take my chances - but I am apprehensive.

So recently I completed the free[ OOP java courses](https://mooc.fi/en/) offered by the University of Helsinki and the courses taught me a tremendous amount and really encouraged me to think like a programmer.

My ex broke up with me about a year ago now and I've spent that year growing but I also haven't gotten over her. At all. 

When she broke up with me, she blocked me on all social media, wouldn't respond to ANY text, and she would ignore me if we were in the same room as each other. 

About a month ago she unblocked me on Instagram and started following me. She started texting me and starting conversations, but that only lasted for like a week or two and now she still follows me but doesn't go anything past that. When she was talking to me, I made sure she felt loved and that she knew I was happy to be talking with her; that I didn't want it to be awkward. She talked to me more about her plans for her future and internships she was excited to start, books she was going to read. I was really happy to hear from her again.

But now she is back to not paying any attention to me at all/ignoring me.

As the major implied, I am personally interested in programming/coding in general but I also have a knack for design-related stuffs, so I do enjoy web development, digital art and a little 3D modeling/animation (Blender) as well. Here are some questions that I have:

1. Recently got offered a job with the title Associate Technical Consultant. After some simple searching via the Internet and this sub, it seems like it may not be what I'm looking for? Is it very different from positions like *insert programming language here* Developer? I was informed that I will be working mostly on client side for my first project (if I accept the offer), so the commute or travelling seems to be off-putting for me. 

2. If I were to find a job related to either PHP or ASP.NET web applications, will I be limiting myself to one of language to get higher salary in the future? Or it doesn't matter as long as it's in the realm of web applications? 

3. I am fortunate enough to graduate with first class honours (CGPA 3.5 and above) and I saw some job postings that provides higher pay based on that. This is probably due to those companies are subsidiaries (not sure what word to use here) of companies from other countries so they can afford the higher pay. However, due to my experience in my internship, if feels like they probably won't want to hire me as they assume I can't converse in Chinese as my name isn't Chinese even when I explicitly mentioned I can. So should I just give up on applying these higher pay jobs? To give some further details, I studied in Chinese primary school and went to Chinese independent high school. For the internship, I applied with a Chinese friend to a company since they had attractive allowance and there's 2 positions available. Unfortunately only my friend was contacted, but when they ask him for recommendation for the remaining position, he recommended me and I was offered the internship albeit I started 1 week later than him due to the interview process etc. One thing I could never forget is the HR even once asked ""Why didn't you apply with your friend? This way you won't have to start 1 week later than him"". This mean they didn't even glanced my application the first time around and it was quite dissapointing... It's even more obvious that thy didn't view my application when I was offered a job there after the internship as they liked my qualifications and my work result from the internship.

Do pardon my ignorance and I'm truly sorry if any of the questions or sentences comes off in a different tone as intended. I really am feeling confused and would appreciate if I can get some opinions from people with experience."

This is an update on my last post that didn't really get far the first time but now I definitely need advice because the foster mom is now actually fighting me for ownership.

Original post[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/96slzm/getting_back_custody_of_my_cat_louisiana/)

TLDR I had to quickly find arrangements for my cat when I went back to college because my dad has cat allergies. I found a foster mom for him who said she'd watch him for my first year of college. I'm now moving into an apartment that I'm paying for solely so I can bring my cat. She has been ignoring me when I tried to make arrangements to pick him up.

\~\~

I texted the foster mom again and said I was concerned that she hasn't responded. She then responded to say that he was part of her family now and she was surprised that I wanted him back. It's been approximately the amount of time that we agreed she would take care of him for: one year. She is claiming that she thought it was only supposed to be for a couple months. I have screenshots of us saying it would be for a year and nowhere does it say a couple of months. She also claimed that I had only contacted her twice. I did cut back on contacting her significantly overtime because I felt that she was annoyed by it, but I had asked about him way more than twice which is also evident in our texts. Every time I asked about him I referred to him as ""my baby"" ""my sweet kitty"" etc. so I don't know why she thought I was giving him up.

I'm upset that she's lying to try to make her argument to keep my cat. I'm upset because she hasn't responded to me in two days after I replied to call out the inconsistencies in her messages. I want to work with her to see what is best with for the cat but she isn't cooperating.

But, my question is \[how\] can I take my cat back if either she doesn't cooperate with finding a solution for him or if I determine that he would be better off with me, which I have reason to believe, and she disagrees. Would he still be considered legally my cat based on our agreement which is documented by texts? Could I get the police to help me reclaim him if she is really uncooperative in returning him to me? I really really don't want to go to court because I have no money and no free time as a college student with 1 job and 1 internship."

I also got to use Redhat cloud forms and Ansible Tower to create inventories, make job templates, and run and debug my playbooks.

My question is, should I still add this to my resume as a ""SWE Intern"" or ar change it to a ""DevOPs Intern""? How should I word what i did with some buzzwords? Will this position help me in finding internships and jobs in the future? Any advice would be appreciated."

**Backstory and goal:** I'm from the US, my SO is from Slovenia and we've been together for about two years now. The long distance relationship thing is draining and we'd like to finally live together for longer than 1-3 months (the holidays and the summer) out of the year, the way we've been doing it up until now. It doesn't have to be permanent, we'd just like to see if our relationship holds up in normal life conditions as well as it does right now. We are both flexible and willing to move to the other's country. From my understanding, this would be easiest through getting a job in the other country, but that's only obtainable with a visa.

**Our failed tries:** We are both recent BA graduates. A few months ago, the plan was for her to do an 8-month-long internship program here in the US, but the company wasn't upfront about the full price of the program up until the last moment (~$4200) and it's just too expensive for us at the moment. 

After that we were thinking about me getting a TEFL certificate and teach for some time in Slovenia through that, but apparently the working visa laws in Slovenia are similar to those in the US - an employer needs to sponsor the visa, and it seems that a TEFL teacher wouldn't be a valuable enough employee for a potential employer to go through the process of sponsoring the visa.

The next option was for me to try to get the citizenship of a country in the EU through my (late) grandparents, but I sincerely doubt we will be able to dig up any legal documents that would serve as proof that they were citizens of that country.

Other than that she has the option of doing a Work&amp;Travel program, but that would be only for the summer (we couldn't find any programs that would continue throughout the year).

**Our future looks like this at the moment:** I have a guaranteed job from now until June 2019 and she's thinking about pursuing a Master's program in Slovenia (we were thinking about her doing it in the States but it's too expensive for her), but that of course means that she'd be signing herself up for another 2-3 years of being bound to her studies and Slovenia. 

At this point, we're at a loose end regarding what to do. The past few months have been filled with a lot of research and many disappointments. It seems as if the only way for us to live together (it doesn't even have to be permanent) is to get married and then get a visa (either one of us) through that, but even with that, as far as I know, you have to be married for two years before you're able to obtain a spouse visa/green card? of any sorts (US laws). Marriage would be our last resort, because we don't want to look at it as merely a means to an end and it's still kind of early in our relationship. (Any advice on the marriage prospect would also be greatly appreciated)

**Are there any other ways, besides marriage, in which I'd be able to live and work in Slovenia or she in the US, at least for some time?**

Tl;dr: My girlfriend (Slovenia) and I (US) would like to live together. Getting a worker's visa is hard both ways and we're wondering if there are any other ways in which we'd be able to live and work in the other's country, at least for some time."

The previous few weeks have been good, and I've been making steady progress in learning about gcloud services and frameworks I didn't use in school. However, I'm at the stage where I need to improve my model, and I feel like 1) I'm blowing money on experiments that haven't amounted to anything 2) running out of ideas to test and 3) have somewhat high expectations from my coworkers in other teams.

I was thinking about this yesterday, but I think I'm not being methodical enough in how I'm setting up my experiments. I've done a research internship before where my supervisor would sit down, do analysis with me, and plan out experiments for me to try, and I'm realizing how much I wish I had that now. My past week has been learning how to use ML Engine and running maybe 20-30 experiments trying different parameters, models, and data distributions to little avail. I feel like I'm sitting in a control room with thousands of buttons that I don't recognize or understand. My plan today is to write out an experiment schedule and take notes on everything.

I worked as a lawyer but decided to learn programming as I found it more interesting than law. Over last year I've put a lot of time to learn Java and additional technologies I would need to get a position as an intern or junior. Two-three months I've started to send out applications to no avail. Now, one of the biggest IT companies in my region, offered me a job, but not the one I applied for.  

Instead of programming in Java I would be responsible for writing scripts in some scripting language that is used only for this project and that I would have to learn after I begin my work. It's supposed to process data from documents and evaluate their correctness (that's where my law background is useful to the company). Some Java may be involved as the application 'surrounding' those scripts is written in it, but probably not much of it.  

As I'm very eager to get a job in this industry this offer seems good enough. But I worry that doing this particular job won't let me really develop my skills and get useful experience and knowledge. Yes, I would learn how to work in a team in a bigger company, deepen my knowledge of databases, get some IT experience in my CV. On the other hand I'm kinda old and late to the party and I'm concerned that if I would later like to move to do something more like the programming I'm learning now then I would just be in the same position as I am now.

Before I get into what I've been going through, I want to say that I am currently going through therapy and my therapist has recommended I post my troubles anonymously online to help me since he knows I use reddit as a way to cope with life. Therefore, this post will be me telling my story to look for advice and to help relieve some of the weight.

If the me from a year ago looked at me now, I would be unrecognizable. Over the past few months, a series of major life changes that I have gone along with have left me with some insomnia, eating problems, depression, and severe anxiety (not diagnosed yet, but I will have the diagnosis by next week). As a bit of background, I am entering my senior year of high school after skipping my sophomore and junior year (due to my mom; more later) and would consider myself competitive for top schools. My mom's family is from Mexico, so she wants us to get the best education possible, but she ends up putting a lot of pressure on me and my two sisters to do well in school to the point where anything below a 97% is unacceptable. She constantly micromanages my studying, makes sure I will be valedictorian, made me take the SAT until I got a 1560, and made me take more classes this summer than I did in all of last school year. My parents got divorced about 11 years ago and both quickly remarried. My dad was abused growing up and has a history of being violent with my mother, which is why she left. I have been going between houses every week as part of the divorce agreement, but my mom has custody of me and my sisters.

Now for what happened over the last few months. My troubles all started in January when my mom got a divorce from my step-dad after he was caught stealing from her company and cheating on her. This caused my mom to shut down and go into a deep depression. I was fine at this point because I was never attached to my step-dad, but my mom started to focus all of her frustrations and anger on me by controlling every aspect of my life and forcing me to study and not allowing me to do anything with my friends (isolating me in my room with prep books and cancelling all of my plans). This went on for a few months until she found a new boyfriend, but once she did, she started giving him all of her attention and forgetting about me and my sisters (ex. not buying food for several days because she forgot, forgetting the plans we had for months to go on a date, etc.).

Around the same time, problems started occurring at my dad's house. One of my sister's friends found a video camera that was hidden in her room and I had found several in other private locations. My dad dismissed these as ""alarm systems"", but we all knew what they were. A few weeks later, we went on a vacation where I slept in the same room as my sisters (nothing abnormal). On the last night of the vacation, one of my sisters (technically my step-sister from my step-mom) was told to sleep in my dad's room (with my step-mom there too). I later asked why and my dad told me it was because I had ""touched my sister inappropriately"" the night before. This was a shock to me because nothing like that happened and my other sisters were up later than me and defended me; but he didn't listen.

Fast forward a week later and my dad was engaged in another screaming match with my step-mom and somehow I had become involved. A lot of things were said that I felt had threatened my safety, so the next morning, I woke my (biological) sisters, we packed our bags, and we went to school. That afternoon, we were supposed to return to my dad's house. But because none of us felt safe there, me and my sisters took the bus to my mom's house. When he found out where we were (he tracks our phones), he furiously called and rushed over to come get us. Because we were scared of what he might do if my dad managed to get us in his car, we called the police. When the police arrived, we informed him of the situation and said we refused to go over to my dad's house. When my dad arrived, he had a talk with the police officer and quickly sped away.

I have now been living with my mother for about 4 months, but since then, a lot has happened at my dad's house. It has come out that he was videoing and molesting/raping my step-sister (which is what was happening earlier in the hotel), my step-mom is getting a divorce, and naked videos of one of my biological sisters was distributed online. After all of this coming to light, my dad skipped town with my 6-year-old sister and cannot be found or contacted. The FBI and CPS have been looking for him for a while, but he has so far evaded arrest. The scary part is, the week before he left, he was dropping hints of suicide and talked about who was in his will, the fact that life insurance covers suicide, sadness, and the inevitability of death a lot.

On top of all of this, I am managing 3 internships, countless awards, college essays, a blog, coding, 8 summer classes, getting eagle scout, pressure from my mom, and maintaining a cheery outward composure while I'm crumbling inside. I have been interviewed by CPS several times and have had several breakdowns and slumps of bad depression. My mom has taken notice to this and put me in counseling, but I'm still having a lot of difficulties coping with all of this. I try to keep myself happy by saying stuff like ""If I make it through, this would make one hell of a movie/book/autobiography"" and ""one more year of school and you can move to California and it will all go away"", but deep down I really wonder if I can do it. My sisters have also taken this really hard with one on pills after being diagnosed with depression, and the other sad all the time.

I know this has kind of turned into a rant/me venting, but over the hour it has taken me to write this, I feel I've calmed down significantly like some of the load is released, so thank you for reading. I would appreciate any advice or positive comments that are not hotlines or medical help (I already have that much covered by my counselor and therapist) because my mom has destroyed all of the friendships that I could really use right now to talk about all of this.

My full-time internship ended in May, and I graduated with a bachelors December 2017. I currently freelance as a marketing design coordinator and illustrator, since I do so much freelance work with startups and help them get set up with everything they need to function- not just design. 

I have applied to about 30 different jobs since then doing the whole process- curating a portfolio, writing a cover letter, reaching out on LinkedIn, stuff like that. I've also been attending networking events as well. I have gotten up to one phone interview, and that was because HR liked me, but didn't have associate design positions available. I expressed interest with freelancing with them, so they still have my info. 

Our savings have now dwindled, and I am constantly at negative in my bank account. Now I almost cry when I get a phone call and let it go to voice mail because they're all bill collectors. I get some freelance gigs, but they either don't pay enough, or I don't have the faculties to do them. (I rely on medication to function, and I have had to go without for several months now, which makes my potential ""productivity"" even less.) I started to apply for low skill labor jobs, but I also haven't heard back from anyone. I have food allergies so I can't work at a restaurant, I have memory and balance issues so I can't work as a server or have anything to do with money, and I don't have a car so I can't work at places that are hiring without either spending 3 hours on transit or risk walking home late at night- which I don't do as a woman. I once called a grocery store who was hiring and they said they didn't want to hire anyone with a degree. I was crushed. 

I'm so... *sad* with this process. I've dropped into a depression and I'm thinking some concerning thoughts- and I've only been unemployed for three months! I can't imagine how people who have been searching longer feel. I have reached out to recruiters and peers to give me a truthful, blunt portfolio and personality review, and my peers tell me I'm doing great, my mentors tell me I'm doing everything right, and even my recruiters at staffing agencies said I'm doing everything right. Everything is meticulous and consistently branded, my cover letters improve every time I write one, and I always am meticulous about writing back thank you letters. 

I'm struggling with feeling worthless. I'm selling what little possessions I have to try and make ends meet and get cat food and maybe a small present for my husband's 27th birthday. I'm walking around everyday finding places with ""Hiring"" posters that are local to me for anything that I *can* do. I'm dropping the ball in so many little ways and everyday I wake up later and later and apply for jobs more irritatedly because I haven't heard anything back. I would kill for a simple copy-and-pasted auto rejection after a week. 

I keep track of the address, job, contact and method of application, along with a flow chart of the process and how far I get and when I apply. This screenshot is just the first few, but its still so sad. https://i.imgur.com/CKj6MmD.png

My mentors, peers and recruiters say I'm doing everything right, so I just have to sit tight. But how do I do that when I'm at risk for my electricity getting cut off on the 29th? Or wonder how I'm supposed to make it even to next week when it comes to food? I get that life is tough at 23 but I got rejected from grocery stores and other supposedly """"accessible"""" stuff so how else am I supposed to take that? I'm feeling like there's something wrong with me and no one is telling me. I'm not even applying for jobs that are ""out of my league""- they're all exactly the kind of gigs junior designers apply to! 

I'm so freaked out, depressed, and anxious. I feel so worthless and put down. Those of you who have been in my position, how do you cope? "

In particular:

* PHP
* JavaScript
* MySQL
* Version control (Mercurial)
* Unit/Integration testing


Of those 5 tools, I've used JavaScript in the past and also used SQL in the past (not MySQL in particular though). I have no experience using PHP and I also don't know much about version control and unit/integration testing. I have a few hours after work everyday that I can spare to prepare for my next internship, but I was just wondering what would be the best way to do this. I have 2 options that I'm considering:

1. Go through some tutorials that use PHP + MySQL together. ([this one](https://ilovephp.jondh.me.uk/en/tutorial/make-your-own-blog) or [this one](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/php-tutorial/php-mysql-crud-application.php))
2. Go through a web-development book that uses Python + JavaScript + a NoSQL database, and also teaches version control and unit/integration testing. ([this one](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/))

The Python book doesn't use PHP or MySQL, but I'm a lot more familiar with Python and I think that I will learn more about web-development fundamentals with that book compared to the PHP tutorials. The PHP tutorials are also more about using PHP with MySQL and don't contain any JavaScript at all, so I don't know how useful they'll be in my case. At this point, I'm leaning towards going through the Python book, but it would be nice to get another opinion on what I should follow through with. Thanks for taking the time to read!"

Hey guys, first time posting here so sorry if I'm misunderstanding a rule or something in this post.

I'm a recent grad in game development. I know a few programming languages, I've made a few apps/games, but my program didn't have a co-op and I screwed up getting a summer internship. So, I'm sitting here, not quite sure what to do. I've applied for a few different jobs in town in the programming languages I know, and I've picked up web development in an attempt to broaden the sort of jobs I can apply for. But I haven't even gotten as much as a phone interview.

Should I be going in person? I'm pretty comfortable talking to and meeting people in person, but I'm not sure if that's an acceptable approach. Should I be having someone professionally write my CV or resume? I don't want to go back to school and start an entirely different program, but now that it's been three months since I graduated, I'm beginning to become concerned that I'm not going anywhere fast and that my field of study in college is a massive turn off. At this point I'm lost and not sure where I should be going...

Following is the job post for the job position that I am looking at.

&gt; Review and manage structured and unstructured data


&gt; Inventory data received and record metadata


&gt; Transform data using scripting languages such as SQL, PowerShell, C#, or Python



&gt; Perform basic data imports into Microsoft SQL Server


&gt;  Validate imported data and perform preliminary data manipulation and analysis


&gt;  Visualization improvements


&gt;  Machine learning


&gt;  Data science


&gt;  International compliance standards



&gt;  Data privacy laws


I feel like descriptions are rather broad. 

Also, this job position is for an internship.

I learned a bit of Python this past summer and I am reading a book titled Data Science from Scratch. So one can say that I already know very limited amount of Python and data science but I know them only in theory. SQL .. I know what it is and I learned a bit a couple of years ago. 

The company is looking for someone educated in Management Information Systems or Computer Science or anything similar. I come from accounting background and I am strongly interested in doing ""data analyst"" type of jobs because I believe that nothing will be better than showing that I worked as data analyst to convince employers that I have some proficiency in data science along with my accounting background. I believe that will give me an advantage when I look for ""financial analyst"" type of jobs.


Strictly speaking, I don't qualify for most of the qualifications now. How long would it take for me to have enough knowledge to apply for job position as described by the job post above?"

I majored in liberal arts and I've developed an interest in tech and finance careers. I took some business courses in undergrad and took a coding course through Udacity and liked both fields.

To break into tech, I'm thinking about doing a second degree in CS that will be fully funded by my parents and plus I'll be living with them so I'll get free food and housing. I'll also get a very small stipend for gas, food, credit card bills, etc. 

My parents don't want to fund my finance aspirations though. I'll have to take out a 50k-100k (tuition) loan to get an MSF at a top business school so I can get front office roles.

The best thing is doing what I like the most but I haven't done a finance or tech internship so can't decide between both. 

I'm thinking about learning finance/accounting and taken an excel course to get finance roles to see if I like it. On the other hand, I can do a 3-month bootcamp to see if I like coding."

98835r,68,2018-08-17,TIFU by getting hot and fruity,throwaway381511001,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/98835r/tifu_by_getting_hot_and_fruity/,"About two years ago I was in a city I hadn’t lived in before for an internship. I was subletting a room from two really nice people. I had my own space and even had my own bathroom.

I had moved in a few days before the Monday when the internship started, and on the Sunday night before my first day of work I was in the shower when I noticed that my roommates had placed some shampoo and conditioner in the shower for me to use. How nice! 

Not only had I not shampooed my hair since I’d gotten there a few days prior, but I also hadn’t masturbated. You know how it is: 80% worrying you’ll be caught by somehow forgetting to wipe all the semen off the ceiling and 20% spiritual shame about masturbating in someone else’s abode. Anyway, my male urges had sufficiently extinguished those mitigating factors over the last few days, and this is conditioner we’re talking about here. As lube it’s infinitely better than shampoo or, god forbid, *body wash*, so there really wasn’t much hesitation on my part. And it was a brand I’d used before (although I’d never used this particular flavor of some weird fruity flavor from a far off continent). In fact, as a side note, conditioner is actually #2 on my list of lube stand-ins commonly found in household bathrooms, right behind neosporin. Not to mention, Confucius say “man who sleep in tent wake up cold and tired.” So I went ahead and did my business with the conditioner and then used it again along with the shampoo to wash my hair. I slept soundly that night.

In the morning I woke up after that classic “where the fuck am I” moment you get when you wake up some where you’re not expecting to wake up, I turned on my side to reach for my phone, and I immediately felt the most intense itching sensation I had ever experienced deep in my crotch. As soon as I reached down to scratch I could tell something was not right down there. I threw off the covers and pulled up the waist band of my boxers to assess the scrap value of my junk. It was zero. I could barely recognize the skin down there as a penis.

I ran to the bathroom to get a better look at things. What had been my penis was now a completely red and swollen blob. (A side note here about penis anatomy for the uneducated. What allows the penis to become erect is sponge-like tissue inside of it. To accommodate the size of an erect penis, a flaccid penis naturally has a lot of loose skin.) So what shape does all that excess skin make when it expands to its limit but the inner erectile sponge tissue is totally un-engorged? The answer, it turns out, is a donut. My penis had essentially turned into a donut with the head popping through the hole of it. The skin was both extremely itchy and extremely sensitive so it was a real damned-if-you-do-damned-if-don’t situation. Whenever I scratched it hurt like hell, whenever I didn’t scratch it itched like hell. I gingerly dressed myself, and, as if my Dickin Donut  wasn’t enough to deal with on my first day of work, I noticed while brushing my teeth that my face was all splotchy red with little rash marks, and my scalp was very tender and a little bit of my hair had fallen out. Apparently I was very allergic to the conditioner and shampoo that had been set out for me to use, and I’d only rubbed it violently all over two of the more sensitive parts of the human body. My first day of work was absolute hell. I was constantly itchy and looked like shit as well. The next day wasn’t a whole lot better, but I was able to get to a drug store and buy some cortisone cream on Tuesday night. I applied it *liberally* to my groin.

My recovery from trial by foreign fruit was slow and arduous, but I luckily walked away with no long term effects. Within 5 days I was feeling pretty good, and within 10 days I was happily jerking off again (dry or with neosporin). I’d like to say i learned my lesson, but honestly just yesterday I masturbated with some African gum tree conditioner variety or other, so boys will be boys I guess.

I wish I’d taken pictures, but in hindsight the 10% of me that thought I might have permanently disfigured my penis wasn’t really thinking about the laughs down the line.

TL;DR masturbated with some ethnic fruity conditioner; had a legit chode for a few days"

So I am currently a rising junior at a top 5 CS university, who just finished up a software engineering summer internship (think BB like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Bank of America, etc...). I am fortunate enough to have received a return offer from them. I have had a software engineering internship before this one as well, and I have one more summer of interning until I graduate (and then the summer after graduation, if I choose to intern then). I enjoyed working there, but I'm worried that they are not up to date with the latest tech, and I might reach a ceiling in growth very quickly by working there. I would prefer to work at a tech company, hopefully one of the brand name ones, where I would make more money, be a front office employee, and most importantly learn the most from.

The problem: My summer company's deadline to respond to the return offer is long before any other company would get back to me about summer internships. I have not taken algorithms yet (very in-demand course at my college), and although I am confident in my LeetCode easy solving abilities, I struggle with leetcode mediums (solved 19 leetcode easy and 4 leetcode mediums). I have been grinding everyday and have improved tremendously, but there's definitely still a long road for me to go.

The way I look at it, I have three options.

1. Accept the offer and work there next summer, and apply for that fall or next spring at a tech company (this way I ensure I have a company that I can work at for next summer, and try to go for higher the semester after. I am perfectly willing to delay graduation for a semester to work at one of the brand name tech companies).
2. Decline the offer, and search for a new internship next summer (and next fall too). My issue with this is the one bird in the hand is better than two in the bush problem, I'm worried if I do this I might not get a summer internship. If I can't get one I would do everything I can to try and get a summer research position at my university, though that's not guaranteed either and it would be much better to have an internship because there's the chance of getting a full time offer for after graduation.
3. Accept the offer, and search for a better internship for the summer anyway and reneg if I do get a better offer (my worry with this is giving myself a bad reputation, and having future employers not give me offers because they heard I did this). I'm not saying I would choose this option, but it is a possibility I need to evaluate I guess. It also might be helpful to add that I might be interested in working as a quant and would want to try that out, although this would be one of many many possible places to work as a quant.

Please let me know what you guys think the best option for me is, I want to start my full time career as strong as possible so that I could grow the most, and I will have a decent amount of student debt that a higher paying job can make less stressful when I graduate."

I recently completed an internship which would allow me to pump up resume more with far more juicy keywords. I have more personal projects to put on along with being a 'maintainer' of a kinda popular Github project \[don't now if it helps\]

But I still believe, I won't never get short listed for a real software engineering role because my undergrad wasn't even in computer engineer/cs. It's in chemical engineering. 

I'm going to be reading software engineer books like Effective Java, Algorithm Design Manual, and all those fascinating books. Yet, I know this is not enough to get short listed for a full time software development role at the big four. Just doing leetcode won't get me anywhere by failing to get shortlisted for the initial screen test.

I’m an upcoming freshman at University of Illinois at Chicago. I start school in about 5 days. My end goal would be to end up at UIUC, Northwestern or UChicago. I have no clue about internships, but I would like to get one over this next summer. I’m looking to work as a hedge fund analyst as my career. I have a current trading account with a profit of 10-20% of account growth a month I could use as a way to show I’m interested in finance. I really don’t care if it is a paid internship or not.

How do I go about that to apply for an internship? What’s the process like? 

I live in the Chicago area, so any recommendations for internships?

Any advice or recommended tips?"

98cpmv,668,2018-08-18,My manager told me why I got my return offer.,elf_lord_wario,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/98cpmv/my_manager_told_me_why_i_got_my_return_offer/,"If it ever sounds like this is me bragging, part of it is, but most of it is for context. Maybe this will give insight to people who are looking to intern.

I started interning at a ""big name"" financial tech company back in May 2018. Worked on distributed systems and budgeting servers. I was the only intern at this company, and I essentially worked alongside the other engineers.

My manager and I had weekly meetings where he would start the question off with questions like ""are you having a good time here?"" and ""What do you feel like you've learned"" but never gave much critical feedback. I thought this meant he did thought I was incapable of improving or that he thought I would be demotivated by criticism.

Often times in these meetings I would bring up things I could be doing better. I don't think it was self deprecating, but in the sense that I wanted to see what he would agree with so I could get some more insight to where I stood.

When giving me my return offer (100k + 20k benefits), he said that the reason he didn't give me much criticism was that anything he could have told me, I would have already thought of myself. He mentioned the differences between my first presentation and my later presentations and how it didn't matter where I was at now because I would keep getting better quickly. He used the word ""introspective"" a lot to describe my approach to work and I realized that it wasn't always about coming into a company as a ""ninja coder"" (I hate that term) but more of just a human that can assess themselves, because we're probably our own best critics.

In conclusion, I think more importantly than just being a skilled software intern is being an introspective one."

A bit about me, I'm in a startup with an ex-googler who I knew in high school, and we are pushing to launch our app end of September, which is the same time my internship ends at this company I'm working in.

 I'm pretty sure they aren't considering hiring me ( don't really know ), plus it is upstate and I'd like to move out to Brooklyn with my girlfriend once end of September hits.

I just finished my AS in Computer Science and have a BM in music as well. Now that I've explained a bit, I have a few questions for advice:

1. Begin my job search now or focus on launching my product and take a month with no work in the city while launching?

1a. if Beginning job search, how to best go about searching the market place in the city to find a steady 9-5.

2. With my experience, about 1.5 years working on this small start up and 4 months at this big research company, apply for junior or mid-level roles? (I work mostly with backend APIs, Django, and have some experience with Vue, will be learning React)

Thanks for any and all advice! I know many would recommend that I get a BS, but I don't plan on doing that, I think 6 years of college is enough ( career change ), and I can't afford to do that right now."
98cx8b,2,2018-08-18,What should I do in my gap year?,chibirilakkuma,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/98cx8b/what_should_i_do_in_my_gap_year/,"Hello!! I posted on here a couple weeks and the responses were (surprisingly) positive, but then a little bit over a week ago I learned that I’m going to be moving to India in a month because of my dad’s job ..... right before my senior year.  It’s quite a strange situation, so I wanted to explain my situation here and see what you guys thought I should do/focus on! 


So, first off, here’s my stats from BEFORE this year: 
General /
Female/Asian (Indian) /
Would be an international applicant /
Go to a small (1200 kids), pretty competitive high school in a suburb of Ohio /
Intended major is neuroscience /


Test scores:
ACT is 35 with 36 for reading/writing, 35 for science, and 34 for math, essay score was a 9 (9/9/8/9 score split) /
SAT subject tests are 780 in bio and chem /
AP tests: sophomore year: chem - 5, apush - 5, enviro - 4; junior year: psych - 5, gov - 5, lang - 5, bio - 5, physics I - 3 /
GPA: 3.87 UW, 4.3 W / 
Top 7% of class but my school is technically a non-ranking school so I can decide if I send my rank or not/not sure if I will


Extracurriculars:
Secretary of Bio Olympiad club sophomore year /
Secretary of Medical Careers club junior year /
Self-studied Computational Neuroscience under the guidance of a prof. at a local university in the summer of 2017 /
Won the 2018 Regional Brain Bee for my state, Went to the USA 2018 Brain Bee, 5th place /
Won the NSF Regional Brain Bee, Qualified for the NSF Natl Brain Bee (didn’t go because of financial reasons) /
Made my own youth neuroscience organization based in Ohio that fundraises/does brain bee prep/does neuroscience outreach events (2018 June-present) /
Research assistant at an attention lab at a university close to me and a lab studying glaucoma at a different university (2018 June-present) /
Did a couple of neuroscience camps at OSU, but nothing too spectacular /
Hospital volunteering (department: ICU), summer 2017-present


Rec letters:
My Advanced Research in Science and AP Enviro teacher who really likes me and described me previously as one of the most responsible students he’s ever met / My AP Bio teacher, I was one of the top students in his class and I talked so much and so consistently about brains that he was surprised when I said I didn’t win brain bee nationals — he doesn’t know me as well, but he’s definitely going to write about me and brains / My guidance counselor who I really don’t know well / Supplemental will either be the prof of neuroanatomy at a med uni who helped me study for the brain bee or the prof who I’m doing a internship with (glaucoma one)


These are the colleges I would like to apply to:
Brown University ED /
Hamilton College RD /
Rice University RD /
The Ohio State University EA /
University of Rochester RD / 
Ohio Wesleyan University RD /
McGill University /
University of Toronto /


ALRIGHT, so now that you’ve gotten a sense of my stats, here’s what’s happening:


— I’m moving to India in early September sometime because of my dad’s job 

— I don’t want to do HS in India because a) I’d probably have to repeat a grade (for reasons bc of their school system that I won’t get into here) and b) adjusting to a whole new school system for a year would be hard 

— Therefore, I’m going to finish my senior year and graduate before then (so in like 3 weeks).  This sounds super weird, but hear me out: I only have 4 classes that I still have left to do in order to graduate, which are Health, PE, Art, and English.  So, I’m taking them online and just going into a random classroom and studying all day so I’ll finish them in 3 weeks.  Essentially, I’m finishing my senior year in a couple weeks, getting my HS diploma, and moving. 

— My weighted GPA will 100% go down because of this, but my UW GPA will go up because I’m on track to get As in all the classes (I’ve already finished English Sem1 and Art, and I’m halfway through Health and PE).

— I will be the Co-President of Medical Careers Club for the couple weeks before moving (I could also be the President/Founder of Brain and Psychology Club, but I’m not sure about that yet).

— IN INDIA, I will have essentially 2 ECs and 0 connections (because my parents think I should do things myself instead of relying on them) to start.  My two ECs are: 1) my internship at the glaucoma lab, which the PI agreed to let me work on (because I work on tracing axons and have been doing it remotely anyways since the lab is 2 hours away from my home) from there and 2) The youth neuroscience organization — I will be helping out with the “Brain Bee Prep” section and will be making a new sister chapter in India (although I’m not so sure how successful it’ll be, I’m going to try to promote it at events like the Indian National Brain Bee and etc.).  So, I’ve got a ton of options on what to do with all my free time! I’ve already decided that I want to look for an in-person lab, but that’s really difficult to get in India, so I can never be sure of if I’ll get it.  I could also try to do a couple of AP classes with a tutor (Calc BC/AP Euro/etc.) and take the exams.  I could also teach English in my grandfather’s school (he lives in a very rural area) or try to work with a neuroscience-based nonprofit to help them out.  I also really want to volunteer with either a national or regional brain bee, so I’m going to try to do that.  I will almost definitely take some language classes so I can get better in the native language (I can understand it, but I can’t read/write it at all).  Lastly, I’m leaning towards getting some kind of part-time job since I couldn’t get one here in the US, I’d like to have my own money (no allowance because my parents buy me whatever I need, but I’d like to be more independent now haha), and I will have a high school diploma (so theoretically I’ll be  more employable? Although I’m not sure how well it’ll work since a) language barriers and b) I’m 16 since I skipped a grade earlier and c) getting a part-time job isn’t really a thing there) 


So, here are my questions: 


— Should I still apply to the same universities? I know I’m aiming really high, and my app will be a fraction of how good it would be if I stayed here, BUT this also gives me a pretty solid essay idea and makes me unique.  Plus, I could hopefully do a couple more ECs within those couple months! 

— What kind of stuff should I focus on doing when I get to India? I’ll definitely have to do college apps (I had started before, but right now I’ve gotta focus on those online classes haha), so that’ll take up some time, but there’s just so much that I could do and I’m honestly sorta confused by it all.  I like being busy and I don’t get stressed very easily, so it’d be fine if I chose a couple of things, but obviously I can’t do them all!  Is there anything in particular you guys think I should focus on? 


Thank you so much, I really appreciate your advice (:

98dvhi,6,2018-08-18,CSE Masters Program,Ronin_Runner,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/98dvhi/cse_masters_program/,"I was wondering if anyone had experience going to UCSD and then doing the Masters program, but not the 5 year BS/MS or even a program elsewhere. I was wondering if it is possible to take grad courses in undergrad and later count them toward your graduate degree? Also, how much extra would an undergrad have to prepare for grad courses?


My current situation is that as a Math-CS major I can nearly graduate a year early, but not quite. Even with a minor I can graduate a quarter or two early. This leaves me with trying to take other undergraduate CS courses to stretch out my graduation, but it may be difficult/impossible for me to get these courses. Another option is that I start taking grad courses, but I would want them to count for something and not block any future options. A third option is that I graduate 2 quarters early and intern or go full time or something? The last and worst option is that I attempt to rush a three graduation, though there is no guarantee I can get the classes I need. However, I also probably wouldn’t be able to go to grad school immediately after anyways.

Any experience or advice is appreciated, thanks!

98ejin,3,2018-08-18,Building a new lifestyle and fighting depression after graduating college,corehazard,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/98ejin/building_a_new_lifestyle_and_fighting_depression/,"Since I graduated from ECU this May with B.S. in IT, my depression levels have skyrockted, particularly on weekends. Nearly all of my high quality friends live in Greenville. The only high quality friend that I have near Charlotte works on weekends.  I do have some very good family friends in the Charlotte area (all of them are married and have kids), I occasionally go over to one of their places to get better at cooking and have company.  I've eaten much more junk food since I left campus.   


I lived in a college dorm room or a student apartment complex right next to campus for most of the past three years, the only exception was when I was when working an internship in Raleigh from June 2016 to December 2016.  Being on campus, I nearly always had someone that I could talk to. If having conversations with people you don't know is like building something, on campus I felt like I was working with a template, much of the time.    


During the internship I was lonely and depressed. An important factor in this was that I was simply not ready to work a full time position while living on my own, not to mention that the company culture being toxic for me.  Thankfully at my current position (a network engineer in Charlotte), the company culture is good for me as my supervisors and co-workers are much more friendly and helpful.  All of them are much older than me and married with kids.  There is one other young network engineer on a different team that I see regularly.  However for the interests of maintaining a professional relationship, it  would be good to avoid becoming close friends.  My best bet is to ask my supervisor about any social events.   


How would I meet people in the Charlotte area that are close in age to me and not into drinking and partying? Bars and nightclubs are not an option for me. Talking to other students was easier, since I was in the same/similar phase of life and I had many things in common in them, while being very different (this applies to all majors).  What are some good and easy hobbies to pick up?  On the bright side of things, I will be seeing a few friends in Greenville in the three weeks and I do swim four to five times a week. If anyone here was in a same/similar to boat as I'm in; what organizations or hobbies did you get involved in or develop after you graduated college?  How did you fight depression?  In addition, I have Autism.  Thankfully I'm very high functioning and my current employer is highly understanding and accepting of it.   
I went to Aspergers meetups before and nearly everyone there showed many symptoms that I don't and or was lower functioning.  I have an acquaintance in Charlotte who has ASD, she is four years younger.   


Side note:   
Both of my parents are deceased. My dad died from cancer three years ago (right before I went to ECU) and my mom committed suicide in August last year. The same friend that tried to save my mom with me last year (he drove me from Greenville to Charlotte) has been ghosting me  over the past month or so (does not respond to my calls or texts), he told me that his depression is very high largely due to his business failing , side effects of medicine he's taking for narcolepsy (it worsened significantly in the past few months), and his roommate's Chron's disease worsening.

Back in my home country, companies usually conducted on-campus interviews. Their initial screening process only focused on GPA, and not academic/side projects or internships.

I've been advised to start looking for internships ASAP after the commencement of the course and try to get in touch with recruiters.

LinkedIn seems to be the best bet for the job, but I am not sure if a connection request (with a brief introduction message) would help. Could anyone provide me any insight on this? Are there other ways (apart from career fairs/ hackathons/networking events) of doing so?

This house is in a busy beach town and it’s about 3.5 hours away from where anyone I’ve invited so far lives.  When I say it’s a good offer, I only have to pay the cleaning fee on a nice condo that has three floors of bedrooms, multiple decks, a pool, and beach access.  Understandably I only came into this deal a week ago so it’s very short notice for a vacation but from what I know about who I invited there aren’t any major plans going on so it feels like I’m only getting turned down because these people aren’t as cool with me as I thought.  I have two primary groups of friends, friends from home and friends from school, i also have a girlfriend but we’re currently not on the best of terms right now. I have not really been around for most of the summer because of my internship which gave me early mornings and late nights five days a week for over two months so of course I miss all of these people.  For this entirely huge house only three of my friends from home said yes to going, none of my friends from school bothered to answer me, and my girlfriend says she’s unsure even after I gave her the opportunity to invite her friends because there’s that much space.  Am I being dramatic thinking that, because only 3 of the 20 something invites I’ve given came back as yes, it’s because these people don’t like me as much as I thought?"

On the one hand I have a more robotics oriented internship to gather data, language unknown but I am assuming low level C/C++. On the other hand I have a computer vision internship to follow which will be done in python. I'm thinking I should go the C/C++ way to learn more about embedded systems.

I am not sure about the exact details of the C/C++ internship though, since I will have my visit monday. It's about reading data using IoT. They have not specified the language, but I am assuming C/C++.

The python internship place I have visited, it's a cool place with what seems to be a great team.

I'm applying to a couple schools (CSUF, CSULB...) for an MS in Computer Science/Engineering and I am writing my statement of purpose. Something that really rings true in me right now is that I had a rough time in my undergrad. I did my best in school, but thinking back I think I could have worked harder. I didn't work, I didn't do any internships. I never thought I was ready for an internship. No matter what people told me, I thought I would inconvenience people out there. I didn't really have a mentor to tell me what was wrong with my mentality. I see the flaws I had now and I regret it. I couldn't find work for a year after graduating. I study at home all the time to learn as much as I can.

Eventually, I concluded that this isn't how I like to learn. The way I'm studying isn't as effective. I like structure, I like to learn along side other people. Sure I could probably do a boot camp, but I actually have interests in possibly working with some professors for a research position or a lab position. I would like to really change how I had treated my life before. I never had hardships before. After struggling for a while... I definitely see how I took things for granted.

Should I write my Statement of Purpose in this point of view?

OR

Should I just explain my interests in the programs, etc. ?"

Will it be really hard for me to get into JP Morgan/Goldman Sach? My GPA is a 3.7 but I only was as a research CS intern at NYU and an intern at a small start up. Dont got big company exp :/.

My friend who interned this summer and got a return offer refered me to JP Morgan. And Goldman Sachs sent me a hacerrank problem the day after I applied and I got all the test cases correct on both questions (not too bad) with 15-20 minutes to spare after I submitted.

If I can't get into them, will it be really hard for me to get a 80 or maybe even 90k job (before taxes)at NYC if I don't slack. I did around 40-50 Leetcode questions (Medium and Easy), and I am planning to study CTCI, prepare what to talk about in my resume, and brush up some general CS knowledge.

98fts7,1301,2018-08-18,I am Death’s Assistant.,digweg,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/98fts7/i_am_deaths_assistant/,"Okay, assistant may be too much. Let’s say I’m more of an un-paid intern, no where near the top of the hierarchy. 

I’ve actually only met the man himself once, apparently he’s pretty introverted. I don’t blame him; if your main job was to end thousands of people’s lives a day, you’d be kinda grumpy too.

You see, regardless of what people might say, being Death is a lot of work. Way to much work for one eternal demon. So in order to lighten the load, he hires assistants (or un-paid interns, such as myself). There are thousands, hell, maybe even millions of us.

I’m doing my job right now. Sitting in a restaurant, with my notepad. 

I’m wearing a pretty inconspicuous outfit, as to not draw attention to myself. A Hawaiian shirt, blue jeans, and aviator sunglasses. Kinda stylish if you ask me.

My eyes dart around the crowded Burger King, eyeing every soul inside. Pretty easy place to find people for my job, the more people, the better.

Oh, my job. Almost forgot. As I mentioned, Death is a busy eternal being. My job, is to notice what people are doing, all around, wherever I am, I watch. If these people are doing something that could result in death somehow, for example, riding a Segway (god those are dangerous machines), I write it in my somewhat-magical notebook. The higher ups then take a look at my entry immediately after I write it (please don’t ask me how the science works out. I my self have no clue). If they deem the action “Death-Worthy” then they send someone, to, you know, see the death through. It all happens pretty instantly. 

I click my pen as I spot one.

*#1. Man walking on slippery tile.* 

The middle aged, balding man was ignorant of the “Caution, Wet Floor” sign, as he made his way to the bathroom. I braced myself for what could happen next. This part always makes me nervous. I don’t like watching these people die, it really pains me. But it is my job.

In the last moments, he notices the sign and navigates around it. Safely heading towards the bathroom.

Phew.

I hurriedly go back to looking around. Scanning the crowded Burger King. 

Aha, another one. I clicked my pen.

*#2 Worker dealing with scalding hot fryer oil.*

I wait, and watch the kitchen, expecting the poor soul working the fryer to spontaneously combust, or get doused in the boiling oil, or potentially fall in and suffer the same fate as the fries.

However, lucky for all of us, she takes the basket of fries out, shakes off the excess oil, and moves away from the fryer and in turn the risk.

Another sigh of relief.

I guess there’s a lot of reasons I don’t like watching people die. It reminds me a lot of what happened to me.

I click my pen again. This one was outside.

*#3 Potential J-Walker.*

I watched out of the big Burger King front  window, as this man attempted to cross the street, against the light. Not uncommon in my city, although it’s always potentially dangerous. 

I waited for the imminent screeching of breaks, and the painful thud of a collision. 

Lucky again. He makes a quick dash across the street, and continues his stroll through the city.

I guess I got pretty lucky to get this job. Most don’t get the opportunity, but after the crash, that’s when he came to me.

It wasn’t his fault. The big 18 wheeler’s brakes stopped working. Poor soul couldn’t stop the truck as it barreled down the road. He had to choose between hitting into a school bus, or my Prius.

I was in the hospital, in and out of conciseness for two weeks. Really close to dying at some points, others I was dreaming, or hallucinating. But one period, I remember clearly. I might have been awake, but I was probably out cold. Than I saw him. He was standing in the corner of the small hospital room.

But instead of taking me, he made a bargain. He never really spoke, but somehow I knew what he was saying. Telepathy? Maybe. I might have mistook the ordeal with him for another hallucination, but something about it felt real.

The accident should have been fatal. Every doctor in the hospital told me that. Death didn’t take me that day, he allowed me to go back to my family, but I was in his debt for the rest of my life. When I woke up, finally, there was a notebook and a pen besides my bed.

And here I am now, in a Burger King with a magical notebook.

My eyes once again go person to person, watching everything, seeing if anyone is taking a potentially fatal risks. Than I spot him.

I click my pen.

*#4 Morbidly Obese Man Devouring a Double Whopper.*

My eyes are drawn to this man, in a blue collared shirt and a sports jacket, the buttons from the shirt ready to pop off under the slightest more stress. He has to be at least 400 pounds, yet here he is, devouring a double whopper.

He finishes his food pretty quickly, taking a long sip of his soda. After the soda, he begins licking his fingers. A look of accomplishment streams across his face. 

He stands up, ready to leave, but is halted by some other force. For a few moments, he stands in his spot, his look of accomplishment changes to something else.

A hand darts to his chest, as a look of pain flashes across his face. His legs begin to quiver. He makes a deep gurgling sound, before falling over, all across the table.

The commotion draws the attention of most people in the Burger King, staff included. They run over with the defibrillator. A boisterous crowd has now gathered around the man.

I don’t like staying around much long after it happens, as I mentioned I don’t like seeing these people die. So I myself stand up, and walk towards the door, pocketing my pen and notebook. 

The sirens wail through the air as I casually walk further and further away from the Burger King. 

Call it a blessing or a curse, but it is my job.

Death’s un-paid intern."

I start my next internship in about 2 weeks from now and they use quite a few different things that I'm unfamiliar with. In particular:

* PHP
* JavaScript
* MySQL
* Version control (Mercurial)
* Unit/Integration testing

Of those 5 tools, I've used JavaScript in the past and also used SQL in the past (not MySQL in particular though). I have no experience using PHP and I also don't know much about version control and unit/integration testing. I have a few hours after work everyday that I can spare to prepare for my next internship, but I was just wondering what would be the best way to do this. I have 2 options that I'm considering:

1. Go through some tutorials that use PHP + MySQL together. ([this one](https://ilovephp.jondh.me.uk/en/tutorial/make-your-own-blog) or [this one](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/php-tutorial/php-mysql-crud-application.php))
2. Go through a web-development book that uses Python + JavaScript + a NoSQL database, and also teaches version control and unit/integration testing. ([this one](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/))


The Python book doesn't use PHP or MySQL, but I'm a lot more familiar with Python and I think that I will learn more about web-development fundamentals with that book compared to the PHP tutorials. The PHP tutorials are also more about using PHP with MySQL and don't contain any JavaScript at all, so I don't know how useful they'll be in my case. At this point, I'm leaning towards going through the Python book, but it would be nice to get another opinion on what I should follow through with. Thanks for taking the time to read!"

I was being bullied at work by someond who tangientally worked with me and has an office located not far at all from where I work. Past few month have been hell. To top it all of, a guy who also tangientally working with me, sexually harassed me. I complained to HR about the former, with a belief that reporting the sexual harassement would probably get me immediately fired. My suspiscions were not far off, because I ended becoming the center of the investigation and ended up loosing some secondary job duties. I am essentially being blamed for the bullying on paper. 

The victim blaming and experience was causing me so much stress that I ended up becoming pretty ill on various occassions. With waivering support from my supervisor, I realized I probably needed to leave. Well, I found a job that even paid more. Got offered the job, accepted, sent out two weeks notice. Then things started seeming off. It was taking a while to receive an official offer letter/contract. When the president finally did follow up, they asked whether I wanted to be full time or contract. They seemed upset that I said full time. They also implied they'd send me work before I start. The gut feeling led me to the internet. Usually, I read reviews about a company before accepting an offer. Like an idiot, I didn't this time, an it turns out, the president has been said to have regular temper tantrums and is described as a tyrannt. These reviews have been consistent and confirmed as ""helpful"" by at least 7 others, and I don't think it's a company of more than 15. I'm panicking. I can't go to a more toxic workplace. It just might break me.

What do I do??? I acted rash. I can see if my boss will allow me to rescind my offer. She has always, for the most part, recognized my contributions, but I'm afraid it won't be accepted. I feel like my resignation may have caused a rif. Plus the HR complaint don't help. I could see if the reviews are true, but then I will have to be looking for work while being in that environment. I'd have to give a resignation to that person, and would not reflect well on my resume. Please, any sound advice would help. My anxiety is over the roof and I can barely sleep. 

I live in far to expensive of a city while far too little support for this situation."
98gn1z,40,2018-08-18,how do i attend physically classes? (complicated situation),unfortunate_commuter,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/98gn1z/how_do_i_attend_physically_classes_complicated/,"hey everyone

i just realized the title was worded wrong, i meant to say ""how do i physically attend classes?""

im a commuter that lives with my parents and last semester, i was facing issues of depression and anxiety impacting my everyday performance in academics, social life, work, physical appearance, internship opportunities, etc to the point that i ended up having to go to the hospital emergency room and therapy so in the end, i had to be excused to make up classes by a dean's approval

these were all due to personal family issues going on at home with parents who would constantly threaten not to pay my tuition as a part of their overall mentally abusive ways so this summer i have been trying to fill a financial aid petition for dependency override as a way for me to declare myself independent from my parents thus able to not risk relying on my parents to get my college paid since they could cut it off anytime they want and receive financial aid based on my personal need rather than family personal need to help me opt in for emergency housing so i could flee the abusive house that they refuse to have me leave to live on campus for (several occasions i would try to find ways to live on campus but my attempts were useless because loans would need to be cosigned by them since im not independent from them) and help me be financially secure knowing i can still be able to attend university

the petition for dependency override needed 3 letters

1. my own personal letter with detailed personal knowledge of my situation
2. a letter from a relative/friend/ neighbor/etc who has detailed personal knowledge of my situation and can verify my circumstance
3. a letter with an official letterhead from a community member who has detailed personal knowledge of my situation and can verify my circumstance (ex: minister, high school guidance counselor, etc)

fortunately, i wrote my own letter and was able to get the letter from my close friend who was the only friend that knew what was going on but I had such a hard time getting the letter from a community member; the only community members who has detailed personal knowledge of my situation and can verify my circumstances were my therapist over at rutgers behavior health center, caps, the 2 deans i talked to, the emergency room doctor who had me as his patient and created the medical documentation, and my primary doctor

when i tell you nobody was willing to help write that 3rd letter, i mean NOBODY even tho they knew what was going on, was desperately asking them politely, and offered to draft the letter myself to save them the work and just sign it as long as they consented to what i wrote on their behalf in the letter

my therapist said he wasn’t ""comfortable"" writing a letter because he didn’t feel like he saw me enough times to confidently write one and that rutgers behavior health center wouldn’t allow to write those types of letter, caps said they were only allowed to write doctors notes for students visiting to see whichever person they saw to help them out at whatever date and time that student came in but nothing more, and my 2 deans couldn’t because they said it conflicted with their roles as academic advisers

essentially i found out that rutgers affiliated staff/faculty werent allowed to write these type of letters for students unfortunately so i contacted the emergency room doctor since he wasnt rutgers affiliated but he essentially said the same thing caps said and that this would be something my primary doctor would take care of

i contacted my primary doctor as my last chance of hope and making sure she knew that in attempts to get this letter done and although she has not personally known what was going on since i haven't seen her about it, all medical documentation had to be retraced to the primary doctor and i made sure to bring the copies of medical documentation i had as proof but she refused to write the letter because she believed it was ""purgery"" somehow even tho it wasnt since i had medical documentation as proof and no one else had that problem she was claiming.......

she said it was ""purgery"" only for me to find out that she was telling my parents when they visited her the last time about what i was doing and that i was doing with ""stupid""; both her and my therapist are the same ethnic group as my parents raised under the same cultural upbringing that the way parents treat their children is normal where theyre from but not normal in the usa so there was definitely bias as to why she refused to write that letter which was unfair

now dont get me wrong, i havent been doing this at the last minute, i ve been doing this petition for financial dependency override paperwork ever since the beginning of july since this was due by aug 16th but it got to be so time consuming to the point that it went past the due date bc of calling to see when everyone was available or waiting for email replies and the time i had to wait between for the ppl i was asking for to write the letter whether or not they were able to and the amount of ppl i had to ask since no one was helping me, it just sucks how even when i did this ahead of time, i get screwed over and still have no help

its almost like no one cared enough to make time to talk to me or get back to me for the letter at that moment when i really needed someone, i did my part and everything i possibly could but no one was willing to do the same for me when this is the only time i go to ask for help 

everyone is basically telling me to deal with my parents for this one last year until i graduate but they do not understand as they would need to live in the house and experience the same things i have experienced that my parents have done to me to know, i dont understand how they can just say to deal with them when they have no experience as to what its even like to deal with them

they also do not understand that i have held back for so long trying to deal with them ever since college because i  was ultimately afraid it would get in the way of classes and i did care about my classes first so i would always try to sacrifice my well-being by dealing with it but i cant anymore, it just came to a point at which it got in the way of my normal life and wasnt able to live my normal life as i wanted to so if i deal with them this last year, i risk having the same shit that happened last semester happening to me all over again and if it happens again, i wont be able to graduate so i can't risk anything at this point since everything would drastically change for the worst as i would drop out of college altogether and not be able to finish the last year that i have left, get kicked out of the house not being able to afford shit with a minimum wage job, and having to be a fucking stripper so i can not be on the streets

my parents mentally abuse me with the punishments they decide to have me face whenever they want, even if i dont do anything and want to take it out on me:

1. they curse me out
2. take my phone away
3. go through my phone
4. cancel my phone service
5. change the wifi password
6. broke my school laptop stored with important shit like essays/projects/homework/assignments i cant recover and would have to start over
7. locate me on family maps
8. lock me out the house and kick me out the house in freezing weather only for me to end up sleeping in the car with the heat blasted on only for me to wake up sick the next morning
9. take my wallet filled with IDs and money away or anything that i paid for with my own money away from me
10. take the car keys away
11. take the license plates off the car just in case i have spare car keys somewhere since i could get stopped for driving without them because its illegal to drive without license plates
12. threaten to call the cops on me for stealing their car when i have the spare keys to one of the other cars besides the one i usually use to go to class or work
13. uber/lyft to wherever i am with the spare car keys of the other car i dont usually use but took since the car keys to the original one i use is taken away only for them to take the car away and leave me of having no way of getting back home

im sorry but i really cant deal with this bullshit anymore and if anyone had to go through what i do, they wouldnt be able to just ""deal with their parents"" either but fortunately, i have learned how to deal with almost everything except for the car; i need to go to class or go to work and if i dont then i wont pass my classes and i will get fired from my job (which has allowed me to deal with their punishments by buying my own stuff like my own secret phone with an individual plan and secret laptop), and i wont be able to travel for a possible internship if i get one during the semester

**my parents dont give a fuck, they want me to suffer and have control over me so i need to have my own mode of transportation that i rightfully own so that way if my parents try to take the car away, then it would be illegal for them to do so but i cant afford a car alone now with my minimum wage and i still need to pay for gas, maintenance, insurance, etc that again i cant afford with minimum wage, nj doesnt have public transit the way nyc does so you can barely get around without having a car, and i had thought about paying for uber/lyft but i go out to class and work almost everyday that i wouldnt be able to afford it either......so how the fuck do i go to school so i can graduate to earn money to move out if my parents arent even letting me go to school and no one is helping me be independent for financial aid so i can go to school????????????**

my fall semester is going to start soon and i can't allow these problems at home to get in the way of my education, career, and essentially my future, but i dont know what else to fucking do anymore and im just losing hope"

So I’m a rising sophomore studying comp sci. I’m going to try and look for some internships next year. I’m really fascinated by the field of computer vision and especially its applications in autonomous vehicles, but I don’t get to take computer vision courses until third year. 

For the sake of being employable and being able to work on meaningful projects I decided to learn web development over this summer. I focused on the MERN stack and managed to put together somewhat decent projects; I also got a web dev stint with a lab so that was good learning experience. Now I don’t hate web dev, in fact I kind of enjoy it, but I don’t want to narrow myself into a web dev corner. 

If I focus on web development for now and manage to secure a decent fullstack internship next year does that allow me to still pursue other fields of computer science in the future, or am I better off trying to self learn some of the advanced computer vision/deep learning concepts even though they might not result in practical skills for now.

Thank you."
98hvvw,4,2018-08-19,Sometimes even paid internships are bullshit,ResesDougnut,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/98hvvw/sometimes_even_paid_internships_are_bullshit/,"This is just something I had to get off my chest because it has been bothering me for months.

Last year, I was hired as a programming intern at a company who's name I won't mention and I will not mention the programming language either. I was made to believe that I was in for a great start to my programming career. The first few months went by great and I felt like I was on top of the world. Two months into my internship, I was offered a part time job doing technical work.... not programming. Since I only had an associate degree, I was not allowed to be an official developer. I admit, it took awhile to get use to the language, but I was never given any projects that  stimulated my mind and since everyone had to do their own jobs, I was pretty much on my own. There were not a lot of online resources for this particular language either.  It wouldn't have made a difference anyway because ""muh bachelor's degrees!"" Anyhow, you wouldn't think I'd be okay with just being offered a part time job and as tech support... not a developer, but I was fine with it. However, a week later I was told that the internship would be extended..... for a vague ""amount of time""..... 

Forward to 6 months later! Still an intern!  I spent 6 months naively telling myself that I was not being taken advantage of as cheap labor until one day, I visited my college adviser who also managed the internship program at my school. I told him that ""I am still at \[Fill in the blank\]"" and he said ""great! so you're an official employee now?"" and I responded ""no, I am still an intern..."" There was silence... My adviser then proceeded to red pill me... It was at that point when I awoke from my slumber... I was pissed. I realized that they were just keeping me there as long as possible so I could do the tasks that nobody else wanted to do for a fraction of the cost. For the next week or so, I went into work with a temper, but did not show it. I could have quit, but I didn't want to go back to my old job. I wanted to find another entry level programming job. This meant I would have to now take advantage of them... Which I gladly did.

 I had a lot of down time at this internship, so I spent many hours working on my JavaScript and C# skills. As I said before, the tasks I was given as a programmer were not very hard.. you could even say they were humiliatingly easy. It was because of this and the fact that I hadn't messed around with other languages in almost a year, that I had to spend a lot of time refreshing my memory on algorithms, data, and all that jazz. I was racing against the clock... all the while pretending that I didn't resent my boss or any of the higher ups. I knew that any day, they were going to call me to their office to let me know I am no longer needed. I heard them through the walls talking about me frequently. A year had passed since I started interning..... **Finally**, I got a call to come to the office... ***""Are they going to give me that tech job?""***  ""NOPE!"" ""We are afraid we are going to have to terminate your internship."" And that was that. Not wanting to go back to my previous job, I decided to turn my back on programming all together and work in a blue collar field... the third day of my blue collar job, I said ""fuck this"" It's time find a programming job.

What did I get out of the internship? Not a job, decent skills in a programming language that three people use, but the most important thing I gained, is that I will never fall for any shenanigans and bullshit employers throw at me.  Many employers will tell you that you're great one second and stab you in the back the next. 

If you decide to intern. Research! Avoid having your time and energy wasted!!"

My reasons are that I know by first hand how bad it's the job market (low wages, shitty working hours and bad work ambient), how hard it's to live in the capital (trash public transport, expensive rents, etc.) and I been living in a toxic household since I remember. I'm basically looking for countries (english speaking preferential but open to learn other languages) where I could live in better conditions socially, culturally and -at least- get a decent paid job/internship that allows me to pay rent or a house, as I said, I'm about to finish my degree and I'll just have my practice left (7 month-ish left).

I was wondering also if they're like inmigrant-friendly internships or programmes to students directly from other countries as locally they aren't avaliable for people like me (degree, economic status).

Thanks for the help!"

All was nice and cool, until I realized I didn’t know squat about managing people. I took a step back and re-evaluated everything.

I think I’m making progress, however, there’s one area I’m still not comfortable with: micromanaging. I’m not against giving people autonomy to do their job, what I don’t like is to give others autonomy until I know they are ready.

- In some cases, team members just don’t care about “improving” their skills, so they remain at a low skill level and yet don’t want to be told how to do their job. If I have to guarantee productivity and high quality on the job, this makes it very hard.

- Another issue is organization. In some instances, I know timelines are tight, so I set down tasks, schedule activites and assign them to my team. And they not always take it well. Too much of this makes them feel “they have to do what I want all the time”. But how can I organize work if I don’t do this?

- code quality: sometimes I code review their code, and whenever I ask them to correct something giving them a logical explanation, their reaction is not always good. Interns don’t complain, but seniors get angry that “they have to write code the way I want”.

It's not quite what I want to be doing forever, but it's a nice job, the staff are great and the pay is good.

I was on a paid internship contract up until May. At the end of that contract, I had another paid internship lined up. I was pretty set on going but then I started to have doubts and I was offered a permanent contract on very good pay and conditions. After a period of major indecision, stress, and anxiety (it was pretty bad) I accepted. I've been working a away for three months now and I'm happy.

During the period of indecision, I had let it be known I had a PhD place to start at the end of the second internship (January '19). My colleagues know that acaedmia is my real passion and where I eventually want to end up working so that's fine.

Here is where the problem arises, during the summer - after I had the permanent contract - my PhD supervisor told me he was going on sabbatical in January and that I ought to start in Oct so as to get proper guidance at the very beginning of my studies.

Now I'm in a bind, I had told myself that I owed my current company 5-6 months of firm commitment on my new contract before I left. Unfortunately, the most I can give without compromising my long-term career path in academia is 4 months.

I really don't want to leave my job on bad terms. I'm aware I probably haven't handled this in the most proffessional way but I honeslty hadn't expected to get as many offers come at once. Nor did I expect the circumstances around my PhD to change as they have. I want to leave on as a good of terms as I can, I think the work I have provided up to date has been of high standard and my employer is very happy with me. I would hate to see that sullied my the way these events have worked themselves out. What's the best way to broach this? I'm aware its a complicated set of circumstances and I want to at least convey the fact I've been trying to act in good faith throughout."

Recently graduated school in another city not far from Toronto for audio engineering. I’ve been told all the work for post-production is in Toronto and thus that’s the place I should be. HOWEVER few of these jobs actually hire right away and theirs a whole internship process which is usually unpaid.. and those that do pay are about 18k/year.

I need professional advice. Should I move somewhere else first and get a shitty part time job and save up while practicing my skills on the side and THEN move to Toronto? Or should I risk it move to Toronto and pray to god I can somehow pay rent and also find a shitty part time job to pay my share of the bills. 

I hope this makes sense, im quite young and this sort of feels like a mid-life crisis because I feel I should be doing something with my schooling and theirs what feels like a ton of social pressure to do so but financially I’m nervous and life is intense out there... someone please help "

This work usually comes from freelancing, I use Upwork sometimes. My github has 20 public projects (more private), have personal projects and live demos for viewing. Experience working in teams , leading teams, agile/scrum, building projects from the ground up. I work with a lot of Vuejs , Angular, Nodejs, mongo and sql. Yet can't seem to get a more steady job. Freelancing is nice but it hasn't fully picked up yet so i'm leaving it on the side for now.

Is my resume just trash or is it something else?

As I'm still doing classes on only available whole day Tuesday, Thursday, Friday in office, but monday wednesday remote, do you think I should apply to only internships (already had 2 internships 1 paid 1 unpaid)?

I have graduated with a Computer Engineering degree in May and while I was initially applying for software engineering jobs, I decided that I liked Control systems better. I have had a short internship with a nuclear company over the last summer where I have worked on an HMI system to control the nuclear units, and I loved the kind of work I was doing. 

I have been applying for Control Engineering Jobs for over a month and I haven't heard back from a single company :( I do not see any Junior/Entry level positions at all and almost all of them require about 5 years of experience, I also noticed that they mainly look for electrical engineers not computer.

How hard do you guys think it will be for me to get into this field with only 3 months of internship experience? I would appreciate any advice especially from those in the field. Thank you !"

I have about 1 year of experience under my belt post-grad, in addition to 2.5 years of sparse freelance experience, and 3 internships. One of those internships lasted 18 months. 

I'm in the market for a new position but I'm not really interested in another 'associate' level. I don't find it challenging whatsoever, and I feel I'm ready for more responsibility. A few months ago, I made it to the final round for a senior level position, with the idea that I would start at staff level with a promotion into senior following a year of proved employment. 

I didn't get that position due to scheduling conflicts but I'm hoping to use a similar tactic for my current job hunt. This is also because I can only find senior level openings within my field.

Any advice for approaching potential employers for senior level positions? Should I cover my desire for more responsibility in my cover letter?

Thanks!

I graduated last year and since then I’ve worked in two advertising agencies. I’ve been a social media intern and currently a production assistant. I have a strong background in the film industry and 4 year marketing degree with Sales Certificate.  

In college I worked at a boutique and I moved from the retail sales floor to the the “corporate office” as marketing coordinator. I was there two years but I made directed &amp; produced a lookbook video that got over 12K views, photo shoots one a week, and made all the content. Two years ago  I had some momentum &amp; a lot of passion. Thought advertising was were I needed to be! 

Flash forward 2 years, I’ve got the Ad Job: I’ve gained 20+ pounds. I work 50+ hours a week on salary. The company interviewed me as a PA and then their receptionist quit a few days before I joined the team. So now I sit at that desk and do admin on top of my project management responsibilities. Every day I am told  to work faster and harder but that I’m doing a great job. I make thousand dollar estimates for clients and run the implementation of massive brand campaigns.... and I get asked to buy the owners lunch and pick rug samples for their home while on deadlines. I’m putting in my two weeks in a week. Job or no job. I want to take my life and creativity back. 

What I know so far:

1) I want to be freelance or remote 

2) I have no idea which direction to move but I’m good at producing, creating social/digital content, research, tech savvy, budgets, finding vendors, event planning 

3) I want to travel

4) I need to figure out a way to supplement my income even if it’s temporary 

My intention is not for this to seem like a sob story. It is a desperate attempt to connect with others who have been through this and reach out because I want a better lifestyle. Hoping I can lay out the details and get some ideas on my next steps.

98m89n,3,2018-08-19,Equity split case: it's complicated,blechie,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/98m89n/equity_split_case_its_complicated/,"Often you vest shares over 4+ years, with a 1 year cliff starting when someone joins full-time. But what if ""full-time"" is relative, work hours differ ever-so-slightly, and side-hustle co-founders play an important role in acquiring some of the seed funding?

Here's the story: Co-founders A and B started the company several years before co-founder C joins the team. A number of interns and freelancers (and another cofounder) helped along the way. Co-founders A and B worked full-time on the venture for most of this time. The team acquired a $20,000 grant and validated the market with first revenue (albeit not a full-blown launch) before co-founder C got involved.

Co-founder C, a student, helped the team secure an additional $90,000 grant before joining the team for a summer, and plans to join full-time in another year.

Co-founders A and B spend most weekends in the office and work hours tend to total 70+ hrs/week, while co-founder C worked around 50+ hrs/week while helping full-time this summer. 

How would you navigate equity and vesting in this case?

EDIT: 

What changes (%) would you make to an equity split to reflect that earlier co-founders bear the technical and market risk, while one co-founder joins when there is funding and recurring revenue?

What changes (%) would you make to an equity split and/or vesting schedule to reflect that someone who joins later contributed to fundraising before joining full-time?"

I am a 17-year-old white male Senior from Florida.  I come from a middle-class two-parent household. I go to a small public high school that is pretty academically successful (1st in Florida depending on year and source). I plan on majoring in computer science and I am trying to decide on apply to stanford, princeton, yale, MIT, and U Chicago (I know it's not actually HYPSM). I will of course also be applying to a couple in state schools as well. I know these schools have a varity of ED and REA options, so I'm wondering if anybody knows which school would give me the best chances? Also I'm mostly only interested in these schools because as far as I can tell these schools offer the best financial aid, and I am trying to minimize the costs. I know my chances aren't going to be great, and it's okay if I end up going in state, but I'd like to try to get in to one of these schools.

&amp;nbsp;

**School Academics**:

GPA W: 4.6 GPA UW: 4.0

I've taken the most rigorous course load available to me each year.

This year, I am taking AP Computer Science Principles, AP Physics 2, AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism, AP Physics C: Mechanics, AP Literature, AP Calculus BC, and AP Capstone Research.

35 ACT on my first try. (34E 34M 36R 35S)

1580 SAT on my second try (790 Math, 790 Reading and writing)


&amp;nbsp;

**Extracurriculars**:

-Volunteered for 175+ hours from grade 9-12 at a place that teaches kids ages 8-18 basic programming topics.

98nx6b,1,2018-08-19,"Just out of school, looking for tech job, 36... How far back should my work experience on resume go?",dwb122,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/98nx6b/just_out_of_school_looking_for_tech_job_36_how/,"I just finished an EET degree and am looking for a job in this field. I don't have the formatting/etc of the resume down yet but I'm outlining it and trying to figure out what I even need to include. I already have a BA that I received in 2005. I did an IT internship a couple summers in 2000 and 2001. After I graduated I worked for my father's small failing computer repair/backup/whatever business for a few years (sometimes part time, sometimes full time). I did some temp jobs in 2007 until I got my first 'real' full-time job in 2008 at a bank that I held for over seven years until I quit and got a temp job that I held for a few months until I went back to school.

I'm wondering what I should include on my resume up until I got my job at the bank. I did very well in school (3.95 GPA, lots of activities, part time student employee job doing tech stuff) and those 2.5 years of school comprise anything that'll be relevant to any job I'll be applying to and can easily take up half my resume. My IT internship and job at my father's business obviously seem more relevant than my bank job, but the internship was almost 20 years ago now and the work I did for my father's business was a joke and I'd honestly rather not be asked about it. Would it seem weird if I didn't include anything before my bank job in 2008 and don't mention what year I got my BA, and was then asked about those years in an interview? Ideally I'd like to include all my work going back that IT internship but I feel it'll just leave less room for the kind of stuff employers at tech jobs will really be interested in from someone fresh out of tech school- recent, relevant stuff.

Also asking because I've read that mentioning the year you received your college degree, if not recent, can hurt more than help you.

tldr:

36, just out of tech school, earned a BA in 2005, no work experience prior to tech school that is relevant (or too far back) to what I'm applying for. Should I leave off anything prior to my first long-term full-time job that I got ten years ago?"

98pur5,1,2018-08-19,I feel like I might be a narcissist after how I've treated a suicidal friend.,15yrThrowaway,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/98pur5/i_feel_like_i_might_be_a_narcissist_after_how_ive/,"Right now I'm just beginning my sophomore year and during the Summer I became friends with a girl I'll call Kale. Kale and I before Summer had talked and at one point in time she facetimed me out of the blue and said she felt like she was about to jump off a parking garage. This was the first time I had ever dealt with someone who was somewhat suicidal and over the next few months this escalated further. 

Kale doesn't come from a very dark background and has a from what I know loving mother. She has two therapists, and has been depressed and suicidal before. She has a very loving group of friends to support her whenever she needs them. On a few occasions Kale has almost tried to make people notice her cuts, like wearing really short, shorts and while sitting made them visible. Then complaining that people noticed.

I've dealt with my own stuff like anyone has, but any thoughts I had of self harm or suicide stayed as thoughts and while I thought I might be equipped to help Kale during this time. I wasn't. Throughout Mid-May to this August I've been talking to her several times a week and for a month or two, daily. Since day one I told her anytime she needed me she can call, text, facetime, whatever she needs. Because I'll talk to her for however long it takes to calm down and go to bed. This offer was almost never taken, I would always receive calls after and once during her cuts. 

The cuts continued and over time became more and more frequent once she moved to my school to be with my group of friends. I think a lot of it was anxiety, but I wouldn't be asking for advice if I knew what to make of any of this. Every day or whenever called, I would listen, talk in general, and offer any advice. She refused to get anyone else involved, keep that in mind. She didn't want to hurt anyone else or bring them into this, even her closer girl friends. I was from what I know the only person there.

The stress became insane to me, knowing that I was the only person she had and anytime something happened I felt the weight of it, I've struggled with weight my whole life and over those several months I gained \~30 pounds, and struggled with my internship at a local paper. The gain in weight made me extremely sad and borderline depressed after all the work I lost. But I felt that even if I was hurting at least Kale had someone.

Generally Kale can be a somewhat annoying person in a group of people constantly commentating on everything and trying to relate to stuff. And since she was so depressed I invited her to hangout with my group of friends, which also consisted of a few of hers, so that she would feel uplifted. This was also at the expense of me, her presence caused stress and anxiety seeing her act so normal but so terribly once we were one on one. It just got to me. 

I consider myself pretty empathetic toward people and I understood how she felt, but she made me feel weird, calling me a her 'Favorite therapist' and stuff which was a joke but made me uncomfortable. Around Mid-July it began to be too much, the near daily self loathing, and depressed nature of her made me depressed and I lost a lot of care for my own well being which I'm still struggling to understand why. Her problems make me feel like I can't be sad or anxious about my weight gain, or how I can't be stressed about this responsibility I'm carrying.

Back to where Kale didn't want to talk to anyone about it I always said she can't beat this or feel fulfilled without others. Eventually the stress got to much and I talked about it to my closet friends about how her feelings and my own faults brought back suicidal thoughts and I stressed it wasn't because of her and I would never even come close to acting on them. But I shared what had been going on with her and why I had been acting weird when she was over. I felt like Kale was the only person I could talk to because a significant portion of my stress came from her, but I couldn't tell her that because it would make her worse. 

I told them what she had done and said to me, which from what I remember wasn't explicitly confidential, but I assume was meant to be kept secret. I feel horrible for telling my best friends about it which consists of 5 other guys, and I've told my girl friends who are friends with her that I'm stressed to but I never told the girls the same details. Kale had a crush on me too I found out recently, and she is getting over it. But to me this just makes things even more complicated.

I feel trapped and I shouldn't share any of this with my other friends because I feel like I'm betraying Kales trust even if she didn't specifically say it was a secret. But if I don't share my pain I feel like I'll get worse. I've never had anything like this but my father is a narcissist and I really am scared of becoming like him and my actions in this feel like I'm taking attention away from her.

A few days ago Kale was admitted to a Psychiatric hospital and gets out tomorrow. She's aware I've told the guys but I don't know if she knows how much. I never said super specific details outside of what I've said in this post from what I remember. While I plan to continue helping her because its the right thing to do even if its at the expense of myself, I still don't feel like I can keep going. But if I stopped I would feel responsible for whatever comes after and worry my relationships with the rest of my friends would suffer. I've lost sleep, gained weight, and don't know if I'm making this all about me. But I feel like no matter what I do I'm in the wrong and I don't see an end to the thing with Kale.

Any advice, good or bad please give it. While my closer guy friends were very supportive and understanding I still want others opinions. I can't handle this on my own and the thought of me being a narcissist terrifies me, thanks."

I first realized that I had a gift of sorts when I was 5 years old. For Christmas that year, my grandmother gifted me with a tiny, wriggling ball of black fluff much to the dismay of my parents. I remember the palpable silence and the cold stares cast on my granny before my father finally commented “Well maybe the mutt will keep Morgan out of our hair for a change.”  The curly poodle pup, snuggled warm in my grandfather’s flannel coat, peered at me with chocolate drop eyes and in my head, I plainly heard the words “My name is Sunny. Wanna be friends?” I of course was ecstatic to say the least. Having always loved animals, I finally had a dog to call my own and I could actually communicate with her! It was a dream come true for a lonely little girl like me. Still to this day, I believe Sunny was one of the best teachers I’ve ever known as well as one of the greatest things that ever happened to me during my early childhood. I learned from my four legged friend many things; the customs of different species, how to speak politely to them, the histories of various creatures. Sunny taugHt me more than my selfish, drug addicted parents ever could. She would warn me when she sensed the “angry, hot” scent seeping through the pores of my father, urging me to hide out in the forest surrounding our trailer, before daddy took his frustrations out on me again. Several days before my dad passed from an overdose, Sunny confided in me that his insides reeked like that of rotting wood. On the night my mother, unbeknownst to me at the time, took her own life, my sweet puppy beckoned me into the bedroom closet before warning me to stay put until I heard the voices of my grandparents.


After the deaths of mom and dad, Sunny and I went to live far out in the country with my grandma and grandpa. Life was good. There were horses, cattle, pigs, and a variety of other barnyard animals for me to spend my days conversing with. I also had the privilege of roaming the forest surrounding our farm, chatting with woodland critters such as squirrels and birds. I never worried much about getting caught. My grandparents simply thought I had an active imagination and being an only child, the animals became like siblings to me. As far as I could tell, they never really acknowledged the many times I, in some way or another, foretold the future when it came to our feathEred and furry friends. Looking back now, I assume they were simply too busy keeping the farm up and running and tending to a child that they didn’t bring into this world. Still, they never seemed to question how I knew our Paint mare Delilah would deliver a lethal white foal. They never batted an eye when I pleaded to bring the Muscovy Duck pair inside the barn one night in order to save them from the jaws of a sly red fox. They seemingly never wondered how I knew that my best friend Sunny, far too young and yet riddled with an ugly cancer, would fall asleep in my arms one day and never wake up again. Her untimely death remains a sore spot for me even decades later as I type this to you all now.


Continuing on and many years passed. I grew up and put my special talent to good use. I attended 8 years at university, majoring of course in Veterinary Medicine where I excelled and was always top of my class. I had the animals to thank for that of course. You can learn a lot from textbooks, internships, etc...being able to actually listen as an animal patient cites his or hers symptoms allows for a much quicker and more accurate diagnosis, as you can imagine. After graduation, I worked several years at an already established clinic, paying off student loans, and helping out my elderly grandparents around the farm. Finally in 2009, I opened my very own anImal hospital. By this point, my beloved grandmother had passed on and my grandfather’s health was rapidly declining. He spent the majority of his time in a La-Z Boy in front of the bay window facing our barnyard and subsequently my clinic as well. Sunny Day Animal Hospital, only a large, flat pasture full of rich fescue separating the building from the very home that I grew up in. In January of 2010, my grandpa, sitting in his favorite tattered recliner, was reunited with his dearly missed wife. His final words to me were “I’m proud of you Morgi.”

Time continued its march onward.  I eventually married, had a couple kids, loved my job, and life was good once more . But recently, some things have been happening that I don’t really know how to explain. Writing has never been my forte but I’m going to try my best to deScribe the events of the last several weeks.

It all started with Moe, a friendly spotted mule that had been a member of our family for over a decade. Once upon a time, Moe would be hitched to a rusted antique plow cutting furrows in the soil and turning it over in preparation for the many seeds of my grandfather’s garden. Now though, with arthritic joints and only partial hearing, Moe was simply a pasture ornament easy living like most retirees. While brushing him one morning before the clinic opened up, Moe turned his icy blue eyes towards the clouds and proclaimed “Something bad is coming.” I patted his slightly curved back while prying for more details but mules are often stubborn and in this case, Moe was no exception. Nonetheless, I felt goose pimples rising on my flesh. Out of the thousands of animals I had communicated with throughout my life, not once had I been told an outright lie by any of them. As I forged ahead with my morning routine of caring for the animals around the farm yard, everyone seemed eerily on edge. Priscilla the ever jovial Yorkshire Sow who, instead of devouring her slop per usual, stood idly by the paddock gate. “Something bad is coming,” she squeaked. Usually found hunting miCe in the hay shade, Mittens the barn cat sat near a flower bed still as a picture and eyes glazed with fright. “Something bad is coming,” she hissed. Even Ranger my fearless Shepherd mix who, for the first time since I’ve owned him, appeared downright spooked. “Something bad is coming,” he whined. Each and every single animal on the farm began repeating the phrase one by one “Something bad is coming” before joining together in an unnatural chant. 

Finishing up feeding and watering my stock, I began to get frustrated. I had asked repeatedly just what in the hell they were all worked up about. I thought that maybe they had heard some music on my phone and just got a jingle of sorts stuck in their respective heads (yes, this does happen to animals too.) But the way the creatures had begun saying the same sentence in unison thoroughly freaked me out. I tried to reason with myself that they were all playing some huge prank on me but this was getting somewhat cruel. I’ve never personally met an inherently cruel animal before...especially not these animals...Fed up, I mentally screamed “OK! You guys got me! Cut it out!” Every critter in the entirety of the barnyard turned to loOk at me before hanging their heads and falling silent. It was the weirdest damned thing I had ever witnessed. And when I say something is weird...a lady that telepathically speaks to animals...trust me when I say IT REALLY IS WEIRD!


After the strange incident with my pets, I headed next door to open up shop. It was 8 A.M. sharp. I was still pretty shook up from the whole ordeal as I made my way through the back of the clinic to our overnight holding area. On this particular morning I had two in-house patients. Buck, a German Shorthaired Pointer who enjoyed the occasional tussle with a venomous snake, was located in the large kennel area. I always hated leaving Buck in the clinic building during his many stays. Usually, I would bring the overnighters across the pasture to my own home. Buck, however was not very fond of my Ranger and vocalized to me many times that he would actually prefer to reMain at the hospital. Despite both animals being altered, they each considered themselves alpha males and did not prefer one another’s company in the slightest. I called out “How ya doin’ Buckey?” while willing myself to put the earlier morning’s oddness in the past, I was horrified to, in return, hear those now dreaded words “Something bad is coming.” I quickly checked his vitals and prayed that my next patient would be a welcomed reprieve to this madness. You see, a little further down the hall in our wildlife quarantine sat an injured Whitetail Fawn. Her ears had been mutilated by an unknown predator and the local wildlife sanctuary brought her to our clinic to see if she could be saved. Now, it’s a known fact amongst species that wild animals have a different language, if you will, versus that of domesticated pets. Though I was fortunate enough to understand both Buck and Bambi (original right?) they could not communicate with one another using anything other than regular barks, growls, snorts, and bleats. Therefore, if the bizarre happenings were indeed some elaborate prank, little Bambi couldn’t possibly be in on it.

As I cautiously approached the plastic crate and peered inside, I was at first relieved to see that the little doe had made it through the night. Although she would still have to remain in quarantine for 9 more days as is our protocol with wildlife, I was glad to observe her eyes wide and significantly more alert than on intake. Any positivity I felt was short lived, however. I anxiously asked “How are you feeling sweet one?” and as you probably guessed, Bambi peered at me through long black lashes before exclaiming “Something bad is coming.” At this point, I began thInking I was going insane. Down the hall, Buck joins Bambi in a chant. “This is fucking impossible,” I thought to myself. “This would be like me joining in a spontaneous chorus word for fucking word with someone that speaks German.” Confused and angry, I verbally shouted “Enough!” and the animals piped down. I scuttled back up the hallway praying my small staff had not shown up in the lobby, heard my yell, and concluded that I had gone bonkers (and honestly maybe I had.) None of this made any sense.

I stopped off in the bathroom, splashing my face with frigid well water. While drying myself off and staring in the mirror I realized something...the chants of Buck and Bambi had followed the same progression as the barnyard critters...one by one, they had each made that same god awful statement and once every single animal in the vicinity had spoken it, they all then joined together in a sickly singsong call. I was beginning to feel nauseous which is completely out of the ordinary for me. Ever had an aNal gland rupture in your face? I have and even that in no way compared to the queasiness I was now feeling in the pit of my stomach. Maybe the animals were trying to tell me something but simply couldn’t? Maybe that’s why they gave up every time I responded in exasperation? 


I thought seriously about just taking the next day off but it was birthing season, more importantly it was calving season in an agricultural community. I’d definitely be needed to help pull some babies. Cattle often have a difficult time giving birth and if large calves aren’t removed from their mothers soon after labor begins, both mama and baby are at risk of dying. Our town was chock full of dairies and meat farms. I had already successfully pulled 13 babies this season and the season had really only just begun. So, perhaps foolishly, I stuck around at work trying my hardest not to speak directly with any of the patients that trickled in and out of the clinic that day. Sadly, the totality of live animals I examined uttered that same wretched phrase over and over again. New patients and ones I had known for years. Furry patients, feathered patients, scaled patients, and even one hairless patient. Domesticated and wild alike, they all repeated the same sentence before joining together in what can only be compared to a Gregorian chant. By closing time, I was drained in a way that I had never been before. After locking up the clinic, I walked across the pasture all but wholly avoiding my menaGerie. I refused to even look in the direction of any animal that was out grazing in the fading sun. Regardless, I took note of the fact that as I gradually approached, the critters were making sure to steer clear of me as well. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed my entire humble herd of rescued Red Angus steers huddling closely with Moe and Priscilla...all of them glaring at me in some type of distress, mouths gaping and completely silent. 


Around 9:30 that night, after supper and baths and story time and tucking the children into bed, I sat at the dining room table and dug a buzzing iPhone out of my work bag. I sighed heavily realizing it was my emergency line, practically knowing this was going to be a calving situation since I had someHow been fortunate enough to avoid any during the work day. I answered with “Dr. Haskell” and heard a very familiar voice on the other line. Old man Bonnett of the Bonnett Family Dairy 20 miles East (2.5 of which are his driveway) tells me with the precision of a lifelong farmer that one of his largest producing heifers has a baby in breech. After giving Mr.Bonnett an ETA, I double checked the supplies in my work truck and headed towards the dairy.

Upon arriving at Bonnett Farm, I made sure not to speak to any of the 300+ head of Holstein Friesians that called this place home. I was doing pretty well under the circumstances until elbow deep inside a black and white cow called Gertrude, I made the mistake of mentally saying to her “Push Mama!” God I didn’t mean to, it had just become like second nature to me. Gertie stopped right in the middle of giving birth before turning to me and bellowing “Something bad is coming.” She then abruptly dropped dead at my feet. I fought to save the baby despite being so fucking disturbed that I wanted to run as far away as humAnly possible. He was unfortunately met with the same fate as his mother. Removing my shoulder length OB gloves, I apologized to Mr. Bonnett. He patted me on the back and told me he knew that I gave it my all. I began packing my supplies into buckets to be sanitized when I heard that fucking sentence. God no. This could not be happening. One by one, the heifers in the barn started to speak. “Something bad is coming. Something bad is coming.” I sprinted to my vehicle screaming on the inside “NO! STOP PLEASE!” as those cursed fucking words continued on, quickly moving to the herds outside in the paddocks. I cranked up my truck and hauled ass down the extremely long driveway all the while just over and over that fucking sentence. The faster I drove, the faster all 300 or so head of cattle spoke, until it was almost as if one sentence began before the previous one even ended. I made it out of range of the heifers just as they all began to chant with one another.

I sped 30 miles over the speed limit the entire way home. Discarding my soiled uniform in the mud room, I messaged my senior vet tech and advised her that I would not be returning to work the following day. Made up some excuse about being sick. I took an ambIen and prayed that things would be different in the morning. Drifting off to my drug induced sleep, I distinctly remember hearing the sound of our household pets chanting.

At 830 the next morning, I awoke to a loud and fast paced knocking on the door along with that goddamned chanting. It must have went on all night. “It’s too early for this bullshit,” I grumbled and the animals hushed. The knocking, however, intensified. I clumsily rushed downstairs to find Val, my vet tech. She was visibly shaken. After rubbing my eyes and urging her to calm down a bit, she explained to me that the clinic had had multiples calls already of seemingly healthy pregnant animals just flat out dropping dead. Only thirty minutes after opening, 15 different people had phoned in with concerns and 3 people had shown up with the actual proof. Val apologized for disturbing me while all but whispering “I just didn’t know what to tell the owners. I don’t know what’s going on.” “Well that makes fucking two of us,” I thought to myself. I assured Val that I would be over shortly and put on my scrubs. Two hours past official closing time, I had lost track of the number of cases. My uniform was covered in blood and sinew. I’d spent hours inside of people’s dead pregnant pets and I hadn’t found a single cause to this fucking madness. It was as if every single patient had spontaneousLy aborted before dying of shock. At the time I when needed explanations or words of wisdom the most, the animals couldn’t or wouldn’t give me any damn thing to go off of except for those four terrifying words: Something Bad is Coming. My once greatest gift had evidently become my biggest curse.

Two weeks pass and it seems as though any and every pregnant animal in our entire town has died from unknown causes. An article is even written in the front page of the town gazette. I never felt more unqualified as a veterinarian than I did whilst giving an interview to that journalist. Not having the slightest clue what was going on, the best I could think to do was strongly encourage townsfolk to stop breeding animals all together. I offered and preformed countless no coSt spays and neuters. By the middle of the second week since this shit began, many of the local meat and dairies had all but gone out of business. Decades old farms finished in two weeks. Forced out of their lifelong professions by losing half or more of their stock. Things were beginning to scare even the most seasoned farmers and they weren’t alone. Hobby breeders of all types, even people with no pets at all, everyone was getting nervous. Town council held a meeting that was of no real use other than to inform us all that reports were coming in from Sercy, the city closest to us, that they’ve had an unusually large number of pregnant animals unexpectedly kicking the bucket. 

I had an idea the morning after our town meeting that I felt completely foolish for not thinking of sooner. Although I can apparently no longer “talk” to animals like I once could, there is one particular former patient of mine that can communicate with many folks. I phoned my old vet school friend Tabitha. She works at a very nice zoo about 2 hours away. After engaging of course about the situation in my town (as the news had began to spread along with whatever the hell this “disease” is, if you can even call it that) I asked if I could possibly schedule an impromptu meeting with Jazzy. Jazzy is a brilliant female Western Lowland gorilla that has been taught ASL throughout her years in captivity. Tabitha surprised me by responding that any time would be acceptAble as Jaz was 8 months pregnant and nearing her due date so much so, that she was no longer available for public viewing at the Zoo. Instead, she had her own private maternity ward within the internals of the park. I shuddered at the news of pregnancy but tried to remain as optimistic as possible considering Jazzy was essentially my last hope. I was desperate for any insight and terribly afraid that Jaz would be the only one able to provide such at this point. 


Pulling into the parking lot of Greenbriar Zoological Foundation, I prayed that this would result promisingly. Dr. Tabitha Bridgewall met me at the front gate. As we made our way to the maternity wing, she confided in me that they were very excited to have me here as Jazzy had been acting rather strangely in the last few weeks...Had been signing words repeatedly...words like “Something” and “Bad.”  The zoo staff was more than happy to have an additional veterinarian’s opinion when it came to Jaz considering how special she was to their conservaTion program and taking into account the recent happenings from neighboring towns. It was only an added benefit that Jazzy was no stranger to me. I had preformed many a dental cleaning on her in the past. The pleasant old ape and I would often discuss the theory of evolution but that’s another story for another time. Tabitha followed me to the glass indoor enclosure as Jazzy emerged from her nest of branches and assorted flora. I signed “Hello” and Jaz stared menacingly in my direction. “Something bad is...” “NO! GOD PLEASE!” I screamed out loud overtaking the gorilla’s telepathy. Jazzy, the magnificent beast, took her final breathe but not before pointing at me, bending her long arms at the elbows, and pulling her digits towards her body. “Coming.” 


It is now the beginning of the third week since this shitshow began. I guess I should clarify that some names and locations have been changed. Not that it matters. You’ll likely be hearing about this everywhere soon. It will be picked up by all of the national news outlets. There will be mass hysteria. Things are going to fall completely apart. I’ve quit my job. I’m staying at home with my children and husband and I’m waiting. Looking down at my swollen belly, a local news alert scrolls across the television screen advising all pregnant women to be extremely cAutious as the number of death reports continue to roll in. I rub my stomach gently and cry out “Something bad IS coming.” I’m unnerved to hear a voice in return...a voice somewhere between that of a goat and a winged creature...a demonic voice...a voice being emitted from my very own body...“I’m coming Mommy! I promise I won’t be bad! Just let me live and I will show you!” 

The aNimals were right you guys."

98ruly,43,2018-08-20,Denied Boarding on Lufthansa.,nawfalelaroussi,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/98ruly/denied_boarding_on_lufthansa/,"**can you please provide me with advices and ideas regarding this situation.** 

I am taking contact with you regarding my denied boarding on the flight LH1331.

The flight LH1331 was scheduled to depart from Casablanca, Morocco on august 16th, 2018 at 1:30 am However, my boarding to the LH1331 has been denied by the check in agent at the Lufthansa check in desks in Casablanca’s Mohammed 5 international airport in Morocco and by that I have not arrived to Mexico city international airport (Benito Juarez INTL) on august 16th, 2018 at 18:30 Mexican time.  
I have presented my passport and my flight ticket to the first Lufthansa’s check in agent who asked me what are the reasons for my flight to Mexico city and which company I’m willing to have my internship in then he turned to the lady in his left who was responsible for business class and gold members as the monitor above showed, however she decided that I need to stand by.

After minutes of me standing by, the Lufthansa’s check in agent she told me that there are high chances not to be on board of the LH1331 flight because I need a visa Schengen for my transit in Frankfurt international airport knowing that the transit is for 7 hours and 25 minutes without changing the Terminal 1 which according to the international standards is visa free, it applies also to the Frankfurt airport in which I will not receive my baggage neither I will change the terminal.  
The Lufthansa’s check in agent asked me to give her any document that can justify my flight to Mexico City, from my part I have presented all the necessary documents that justified my flight to Mexico City which are:

\- My Moroccan passport with Mexican visa in it.  
\- The invitation letter and the presentation letter from the organization that will sponsor my internship in Mexico City.

The agent took photos of the documents and sent them by WHATSAPP from her personal mobile to whom she said is the responsible for the flights in Lufthansa, during her conversation with the person on WHATSAPP she started asking me about which kind of training I’ll have, how much money I have with me and in which company I will intern, from my part I have responded to all her queries gently and kindly and to my surprise after that “INVESTIGATION”, she told me that I was not able to be on board of the LH1331 flight because “they didn’t like my profile” while pointing to my physique and my face which I have found really offending and racist, she also told me word to word “ you can go and sue the company if you want” otherwise I asked her if there’s a solution she responded “just forget about Lufthansa you will never be on board of its flights”.

The Lufthansa staff refused to give me any written explanation of why they were denying my boarding in the LH1331 flight, in contravention of my rights as a passenger.

I was left with no justification to the organization sponsoring my internship which can result on delaying/cancelation of the internship and for consequence delaying my master’s degree graduation.

Also as a consequence to the random decision of the Lufthansa’s check in agent I have beared the costs of my booked hotel at Mexico city (IBIS MEXICO ALAMEDA) for the august 16th,2018 night, the costs of taxis and train back to Tangier, Morocco in order to come to my travel agency.

I am very unhappy with the way this situation has been handled by Lufthansa’s staff.

I look forward to hearing from you and would welcome a response."

98scvc,3,2018-08-20,"Having kind of ""anxiety attacks"" following unsignificant vexations or even in random moments",ASB43,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/98scvc/having_kind_of_anxiety_attacks_following/,"For the last few months, I've been experiencing many bad feelings without finding a ""real"" cause to it.

**Context/Who I am** : 22 years old student, living in France. I'm a student, doing an internship (everything is going well, I love my work and my colleagues), I'm graduating in a few weeks and I also found a job to start in september, so nothing to worry about my future. I've been in a relationship for 3 years, we love each other, we talk a lot, nothing to worry about either. 

**My problem / ""symptoms**"": for almost one year now, I sometime experience what I call ""anxiety attacks"" even though I think anxiety refers to a precise diagnosis which doesn't correspond to my experience. In these moments I can be very nervous for one hour, several hours, a day, several days (but never more than 2 days, and when it was 2 days it was only during a weekend). My chest feel constricted (I can breathe but slowly), my body is tensed, my hands are clammy and I clench my fists or any other random move to ""evacuate"" the nervosity. Meeting people, even my friends my boyfriend makes me ""panic"", even if I'm very good at faking that everything is ok. I feel kind of agoraphobic which is really not me. I can also feel very very tired without reason, and want to stay in my bed all day long. These strong ""crisis"" are not the most common, more often I'm just in a really bad mood, finding everything boring, finding people stupid, reproaching my boyfriend for stupid things (forgetting this or that, not being as cheerful as I expected from him about a film/a song/an activity/..., touching me, not touching me...). Sometimes I reconsider all my life, my choices, being with my boyfriend, wondering if I'm with him from habit or from real love, the kind of question I never consider when I'm ""normal"".

 All of this is NOT me. Sometimes I can be back to my normal mood after 2 hours. 

**When does it happen ?** : Sometimes I can't figure out the reason. Sometimes it begins following an unsignificant vexation. What I mean by unsignificant is something which isn't normally suppose to cause a ""mood blast"", and most of the time doesn't have this effect on me : missing my bus, not finding my keys, my boyfriend not wanting to watch the same film as me, forgetting a task at work, a last minute change in my plans for the weekend...

**Hypthesis** : I've been wondering if my mood was linked to my diet, even if I consider being quite balanced with it. I have moments when I eat to much sugar or carbs or fat, but I think there have been no big change in my diet for years. I tried taking magnesium and B6 pills for around one month, I had the feeling that it worked for a bit because during this month I didn't experience any ""big crisis"", or maybe it was a placebo, I don't really know. I don't eat a lot of meat, maybe I miss B12 vitamin, but could my diet have such a strong effect on my mood ?

Question : As any of you experienced the same thing or have some advice to give me ? Thanks a lot in advance &lt;3"
98szf2,844,2018-08-20,"""Just a patch""",AeroXbird,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/98szf2/just_a_patch/,"This recently happened, and left me lightly irritated and stunned.

Some background: My official title and job description would be datacenter technician, but in reality i'm more a network admin/architect and sysadmin.  
The company I work for has multiple sites, but two main sites in the country, I work at the sister office, and the other office is our headquarters.

We are in the midst of phasing out a hop in our network, we used to have a dc in the middle of our route from the headquarters to sister dc.   
This was done because of the range, and because this hop allowed us access to some well connected datacenters and transits. As this situation has changed, and its costing us a lot of money to keep this site on-line, we're planning to get rid of it completely, by getting a direct layer-2 tunnel (dot1q) through a client/supplier of ours.

**$me**: keeper of (ssh) keys, protector of subnets and the spanning tree, guardian of the company's digital realm.

**$doofus**: sloth-like colleague at our HQ Datacenter

**$srtech**: my direct boss / senior technician, also my sparring partner for technical problems.

**$nondoofus**: other colleague at our HQ Datacenter, is not sloth-like, or a doofus.

We start our adventure with $srtech, who is ordering our layer2 tunnel at our supplier.

&gt;$srtech: I'm trying to order this l2 line but its taking forever to get a hold of someone, please escalate.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Maybe we should try 'stalking' our account manager every single working day?  
&gt;  
&gt;$srtech: Let's do it.

And so it became, that we phoned up our account manager every single day until that line was delivered, but little did we know that this was only the start of our misfortune.

&gt;$srtech: Hey, line's been delivered at last, I'll e-mail you port positions so we can get the patches made.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: awesome, I'll start configuring some ports so we can test this sucker.  
&gt;  
&gt;$srtech: Make sure you call up $doofus so he can patch the tunnel on our end at HQ.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: sure.

So I ring up $doofus with the port positions so he can make a patch.

&gt;$me: Yo $doofus, I need a favor, can you make a patch from SUPPLIER\_SWITCH\_PORT to OUR\_PORT for me?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: oh and before I forget, I need this done by the end of the day so I can test this thing.  
&gt;  
&gt;$doofus: sure thing I'll give you a call when it's done.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: cool, thanks!

In the meantime I get our intern to make the patch from the supplier to our core switch in our datacenter, and I'm ready for liftoff, awaiting $doofus.

A few hours later I still haven't gotten a call, but it's the end of the day, so I figure I'll call the next day.

&gt;$me; Hey $doofus, did you get that patch done for me that I asked about yesterday?  
&gt;  
&gt;$doofus: Nah it was too busy.  
&gt;  
&gt;\* at this point I already know he's talking out of his ass, because he does fuck all every day. \*  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: oh that sucks, but I really need this thing today, so can you please shift some stuff in your 'schedule' and do it ASAP?  
&gt;  
&gt;$doofus: sure I'll see what I can do.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: awesome, thanks.

As it so happens, $doofus came up from his chair, and wrestled the very dangerous Cat6A UTP snake into the cable rails, and into the ports. So a little after lunch I was finally able to get my testing going.

&gt;\&gt; I start by bringing up the ports on both ends, which goes a little as follows:  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Port goes into autonegotiate  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol down  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Half/ duplex 100Mbit/s.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol up  
&gt;  
&gt;\*2 seconds\*  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;Link state down, protocol down.

At this point I've been diagnosing for about an hour, trying to change duplex modes, changing speed modes, autonegotiate, nothing works.

I ring up the supplier and ask them what's what.

&gt;$me: I'm having some issues with a connection, it keeps coming up on half-duplex, and goes down again after a bit.  
&gt;  
&gt;$supplier: Hm let me take a look.  
&gt;  
&gt;\*about an hour of back-and-forth troubleshooting, trying different MTU values, different speeds, duplex modes, nothing works.\*  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: confusing how it goes online only when you set it to half-duplex 100mbit/s, could this be a cabling issue  
&gt;  
&gt;$supplier: Not sure, it does have connection, so it seems cabling is not at fault.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: What type of switch are you running on your end?  
&gt;  
&gt;$supplier: it's a Cisco Catalyst 3560G.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Okay I've got a cisco 7609 on my end, so it shouldn't be a problem, but I'll go look up some datasheets and get back to you if i find a possible solution.  
&gt;  
&gt;$supplier: Alright that's good, talk to you later.

At this point I'm looking up the port features for this C3560G because I've got a suspicion it doesn't have the fancy features my switch has.  
And then it hits me in the face like a flyswatter hitting you at mach 5.

    Auto-MDIX is enabled by default. When you enable auto-MDIX, you must also set the interface speed and duplex to auto so that the feature operates correctly.

The port we have from our supplier is hard-set to 100mbit/s, so its not on auto.

I enter the datacenter floor wielding a pair of side cutters, RJ45 crimpers, and an RJ45 connector and do my magical TIA 568A to TIA 568B cross cable trick.

Back at the office I log into the switch, turn the port back on with the settings correct.

&gt;\&gt; Link state down, protocol down  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol down  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol up  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Full duplex, 100Mbit/s

I do a little victory dance and quickly grab my phone to call up $doofus.

&gt;$nondoofus: Yo $me, what's up?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Hey is $doofus there, I need a favor.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: No he's out of office at the moment, can I leave a note?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Yeah can you ask him to make that cable he patched for me yesterday into a cross-cable?  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: Sure I'll tell him.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Awesome, thanks!

The next day I ring up $doofus, to ask him if he got around to making that cross-cable, but obviously he was too busy doing whatever.

Another day passes before I finally have enough control over the Force to lift $doofus out of his chair to get him to do something for me.

&gt;$me: Hey $doofus did you make that cross-cable for me?  
&gt;  
&gt;$doofus: Yeah I made the cross-cable, its all good and patched in the DC.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: awesome, I'll go and test it later.

And so later that day I start to test it.

&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol down  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Half/ duplex 100Mbit/s.  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol up

At this point I'm beating my head against the desk in a vain attempt to mix up the information in my head into a solution, to no avail.

I think to myself, $doofus must know how to make a cross-cable right? But it's doing the exact same thing when we had a straight cable connected...

And so I pick up the phone once more...

&gt;$nondoofus: Hey $me, what's up?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Hey is $doofus around, i need to ask him something.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: he just left his spot, probably going to the bathroom.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: alright, maybe you know, did he happen to test the cable before he patched it?  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: Yeah he used the cable tester and he said all lights lit up just fine.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: all lights lit up huh? with that 10$ cheap-o-meter you guys use, right?  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus; yeah I think so, oh here comes $doofus, I'll ask him real quick.  
&gt;  
&gt;\*$nondoofus asks $doofus if the cable tester had all lights on during testing.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: yeah he says all lights lit up on the tester.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: okay, can you please drive to the DC for me, with a pre-made, known-good cross cable, and an RJ-45 coupler?  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: Yeah sure, but why?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: please just trust me and do it please.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: ok sure, I'll call you when I'm at the datacenter.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: awesome, thank you.

At this point I have a 99% certainty what the problem is here, and I wish I could bitch-slap $doofus so hard it goes down 3 generations.

Half an hour passes and $nondoofus rings me up

&gt;$nondoofus: Yo $Me, I'm at the datacenter, what do you want me to do?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Okay walk to our core switch, and unplug the port that $doofus patched on.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: done.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: okay now connect the coupler block, and connect the crosscable to the port and the coupler.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: alright that's done.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Ok give me a second to verify.

I log in to the switch and turn on the port.

&gt;\&gt; Link state down, protocol down  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Link state up, protocol up  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Full duplex, 100Mbit/s  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt; Trunk online, VLANs forwarding.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: $nondoofus, you still there?  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: yep, still here.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: okay we're all set here, when you get to the office I want you to go to the storage closet.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: when you get to the storage closet, I want you to pick up the old Cisco 7201 router we have lying around there, and I want you to hit $doofus with it so hard, that he comes back to his senses.  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: \*laughing loudly\*  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: why's that? \*still laughing\*  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: Because this idiot made a STRAIGHT cable, when I asked him to make a CROSS cable.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: The reason is, he used that cheap shitty tester you guys have, and it only measures straight cables properly.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: all lights lit up, indicating it was a straight cable..  
&gt;  
&gt;$nondoofus: haha, this is going to make for a great story.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: thanks a lot $nondoofus, I'll talk to you later.

Flabberghasted I tell the story to $srtech.

&gt;$me: Finally managed to get that L2 tunnel online.  
&gt;  
&gt;$srtech: Really? finally. what was the problem?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: $doofus.  
&gt;  
&gt;$srtech: \*looks at me confused\* eh, what?  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: I asked him to make a cross cable for me, and he made a straight cable, convinced it was cross.  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: I asked $nondoofus to put in a good pre-made cross-cable with a coupler, it works now.  
&gt;  
&gt;$srtech: \*laughing at this point\* Good.

And that is how my colleague managed to waste a few days of my time troubleshooting by not knowing how to use the equipment he has to handle.

To this day I'm not sure he really knows how to make a cross-cable, and I don't intend to ask him to make one for me again.

What a shitshow that was...."

My project is to work abroad in an English speaking country. I dream about North America, so Canada would be a good choice as US seems to be very difficult to get in.  I am also considering Europe.   
Ideally, I want to work in a private research environment for a big company in North America.

I am currently doing a PhD in CS (Automotive Industry) in France that would ends in 3 years when I'll be 28. I have an Engineering degree and an MSc. in Robotics. Those degrees are not from top schools but not from bad schools either. Before my PhD, I worked 1 year as an Engineer doing mainly software engineering and computer vision stuff for my current lab.

I plan to do my PhD thesis in English and hopefully I will have good reviews from English speaking universities and several publications in good  journals/conferences.

Here are my questions :

1/ Is it too late ? It's a strange question but i'm wondering if, by the time I finish my PhD, it will be too late for me to work abroad. I mean, I'll be 28, I only worked abroad for 5 months during an internship and I feel that I'll be behind people that started their adventure at 25 or less. And also I don't want to quit the PhD program...  
3/ I have a C1 (fluent) TOEIC certification. It's an listening and reading test. Is it enough ? Or recruiters don't care and evaluate English proficiency during interviews ?  
4/ Which cities in Canada do you recommend ? Or which countries if not in Canada ?  
5/ Any tips or advice on things that I can do now to increase my chances of getting recruited after my PhD.

Merci d'avance ! :)"

It’s my first job post college. I have a degree in business management, which I feel like is a complete mistake because my job doesn’t involve managing anything. I feel like no non-sales company is ever going to hire me because my education and experiences ONLY match that of sales and I HATE sales.

I don’t even know what I want to do! Everything I’m truly passionate about - writing, film, animals - does not lead to a successful life. I want to make money. But every career path I look at - IT, software developing, flight attending, hospitality - that I have at least a passing interest in either doesn’t pay great, won’t consider me because I don’t have the skills (which I’m willing to learn, but still), or sounds good but most people I hear talk about it are actually miserable in the role. It also doesn’t help that almost everyone I know has a much better job than me! And I don’t know what to do about that.

Anytime I get an interview they always tell me that while I have a great personality and I’d fit in well, I don’t have the “necessary experience” and it shows in my answers to the interview questions. But how can I gain experience when the only thing I do is make calls all day?! There’s nothing to learn at all telemarketing! I can’t take that anywhere else so it’s really difficult for me to answer interview questions because I don’t have experience! So I feel like I’ve trapped myself into crappy jobs by doing this.


I don’t know what to do! I can’t just follow my passions because I’ll never make money in them/I’ll go broke following them, but the things that WILL make me money will make me wanna kill myself much like I do right now! So what do I do?! I feel completely trapped, like I put myself into a box by deciding to do THIS job as my first ever post-college job (I did an amazing internship with Disney before and some summer jobs but that’s it).

Did I trap myself into crappy jobs forever? Am I gonna have a miserable life because of the choices I made? I’ve legitimately been suicidal about this before and I feel like I complete failure compared to everyone else, especially because I feel like literally everyone is doing better than me.

\----------

After the ""Bearucracy"" incident (get me the intern that named that, they deserve a medal and a slap on the wrist) I thought the galaxy would learn to *not* annoy the HAF. Apparently the Norioi didn't get the message.

Multiple Norioi spies were discovered in the HAF core planets during a failed operation to steal some information and promptly expelled.

An apology was quickly sent along with an unknown amount of money. The HAF's response was vague as ever: ""We accept the monetary compensation but still feel slighted by the espionage"".

This left everyone uneasy, they knew that that a response like this meant the HAF would have a punishment.

Then there was a unrelated event: A few HAF prisoners were released. In hindsight, ""related"" would have been a better term.

A couple months passed and, surprisingly... nothing happened. People calmed down, they assumed that the HAF wasn't going to do anything.

Then, on some remote administrative outpost in Norioi space a single Human employee unplugs a data chip and uses some stolen administrator codes to clear the access logs. He checks out early and boards his personal shuttle, he is back in HAF space within the hour. He isn't coming back.

Fast forward one week later, a few computers around the Empire slow down slightly, others are a couple hundredths off on basic math problems, these are basic computer errors though, and they go unreported, unnoticed in some cases.

Now we go forward a few days, and most administrative computers in the Empire are acting up. People begin to notice. Analysts run through terabytes of code to find viruses. They aren't having any luck.

The Empire is grinding to a halt, most civilians can't apply for any government servers, the computers are too slow to access the data servers in any reasonable amount of time.

Issues in the various sectors go unresolved for days, the administrators who are supposed to solve the problems having to sit through the physical reports slowly. The problems only grow worse and worse from there, I'd go into more detail now but it'd be easy to see how a stellar empire with no way to communicate with itself could be problematic. 

Fast forward a few more days. No government computer works. Any time they are turned on they simply show a black screen with white text on top of it. It simply said: ""We apologize for the inconvenience"". A day later everything worked fine.



At this point, everyone knew it was the HAF's doing, not that there was any solid evidence, the malware erased itself from all the computers.

But some of you may remember that I said the HAF released some prisoners. What was their relevance? They were all cyber-criminals, what the HAF would call ""Hackers"". Feel free to draw your own conclusions from that.

And then been introduced to a woman, she explained about safety during work and stuff. And then back to my 2nd SV, he gave me a brief overview of the production of the company and expalined what do i have to do. 

So basically my task is to create a profile for the  presser machine of rubber seal, they can now press only 2. But i need to redesign it so that it can press 4 and it fits the machine presser. I have to use an autocad software. I use creo parametric to do stuff regarding 3d model.

And after that went for lunch break with the officemates.  After lunch, i transfered pictures and drawing model of the current produced sealing rubber and that basically it for the day. My SV said i dont have much anything to do for today and went straight home at around 2pm. Can interns work time be this flexible?

i just got my bachelor's in media/communications and due to failing two classes in my last semester, i graduated in august, about a few weeks ago, instead of may like i had planned. i became depressed for most of the time i spent retaking the two classes this summer but i'm officially done with both (passed with As) and my degree is being conferred.

i'm in the job search process and i know it can take months before something good comes along. i am currently living at home but am focusing on getting a job that will allow me to move out on my own and will also be in line with what i want to do career-wise (marketing/communications). these are some of the things that i'm looking to do over the next couple of months and wanted to know if you all had any advice or thoughts on additional things i could be doing.

**what i've been doing**

\- skills building: after looking through r/marketing and other career sites, i've decided to start the certification process for Google Adwords, Google Analytics, Facebook Blueprint, and Hubspot. i know that they probably won't hold much weight but i figured that since they were free, it wouldn't hurt me to be familiar with these platforms. i am also looking into building my skills with adobe photoshop and other adobe programs/taking some courses through lynda and coursera. 

\- job hunting: this is basically my job until i **get** an actual job but i'm using general job search sites like glassdoor, indeed, etc. as well as the general job board for students at my university and the one created for alumni. i will also be attending a job fair at my university (don't worry, alumni welcome!) in a few weeks.

\- beefing up my resume and linkedin profile

**what i could also be doing/focusing more on**

\- looking into internships: i did internships when i was in school and got all the way to the final interview round for 2 companies this summer but unfortunately, they didn't work out. i have been mainly focused on applying to jobs but not so much seasonal internships in my area. i figured companies are mainly looking for people still in college according to their postings but i guess it couldn't hurt to try...

\- talking to a career counselor at my school: we still have access to career services 6 months post graduation. i had a bad experience with a counselor once that completely turned me off but the past should be in the past and i could try again.

if there is anything else that you all think i'm missing or could also try to work on during this job search process, i'd love to hear it! it's been really, really rough for me from may till the end of july and i'm just trying to work on goals and not let depression get the best of me like it did during that time period. i appreciate everyone's advice and thoughts. thank you all so, so much!"

Since I did my masters right after my bachelor, I do not have much work experience, only a summer internship working as a technician at a car workshop.


I have been job searching for around 2 months and a half after I graduated from my masters degree. been adding alumni on linkedin and talking to them just as an informational interview about their post and company and what they do. Been applying almost everyday. so far, i am getting close to 200 applications submitted over linkedin, indeed and company job sites. 
Recently I have found an opportunity but it's for a machinist (CNC mill) position, going on an interview for it this week. 


A lot of the other jobs I apply for, I am told that I lack the experience (mechanical assembler, quality agent, method agent at aerospace companies) so i opted to find tier 1 companies/suppliers and gain experience from them for a year or two and then move on.


I am posting here just to talk and see if someone ran into a similar situation and found success. Someone who graduated with an engineering degree and took on a machinist/technician role and managed to find success moving forward.


I just want to know if this machinist job will be worth it or just a waste of time and i should find better.


The job is with a company that manufactures machines for XYZ plants and offers services to fully set up the XYZ plants. I will be working in their manufacturing plant reading blueprints and producing the desired parts under the supervision of a senior machinist. My interview is with the plant engineer this week


the job post is permanent and not contractual, would this mean that my chances of moving up are better? "

Rather than specific advice I'll just focus on stating the process, results and my thoughts on what I did well and could have done better.

Applied for PhD in Computer Science

Bachelors in CS from Cal-State University

School choices:

   2 ""reach"" schools, UC Berkely and USC

   2 ""safer"" schools, UC Irvine and UC Riverside(accepted)

needed more schools. another four (outside California) would have been a decent goal but due to poor planning  and an inability to pay application fees I erroneously aimed small.

GPA: 3.4

 By **FAR** the weakest part off my application. I pushed myself to graduate in 3.5 years and frankly i'm just not 4.0 caliber. Still would have liked to see this improved upon.

GRE: Verbal: 160 Quantitative: 164 Writen: 4

   pretty close to 90th percentile (except writing :( ). Least important part of the application. crammed for 2 days. ez.

Personal Statement: 

   Mentioned 2 research internships and one publication, 1 industry internship and job, and finally academic club leadership. Had family and letter writers look it over for quality. Interviewers mentioned several buzzwords within the statement so feel free to plug very specific research topics you are interested in. 

Letters of Recommendation:

  3 PhDs, one from research-ship at another university, and two from the university that I graduated from(and CS department chair) all of whom I took multiple courses with or did projects with. Would recommend only submitting letters of rec from PhD's if applying for PhD program.

Results:

   Only accepted to Riverside with full stipend (expected TA/RA). Most likely due to Low""ish"" GPA and unimpressive Alma matter. Had one interview with accepting school faculty before decision.

TLDR:

   Pros: research internship, solid letters of Rec. No glaring faults outside of GPA

   Cons: Sub-Par GPA. Didn't apply to many schools.

   PhD apps are rough but I'm somewhat happy with the results."

I have an associate degree in Computer Programming, I'm working on my bachelors degree in Software Development. I really need a better job. Every time I get an interview for a position (which is rare because most of the time I don't even get a response), I'm asked questions that I never learned the answers to. I'm studying everything related to Programming I can but every company wants something different and I'm not a mind reader. My thought process is this training was developed with specific desires of clients in mind so the likelihood of getting hired in my mind is higher. Yes there are a lot of red flags. However, as a person who's been through several interviews and been ghosted a few times I can truly say I just want a chance.



So I just had an interview with a company. They are basically a staffing company for it consultants. They have a lot of clients all over the us, Fortune 500 companies that anyone would know.

Recently they developed a program to train consultants in all things full stack. That's what I interviewed for. It's basically like an internship where your job is to learn and get a job after. It's full time but they pay you enough money for gas a food, weekly.

At the end, they will show you off to their clients and whoever calls you first, wins you. You are required to move wherever they want you to or else it's a breach of contract and you pay them $10,000-$20,000. When you are hired you are payed a base of $10 with a highly variable bonus. Depending on how much the client is paying and the cost it took to get you the job, you could be paid $15-30 per hour. 

If you don't get picked up by a client you get paid $10/hr until you get picked up or dropped.

You are required by contract to work for them for at least 2 years.

I'm doing school at WGU, Software, and don't have that many job prospects. I have an Associate in Computer Programming and I'm excited to learn everything in the course.

Should I accept the offer?"

I am very fortunate to already have 8 years of experience as an intern working in MIS and SW QA at a Fortune 500 company. I got this internship while a senior in high school and as I began my college career. I worked part time (20 hours/week) when in school and worked full time (40 hours plus+) during the summer for 8 years. 


Unfortunately I struggled with working and going to school at the same time and only have 90 credit hours to show for my 8 years in college. Last year I got burnt out and stopped going to school and never returned from my work vacation and was later fired/terminated for being awol. I then spent 10 months resting and exploring other interests and also started working on an Arduino project.


Fast forward to today, I need to start applying for jobs. I am not currently enrolled in school, but I plan on going back and wrapping up my degree in CS. I plan on doing this about 6-12 months after I get a job and saving up money. **What's the best way to word my situation on my resume?** Usually education goes at the top, but I think it'd look bad if I say I'm a dropout. Should I say this and list my relevant courses or not mention school at all?



**I would also like help on how to emphasize my job experience.** I was basically a part-time employee rather than an intern; I was co-leading major project releases and training new hires. I was also put on special projects and more challenging technical ones. 
About 2 years ago while I was still working, I got a job offer from a random person on LinkedIn. The offer wasn't what I wanted and the recruiter sort of downplayed my experience just because I was titled as an intern, rather than my accomplishments and experience

I am a CS student in Prague working part-time as a web developer, and I've been looking into kickstarting my career with an internship at a Big N company during the next summer. I have a solid command of data structures and algorithms, leetcode challenges and will have more than a year and a half of job experience in web development (full-time during the summer and part-time during school). The only big N company in Prague is Microsoft, and although I am going to apply there for sure, I have to admit that it would be the last option by far if by a stroke of luck I were accepted to more than one big N company.

I am aiming to get into Facebook or Google, unfortunately though that would mean applying for positions in other countries. Which brings me to the question, how much does being a student from a different country hinder your chances at landing a big N internship? I am going to do my very best, but I am still worried that I will be overlooked due to me not being a resident of the country in question. I am going to be applying to internships in England (Facebook), France (Amazon) and Poland (Google). I speak fluent English and French and have certificates to prove it.

Also, is it common for non-US residents to apply for internships in the US and get accepted, or should I just stick to doing my best to land something in Europe? How about housing? Is there a chance that the company would provide me with housing for the duration of the internship?

Basically, what I am wondering about is if the hiring process in Europe is similar to the one in the US, and if it is possible for me to land an internship in a foreign country (considering I speak its language fluently).

Thanks!"

I would appreciate any feedback, particularly if you've had experience with Common Bond or have received differing information. 

My goal is to borrow \~$48K in loans for the year and minimize how much I'll need to pay back (including fees).

Common Bond: 10 year fixed (deferred for 2 years), 6.48% interest, 2% origination fee. Capitalized after 6 month grace period upon graduation. I'm not sure if I need to ask for the full amount I need for the year up front, or if I can add additional principal later in the year - I've received differing information from different sales reps. One rep mentioned I would need to take out a new loan if I wanted to take out more, with a minimum of $5K. 

Federal Unsubsidized Direct: max loan amount of $20,500. 6.6% interest, 1.062% origination fee. 6 month grace period upon graduation.

PLUS Loan: $27.5K, 7.6% interest, 4.248% origination fee. I believe this is also capitalized after a 6 month grace period upon graduation. "
98zicx,1,2018-08-20,Should I leave my job just after 8 months?,yongjp94,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/98zicx/should_i_leave_my_job_just_after_8_months/,"In Feb of this year, I joined a very large and reputable fintech as a full time SW Engineer after spending 3 months with them in an internship last summer.

The company is great, and I loved the work that I was given. Until after it had been all taken away.

I joined as a general SW Engineer, but my passion was in front-end. Therefore, before I joined, I tried my best to clarify that I would like a front-end role, and luckily, the company was in need of UI engineers.

However, just after 2 months, the company went through a re-org and re-structuring of their products and all of the front-end work had been given to a different site.

After that, it just kind of turned sh\*tty.

I fought my way to find front-end work, and was assigned into a distributed UI team that consists of members mostly from the other office + me and a few people in other offices.

I had no stability. After my first project was canceled, I basically sat at my computer for a month and a half while the management tried to figure out what I could work on. The new team allowed me to work on a UI project until it was completely scrapped just a month ago due to a strategic change... Now I'm ramping up again on a different application with different set-up...

For 8 months, I probably spent a quarter to half of the time ramping up on new things and work that had been wasted. I ramp up, start working, and it gets canceled. Continuously.

After the new re-org, it looks like there won't be any real front-end work for me unless I join a remote/distributed team, and in those teams, it feels like I can't truly connect with the teammates, which makes it hard to look for mentors or find opportunities for growth.

Initially my mind was kind of set on leaving. I started interviewing, and it had been going great.

But since this is my first job, I am starting to think that this may not be a good reason to leave.

So I have a few questions..

*Questions:*

Is it even a good decision to leave this company? Is it normal for these types of things to happen?

Am I just being a baby or is it just that the management at my company is indecisive?

How it will look when I leave the job just 8 months after I joined?

Will I be blacklisted?

Is this a big problem? Will I look like a job hopper?

What can I do to not burn bridges that I cross?

**TL;DR**

After joining company in Feb, Every project I have worked on has been canceled time after time.

I'm a front end engineer, but opportunities for work in this domain seems to be limited."

I'm a Class of '22 admit to a HYP school that I currently attend. Stanford was my top choice but I didn't get in when I first applied; I was waitlisted, then rejected. At that time I didn't care because I was thrilled with my decisions anyway, but after a whole summer I've been having some doubts and would appreciate some feedback for my transfer reasons. 

1. I was originally a tentative economics major but after working at a tech company this fall in the Bay Area, I fell in love with CS. I liked the problem-solving, collaborative nature of being a programmer, especially in Silicon Valley, and am heavily considering pursuing CS as a major. Unfortunately, my university sucks when it comes to CS. It barely cracks the top 50. I think you know which school I'm talking about now. When I went to its admitted student weekend, I talked to a few CS majors and they highly discouraged coming here for CS, citing issues such as faculty shortages and the curriculum being too theoretical to getting internships or jobs at top companies. During my job this summer, it seemed as if everyone at the company looks down on the school I went to as ""subpar"" for CS, making jokes about it whenever I make mistakes. All in good humor, but I was wondering if going to that school would be a disadvantage for me in the tech field later, since I don't think I can afford going to grad school and getting a degree at another institution.      
2. Location is another factor. My parents are estranged and I've always lived with my dad, but my mom lives in the Bay Area and transferring to Stanford would give me the opportunity to visit her more often. I spent a lot of time with her for the first in a long time this summer and I feel sad knowing that I might not have as much time and flexibility to visit her in the future. She's getting old, and being at Stanford means I could visit her more often. 

Thank you for hearing me out. At this point it's not about prestige at all, but rather perceived fit. Trust me, I love the school I'm going to, but it might not be a good choice for me if I pursue CS. If it helps, I was selected as 1 of 161 U.S. Presidential Scholars since then, which I thought about but ultimately did not update Stanford on.  "

2. Similar question about your SOP, do you make some sort of a master SOP and then tailor it to different schools, or do you start from scratch for all of them? I'm applying to maybe 6 schools, so the latter does sound like quite a bit of work.
3. I clear the GPA cutoff by only a small margin, but it's low because of a bad grading policy that my recommenders can confirm. How do I address this in my statement?
4. As an undergrad, I don't have a lot of research experience, because of the lack of research culture here and because I spent my first two years focusing on doing projects and learning frameworks to build an industry CV.

# Every Business Is Just An Equation

A company is, fundamentally, an arrangement of cost and revenue variables that dictate its success. So, most can be reduced into a simple equation. Once stakeholders have a complete understanding of their company's variables, they can start to adjust the levers that control profitability and growth. 

At Square, Rabois and the team focused on isolating one variable in that much larger equation: cost per customer. They brainstormed ways to manipulate its output, like lowering incidences of fraud, reducing customer service inquiries, and renegotiating with partner companies.

By the time Square filed for its IPO, the company was reporting a 36.5% margin on its payment processing services—a number Rabois says was originally in the red.

For companies to continue to grow, it’s crucial for new hires to understand such business equations. That’s one of the most valuable skills Rabois looks for when he’s recruiting—that and the ability to use them for smart decision-making. He refers to these qualities simply as “strategy,” and if a person displays it in an interview—usually by asking questions that cut to the core of the business—he'll often hire them on the spot.

# To Grow Fast, Throw Out The Org Chart

Rabois has a special title for people who display high levels of strategic thinking: barrels. While some people are great team members who can contribute to a project—“ammunition” in Rabois' framework—barrels are people who can “take an idea from conception to execution.”

You need one barrel per initiative. A barrel may be supported by many team members, but the barrel understands the broader business context of a project, is responsible for collecting the right resources, and can independently make strategic decisions. As Rabois says, “They charge up the hill, and everyone comes with them.”

Apple's popular concept of a directly responsible individual (DRI) is a great example of this metaphor. An effective DRI is, in essence, a barrel, able to own the delivery of an entire initiative, and as a result, expand the company's overall bandwidth for production.

When reorganizing a company, Rabois starts by listing its problems next to its barrels, then connecting them one-to-one. As he explained, “Among many important things that Peter (Thiel) taught me at PayPal is: You've got to get your most talented people working on the most important problems, regardless of what it does to your organization chart.”

# A Simple System For Nurturing Talent

On the surface, Rabois' philosophy for nurturing top talent is simple. He gives them more and more responsibility until they either reach a point of failure or are capable of running the company.

It's an approach he learned from David Sacks, cofounder of Craft Ventures. “With every single employee, to your newest intern, you start with a very narrow scope of responsibilities,” Rabios says. “You prove their ability to discharge that, and then you constantly expand the range and difficulty of the challenges you give them.”

The key to carrying this out, though, hinges on a delicate balance: You'll need to give your employees the chance to test themselves—exactly what ambitious people want—while simultaneously reassuring them that reaching a personal point of failure is not a punishable offense. Rabois reiterates, “Everybody has some point of failure... Even someone like Elon (Musk).”

By using this system, Rabios says he's constantly shocked by which team members are able to “run things that you never would have guessed from their resume.” All employees have the chance to climb as high as they can, while still feeling safe at their limit.

# A Leadership System — Not A Leadership Style

Rabois told us that in one round of employee feedback, some team members described him as a “micromanager,” while others extolled the “incredible degrees of freedom” he gave them. It made him happy because he doesn't think you should ever have just one leadership style.

Instead, he has a decision-making process for delegating work that allows him to manage employees differently depending on his confidence in their plan of action. He considers two variables—the potential consequences of the decision and his own level of certainty about what the right decision is—and delegates accordingly:

*High risk/high certainty:* Step in, overrule, and take over the decision.
*High risk/low certainty:* Give more freedom, but collaborate on the decision.
- *Low risk/high certainty:* Delegate, but treat it as a learning experience for the team member.
- *Low risk/low certainty:* Delegate fully.

If Rabois is convinced a team member's plan of action is wrong, and there is a high risk-level associated with the work, he takes complete control. However, if he believes in the plan—or doesn't necessarily have a better plan himself—and stakes aren't too high, he completely delegates.

He also takes into account an employee's task-relevant maturity, a concept from Andy Grove's famous High Output Management, Rabois' favorite book on management. It is a gauge of how mature a team member's skills are in a specific niche. The more mature someone's task-relevant skills are, the more Rabois is willing to delegate.

# Simplicity Is Speed, And Speed Is Good

In his appropriately-titled essay ""Startup = Growth,"" Paul Graham offered this definition of a startup: “A startup is a company designed to grow fast.”

The key to speed, according to Rabois' framework, is simplicity. “Speed comes from simplicity. The more you can get your team to be instinctually reacting with high fidelity to your goals, the faster everything will fall into place,” Rabios says. “It's easy to deluge people with data and analysis. It's hard to tell people exactly what matters, what they need to do and the simple philosophy guiding it.”

Rabois' radically simple philosophy allows him to hire quickly. It allows him to address pressing problems quickly. Most importantly, it allows his employees to grow quickly. That leads to better results for the company and a better relationship with his team.

995jzp,0,2018-08-21,"I've had a change of mindset and am now actually looking forward to finishing college. I'm a creative type, and a good communicator/writer. Any recommendations for me? What's a marketing job like?",Spiner909,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/995jzp/ive_had_a_change_of_mindset_and_am_now_actually/,"So I recently earned my associate's degree in Social Science from my local community college. Sweet! Problem was, I've been putting off deciding what to do with it for a while. The way I was looking at college was akin to a tunnel. As in, I go pick a degree course, and now I'm locked in. I graduate, and look for employment in that field, and the rest of my life is now shaped by that one choice of deciding what to do.

But that's not the case today, and it probably never was, really. The modern career is so much more flexible and nebulous than that. Lots of people get hired into jobs that they didn't have a specific degree for, but rather relevant skills that they sold to the employer by convincing them that they would be a good fit.

Now, college isn't this scary, impossible choice that would doom me forever if I got it wrong. Now I view it as a place where I go to gain useful career skills, work experience (internships, etc), and garner contacts. After I graduate, it's up to me to market myself and experiment to find a career that will mesh well with me.

Ideally, I could transfer into the Sociology course of my local university. This is a great option for me, since it's close enough to commute and would save me a ton of money from moving somewhere. Now, I'm trying to look ahead and consider my options once I'm done with that.

I'm a creative type of person. Writing is one of my best strengths, without question. I'm a good communicator when it comes to essays, class presentations and the like. I'd also like to think that I'm OK with analytical/statistical stuff, though it could use some refinement.

Doing some research, I found an idea that I hadn't considered before - marketing. It's a creative position, but isn't just the design of creating ads, but rather the entire process of deciding what to sell, how to sell it, etc. This seems like it might actually be a pretty good fit for me. Does anyone have insight about this field? What's it like, how did you get into it?

The other thing on my mind lately is what I could minor in. I'm wondering if it would be better to specify myself a little more with another humanities option, or to broaden my skill set with something like computer science. Maybe a coding bootcamp would be a good option here.

I'm quite interested in criminal justice, for example. If I took one more class in the subject, I'd actually have a CJ associate's degree, as well. But I'm not interested in being a police officer, and most of the other jobs in the field seem to require a degree in law, which would be quite the commitment...I thought about a minor in law, but apparently that wouldn't even be enough to let you be a paralegal.

This was a bit of a ramble, but I'd greatly appreciate advice anyone has to offer."
995zjj,2,2018-08-21,[MD] [HS Math] - No job offers -- subbing and grad school on horizon. Advice wanted. (Warning: Long. TLDR at the end.),MelloMathTeacher,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/995zjj/md_hs_math_no_job_offers_subbing_and_grad_school/,"I'm not particularly happy that I don't have a full time math teaching job right now. I got my bachelor's in December and got called for a long-term sub position to replace an intern to finish the school year. With this experience under my belt as well as certification, I was confident that SOMEBODY would take me. But nobody did. Anyone from my area who got a full time HS math job with no experience, bite me. (Actually, don't, that could cause rashes.) 

As it stands, I'm still a district employee, and my official job title is ""substitute teacher."" I hear that short term subbing is a good way to become familiar with the schools, principals, and admin in the district, which could be helpful for next year's job cycle. The problem is that if I'm going to be subbing frequently enough to keep a somewhat steady rate of pay, I'm probably going to have to take classes that aren't math and/or high school. It will probably be a while before I can establish a reputation as a competent ""math teaching sub."" I'll contact the resource teachers of my student-teaching school and my long-term subbing school and ask their departments to keep an eye out for my name if they need a sub. Perhaps they can pass the message on to the rest of the high schools in the district. That would be nice. Anything else I should do to help my chances at landing a position next year?

I worked hard all summer preparing activities and guided notes for the upcoming school year's classes. Obviously, I am going to spend a great deal of time continuing to work on these. I've got textbooks, lists of skills and standards my district requires, but don't have access to the Google Doc given to math teachers with sample lessons to tweak. You think a math teacher at a school I happen to sub at that day would be willing to share these with me? (I had access while student-teaching and LTSing, but as I'm not listed as ""math"" at the moment, I was cut off from it. I called HR, they said that subs don't get them unless they are in a long-term math spot specifically) Or is this the sort of thing that could get me or the sharing teacher in trouble? 

Since apparently my bachelor's degree in mathematics and secondary education isn't good enough, I figured this would be a good time to get started on graduate school. I want to enter a program specifically for mathematics education. There are a few of them in my state. Two questions. 1) Do you think it's better to get an MA or MS in mathematics education? Does one have a better reputation than the other? (Both involve research methods and curriculum issues and stuff like that. MA classes require a thesis, which I've never done, while MS classes require rigorous proof-based classes like what I did in undergrad; e.g. abstract algebra, real analysis, topology, etc.) 2) None of the MA or MS programs in my state require the GRE. I'm not super confident about the Verbal portion (I was about 68th percentile on SAT Critical Reading), but the Quantitative Reasoning portion is a total joke and I'm confident that I can achieve a perfect score on it, or at a bare minimum, come really darn close. The problem is that a percentile chart I looked at tells me that from 2014-17, a perfect score is only 96th percentile, meaning at least 3% of test takers get a perfect score. Still impressive, but not truly remarkable. Is it worth spending 200 bucks to prove I can do math that is honestly easier than the math I taught last semester, and work on studying hard on the verbal portion, or should I just not even bother? 

Based on feedback I got from my students during student teaching and LTSing, I'm very good at explaining things clearly, diagnosing difficulty, simplifying complex topics, and I'm patient with struggling (though willing to learn) students. Some tell me that I'd be excellent at making video lectures and tutorials. In fact, when I described this feedback to an interviewing panel, a math RT said she ""certainly could see me doing well with that."" Subbing is much more about keeping things under control than about truly teaching. I'd like to be able to contribute to someone's learning, even if indirectly. Plus, I really enjoy teaching. Either from home or an empty college classroom, I could record some lectures based on the notes I'm writing just to see them in action so I can send something to other people, practice teaching in a room, and tweak my notes as needed. Maybe they'd come in handy in the future if I find that a flipped classroom model works better for me. 

TLDR

So, to summarize:

I'm going to be a short-term sub this year, hoping to establish myself as a math-teaching guy, so I can find a long-term math sub spot this year, and more importantly, a full-time math position next year. Any advice for me? 

I'm going to apply for graduate school to start toward my master's degree and renew certification. Is a MS or MA better for mathematics education?

Should I take the GRE even though I'm not required to? I'm confident I'd completely ace the quant section, but the verbal section is quite a bit closer to the center of the bell curve, and it'd be a time and money investment. 

Creating video lectures and tutorials based on my guided notes and activities (which I'm still constantly creating and updating), so that not only can I create more resources, but have a bit of fun, fill my desire to at least pretend to be a teacher, and rehearse lessons. Productive? Or a waste of time? 

Any other pieces of advice for this year or words of comfort? "

[You can read the first part here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/983ssc/my_personal_journey_and_nonexistent_college/)

___

It was April 2011 during my senior year at UT, and I had no idea what to do with my life. 

I had recently completed human rights work with genocide survivors in Bosnia and Rwanda. I had spent my first Christmas and New Year away from home, in East Africa. Years later, I still reflect on my month in the Land of a Thousand Hills as the most transformative and profoundly jarring experience of my life. 

Until that point, I had never conducted an hour of volunteer work or anything nominally called “service.” I left that Apply Texas section blank. I hurried back to Austin and, jetlagged, missed the first two classes of my final semester. Within a few days, I executed a series of life-changing decisions. 

I spent three hours each Tuesday and Thursday morning in UT swimming and weight lifting courses. Varsity baseball players in high school had made the weight room hell for me, and it felt good to move on from memories of bullying and start lifting again. I figured if Rwandese genocide survivors living with HIV in absolute poverty and running a community garden could eat healthily, I could finally shed my Sophomore Thirty. I had skipped the Freshman Fifteen.

I broke up with my long-time girlfriend. I stepped away from my Peace Corps invitation to teach English in Eastern Europe. I withdrew from the George H. Mitchell competition—UT’s most prestigious award for undergraduate research. I worried about disappointing my thesis advisor, at the time our second-highest-paid professor behind the Nobel physicist, who said of my thesis it was the single best he had ever received. 

Part of me felt I was “wasting my potential.” Despite being a favorite for the $20,000 top prize, I acknowledged deep down that I neither wanted to attend law school nor pursue graduate studies. I didn’t need the validation, and the money didn’t interest me.

More than that, I began not just questioning everything; I set fire to my beliefs. I began my process of “getting off the path” that continues today. I concluded my inch-thick thesis about ethnic cleansing in 1990s Yugoslavia by dismissing everything in the preceding 150 pages and instead sharing the stories of a few incredible heroes and survivors I had met. 

What was the point of academic research divorced from living, breathing people? Poring through thousands of pages of court testimony and legal documents could not substitute for listening, embracing, and learning from people I soon called friends. 

Even if I didn’t begin my career abroad or transition to graduate school, I had a feeling that I would be most happy if I were working with others. I didn’t realize that walking into the Undergraduate Admissions Office at John Hargis Hall for my first interview that April afternoon would be the first step toward finding my life’s calling: mentoring people navigating challenging and uncertain transitions. 

Like most of my colleagues working in college admissions, if you had asked me at eighteen, “Do you see yourself working in higher education four years from now?” I would have stared blankly. What’s “higher education?” 

Unless they worked as a student tour guide or ambassador, it is almost certain that the dozens of university representatives you see at college fairs never intended to work in college admissions. 
I was late to my interview because I didn’t know precisely the location of the admissions office. 

Like many prospective students and families attending those information sessions off Red River and MLK, I had trouble finding parking. I wore clothes borrowed from my trendy Business Honors roommate (thanks, David). I responded to the job posting thinking, That sounds pretty cool—be a Longhorn for a living. Why not apply?

My future boss and I chatted for over an hour and a half. I still didn’t have the first clue what a college admissions counselor did, but we got along well. Since I never did an internship, went to a job fair, or participated in interview workshops, my mom had to reassure me that no, it isn’t typical for an interview to last that long, and yes, that is probably a promising sign. 

In my final interview with the director of admissions and her second-in-command, I boldly answered, “Where do you see yourself in five years?” with, “I have no idea. If you make me commit to a two-year contract, I appreciate the opportunity but I am walking out the door.”

I erred toward sincerity rather than singing the tune of undying loyalty that employers typically want to hear. It worked. Sparing me the humiliation of prolonged under- and unemployment that many of my friends experienced during a weak economy, I received a phone call a few days before commencement. 

I was hired to be a UT-Austin Admissions Counselor working in the Dallas Regional Admissions Center. 

Whatever that meant.

Thank you all for this wonderful community. I've been lurking a long time.  I am in need of your advice.

I am a 29 year old first year computer science student. I have completed the one and only programming class required for my specific associate degree to transfer to a four year school.  The programming class gave me a very basic foundation in c++. I am not sure if I want to continue with my school education.

I have been learning a lot on my own through online tutorials and books over the summer. I've also began to scratch the surface on web development with HTML and CSS. The rest of my associates, roughly 40 hours, is mostly math and other classes I have no interest in. I've applied to several student internships to no avail. 

I have a few questions.

1. Does a basic foundation in c++ qualify me for any sort of internship? I'd be willing to work for free.
2. If the answer is yes, where should I be looking?
3. Is it worth it to continue with my degree?

So I thought I'd share some of my stats to maybe give people a better idea of PhD admissions but I want to stress that graduate admission committees really look at a lot of factors so take anything you see with a grain of salt. When applying, I stressed that I wanted to change fields and only had the vaguest idea of what I wanted to do. As such, I mostly applied to umbrella programs that would give me flexibility in my first year of rotations before committing.

**Undergraduate**: University of Washington

**Major**: Biochemistry and Chemistry BS

**GPA**: 3.80/4.00

**GRE**: 154V/166Q/5.5W (65/91/98 percentile), no subject test (wasn't needed although recommended by several schools)

**Research experience 1**: 3+ years of undergraduate research in the same lab working on my own project. Worked primarily in structural biology and spectroscopy.

**Research experience 2**: One summer internship in industry, where I worked on developing new methods to identify unsafe and safe doses of various cancer drugs the company was developing.

**Letters of rec**: (1) PI at my main undergraduate lab (2) My graduate student mentor who, at the time, had not earned their PhD yet (3) Professor I was close with whom I took an undergraduate and graduate level course with.

**Personal Statement**: These were pretty standard across all my schools. I opened with a quippy intro into why I liked doing research and transitioned into a short summary of how my experience (primary research experience 1/2) led me down the path of research. The next two paragraphs would talk in more detail about my research and would tie back to the overarching reason I wanted to do research. The fourth paragraph talked about why I wanted to attend said institution. I would identify 2 faculty whose research I though interesting and give a short explanation for why, and then talk about how the location or other aspects of the program fit my interests. And finally, I would end with more poetic sounding reasons I felt the PhD and the program was right for me. 

**THE RESULTS:**

The Rockefeller University - Rejected w/o interview

Columbia University - Accepted

Stanford University - Rejected w/o interview

University of Pennsylvania - Accepted

University of Wisconsin - Madison - Accepted

University of California - San Francisco - Rejected w/o interview

Weill Cornell - Rejected w/o interview

University of Colorado, Denver - Rejected after interview

University of Pittsburgh - Rejected after interview

**Looking back:**

Before applying I asked several professors who I knew had served on adcoms what they thought my chances were. They pointed to most of the schools in the top as being reachy, but not impossible. I think that when applying, don't go for too many safety schools as I've heard adcoms will reject people solely because they think they'll be accepted somewhere better. In other words, schools won't waste an acceptance on someone if they feel like they're getting into somewhere they know will be more attractive for them. Don't sell yourself short (and waste money) when applying and maybe refrain from filling in the section of the application that asks where else you've applying (unless it's required). I hope this helps other people, because I remember going into interviews and seeing people with masters degrees or publications and feeling utterly unprepared. I mean, here I was basically having cruised through 3 years of research without any hugely consequential results compared to my peers. Their research just sounded so much more impactful than mine, I really felt like I had no shot. This reddit thread probably doesn't help much either. 

And finally, some people on here ask where to get letters of recommendation. Most people will say graduate students simply can't write good letters. And for the most part, I think that's true. Professor, assistant professor, these titles matter to adcoms. But I asked my graduate student mentor to coordinate her letter with my PI so that both didn't say the same thing and for my PI to check for quality. In the end, I felt my grad student mentor could write me a good letter because we had worked closely for so long. She had nurtured me from a naive freshman to a (semi) independent scientist. I felt that her perspective on my growth could offer valuable insight to adcoms! So when you're choosing your letters, don't shy away from the unconventional. Just remember that each letter should have a reason behind them. Don't just randomly pick professors that you happen to know. 

In the end, I chose Columbia! Any other questions, just let me know!"

Hey friends,

I'm a 22 year old studying CS in the Bay Area. I'm currently on track to graduate by May of next year, which would mean applying to full-time positions right now to start work next Fall. However, I've recently come off a year-long withdrawal from school to deal with some personal issues. That, combined with a dropping gpa (&lt;3.0 technical) before withdrawing, as well as having only had one software dev internship at a mid-tier company, makes me think that it'll be nigh impossible for me to land a $120k+ job at a top tier company (FAANG et al).

Because of this, I'm considering spending an extra year in school. On the plus side, this would give me time to get one/two more solid internships under my belt, as well as a 3.3+ gpa and potential research work with professors. (I've also taken some French classes, and the extra year would let me finish up a second degree in French.)
On the negative side, however, I'd have been in school for almost 6 years. Employers could see this as a sign of laziness, lack of ambition, and inability to handle pressure (they wouldn't be entirely wrong, either, judging from my past). If I explain to them I wanted to finish French, it could show I'm not as passionate about tech as other applicants, and wasn't able to handle a full CS course load.

I've thought about getting as good a job as I can get for next year, then trying to switch to a better company afterwards. However, from what I've seen it's wayy harder to get into FAANG as a working professional than as a new grad.

Anyway, this is what I'm struggling with right now. Have been reaching out to my advisors, friends who are working, and industry professionals, but it's been hard to get responses and I really value yall's perspective.

Thanks for reading, any advice would be much appreciated."

This past summer I had what I felt was a really successful internship as an application developer at a company that was awesome to work for. They've since offered me a full time position at a salary I think is fair, and a total compensation package that is definitely fair/above average.  
  
However, I live in Georgia and the company is in North Carolina, and the sign-on bonus is only $3500, which wouldn't be enough to put a down payment on an apartment, live for a month, move all my stuff up there, pay for a month's rent, etc. There's almost no way - unless I put a down payment on a cardboard box, that is.  
  
So I brought it up during a phone call with the recruiter from the NC office (who I've never met, I did my internship in their PA office). She gave me a standard ""there's nothing we can do."" So I said nothing for a few moments, and she said ""but I'll send your concerns to your program manager."" Could be good, but very unlikely, imo.  
  
That was a week ago, and I have until October 1st to make a decision. I'm writing up an email to continue the discussion and **would really appreciate feedback: do you think I'm coming off as petty? Is this the right way to go about this?** My feelings are... they've already spent tens of thousands on me, and it would cost them many tens of thousands more to find another me, and I told her the offer is otherwise very fair, I'm just genuinely concerned I'd be roughing it if I accepted a low sign-on bonus like that.  
  
Here's the email so far:  
&gt;&gt; Dear Ms. RecruiterLastName,  
  
&gt;&gt; I hope you're doing well!  
I know you've worked hard to provide a comprehensive offer, and trust me, I appreciate that and recognize the honest culture at CompanyName that I grew to love over the summer.  
  
&gt;&gt; I'm excited to hear back about working with me a bit on the signing bonus, given how far I'll be moving and how incredible a fit we are as employer / employee. Considering what a down payment on an apartment requires in the area, a month's rent, cost of living, moving my current apartment 200 miles up to Charlotte, and other unexpected costs that I know from experience come with this process, I'd have no hesitation signing this offer if we could agree on a much more comfortable $5500.  
  
&gt;&gt; I am confident I'll continue to contribute to Company's mission, as I did over the summer with my efforts toward the health care cost estimator and data analytics dashboards that now serve as an example for future endeavors. I look forward to talking soon so we can move forward and finalize this incredible opportunity!  
  
&gt;&gt; Sincerely,  
First Last

In advance I just want to thank anybody who takes the time to read this and posts a reply, I really appreciate it. I graduated back in 2016 from a large state school with an B.Sc. deg in Economics (graduated with honors, 3.5+ gpa). Was taking a lot of premed courses on the side because I wasn’t too sure of whether I was interested in healthcare or banking/policy research. In undergrad I had the opportunity to work for a small state based non profit as the financial director and got some semiprofessional experience for 2 years doing that as well as founded and designed a large event on my university’s campus while recruiting and managing the entire board working the event. During my senior year I ended up getting accepted to medical school so decided to pursue that opportunity and after a year I realized that this path was not for me and didn’t think it’d give me fulfillment in the long term. 

Took a few months off to find out what I was really looking for in a career and am really interested in working in corporate banking research or financial analytics with eventual goals of going back to school and attaining a further degree in Economics. With that said, I’ve been looking for a job now for about 4 months now and have not had any luck at all. I’ve easily sent in over 200 applications around the US looking for entry level positions in sales and finance and have only had a handful of phone interviews with only a few in person interviews that didn’t end up being fruitful. I can’t help but think that my lack of internship experience in undergraduate is what is really holding me back from getting my foot in the door anywhere.

Really looking for some sound advice on places to be looking for full time employment and other potential things I can do to get myself a full time position. I’m getting to the point where I’m really willing to do anything in a corporate environment even internship positions for the time being. Any advice is really appreciated, thanks again!"

I have recently received my Computer Science BS but I've also been working as a software development intern for 3 years (started in my sophomore year). 

This was a pretty fantastic internship because I was soon working as a regular developer with decent-ish hourly pay while writing features/fixing bugs using mostly C# and .NET. This has left me with quite a bit of legitimate development experience. I enjoy C# and .NET and intend to continue in that realm for quite some time.

But now I'm not really sure what I'm worth. I do think I should be rewarded for my hard work by earning a higher salary than a new undergrad with no experience, I'm just not sure how to quantify 3 years of internship experience. How should I go about this so that I don't undersell myself?

Any opinions are welcome. Thank You."

I've got a real problem; I really am not sure what to do. I like a lot of things, but I've never really delved too deeply into any one subject, and my lack of direction is damaging and stunting my growth as a programmer. The CS degree at my university is in all honesty, not so great, and never really provided me with an opportunity to explore any area with much depth. 

Not being able to direct myself into a particular field has been hurting my internship/future job search as well. How do I know where I want to work if I can't even find a subject that's really interests me? Has anyone been in a similar situation, and if so, how did you eventually ""come to""?

Totally desperate.

I have pretty severe GAD and depression, and over the years (and the last few years in particular) I've had a very hard time managing it and its affected my ability to do necessary daily activities in a major way. For the last few years I haven't been able to hold a job/go to school for more than a couple months without having some sort of breakdown that lead to me leaving. I'm very privileged to have family that helps me financially and encourages mental health treatment, if I didn't I'd probably be homeless, in prison, or dead.

I've pretty much done it all at one point or another when it comes to mental health treatment (both inpatient and outpatient) but I was pretty much at my lowest point I've ever been early this year, (I had cut myself off from literally every relationship I had besides family and was very isolated, and had just left my third job in 6 months) so I decided to go to an outpatient program at a particular hospital that my therapist recommended that has a really good reputation for treating anxiety disorders in a more personalized way, so I decided to give it a shot since I didn't know what else to do. It ended up being a really good decision because I found it incredibly helpful and felt like I learned a lot about managing my anxiety, and I did a lot of exposure therapy and got myself in the habit of actually doing anxiety provoking things instead of avoiding them (which is the biggest issue I have). I had reconnected with a lot of old friends and also made some new ones through that experience. I was in a better mindset than I had been in years.

Shortly after I got out of that program I started working on a relatively short certification at a community college and I got through all of the coursework and even got pretty good grades. For the first time in years I thought that maybe I can actually function like a normal human and get through day-to-day stuff. But then this week I started a short internship for that certification. Obviously was anxious about it but I felt like I was doing well and I wouldn't let things be debilitating this time. Day 1 I was a nervous wreck but I got through the first half of the day and I thought things were going pretty well. I was fairly awkward socially but I thought I was doing a good job with the work (considering it was my first day) and I got along with everyone okay. I'm basically there to learn and gain experience and I was expecting and wanted constructive criticism in my work, and the person I worked with the first half of the day did a good job of giving criticism without being condescending or aggressive or anything like that. But then the second half of the day I worked with someone else and she was mostly fine but she was a bit more harsh with her critique on how I was doing and it made it more difficult for me to focus, which made my performance even worse, which made me even more anxious. I was like on the verge of a panic attack but I thought I could get through it until she straight up said how visibly nervous I looked and that I needed to ""not be so nervous"" because it was negatively impacting the patients/customers. I pretty much just shut down inside at that point and every instinct I had was just telling me I needed to get out of there even though I knew that I couldn't do that without ruining everything I had worked so hard for, but instead of getting through it like I had been able to over the past 6 months I let the anxiety be debilitating and I just bolted out and had a long panic attack in my car. When this sort of thing happens I get incredibly bad anxiety about explaining myself and with most jobs I've had where this happens I just straight up never come back or speak to anyone at the workplace again because that seems like a better alternative than explaining that i'm such a mess that I can't get through one fucking day without having debilitating anxiety/panic attacks. And that's what I've done in this case too. I knew I was making a mistake but I just couldn't overcome the anxiety. To say i'm disappointed in myself would be an understatement. I've been semi-confident going into things that I've messed up before but this time really felt like it was different. I had worked so hard and so much has lead up to this and for me to just screw it up on the FIRST DAY is just incredibly demoralizing and just reassures my previous mindset that I am literally incapable of basic functioning, holding a job, or eventually supporting myself financially. I just feel like I've had every resource possible available to me to help myself and get better but I still can't overcome this. I am at a whole new level of hopelessness and lack of self-confidence. I haven't even told my family or friends about what happened yet because I've already done this so many times and it's incredibly embarrassing to explain this sort of thing, and it'll be even worse this time. Honestly i'm just incredibly depressed and suicidal and I don't know what to do. Is there any hope for me at all? I just don't feel like I'll ever be able to function like a normal human or hold a job or support myself, and honestly being dead just seems like a better alternative than living my whole adult life dependent on my parents or whatever other option I have.

I don't even think i'm looking for advice or anything I just wanted a space that I can express what my situation is and vent. If you actually read all of this, thank you."

I texted her Saturday, and she said she would pay me the next day, Sunday. Sunday came and I didn’t hear from her.

I texted her yesterday (Tuesday) at 11AM asking for her to pay me back “soon” and she left my message on read. I texted her again that evening around 8pm asking her to pay me by noon today (Wednesday) and never got a response.

What do I do? I have a feeling she’s just going to keep ignoring me. I want to start looking for someone else, but I don’t know who might want to join a random group of friends for a concert. It’s “only” $60 I’d be losing if she doesn’t pay, but I’m just not in a place where I can easily dispose of that money.

I’m really confused because she did pay for 1/2 so I’m assuming she or her boyfriend intend on coming. She said she was waiting for her parents to send her money (still dependent and doing an unpaid internship), but that was weeks ago. I hate lack of communication, but this is especially bothersome because it’s money that I really need back. I’m moving out of state for grad school soon and was planning on using that money to pay for shipping.

Any advice would be great!

Tldr; I bought concert tickets for me and friends and one hasn’t paid back nor responded to my text messages. I can’t afford to take the loss and am not confident I’ll find someone to replace her in time for the concert on Saturday. What should I do?

First of all, didn't happen yet but I want to now my options.

I've been an intern for the past year and a half at this big company. They informed me that I would stay and in a couple of days I will sign contract to be effective. This is all good, the reason I'm here to ask for advice for how I should deal with this next bit.


So, when you sign from intern to effective you can be promoted to the next level or you can't. I came to the company with a few people and they already signed, one got promoted the rest didn't. Now, in a couple of days it will be my turn and I have no idea if I will be promoted (if not now, I will get promoted at the end of the year).


I don't like what I do, I was only here for the money and the prospect of being promoted, and if I'm not, my interest on being here will go to zero. But I like the company, so leaving the company is not in my mind. 


If I'm not promoted, how should I proceed? 
I'm thinking of talking with my manager to be relocated to another project, one of my interest (there are some projects inside the company I would like to engage), but they need me here and this could take months as they will probably delay. Should I talk to HR as soon as I see they are no making any enfort to reallocate me? Being reallocated will have a negative impact on being promoted at the end of the year?

If not promoted, I feel like my work here is not being valued even though I always go the extra mile and try to be always ready and available to help. I have a lot of responsibilities and work to do, and I feel it's unfair if I'm not promoted..

​

I have a couple of questions that I'm hoping you all can get answer before I go back to my employer to negotiate my pay.

​

Background:

This summer, I did an internship for company X at research park, and was paid \~$19/hr for the work that I was doing. From what I could tell, my manager was very happy with the results of my project. As a result, I was offered a part-time position for the school year but on a different team. I just received my offer letter yesterday, and it says that I will be paid \~$16/hr. So I have a few questions about this.

​

Questions:

* Should I be asking for the same amount/more than I was paid before, even though it is a part-time job?
* For those of you who have worked as programmers in research park, what were you paid as a part-time employee?

We don't give them access to any sensitive areas, admin accounts and exposure to management requests. We try to give them some experience with networking/OS/software/hardware/documentation/customer support, etc.

There are times where we are too busy to assign tasks so it is nice to have a pre-determined 'tasklist' that we can refer back to when we don't have time to create really functional tasks for the department/intern/student. 

We always give introductory tasks such as the below, but what they get depends on if it is an intern or work experience student. 

* Create documentation (things like how to use 7zip, etc) for company intranet
* Break down old computers/servers for retiring or rebuilding
* Shadow helpdesk staff/help with staff projects
* Review knowledgebase articles and ticket solutions on helpdesk to become aware of our environment
* Re-cable desks of staff on holidays (call center area that suffers cable-creep too easily)
* Computer maintenance on unused computers (ccleaner, defrag, upgrade RAM etc)

Can anyone add more?

​

I turned 18 two weeks ago and I'm going into 2nd year of University in September. I am not eligible for OSAP (Government funding) because of my parent's income even though they're divorced. My family can be considered mid-upper of middle class. I am **not** receiving any active financial support from my parents, but I do have an RESP. I will do a run down of my past employment + net worth below.

​

**Income**

Age 14-17 | Worked part time for the City as a skating instructor (very limited hours). I earned about $15,000 total.

Age 13-17 | Did a lot of freelance work online - Graphic design, digital design, web design/development, game-related coding. I earned about $25,000 total.

Age 17-18 | I've been into cryptos for a while but never invested heavily into it. I put about $6,000 into various cryptos in Sept and Oct 2017 (because of some whisperings of huge spike in some communities im in), and by January it was worth about $25,000. I cashed out $15k and now have \~$3500 in cryptos (value down from 10k)

​

**Expenses**

First year of University (2 terms, 8 months) costed me approx. $17,600:

Tuition - $6,420

Residence - $10,506 (Includes 3 meals a day)

Textbooks - $212.50 (I bought them all used ayy)

Various other expenses (Extra meals, snacks, laundry, hardcore online shopping) - \~$500

I also built a new PC because mine was getting very old, and I needed something stronger to do media editing. I also live-stream video games. $2000

Going on dates and buying presents approx. $500

Total expenses Fall 2017 - July 2018: approx. $20,000

​

**Net Worth**

Liquid Assets - I currently have approx.

$3,000 in chequings

$5,000 in savings (trying not to touch)

$1,500 in cash, stashed in various places in case of emergency

\-----------------------------

$9,500 total

​

Non-Liquid Assets

$3,500 in various cryptocurrencies

$12,000 in RESP

$1,600 in Gold

\---------------------------

$17,100 total

​

**My Situation**

I am currently unemployed but have applied for positions near my school. I'm hoping for a skating instruction position where I can make $17.50 and hour, but if that falls through I will go for a minimum wage position elsewhere.

I'm in a 5-year bachelors program. 8 academic terms + 5 co-op terms. My program is Honours Arts and Business. I'm studying psychology as my major with a specialty in Behavioral Psychology and a minor in Sociology. I originally wanted to do a double degree in something that would give me qualifications for Computer Science because I have an interest in Artificial Intelligence. **Because of a brain trauma in October 2017, my cognitive speed has dropped by more than 75% and I still haven't recovered.** When the incident first occurred, I couldn't string a sentence together for a few days, and couldn't do any math (single digit or otherwise) for almost a month. I still have issues with verbal communication. I went from a 98% studying about 30 mins - 1 hour a day to studying 5 hours a day and getting 60% average.

I have to push back my co-op terms due to my brain trauma, so I'm planning to string 2 or 3 of them together, and do an 8-month or 12-month co-op. Getting an opportunity overseas is also an option if the conditions are good enough and expenses low enough.

I have a family connection in my local Google regional office and I am trying to get a co-op there as an intern with their Artificial Intelligence research team. At this point, due to my brain trauma, I doubt that it will happen. Before my injury, it was quite likely that I would get the position.

First year generally costs more than any other year (unless I go for a graduate degree). I'm hoping to spend $15,000 per academic year or less.

​

**My Questions**

*How can I begin to save money effectively?* I plan to start a spreadsheet tracking all my income and expenditure. This will also help me to hold back from impulse spending because seeing it on paper will make me feel bad :(

*Once I get a job, how much of my money should go into future savings vs. education savings?*

*At this point in my life, should I be considering investments?*

*Is it too early to consider saving for retirement, maybe in very small deposits? (i.e Education savings, post-graduate savings, AND retirement savings)*

*Any other general tips for a University Student?*

​

Recently my life has pretty much fallen apart. For almost two years I was helping care for my dad who had been diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. During that time I had finished an Associates degree, gotten and finished a year long internship with one company and took on contracting with another, while my dad had been doing extraordinarily well on chemotherapy and was mostly independent. Back in March my dad had an operation that went poorly and as a result, he was off of chemo for a total of three months including the time leading up to his surgery. While trying to balance caring for him and work, my employer chose not to renew my contract even knowing the situation. A month later, my dad passed away.

​

This whole time I had been living at home, and had been even through school. With my mom having passed away a few years ago, my dad and I let the house (actually a manufactured home) fall into disrepair and clutter, by now to a point where it's not even worth spending the money to repair it. On top of all of this, it turns out my dad had been lying to me about his financial problems. For one, now that his estate is going through probate there is an IRS lien on the property because he didn't pay his taxes (he worked up from home up until shortly before he passed). Dad also didn't have any kind of life insurance, and has left behind little in terms of assets. I am trying to sell what I can to pay for legal fees for dealing with his estate as well as other legal expenses, but much of what is valuable is tied up in his estate, and in my state (SC) all estates are settled through the probate court even with a written will. However, it is very likely that I will no longer be able to live at my current home. On top of this, my dad left behind his two elderly dogs.

​

So this all leads into the meat of my question: I know that it's very unlikely I will continue being able to live where I am, if I even should. I currently only have an Associates degree with a small amount of work experience, and have had an employment gap since my contract ended. I have been trying to find work since that contract ended with only a handful of interviews and no offers. I'm drawing just enough from unemployment to survive. I have to either be able to accommodate two dogs wherever I'm living or give them up to a local Humane Society. Would I be better off finding a way to go back to school and get a BS in CS or software engineering or *something*, or should I take what savings I have, get an apartment, and pray I get an offer before my money runs out?"

I am a senior in college graduating next Spring. I will be obtaining a B.S in Computer Information Systems. At my school, this program is located in the College of Business. A brief description of my major can be found here:

 ""The **B.S. in Computer Information Systems (CIS)** prepares students for IS development and support careers in business and government.

Graduates of this program are not only technically competent, but understand how to use information technology to facilitate business success.

Courses include projects designed to enhance critical thinking, oral and written communications, and teamwork skills.

Students are introduced to ethical and global issues by studyng CIS business cases.

Typical employment for graduates includes systems analysis, system administration, and application or web development.""

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I have done roughly 2.5-3 years of internships doing Help Desk Support. I am currently working as an IT Technician for a small MSP in my town. I have interned at a wealth management firm and also a Fortune 500 company, both gaining great experience on how those businesses worked and experienced different sides/departments of IT.

After taking a systems analysis class, I am interested in going down that route and getting into that field of an ""Analyst"". I do not see myself doing Support my whole career, which is why I want to change of pace once I get my degree and try and get more on the ""business"" side of IT.

Does anyone have any tips for me? Any recommendations or things I should be doing before I graduate? Certifications?

I had a phone call from an HR person yesterday. I was taken by surprise when she asked my salary expectations, and replied 32-36k euros (gross) per year.
In retrospect, this seems like a low range for the position of Project Manager/Consultant, and I am wondering if I can tip the scale upward a little, toward 35-40k.

As far as I can see, should the interview go well, my options are:
1) accept something within that range, but enquire about other benefits (bonus, bus pass, hiring bonus...)
2) sign the contract, then check how much my colleagues make and go to HR afterwards
3) not mention it any further

What would you do?

I'm about to be a 2nd year CS student at the University of Waterloo in Canada. If you're unfamiliar, Waterloo is very big on internships. My program includes 6 four month internships before graduation. Because of this its not uncommon to have a new internship every 4 months with school in between. I've finished first year and am winding down my first internship this summer. Overall, I wasn't happy with my first year. I struggled in some of my math courses, and my first internship wasn't very helpful.

I programmed a decent amount in high school, so coming into this internship, I had some development skills. They had me making applications using tools similar to Squarespace, that don't really involve coding. This was not in my job description, but I was already stuck with the job. I was not happy with this, so about two months in, I decided enough was enough. Ever since I've become completely obsessed with making sure my next internship (next summer), will be better.  In my free time, I learned enough node to make a full stack application. I took the app I was making at work, and remade it from scratch with authentication and a database. I showed it to my boss, he liked it, and that has become my job for the rest of the summer.

Since completing this project, I remade my website, followed some React tutorials, learned some Python, did easy Leetcode problems and read parts of a couple of data structures and algorithms books. I feel tremendous pressure to bolster my resume with as many frameworks and tools as I can in hopes that I'll get more interviews next time. However, I feel like I'm not learning the truly important skills. I'm in such a hectic rush to piece together impressive projects, I don't have the patience to learn the little things properly. Sure I can throw together a bunch of libraries and frameworks with code I stole from Stack Overflow, but I don't really understand how it all works or retain much. I change my priority everyday, read every ""how I got an internship at big N company"" blog post I can find, and don't enjoy learning like I used to.

I guess my question is, with your personal experiences in mind, with another internship season looming, how do I take my time and focus on learning properly. Or maybe I should just bite the bullet, make some more for show projects and grind Leetcode all day? Either way, any insight from those of you who've gone through this would be appreciated. Thanks."

I'm starting my undergrad research internship soon in the field of microbiology. More specifically archaea biology of methanogens. We work with bioreactors, aerobic chambers, a general molecular biology lab, etc. Our PI is on holiday and I don't know anyone in the lab yet that I could contact about this in advance.

Here's my dilemma. I have a very crappy Linux Mint which I managed to royally screw up while experimenting with the terminal and system folders. (I've learned a bit but also have no functional drives now, yeah smart I know) So I would already plan on booting a newer version.

Now, according to the software you use most in your lab, which OS would you recommend? (not including Mac, which is too expensive for me right now) 

Should I stick with Linux and just get a better distribution or is windows better for you to use in the lab? Do the software you use in your lab have a version for both? 

Do I do a dual boot? Is windows really needed? (Considering it's not cheap either)

I need some advice...

I've just retrieved an offer at a company I want to work at. I am going into my senior year of college. The unfortunate thing is they have only given 3 days to accept the offer. I have already asked for more time. Waiting to hear back.

&amp;#x200B;

I have 5 prior years of internships, the last of which is at that company.  I still won't be graduating school for another 10 months, so I just started applying to companies. I have a few interviews as I leave the internship, two of which are with 'Big N' companies who reached out to me. The reason I am listing this out is I am trying to justify why I think I am above average candidate. I might not be, in my head I am just trying to justify.

Without any job offers, will I sound like a crazy person trying to negotiate salary?  Its so early I haven't even begun interview to hopefully/potentially get competing offers for leverage. I am hoping they will grant me more time, but if not I need to prepare.

What is a realistic negotiation percentage? There is a part of me that feels like I am going to be seen as a 'kid' and they will just laugh if I say I should get payed more. Is there kinda a standard way to pinpoint in your area what the average pay is? GlassDoor?

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking at the salary range for the companies Software Engineer 1 in my area. I definitely am not at the bottom of it, but I am not at the top. I don't know if it would be crazy to ask to be near the top of that.. at this company I think within a year or two they bring you to Software Engineer 2.. so I don't think I am comparing data from people who have been in the company for a while.

How would you word a request for more money? Any of these questions would be huge!

You are given a ""container"" and various shapes and you are tasked with fitting those shapes perfectly into said container. I got the idea from this puzzle game from Target  https://www.amazon.com/Brainwright-Cat-Stax-Perfect-Puzzle/dp/B01016ARTQ  .

I have already put a lot of time into the project and it solves 2 dimensional problems very quickly and consistently, but I have run into some struggles with 3 dimensional objects. It solves inconsistently, sometimes with a quick solution being spit out, sometimes after minutes of waiting, or sometimes after such a long wait that I kill the program before a solution is returned.

I'm looking for advice on the project, and I find articulating my questions and ideas is hard through writing, and I was hoping to meet with a teacher at the local community college or maybe popping by a college campus and dropping on a professor, or just finding someone that has tackled this sort of problem before. 

Can someone give me a name for this sort of problem I am trying to solve? Is it more of a mathematical problem? Or is it strictly computer science? Is it game theory (I don't even know if game theory applies here)?  And I was also wondering if could gauge how difficult this problem is to solve. If you have any experience in writing programs that are to ""solve"" games, I would love your input.

I was in a hallway using my person laptop for purposes of the summer camp and one of the children in the camp tripped over me and broke my laptop. There was plenty of room for people to walk by, and the summer camp did not provide me with a work computer to use. I talked to the Executive Director about it and they told me their insurance would not be able to cover the replacement based on how the accident happened. I was wondering what legal action if any I could take to get them or the kids parents to pay for it. "

99ise8,1,2018-08-22,Fixing to have a big problem with excess credits before I graduate with my AA. Any advice?,ThomasGalbridge,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/99ise8/fixing_to_have_a_big_problem_with_excess_credits/,"Okay, so my situation sounds a little complicated, but I'll try my best to be brief, sorry. For my first year and a half at a community college, I was in an A.S. Digital Media program to go for graphic design, but found that I enjoyed programming even more than designing hence chose to go into Computer Science. My second year just ended, and I'm now advancing forward with my math. However, the classes I took in the AS program transferred as electives to my Computer Science transcript. I wasn't worried about this, yet, but was aware that I may face Excessive Credit surplus during my last few semesters at UCF. However, what I didn't know and was so blind to was the fact that I can take only 150% of what my program allows, which is 90 total credits to qualify under aid in my AA program.

​

I'm currently at 58 credits, and am taking Pre-Calc, Trig, Programming Logic (Python) and American Government. I'm almost done with my Gen-Eds, but it appears the math and science classes may be a problem. Once this term ends, I'll have 70 credits total. Then, at the next term, I'll be taking Calc I, General Physics (Required to take required University Physics I + Lab), C++ Programming, and Chemistry Fundamentals (Required for Gen. Chemistry + Lab). In a total of that term, I'll have 82 credits. At the final term which I can have aid, I'll be taking Calc II, Physics I + Lab, Chemistry + Lab, and my last Gen-Ed class which should be 14 credits total. That will mean that I've got 96 credits after next year's fall, hence, I won't be covered any more.

​

My financial director said for me to worry about this when the fall comes, but I feel like now's the time to develop a plan. My grant usually covers my tuition, so I'm not in any debt thus far, but it won't matter since I won't have any more loans and will have to pay for the last remaining classes in cash. He said the other option would be to write an appeal and see if it gets accepted for me to be covered, but that may not be likely, since I've been told it's usually granted for people who had an emergency reason. The latter choice would be to look for scholarships, which I'm now starting to do. I worked an internship for the past year, and it gave me a grant to cover a semester (A normal semester here costs $1250 on average).

​

However, my grants usually give me a check of left-over money, which is $2500-3000 every semester. I feel like I have a better chance of be able to take the final classes, which are Physics II+Lab, Calculus III and Differential Equations with that left-over money. I think the best decision out of all of this would be to look for scholarships and put the left-over grant money in my savings account. I live in Florida, and we have an FSU campus across the street from our college which requires us only take up to Calc II and Physics II. However, I want to go to UCF in Orlando which requires that I take Calc III and Diff Eq. I figured that because I'll graduate with my AA with over 100 credits, I may risk excess credit surplus at UCF but my financial advisor told me that I'll be covered until I reach 180 credits in the BS Program.

​

I didn't know what I was doing my first year of college, and I can't undo my mistakes. Becoming a software engineer has been a dream of mine, and I've been really trying to kick it with these last semesters. I don't want to work a whole semester, taking the risk of life catching up with me and demotivating me from furthering school. I just can't allow that, because I want to go far in life.

​

Do you think my plan could work? Are there any better ways, or recommended advice?

99k97u,0,2018-08-23,AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDING CONSENT AND RELEASE FORM FOR TEACHER EDUCATION INTERNS,templateshunter,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/99k97u/audio_and_video_recording_consent_and_release/," This year (school name) is hosting teaching intern, (intern name), from Plymouth State University, under the mentorship of an experienced teacher and a Plymouth State University supervisor. As part of the teaching internship, teaching interns must demonstrate and reflect on what they know and are able to do as teachers by fulfilling the requirements of the New Hampshire Teacher Candidate Assessment of Performance (NHTCAP). 

The NHTCAP requires teacher interns to examine lesson plans, assessment, and instruction, which include audio- video recording teacher candidates, to assess their expertise and effectiveness.  This requirement is the result of a proactive approach to current educational trends toward accountability and increasing the rigor of teacher preparation, and has the full endorsement of New Hampshire’s Commissioner of Education and State Board of Education. 

It is crucial that we protect the privacy rights of our students and their families and respect the conditions under which schools allow us access to their classrooms and students. For this reason, we seek permission from families to include their child in the audio-video recorded segments of instruction. The permission granted for videos/photos is predicated on limited use; that is, to be shared solely between the interns, mentor teacher, supervisor, PSU faculty, and, in some cases, other New Hampshire university teacher preparation faculty for purposes of each intern’s instructional requirements, assessment, and professional development. Interns will be able to use these images to assess their own instruction but will require permission from the parent/guardian of the student captured in these images. The use of such recordings is strictly limited to the context of the intern coursework requirements and assessment under the NH TCAP. At no time will any of these video recordings or photos be posted on public media, social media, social networking, or any publically accessible Internet sites. 

Please indicate your preference and sign below:

\_\_\_\_I do give my permission for \[name of intern\], the teaching intern in my child’s classroom at (school name) to include my child in audio and/or video record segments of her/his classroom instruction.

​

New guy on the block here, trying to become a poweruser while doing an internship. At the moment i am analyzing a bunch of sales reports to figure out which of the products/services are the ones that makes up the most of the revenue of the company.

The exports from the CRM system are divided into 3 categories: Product, Services and Packages. I cannot merge these all together, as there are different data in each datasets. Therefor i have one worksheets for each of them.

​

I have made a PivotTable on a separate sheet called Dashboard, where i have made all the product categories, service categories and also package categories to show the percentage of the grand total from each sheet.

​

What i would like to do is also see what the percentage looks like of the grand total of all three sheets combined. I have made another cell with the simple formula ""=GrandTotalPivot1+GrandTotalPivot2+GrandTotalPivot3"" and get the total revenue of all the invoices combined. What i am interested in, is to see which of the Products/Service/Packages are our highest income of revenue. Is this possible within a PivotTable?

​

I do know that i can just make a simple formula as ""=RevenueOfProduct/GrandTotalAll"" and but that will not work since i have divided the products into categories, subcategories and productname into groups that are expandable and collapsable, therefor i am hoping i can add a custom like the ""% of grand total"" setting, but for a cell outside the PivotTable.

​

I hope my question even makes sense, otherwise i will do my best to explain again.

I graduated about a year ago (Ms in Business Informatics + BS in cmps). I've always had a good GPA.
In total I have almost 2 years of work experience. One year of internship during my Ms and this year as a full time Job.
I received a very good feedback at both jobs. However challenging they were at first, 5 months into both experiences things got really easy (Mainly debugging and minor features improvement, not that technically challenging). 
I want to take it to the next level, and work on challenging topics (Where I have to think about which DS to use, time complexity, complex design patterns..)
I know how to hunt for jobs like this and how to prepare. 
But whenever I'm on the verge of preparing, anxiety creeps in and tends to get worse when I hit a roadblock on some leetcode challenge. 
The anxiety goes as follows : ""What if I'm not smart enough once I get the job and I fail miserably?"" (this idea stems from the fact that I wasn't that good at math) And the train of thought continues : ""maybe I'm not meant to be an engineer and I was lucky because my current job is easy"".
I just can't help but feel like most engineers are better than me.
Is there a benchmark to measure my level? Or is it in my head and is there something I can do about it?
Thank you."

I asked several students in their sophomore year and those in junior year and they said that getting an internship with no  previous experience is unheard off and I should assume that I won't get an internship after 1st year,  (though many students get internships after 1st year). We learn 3 different programming languages in the first year but since recruiting starts from September for major companies, it's really hard to get those. At least that's what I think.

I'd like to learn to be a web developer which uses Python or JS and hopefully get an internship after 1st year. What would you suggest me to learn? I'm open to other career routes too as I'm fairly new to this field. I was also thinking of  going into finance sector for the first year, as it uses relatively simple coding skills. But, I'm again not sure about it, any input about it would be helpful too.

If you've completed it, please let me know what do you think of it as a whole. Was it worth it? Let me know if you know something similar to that program.

I've also seen several posts in this sub reddit where people say ""My friend had no previous programming experience, but he went to CMU and got an internship at Facebook after 1st year.""

I've also seen several posts in this sub reddit where people say ""My friend had no previous programming experience, but he went to CMU and got an internship at Facebook after 1st year."" If you're that friend of such redditors (or someone who went with the similar experience), could you please tell us your experience and how you bagged that internship?

&amp;#x200B;

Even If you can only answer one of the questions, then please do so. I'd be really grateful to you. :) "

I graduated in December of 2017 with a bachelors in computer science with a minor in math. I’ve been interviewing everywhere and I cannot receive an offer. I feel like I’ve been at 20 or so interviews and it’s rejection after rejection. I didn’t have any internships or anything like that. But they seem to like me in the interview but after I always get rejected. Now I feel like cause it’s been almost a year that it’s gonna be harder because of the amount of time I’ve been out of school. I received one offer from revature, but I turned it down due to the fact I would have to move and have no say where I go, and be stuck for two years. I am registered for grad school this fall, but it’s something I really don’t wanna do. So I’m at a lost should I just return to school? or keep interviewing for jobs? Is there something that could better prepare me for interviews? Or am I just giving up to easily on finding a job?"

99nqmx,2,2018-08-23,Questions regarding work in general,TheSwimmingToast,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/99nqmx/questions_regarding_work_in_general/,"So I'm nearing the end of my first summer internship. It was an arc flash/short circuit/ coordination company. From what I was told, this job was very laid back. I show up in gym shorts and t shirt, and apparently this is extremely uncommon. We goof around a bit, hours are very lenient, but we still get stuff done.  One engineer told me he worked for a company that if he showed up like that to work, he would be sent back home to change and not get paid for the day. All the engineers agreed that our company is very laid back and that we just da got spoiled as Interns because most companies aren't like this. Are a lot of jobs that conservative? 

By the third month, I got bored and lazy. Not that I don't like the work, just that it got repetitive. At the start I had one of those ""learning highs"" where I was just learning non stop and it was great. By now I know a good deal of stuff and I'm getting bored. I just show up, get my crap done, and leave. Maybe this is an age thing, I'm too young to find work ""fun"", or maybe it's because I'm getting paid hourly intern money, or maybe it's just something you get over at one point. Is this something I need to be worried about?"

I majored in liberal arts and I've developed an interest in tech and finance careers. I took some business courses in undergrad and took a coding course through Udacity and liked both fields.

To break into tech, I'm thinking about doing a second degree in CS that will be fully funded by my parents and plus I'll be living with them so I'll get free food and housing. I'll also get a very small stipend for gas, food, credit card bills, etc. 

My parents don't want to fund my finance aspirations though. I'll have to take out a 50k-100k (tuition) loan to get an MSF at a top business school so I can get front office roles.

The best thing is doing what I like the most but I haven't done a finance or tech internship so can't decide between both. 

I'm thinking about learning finance/accounting and taken an excel course to get finance roles to see if I like it. On the other hand, I can do a 3-month bootcamp to see if I like coding."
99ox7s,4,2018-08-23,One of the best things in my life happened. I had intense excitement that then crashed into a depression.,Comrade_Soomie,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/99ox7s/one_of_the_best_things_in_my_life_happened_i_had/,"Hey guys, long post. I have a TL;DR at the end but wanted to give a backstory leading up to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve spent so much of my life underachieving and being depressed because of ADHD. The problem is that I didn’t know I even had it until April. I was diagnosed from age 7 as having OCD, depression, and Bipolar. I’ve been successfully treated of ADHD since June. I graduated college with a B.S. in Economics May 2017 after six years. However, I almost dropped out of college or killed myself during undergraduate. I constantly saw myself doing worse than everyone around me and felt powerless to do better. Everyone told me I was incredibly intelligent but my grades and accomplishments didn’t reflect it. I often felt that some of my professors felt that I didn’t add much of value to the discipline because I did poorly in their classes. Students would ask me to tutor them and explain concepts and I would, but they would end up scoring As on exams while I scored Ds. They were just as confused as I was. 

&amp;#x200B;

By the time I came out of undergraduate I was convinced that for as much as I loved it, Economics maybe wasn’t for me and that graduate school definitely wasn’t for me. Professors had convinced me that I wasn’t cut out for it. I tried to get Economics Jobs but quickly learned that you pretty much need a graduate degree to have any hope of doing economics professionally. After undergraduate I wasn’t ready to tackle graduate school.  So I received an internship and then a full time job doing Quality Improvement for a healthcare insurance company. And I actually was pretty happy with my job. But four months into working full time they did corporate restructuring and my entire department was let go last September. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended back in retail and spiraled down. Eventually took my severance package and used it to move across the country in Feb. did something like 10-11 interviews since sept and no offers. I had so much self sabotage, learned helplessness, depression, suicidal feelings etc. I had pretty much convinced myself that I was lazy, stupid, and had no value as a person. 

&amp;#x200B;

In April I saw take your pills on Netflix. I started researching ADHD. I never thought I had it because I thought ADHD meant not being able to focus and meant a young boy bouncing off the walls. I could focus really well on things that I enjoyed. So that was a character failing on my part not adhd. Or so I thought. The more I read the more I felt like I finally found what might be wrong with me. I took my findings to my psychiatrist and cried. I said something is wrong and I think this is it. I got almost an immediate diagnosis and even my old psychiatrist told me that it all makes perfect sense and he can’t believe he missed it for six years. 

&amp;#x200B;

My life has improved ten fold since medication. A month ago, I got my first offer for a degree level job offer since being laid off 11 months ago. It paid less and wasn’t exactly what I wanted to do but the company was great and I saw opportunity for growth. A few days before the job offer I had set up an interview for a Data Analyst working for my state’s department of labor. The job sounded perfect for economics but I didn’t have hopes of getting it. It’s hard to get on with the state jobs because I have already done four interviews with them before that never went anywhere. Plus it was economics. So I pushed it out of my head. 

&amp;#x200B;

They pushed me through the process fast and the interview went great. I got so wound up about this job and felt that it was my dream job. Earlier this week they called when they said they would and told me they couldn’t make a decision between us top candidates and were going to do reference checks to narrow it down. I bit my nails the whole time waiting on the results. I built it up so much and became so invested in it. I couldn’t focus on anything as I waited 

&amp;#x200B;

Then yesterday they called and offered me a job. I now have a state job doing economics. I got off the phone and I cried. I was shaking and crying and started having a panic attack from the excitement. It was overwhelming to suffer so much and to feel so worthless and then finally achieve something so validating to wash away all of the negative perceptions you had had about yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spent the greater part of yesterday excited but also anxious about having to call the other company and tell them I won’t be starting the job Monday because a better opportunity came around. Then in the evening I started feeling numb, confused, and depressed about the choice. I started second guessing and doubting it. I had anxious thoughts that I was making the wrong choice and that I actually am a fraud and they’re wrong about my potential. I’m going to get in there and not be able to learn the job and mess up important economic reports. I should have stuck with the other job because it’s below my skill set and safe. I’ve been pushing these thoughts away but I’m depressed now. It’s getting better as my medication takes effect. I think what happened is that I had such an intense natural high from achieving this huge milestone that I tapped out my dopamine levels and now I’m crashing from it. I think the second guessing thoughts rolled in because my medication was wearing off by that point. That’s the only explanation I can come up with. Anyone else experience something similar?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: After 11 months of being laid off, and ADHD causing me to struggle with underachievement, I finally received an offer for my dream job without needing a graduate degree. The news sent me into a surge of excitement that has since crashed into a confusing depression. I can only hypothesize that I got a powerful dopamine rush and am now experiencing the crash. Has anyone else every gotten a natural dopamine rush of excitement that then turned into a depression?**"

While my major was not CS, majority of my courses were programming based but mostly focusing on data sets analytical applications. Throughout the months I have applied to about \~200 jobs and received about 8 phone/online pre-interviews and 3 in-person interviews. Had interest from a company for intern front end engineer however ended up stopping the process due to very unprofessional ways of communication. Now due to needing some sort of stable income I have settled on a tech support job making $15/hr which after only one week I am very unhappy and becoming depressed from as I am feeling as if my degree/experience and past years in college have been either a waste or I highly over valued myself. I basically receive about 1-3 emails to actually ""support"" a shift and am here more so in case of an emergency outage, and currently work from 4pm-midnight leaving me basically with nothing to do. However a positive of this is I have 8hours to actually work on projects/learn and research. Based on other posts and responses, the fact I have many denials or no responses before an initial interview seems to usually be an issue with the resume, which if anyone wouldn't mind reviewing I can provide a anonymous version of mine. Another thing I realize might be an issue is that I currently have only applied to positions in Phoenix and a few in Los Angeles. As phoenix is where I currently live but Los Angeles is where I eventually want to settle. In terms of web development it seems that .NET is the standard here, which I have no experience as my web based projects are strictly JS and PHP however feature a database and incorporate the use of an API .  And then Java for non web based positions which I have some experience in but bulk of my knowledge and projects are in Python. Another note is I have peers who have found jobs with large banks and automotive companies while having no projects or internships on their resume but I never even received a response or follow up from those same companies. Even at this point I have been searching and contacting design/ad/branding agencies for internships as that would be an ideal area since I also do work with photo/video projects however no responses from any local companies. Is this bad luck? Bad location? Bad resume? Combination of any of the 3? I'm just eager to learn in a work environment whether it be through internship or job as any type of junior dev and with having to settle with this position I am starting to have doubt in myself even though I have equal or more skills to my peers who have already been hired. Any support/opinions/recommendations would be appreciated!"

I'm 18 Years old, I've just crashed and burned through my final year at sixth form with awful grades. 
My plan is to retake and take on another A Level in tandem with regular gym/mental health/my job etc etc
The goal being A*AA but in tandem with positive mental health I'm just gonna focus on putting in the hours and I'll be proud no matter what.

You know what, I'll do some bullet points, and at the end some advice I hope on how to improve from here.

1) I walked to school every day from age 12-18 for 30 minutes, by the time I was 16 I wanted to kms every time I walked there 
2) the rumour mill on my mental health is now the primary reason for the rumour mill on me killing myself although I have no such designs 
3) I use twitter to talk with my friends, network etc and facebook also, although I have an Instagram for girls and tinder lol
4) Hated the high school social dynamics, the fake personas etc, I'm the furthest thing from a demented school shooter but it gets annoying when you're pressured with so much social leadership whilst some peers around you are total fugazzis
5) neglected gym and sex
6) convinced myself that some girl is the one, it was lit but now I'm attached and it's allbeit a very sad situation
7) I put out a persona and I heavily rely on social media, for instance I'll put stuff down on my private Twitter and then plug them in my conversations on Facebook, so I have an immaculate self perception
8) I used to partake in many music groups
9) I show symptoms of bipolar, mania and anxiety.
10) I've never felt accepted at my school not because of social stuff, but I feel nomadic ngl, according to some quiz I'm a sigma male, I like going against the grain as a principle.
11) I have So few friends rn with that embarrassing girl incident and my awful grades which will warrant a gap year 
12) I'm aiming for UCL as my target i.e. One of the most competitive unis in the world, so I'll need A*AA and no distractions
13) Literally marginalised from whole school community, friends of mine say they're concerned for my mental health
14) Dad thinks I'm a waste, Mum is preoccupied with my little brothers condition.
15) my room is tidy (:
16) I am a broke boy :( 
17) saw myself as the alpha dog so never tried to fit in to existing social hierarchies
18) befriended the unpopular kids from compassion
19) noone is really won over to my way of thinking, I have no influence rn, I perceive myself as the best yet (x,y and z) see me as mentally ill, irrelevant, eccentric, you name it. 
20) no-one understands my situation yet they make judgements
21) my autistic older brother tries to act smug with me
22) never respected school, form time, or any teacher 
23) was obsessed with the music department and recording studio
24) I have a kindle fire atm rip
25) small dick

My old folks home:
Dilapidated
They spend their time working, posting on social media, watching Netflix idk.

*) I see myself as an idiosyncratic individual and I detest anyone being stereotyped or marginalised unfairly. Tbh I never fought back against that perceived unfair treatment from those I deemed not worth my time but maybe it did affect me idk

Basically the views on My situation 
Inc people I value, and people I don't and people I don't value who think I'm a puny guy in their world when they're kinda puny in mine lol
This girl and I
I thought she was x in my world but I'm y in hers and it's confusing af.

1) my close friend's; you'll make it man
2) yasmin: you're an idiot
3) dhillon: concerned, you'll make it
4) french gc; concerned
5) trio; concerned, marginalised me (attempted)
6) my year group: concerned.
7) school est; concerned
8) ucas: concerned
9) wggs; concerned
10) ucas; concerned.

My thoughts
1) lol I'm livid that these people are so trigger happy and sensitive, most of them mean nothing to me, and actually I should be directing MY CONCERNS to them.
2) were not friend's? Last party, date etc don't see a thing
3) kicked me when I was down. So I need a year or so to rise up

And so I shall.

Summary:

3) retaking exams, a*a a I hope! With some abc conditioning and pretty dank tuition lol
4) routines/goals + a girl a week? 😍 from tinder

Lo lol 
I 'm 16 now

#imaginebeingmarginalised  
#imaginebeingtreatedlikeshi t

Lol
Will overcome

I feel like kanye when everyone questioned his mental illness when he just had an awol personality

Why TF is it that if you have a strong personality, there's a group attempt to marginalize you and diagnose you with mental illness
Lol

Threat to the system
Dw

Will get into uni, will eat, My #1 CHOICE, and will put in those hours above all else

So much love
I understand this is a huge ramble

But pointers would be lavelyy 
Have a good day beautiful people (:

99pm7e,38,2018-08-23,Wasp Honey (Part 1),Krexington_III,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/99pm7e/wasp_honey_part_1/,"If a tree falls in the woods, and nobody hears it, did it really fall? You know… you’ve heard it. If we can’t measure something, did it happen? Quantum science and shit says “no”. It happened and it didn’t, at the same time. I believe that.

I’m gonna hurry up and write this down - I think it’s my time to die pretty soon. Just gotta, you know… get the things in my head… *out* of my head. I was never good at that.

The first time I got laid was with a girl named Brittany. She told me she was dying already while we were talking in a chatroom. It was the late nineties, and you had to update chat rooms manually by hitting a button. I would hold my breath for a while before updating. Brittany was American… I’m not. It doesn’t matter, but it’s true. And I don’t know what matters anymore. Maybe it matters to you. I’m from a cold country way up north. Nevermind.

Brittany agreed to meet me. I’d talked to girls before, but never liked it. My stomach would knot itself up when I did. The words didn’t sound right when I said them… like, have you taped yourself? You know that’s not you talking, it feels wrong. That’s how I felt when I was talking to girls, but from inside my own head. I felt like that talking to Brittany, too. She wore a wig, because she didn’t have hair on her head from the, you know, medicine.

But she seemed happy to see me. She was wearing the exact same jacket as me, and it was winter. Olive green jacket with the german flag on the sleeve. Pretty popular back then, don’t know what happened to them. Fell out of style, I guess. I was smoking, and she told me I should consider quitting. I mean, she had a strong case. What with the disease and all. The date didn’t go so good, I thought. I would trail off when my voice sounded all wrong, and there would be a horrible silence, and then she’d laugh as if I’d just told a joke but we both knew I hadn’t. 

When we were waiting for our buses to go home, at the same stop, she asked me if I wanted to go with her. Back to her place. She was shivering from the cold, and there was snow. I nodded “m-hm” and lit a cigarette. The bus came right as I lit it, so I threw it away again. Brittany held my hand on the bus. We were both wearing thin, knit gloves. She was happy, but nervous. I just felt awful. If I was so shit at talking, how shit would I be at fucking? I’d never done it before.

She started kissing me right away in the hallway. I kissed her back. I could feel my own mouth tasting of cigarette smoke, through her mouth, somehow. She touched my head a lot. It was shaven, and had snowflakes stuck on it like cotton to velcro. They melted when she touched them. We stumbled over to the bed - I noticed she had trouble keeping her balance. We fell onto her bed. Her tongue was strong and wet in my mouth. Her apartment was filthy. No point in cleaning if you’re going to die, I guess.

That’s the first time I saw the Wasp Queen. I didn’t know who she was, at the time… I just figured Brittany had a mannequin in the corner of her room that she threw her not-quite-dirty-yet shirts on. The mannequin was smiling. It also wasn’t a mannequin, but I didn’t understand that until later. Nevermind. That’s when Brittany’s wig came off. I was surprised. I’d forgotten. Without her hair, her head looked completely round. Like a baby head. She looked a bit… bashful, I guess? I thought the whole thing was a bit disgusting, to be honest. She wasn’t hot even to begin with. But then she coughed, and a drop of blood came up on her lower lip.

And then the awkwardness melted right away. It didn’t matter. She was going to die. I could put my dick in her, do it badly, feel however it feels. Kiss her, slap her, whatever. In a couple of months she would be gone. There would be no memory of my shitty hairy ass bobbing up and down or the birthmarks on my dick or my smelly breath or the fucking shit that falls out of my eyes when I look at other people and they can tell that I hate them. It would all be gone. Unmeasured. 

That fact made me rock hard. I tore her clothes off. She said stuff, but I wasn’t listening. Kissed her more. Pushed her down. Touched her tits, but hardly noticed. All I could think about was that she was going to die and that was great. She was quite a bit overweight, and her flesh lay in folds on her belly. I had to kind of push it aside to touch her pussy. It was wet, and warm, and smelled dank and sour. Her legs were all fucked up, too… really fat, and her one knee was twisted to the side for some reason. Laying on top of her felt like laying on just… a carpet of soft meat. She couldn’t part her legs enough for me to fit between, so my knees rested on her thigh fat. I fucked her. It felt like putting my dick in a bowl of soup, not great I guess. But I was so happy. I almost cried. She cried to. She thought it was love, I guess. And it was.

She died later. And I was hooked on… death, I guess. I never talked to her again, didn’t visit the chatroom. I went to the grocery store one day, and the guy behind the counter had a bad, bad fever. I never had a thing for guys because I’m not, you know, a fucking faggot. But he was so pale and had such sunken eyes from the fever, I wanted to just suck him off out back by the dumpsters. My heart started racing. Thought about putting my finger up his asshole while I was doing it, swallowing his semen. It wouldn’t matter. He would die. It would all be gone. The lady behind me chuckled, and I didn’t get why. I mean, I get it now. It was her. Again. The queen. 

I guess during that time of my life, that specific winter, I was doing better than I had before. I went to evening classes to try and get my high school grades high enough that I could study film at university. I don’t know why I wanted that, it was common back then. I stayed up all night working my shitty job watching the ovens at a huge industrial bakery. That’s when I had my idea to apply for a night job at the hospital instead as a… I don’t know what it’s called in English, but like a watcher. A guy who just goes around and makes sure that everything is on the level and calls a nurse if it isn’t. Just thinking about walking through the halls with all the dying people made me feel… made me feel like I could get clean. I could tell them things and they would hear them and when they died the things would be gone. That’s how I felt, like they would be gone from inside me. I could tell someone about my stepmom, how she locked me in the TV bench and turned the TV up loud for hours so I would sit in there and just scream and scream. And when they died… that thing would be gone. They would take it with them to the other side. I could tell them about how I hit my first girlfriend, pushed her onto the floor of the kitchen and beat her. And all the shame and regret would just be gone when they passed on.

So I did. I applied. I got in, too. It wasn’t even hard - the pay was lousy and the hours were insanely long. That’s where I met Ingrid. She was a psychiatry student doing some kind of internship or whatever it’s called. When you work at the hospital because you want to be a doctor. She was the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen. She was blonde with bright blue eyes, and when she smiled at me it was all I would think about for the next day. She would say “hello” like she meant it, to everyone not just to me. I couldn’t talk to her of course. Knotty intestines. Wasps in my sinuses. But I had to have her. It was love. But she wasn't sick in any way so it could never be.

If you’ve been following along, you know what happens to Ingrid in this story.

99q3gm,561,2018-08-23,"I think people understimate how different of an experience it is to grow up in a rural area and attend a poor/underfunded high school. I am proud of all of you for wanting to go to college, high school is not the end for us",biteszadusto9,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/99q3gm/i_think_people_understimate_how_different_of_an/,"I graduated a year ago, so take my ramblings with a grain of salt, but stalking this sub the past couple of years has changed my perspective on a lot of things.



Growing up in a rural area, you will know the same people from elementary school until graduation. It can make or break your high school life, especially if you are a minority and don't fit in with the school's demographics. Bullying and seedy activity runs rampant, because for the most part, people simply do not care. I went home with bruises and a bloodied lip a lot, because I was gay and autistic, and I was the ONLY person with those characteristics in my school, making me a prime target for harassment. 




In my experience, the school was dominated by sports, and academic success was largely determined by who your parents were, and how much wealth they possessed. I believe 62% of my high school recieved free lunch, and at least 50-60% of my classmates did not meet state benchmark standards on the end of year exams.  The majority of kids did not succeed academically. Our average ACT score was around an 18 or a 19, I believe the year after I graduated it raised to 20. 




Kids at my school could only dream of national awards or research positions at universities. To be completely honest, most people simply did not care about where they ended up at. We never had access to music lessons, private tutors, academic clubs, internships, or summer camps. I did dance for a year but our team had to disband because lack of funding. The only sports offered at school were football, cross country, baseball, wrestling, and basketball, and you couldn't join unless you were amazing. All of my school's funds went towards athletics. We didn't have textbooks for most of my classes. Going to the state championship was more of a priority to school administrators than producing graduates. The nearest university was almost an hour away, and we had no public transportation.





 We did not have supercenters, shopping malls, corporate offices, hospitals, train stations, airports, law firms or any other hallmarks of the modern American city. People either worked at a nearby factory, in agriculture, or in fast food. The nearest city of around 10,000 was 1.25 hours away as well. From a very young age, I worked in my family's garden, hoeing corn and planting beans. I learned how to stitch, sew, and make my own clothing. I hatched and raised baby chicks in my bathroom, and collected eggs from the chicken coop everyday. From childhood to late junior year, I cared for a disabled family member because one of my parents died, my other had abandoned me- I was the eldest child, so the responsibilities fell to me. I was always envious watching depictions of high school life on TV because I wanted to be able to join clubs, take music lessons, and play sports. 





My school offered around 6 AP'S, with one that was only offered every other year, and you weren't allowed to start till you were a junior. Many schools around us didn't even have AP, so I was better off than most. We ran on block schedule so it was nearly impossible to take AP unless you were an athlete and the coaches (who were also the teachers) were planning out a 4 year schedule for you. You also had to be reccomended by certain teachers to be 'Tracked' into honors/ap, which once again favored athletes even if many weren't ready for AP.  The weighted grades boosted their GPA's, keeping them eligible for sports. Not all athletes did AP/honors, but I was the only non varsity athelete in all my AP/honors courses. 





I was not 'tracked' and had to fight tooth and nail to take the 5 AP classes that I did. I had the highest ACT in my school until a transfer student entered my senior year, and my intelligence was still constantly questioned by faculty because I was an outsider who did not play varsity sports. My guidance councelor told me I should just go to community college cause a 4 year might be rigorous. Only 1/3 of the students at my school continue on to college, and only 1/4 of those students go to a 4 year. Most of our students at CC end up dropping out after a semester. 





I didnt realize how cutthroat the college admissions process was till I started reading this sub, and taking note of the demographics of my classes, which was known as the ""most competitive class"" in the history of my high school. The majority of students in my classes, which were honors/AP for the most part, weren't even native to our area, and had transferred with higher GPAs from other schools after moving here to the boonies. A few kids in the top 10 were from the city and commuted to my school so they wouldn't have to compete with kids in their area. The rest of the top 10/20 had parents who were on the school board, or who taught at one of the county schools. There was only one kid in the top 20 who did not have a connection or hadn't transferred. It was eye opening to me to watch one of these kid's parents bargaining with a teacher to raise her football player son's grades despite him skipping out on school. And the kicker? It happened. 





Now, I've painted my high school experience in a bad light, but it wasn't all that bad. I worked several part time jobs, got to do research on my own, won a couple of awards for it, and learned a new language on my own. (My school only offered spanish for 2 semesters, nothing else) I didn't realize until my last year of high school that I had to compete with a lot of the high achievers like people on this sub, who had 5.0 GPAs and mindblowing EC's. It was a lot of stress and pressure. I never felt good enough. I cried for hours when I didn't get into Northwestern ED.





Yet, now that some time has passed, I don't feel as guilty that I didn't get to go to a big high school and take 20 AP's and do science olympiad and ISEF. I am doing alright. I did a semester at a regional school, then was accepted into a good Top 75 State school after I had a couple college courses under my belt.




 I finally got to learn how to play an instrument.  I got selected for a national philanthropy program and will be working towards creating legislation and groups that will seek to stop bullying in rural schools due to sexual orientation. I am the youngest student in my research group and will be working with cutting edge tech. I have a programming internship. I'm joining a sports club where I don't HAVE to be amazing and varsity level to participate.  I'm applying to study abroad.





High school is not the end of the world. I was not even expected to graduate due to my rough upbringing and my disability, but I walked across the stage wearing my NHS stoll with pride. Even if your school sucks, even if you don't have these insane opportunities, you can still succeed. Keep moving forward

I've been working a service industry job part time for minimum wage since I've graduated last fall with a CS degree (with a minor in math, but not like it matters). I can't seem to get a job as a dev. I have gotten a few interviews, so my resume is decent enough I think, but I can't seem to get past the final rounds, even if I nailed the technical aspects. I regrettably never did any internships, but I didn't realize it'd be this hard to find SOME job. The companies I'm aiming for aren't really prestigious and most folks here would scoff at, but I can't even seem to beat out the other candidates even for those. Should I give up? I honestly am feeling suicidal these days. I used to grind Leetcode/CodeSignal and make some small contributions to an open source project I found, but I don't really have the motivation anymore."

The truth is I only have a minor in comp sci and I'm looking for a way to get into software engineering, I've taken all the lower division cs classes and some upper divs but my programming skills is pretty limited (I know things like lists, trees, heaps, sorting, hash tables, big O and that's pretty much it). I'm looking for a field where I can use my coding experience so I can learn on the job as well as get a good boost on my resume. I majored in microbiology and I considered bioinformatics but most positions require a PhD, not going to do a bootcamp since their rep is getting worse and I'm not too excited about the high up front cost. I don't think I can get into a masters program with 3.1 GPA and significantly little related CS experience. I'm currently applying to internships for next summer but I'm having no luck"
99rei2,0,2018-08-23,"Iffy pre-vet student looking for some trail markers on where to go next, love fish and reptiles, prof suggested pathology but not so sure about it...",DewfordTownFishNerd,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/99rei2/iffy_prevet_student_looking_for_some_trail/,"Hello all! This is a long one, I try to be as thorough as possible in these kinda posts looking for wisdom. Also on mobile so apologies for typos or formatting! I’m currently a 4.5 year student at UGA about to get my BS in avian biology aka CHICKENS. I’M SO TIRED OF CHICKENS. Already have an Associates in Bio/Chem. Basically taken all prereq’s for vet school including clinic intern hours, but now I’m kinda backing out of the whole vet school thing. So here’s the deal: working in small animal clinics was honestly a bore, same thing day in-day out, most of the clients I worked with were either crazy, wouldn’t do anything for their animal the doc suggested, or were there for simply average visits for yearly vaccines and tests. Not to mention in both clinics I worked under, I was kind of miserable due to a bit of a toxic work environment. You could tell the tech’s didn’t want me or any new folks that came in there. Kinda like a high school clique air about it. This is just one thing that’s causing my change of heart, though. Another couple things include funds (of course), my unique interest (possibly obsession lol) in the exotic and aquatic animal field. You know, like fish, snakes, lizards, frogs, that kinda thing. 

Working retail in a store that deals with these animals has honestly been much more enjoyable than being stuck in the clinics with people that obviously didn’t like me no matter how well I did my job. Management is honestly too good to me (I mean, I do my job and overkill it 9/10 x’s, but goodness I don’t think I could go back to rough management again...), my customers are almost always a joy to talk to, educate, and help, on the plus side I also get to interact with the type of animals I adore (nothing wrong with the lovable fluffy friends of course, I like everything but scorpions and bees lol). A lot of people in retail fake it, but I honest to god love what I do. If I could just detach the whole retail side of it and remove the salty coupon ladies, I’d probably stay in it for the rest of my life, no joke. Educating people on how to care for animals, how to set up proper environments, what not to do, get excited with fellow critter keepers and telling our own stories and showing pictures, it just makes me happy! Even had some customers comment on my happy-go-lucky air when I’m bouncing around the store looking for things to do.

I’m still in school atm, and since my niche obsession with fish has me smitten I’m planning on applying for an online Masters in Aquaculture &amp; Fish Health from Florida (sorry Dawgs, I’m tired of chickens), and then after that if it doesn’t kill me dead I plan on going for a PhD in veterinary pathology. Even though I love the teaching part of my job, I also am pretty dang good at diagnosing issues with fish and reptiles. Most of the things I’ve learned are from studying in my own free time for fun, as well as for treating my own critters at home. Go into what I call detective mode, get pager on FaceBook groups for help ID’ing illness, have friends that rely on me for info, it’s just what I do. And I love doing it. Fish get sick often and sometimes you gotta act fast. Talked with a professor of mine that said I might be interested in pathology as well as exotic and aquatic medical research seeing as there’s not much known about illnesses in that part of the field. Already going to take the Masters program just because I want some more in depth fish industry background, debating on the PhD since after my 3rd degree I’ll probably be tired out for awhile. 

Big Question: What can I do with my degrees before investing in a PhD that I will enjoy given that I like fish, reptiles, and other exotic pets like ferrets and guinea pigs, love to talk to people about said subjects and willingly do my own research for fun? I know there’s not much profit in mom &amp; pop pet shops with big companies around, seeing as I’ve got college debt to pay I need something that pays in both happiness and dollars. I kind of want to ditch the retail vibe as well. Is pathology an ideal path? Should I go into being a teacher somewhere? I eventually want to move south toward the east coastline, I don’t appreciate densely populated areas like Athens or Atlanta. The beach and country bumpkin places are where I love to be. 

If you’ve made it this far, holy crap THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR READING! And thanks for any advice, again I apologize for the lengthy post. Namaste and have a good day! "

I think the interview went ok and after my interview they also asked my manager questions about my performance. 

I was wondering if its ok to send a second follow up email and when should I send it? Also, I know there is not many entry level cloud positions available so I have been applying to help desk positions as well but all of them would pay less then what my internship payed which is $18.50.

I kind of feel like taking a cloud internship didn't pay off as much as an help desk internship would have, because I didn't learn many skills to use in a helpdesk role like networking, active directory etc. However I did learn IaaC tools (Chef, Terraform) and AWS."

I'm an Indian, male, incoming senior from Massachusetts from a pretty strong public high school. Both my parents have high levels of education, and family income is \~250K a year. I'm planning on going into engineering, but am still not 100% sure what type or if I even will stay in that field. I feel like I""m applying to way too many reaches for my caliber, and the following list is not yet set in stone. That being said, I'm applying to \~10 schools. Any advices, feedback, or comments would be super appreciated. Also, let me know what genre of music you want a recommendation for and I'll be happy to oblige. Thanks in advance!

**Schools I'm Thinking of Applying To:**

Reaches: UPenn ED, Harvard (because why not), UC Berkeley

Targets: Cornell (Probably a reach but it looks nice here), Georgia Tech, University of Michigan, Northeastern

Safeties: Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), UMass Amherst, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)

**Academics**:

GPA: 3.83 Unweighted (out of 4.0), 4.40 Weighted (out of 5.0)

My school doesn't allow AP's to be taken before Junior year, but I've only taken honors and enriched math classes throughout my high school career. We also don't have class rank, but I would put myself top 8-9% in a class of \~500.

Junior Year Courseload: AP Chemistry (4), AP Physics 1 (we don't need to talk about it, not sending), AP Lang (5), Honors US History, Enriched Precalculus, Psychology, etc.

Senior Year Courseload: AP Physics C, AP Computer Science Principles, AP Statistics, AP Calculus AB, Dramatic Literature, Economics, etc.

**Standardized Tests:**

SAT: 1510 superscore out of 1600

ACT: 35 out of 36 (35 Math, 35 Reading, 35 Science, 34 Writing)

Subject Tests: 

Math 2: 790

Math 1: 750

Physics and Chemistry (Taking this Saturday, hoping for a 750+ on both, more likely to get higher in Chemistry)

**Essays and Letters of Recommendation**: 

* I consider myself to be a pretty good writer and have spent many hours refining my college essay, so I'd put it at around an 8.5/10
* Letters of Recommendation from my AP Lang teacher and my Enriched Precalculus teacher, have great relationships with both through class participation and effort, so I'd put them at around a 9/10

**Extracurriculars**:

I'm not going to list every single extracurricular because honestly this post is long enough already. I'll keep it as brief as possible.

* Quiz Bowl (9-12, Co-Captain all 4 years): Our team has competed both at the state and national level over the past two years. Also, in Massachusetts we have a TV show that airs on PBS called High School Quiz Show (it's also in a few other New England states). It's like a game show where over 100 teams attempt to qualify for the TV tapings, and you play a March Madness style bracket until one team is left undefeated. Our quiz team won the High School Quiz Show my junior year.
* Internship at Northeastern (11): I have been an intern at Northeastern this summer at the Sustainability and Data Science Lab, currently working on a report on how to make my town more resilient towards heatwaves. I'm planning on presenting it to the town offices when it's all said and done, and hopefully it can spark some changes.

* Student Council (10-12): I've been on the Sophomore, Junior, and Senior Board in my high school. Junior and Senior board is comprised of \~12 kids from the grade. We do things like organize fundraisers for local charities as well as plan events like 3v3 Basketball and Homecoming.  
* NHS (11-12): Pretty self explanatory, there is a board for NHS at our school which I was elected to in order to help run the program for the inductees next year (if that helps at all).
* Students to Students (11-12, Leadership in 12th grade): Program at our school that helps incoming freshman who need a bit more support with adjusting to high school by pairing them with an upperclassmen who acts as their mentor and guides them throughout the school year.
* Volunteering:
   * \~40 hours this summer at a campaign trail for someone running for Congress
   * \~30 hours freshman year at Ironstone Farm, helping kids with disabilities ride horses
* Prom King (Harvard wya... just kidding I probably won't write it but it may show a fun/interesting side of me)

99s2tf,57,2018-08-23,"You know the tingling feeling you get when the door to a dark room is partially open? Next time, just ignore it. I wish I had.",imaginary_charlie,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/99s2tf/you_know_the_tingling_feeling_you_get_when_the/,"The door was open at the end of the hallway. Not fully, as if someone had just walked through, but open just slightly, enough to see a dark strip of inky black. I wondered if I should get up to close it. It wasn’t as if it mattered, no one else was home, and it shouldn’t be bothering me. But something about the dark space between the frame and door was causing the hairs on the back of my neck to stand on end. I felt like I was being watched.

I looked down at the cat, whose soft snoring at the end of the couch provided me with some comfort. Weren’t animals supposed to be able to sense danger? Surely if I had anything to worry about she wouldn’t be curled up in a ball dreaming peacefully. Rationalizing myself into a small amount of courage, I decided to pull the soft, warm throw off of my lap and get up. 

As I stood, something caught my eye. It wasn’t unusual for my husband to leave his things about the house. He often jokes that his creative mindset makes him incapable of being tidy. I walked over to the rain coat that had been draped over the stairway banister. It was pouring outside. Why would he have left his rain coat?

Having now made it a quarter of the distance down the hallway to inspect the coat, I could see the door frame more clearly now. Was the door open another inch? Surely it was just my imagination. Thunder erupted outside, making me jump. I admonished my cowardice. *You’re a grown woman, Jen. It’s a goddamn door.*

I hastened my pace to the end of the hallway and shut the door with a sharp thud. *There.*

&amp;#x200B;

At two in the morning I woke to another deafening crack of thunder. After looking at the clock through bleary eyes, I rolled over to see if Stephen had made it home yet. His work load had become heavier as of late, and his evenings were often beginning to stretch well into the early morning. I sighed in frustration and picked up my water glass on the bedside table. I made way downstairs to the kitchen, but as I reached the bottom of the stairs I realized Stephen’s coat was missing.

“Babe?”

No answer.

“Stephen, are you home?”

Nothing.

Surely I put it away earlier, and in my haste to close the office door I forgot that I had hung it in the closet. *Stephen should really stop working so late. Too much time alone is turning me into a crazy person.*

As the kitchen light flickered on, my eyes filled with bright white splotches. I blinked them away, heading for the refrigerator. It was then that I saw Stephen’s rain coat neatly folded on the table. I did a double take. Why would it be in here? I was certain that after I had shut the office door earlier I had returned to the living room, scooped up my laptop, and headed straight to bed. I stood staring for another moment before realizing that it was completely silent, save for the sound of soft footsteps coming down the hallway. 

The cat must have woken and found me missing from the bed. She never much liked being more than a few paces away from my warm feet. I turned to the door, expecting to greet her, when I heard the office door across the hallway creak, and her footsteps continue on the other side. *Okay, Jen. What in the actual fuck are you on? That damn door was closed.*

“Katie? Katie-cat, come here baby.”

I waited to hear her feet patter towards me. Silence.

“Katie-cat, what are you doing? Katie?”

With a frustrated sigh, I pushed the swinging kitchen door open and stepped into the hallway. The office door was shut. 

I took the stairs two at a time as I made my way back to the bedroom. I yanked the charge cord out of my phone and dialed Stephen’s number.

“You’ve reached the voicemail of Stephen Whitney. I am not available to take your call at this time —“

I jabbed the phone screen to end the call and threw my phone down on the bed. *Dammit. This is ridiculous.* I decided to go back down to the office and face my fears. It was an office, not a haunted house. I had obviously been spending too much time watching horror movies and needed to see for myself that nothing was going on but an over-active imagination. I picked up my cell phone and gripped it tight.

As I exited my bedroom I found Katie at the top of the stairs, lazily licking her paws. I flipped on every light switch that I passed in an attempt to calm my nerves. When I turned on the hallway light, I looked toward the office door. Shut, just like it was supposed to be. I glanced at my phone to see if Stephen had called back. No such luck. 

When I looked up from the screen I felt an ice cold chill shoot up my spine. The door was open about two inches. Despite the hallway light being on, it was total darkness on the other side. I considered calling the police. Perhaps someone had come in the house while I was sleeping. Had I checked to make sure the doors were locked before I had rushed upstairs to bed?

My throat was tight. Every part of my body wanted to run in the opposite direction. But I stayed my course, walking toward the office. The hallway suddenly seemed an entire football field in length and it took an eternity to finally reach the door. I licked my dry lips and swallowed hard as I pushed the door open. 

“Stephen?”

Silence.

I turned on the light. The room was empty. I breathed a sigh of relief and brought the phone to my ear once again. 

“Jen?” Stephen replied.

“Jesus Christ, Stephen where the hell are you? Why didn’t you pick up?”

“Is everything okay? What’s wrong?”

*Sigh.*

“No. Sorry, it’s nothing. I think I’m just getting myself worked up over nothing. Will you be home soon?”

“I’m on my way home now, honey. Just get some sleep and I’ll be there in about fifteen minutes.” 

Hearing his voice had calmed me down. I felt my heart rate return to normal as I took one last glance across the room. As I turned toward the door I noticed the rug had been moved. It was usually centered under the two chairs in front of the fireplace, but was now askew. I moved the chairs back and began to straighten the heavy area rug when something caught my eye. There appeared to be a red stain on the hardwood. With a quick pull, I folded the rug back to get a better look.

On the floor before me was a large pentagram with strange markings around the edges. It appeared to have been painted on to the floor in blood. I lost my breath and fell from a crouch to a sitting position. *Jesus-fucking-Christ, what is this?*

As I rounded the corner out of the office, Stephen walked in the door, raincoat in hand. Wasn’t that supposed to be in the kitchen? I pushed the kitchen door open to see an empty table. My heart was trying to pound it’s way out of my chest. I suddenly didn’t want Stephen home very much.

“Hey hon, sorry I’m home so late. Apparently the client doesn’t like the — you look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I opened my mouth, but nothing came out. 

“Jen?”

How do you accuse your husband of dabbling in the occult? Hey honey, how’s work? How are your satanic rituals going? 

My mind was spinning and I was afraid to even take a breath. I finally pulled myself together and spoke.

“Stephen, what did you do to the floor?” I choked.

“The floor?”

“The floor, Stephen. Why did you paint that…that symbol under the rug?”

With a look of confusion, he stepped toward me. I involuntarily flinched, reaching for the kitchen door. I made a mental note of which knives were closest in case he got violent. Stephen walked past me and into the office.

“What the fuck, Jen?” he said with genuine shock.

“You didn’t do this?”

“No. When would I have time to draw bloody symbols on the floor? I’ve been working eighty hour weeks. I barely sleep, let alone have time to devil worship or whatever the fuck this is.”

I immediately felt stupid. It was true, he was hardly ever home anymore. I sighed with relief and walked across the hall and into the kitchen to fill a bucket with water. Stephen grabbed a couple of sponges and old towels from the pantry so we could start scrubbing the office floor. It was too early in the morning and my eyes were dry from exhaustion, but I couldn’t leave those blood-drawn symbols on the floor all night long.

It wasn’t as hard as I had anticipated to scrub the blood off the floor. It didn’t appear to have been sitting there long enough to stain, for which I was thankful. That was, until I realized it meant the blood was fresh. I expressed my concern to my husband, but in his tired and frustrated state he brushed it off, saying something about the varnish on the floor. I supposed he was right, but it didn’t settle my fears. I folded the now ruined area rug and tossed it in front of the fireplace as I headed upstairs to bed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next few months things returned to normal. I had taken a new job at a finance firm and was now the one working long hours. Stephen’s department had brought in a new batch of interns, which meant he wasn’t needing to stay at the office quite so late anymore. 

As I was packing up my things to leave the office one evening, Stephen called.

“Jen, I need you to come home.” He sounded panicked.

“What’s wrong, are you hurt?”

“No, no. It’s just…Katie is missing. I can’t find her anywhere. Can you make it home before it’s too dark? I’m afraid she got outside again.”

I gathered my purse and briefcase and drove home as fast as I could. Stephen was in the back yard yelling for Katie. It wasn’t like her not to respond when called. I worried about hawks and other animals. After all, she was a tiny little thing.

“Nothing?” I asked Stephen.

“No. This is so strange. The other times she’s always come when I called. For the life of me I don’t understand how she keeps doing it.”

“Doing what? What do you mean ‘the other times’?”

He explained that over the last couple of months Katie had been finding a way to get outside. At first he thought the screen door hadn’t latched properly, or that she was running past him as he brought in groceries. He would notice she was gone, call for her, and she would run right up to him, wrapping her furry little body around his legs.

I looked out past the lawn and into the trees. Could she have walked through the woods to the neighbor’s farm? 

“Katie-cat! Katie! Come here kitty girl!”

As I suspected, nothing. My mind was pulled back to that image of the pentagram on our office floor. This was right about the part of the horror movie where the family dog ends up dead. I worried for Katie. I hoped that nothing bad had happened.

&amp;#x200B;

We woke up the following morning, put on our rain gear, and headed out to the woods to look for the cat. I brought a can of tuna, hoping to entice her. About three quarters of the way to the tree line I spotted the carcass of what looked to be a small animal, possibly a raccoon. It appeared to have been dead for some time. *Where the hell are you, Katie?*

A few yards into the trees I noticed something didn’t feel right. It was as if the air was too still. There were no cicadas buzzing, no crickets chirping. Not a single bird in sight. Once again, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end.

“Katie-cat! Katie, where are you?” I yelled. 

My voice echoed around the trees, but the only response was dead silence. I looked at Stephen to voice my concern, but before I could open my mouth we heard a loud shriek coming from the woods to our left. Stephen darted off towards the noise, and my legs burned to keep up with him. He slowed as he approached a clearing and stopped before passing the last tree.

“What is it?” I asked.

He stood there, frozen, as if the air was too thick for him to move. A familiar chill crawled its way up my spine as I turned my attention to the clearing in front of me. There, drawn in what appeared to be gallons of blood, was a massive pentagram. Animals of all shapes and sizes were hanging from the trees, their bellies gutted. Entrails littered the forest floor. The stench hit me, and a wave of nausea caused me to fall to my knees and vomit. 

As I regained my footing, I saw that Stephen was now laying in the center of the pentagram. A naked woman stood over him, using blood to draw symbols on his bare chest. I heard a twig snap behind me and nearly jumped out of my skin. I turned to find Katie sitting there, carefully licking her paws. She appeared unfazed by the carnage all around us.

The woman turned her attention to me. Her body was covered in the same strange symbols she had drawn on Stephen. Her hair was soaked so thick with blood I couldn’t tell if she had started out brunette or blond.

“You need not bother with Katie, dear. She’s quite fine.” The woman drawled.

“Who are you?“

“You need not bother with that either.”

“I don’t —“

“Understand? Why of course not. You and your husband have been rather oblivious for quite some time now. My Katie has been keeping an eye on you. She tells me you have removed the glyphs she drew in your office.”

“Katie drew those…symbols?”

“Yes dear. It appeared that while your husband was having an affair, you were spending the evenings drinking and passing out early. This gave me all the time I needed to use your office for my work. Your home happens to be at the intersection of some very important ley lines. Oh, sorry, dear. You thought he was ‘working late’ didn’t you? 

It’s unfortunate that you decided to break your bad habit right as I was meeting some of my, well, let’s call them goals. Our work was almost finished.”

I felt lightheaded and so sick I could barely stand. *Run, Jen. Call for help. Don’t just stand there.*

“You see, that pentagram was the last phase of my plan. When you broke the seal by wiping it away, you undid a massive amount of very difficult spell work. It turns out that despite all my efforts to re-conjure those spells, animal blood simply isn’t going to cut it this time. The gods are demanding a human sacrifice. Shall we see if opening up your husband will do the trick?”

I fell to the ground. Her right hand rose into the air, a golden dagger gleaming in the sunlight. As her blade began to move downward, I felt a sharp pain in my head, and blackness enveloped me.

Edit: When I woke up, everyone was gone. The clearing was empty, no sign of the woman, Stephen or Katie anywhere. I’ve filed a missing person’s report with the local police department, but so far they’ve had no luck finding my husband. "

You're interviewing at a small business for a SysAdmin / IT Director Role, despite having a very comfortable job. It's a business with roughly 100 employees, plus 20-40 independent contractors (1099s). You know a handful of people here and they've worked there for several years and love it. The IT Team is two part time interns, a help desk team of 3 full time techs, an experienced network admin, and essentially a jr sysadmin. 

You find out details from a trusted friend, and they meet one of your biggest requirements: they are really focused on respecting family first. This proves its self in the benefits package which includes things like 4 weeks paternity leave, adoption cost sharing and leave, as well as many other awesome benefits. The job is open due to terminal health issues of current employee. They are wiling to give you on the job training for up to 2 weeks before they will retire. The current position holder doesn't really give you information deeper than surface level stuff. 

The pay is great. The help desk team seems great. The CEO is loved by just about everyone and even glass door ratings are solid and its only an extra 5 minute commute. Everything seems perfect.  


**What questions would you really need answered about the Infrastructure / IT Strategy** in order to make a final decision? As a perfectionist I want to ensure i'm leaving as few stones unturned as possible before accepting responsibility for something so well established.   
Things I have thought about include:  
Bad/Shady MSP Contracts, Travel Time, On Call Time requirements, Historical Network/Server Uptime (lemons?), and legal requirements such as HIPAA that I have zero experience with.   


I can't think of much else so anything you can suggest based on personal experience would be huge.

I've finally snagged two job offers and I'm really out of my depth in evaluating the pros and cons.  For reference, I live in Minnesota, but not in the Twin Cities area.

Offer #1

* $65,000 salary
* $3,500 Sign-on bonus
* Located in Chicago Suburbs (different state, no connections)
* Fortune 500 company

Offer #2

* $45,000 base pay
* Profit Sharing.  The annual estimate he gave was $20,000 to be payed out every 4 weeks.  I have no idea how much I should trust him on that.
* Located in Twin Cities Suburb (same state, still requires relocation)
* Very small company; probably under 100 employees.


The low base pay/profit sharing of Offer #2 through me for a loop, as they had made no mention of it beforehand and I really don't know how to evaluate it.

I've kept Offer #1 waiting while I got Offer #2 in because the work sounds more interesting and I am a little nervous to move to a new state where I don't know anyone.  I really need to have a decision come Monday morning.

Other factors to consider:

* Company #1 offers 18 days PTO, Company #2 offers 5 days paid vacation, as many sick days as needed, unless they suspect abuse.
* I was actually told that the profit sharing part of my compensation would likely be over $20,000 this year, but I am completely clueless as to the stability of profit sharing schemes.
* The work at Company #1 sounds potentially boring, but I've got similar experience from an internship.  The work at Company #2 sounds more interesting, but it would likely be a lot more self-directed, which I'm ambivalent about.

I was pretty stoked about Offer #2 but the profit sharing aspect and low vacation days have given me pause.  Does anyone have any knowledge or personal experiences that might shift me in one direction or the other?"

Any advice much appreciated, and thanks in advance!

I work for a consulting organization that allows remote work. I negotiated prior to taking a job at this company that I could potentially work remote, although this was never in writing and no terms were discussed as far as length. This organization does have some very long term / indefinite remote workers.

I started in the office and then after 18 months my wife had to move for her career, and I moved with her. I make substantially more than her, but she had to move for an internship as part of completing her graduate degree - which I anticipated and negotiated so that I could accommodate this.

We ended up in a city that we very much love. We even bought a house here. I would never leave this city if I had my way.

Jobs in my field aren’t quite as abundant in this city. However, I had another new company approach me and offer me a job that is 100% guaranteed remote.

My current company was fine with me going remote, but I get the feeling that it is expected that I return at some point - at the very least it seems like some members of the leadership team seem to assume that. My wife’s internship had a pre-determined length. I do however love my current job.

Sorry if that was too much background information. My burning question - can I leverage this offer to negotiate with my current company that I can work remote indefinitely? Is that appropriate? Or should I take the job where I know I can work remotely 100% for as long as I want?

Salary is comparable, overall slightly better with the new offer, but more of the salary in the new offer is bonus as opposed to base, so it is a bit of a riskier proposition. I would prefer to stay with my current company, but I don’t like the heartburn of feeling like they may decide to call me back into the office at some point.

I do feel comfortable enough in my performance that I believe my current org would work with me if push came to shove, I’m just not if remote work is something that is typically negotiated like this, or how I should go about it.

Any words of wisdom?"

I have one semester left of uni that I’ll be completing in the spring.

After finishing this year’s spring semester, I hadn’t found an internship yet and was really needing one since I was planning on taking the fall off for scheduling reasons. As a result, I was mentioning in my interviews that the internship didn’t have to be paid, and that I was just looking for some dev experience.

A CEO of a startup wanted me to work for him, so I did. He said he didn’t currently have the budget to pay me, but I wasn’t worried about it at the time since my parents were supporting me (and they wanted to so I could get this experience). I told him I’d be available to work until December.

It’s been almost 3 months and I feel like a part of the team already. I’m used for a lot of their day-to-day operations. CEO mentioned he wanted to train me as a front-end dev for a possible hire after graduation, and that he would maybe offer me some sort of compensation for the rest of the internship.

The thought of this really made me excited at the time, but he said this about a month and a half ago and I really haven’t gotten a vibe that he’s interested in paying me for the internship, nor that he would offer a decent salary if he was looking to hire me. Plus, the work I’m doing isn’t as exciting as I once thought it would be. Now I feel like I’m stuck in a commitment that I made. I feel extremely bored at work now, but there is stuff that they are still expecting me to do that I’m in the middle of. I just don’t feel motivated at all.... I feel like I’ve just been slaving myself for them. Also, I have other interests I want to pursue before I go back to finish my last semester.

I don’t know how to approach my boss about the situation. Do I ask for some compensation? Do I put in my two weeks even though I’m a big part of their team? I don’t just want to say “sorry I’m leaving”, but at the same time there are other things I want to do, the most important of which is making some sort of money for myself."

If you're a CS grad and you were able to find a job, how long did it take you to land that job? If you took an internship during University, did you feel that helped you get a job faster? If you didn't take an internship during University, did you end up taking an internship after graduation? What about coding bootcamps? Did any of you CS grads take a coding bootcamp after graduating?

How do I approach this?,CareerConcernedCamel,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/9a0y7y/still_in_college_until_may_but_wanting_to_find/,"Long story short, I ended up not graduating when I was expecting to due to some personal issues. I am now down to my last two semesters of engineering undergrad, but I am in my 6th year total of undergrad (5 years is pretty much the most common time frame for degree completion for my particular major, and because of the aforementioned personal issues, 1 whole year was basically wasted/considered ""withdrawn"").

&amp;#x200B;

I only have 11 credit hours left to complete before getting my degree, so, numerically, a semester where I would be considered part-time. However, because of the way the curriculum is set-up (and one of the reasons 5 years is the most common time frame), I can only take 6 hours this semester, because the remaining 5 hours require completion of one of the pre-requisites that I am taking this semester, thus making it a full 6 years of undergrad.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing: I want to find full-time work while I finish up these classes, and hopefully, continue to work at the same place after I complete my degree. I am more interested in the business side of engineering rather than engineering, and I am hoping that makes a difference in finding something before I have my degree -- such as in finding a B2B sales rep position within a related industry. I am done with classes by 9am TR and done by 10am MWF, so I have the entire day to work. How do I address this on my resume and in cover letters? Is there any hope of getting a full time position without my degree? What other field or job positions might I stand a chance in currently? My work experience includes 3.5 years of an on campus job, 8 months as a host/server at a restaurant, a 3.5 month summer internship related to my major (but it was 3 years ago), and years of being a private tutor. Additionally, I was heavily involved and held quite a few positions on campus my first 4.5 years."

I was the go to guy when any new hires came on board and I enjoyed ushering in new staff pharmacists and techs alike. An opportunity arose where I became the main training liaison as our previous one a pharmacist has been on medical leave. I did a pretty decent job not by my own account but by the director, pharmacists, techs, and interns who all have worked with me or been trained by me. The rub is the training manager recently told me they were going back to having a pharmacist take over that role which was kind of what I wanted to do. I also had many ideas for projects and ways to improve our department that I had already started working on. I have gone back to staffing which would be fine except they are trying to consolidate and therefore pullback a lot of things that made my job fulfilling like compounding ivs and training. After talking with others, I really think I have out grown the job, and with the way things were handled as far as replacing me in my duties now I am being treated like a jerk for standing up for myself as they wanted me to continue standing in for the new pharmacist with no hope for a promotion or an advancement of some sort.

I submitted a profile review [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/8x5grv/profile_review_27m_prior_military_34_gpa_160v162q/), and received some great advice.

I'm slated to take the GMAT in a little over a week but have been scoring ~700 on my practice exams, so I hope I can bump it a little higher in the little time I have left.

I recently completed an internship over the summer where I was able to speak to a good amount of people regarding their own processes and experiences as they went through their own business school journeys. I'm still a little worried, since I'm not totally sure where my profile fits, as I'm still working on my undergraduate degree as a veteran and the profiles I've seen so far are either prior officers or people with post-undergrad work experience.

1. Will applying straight out of undergrad hurt me in the same sense as it would a traditional undergrad student?
2. I served as an enlisted before I came back to school--should I consider putting off the applications and entering industry for a year or two before applying? Or is my enlisted military career considered work experience?
3. I'm studying computer science, with my GPA sitting at a ~3.4 at my current school. I've noted in my previous post that my pre-military college GPA is awful enough to drag my cumulative GPA down to far below median levels (~3.05). As I jump into the more difficult classes in my major, I'm worried my GPA will continue to sink until I graduate, so if I decided to work before applying, I'd be doing so with work experience, but a lower GPA. Will experience down the road carry more weight than the GPA?

I seriously apologize if any of this comes off as incoherent, I've been worrying a lot about whether or not I should apply now as I'm not sure if having been in the military BEFORE college would count as work experience. Thank you all again for your time and help!"

He started me on medication for both issues which allowed me to enroll and succeed in 3 courses at a community college over the spring semester.

This spiraled into burnout that resulted in severe anxiety and depression that made it too hard for me to even leave my room. Even though I’m now receiving treatment, I’m terrified of this happening again. To make matters worse, nobody knows about my academic dismissal or psychiatric issues. The few friends I still have at school were under the impression that I was still enrolled as I lived in an apartment off campus and hung out with them occasionally. The only people that know of my dismissal are my parents and they don’t even know I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication. When I told them I was struggling with my mental health, they suggested I see a therapist and avoid medication at all costs. I had tried therapy and it didn’t work for me, so I sought psychiatric help behind their backs. I’m a very private person and don’t talk about my health or mental health to anyone, but it’s getting hard keeping everything bottled up.  I don’t know what I should do upon returning to school; do I open up about my issues and academic dismissal or do I just keep moving forward like nothing happened? 


Have any of you been in a similar situation and if so, how did you handle it? Classes start Thursday and I’m worried I might be too anxious to even show up. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist Tuesday and want to bring it up, but I’m afraid to mention it because he was initially reluctant to prescribe me stimulant medication because I have had issues with anxiety. I’m worried that he might take me off my medication if I admit to this anxiety. I know it’s not related though because I’ve taken a break from the medication the past few days and feel just as uneasy. 

Sorry that my post is a bit all over the place, it’s just hard for me to keep my thoughts straight right now. Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated!


TL;DR: Feeling anxious about returning to school after a year long academic dismissal caused by undiagnosed ADHD. How can I manage my anxiety upon returning? "

I'm starting my sophmore year of college, and I've done well in all the CS related courses I've taken but most of the time, the projects felt like a hassle to do (there has been some projects that I genuinely enjoyed working on). I've been thinking about trying to break into Cyber Security after college but I've found out that industry is very difficult to get into without substantial experience. I've started by making a keylogger as a personal project and do plan on starting another personal project when I have time again. Tech Sales does sound appealing to me since I have been working at BestBuy and have been enjoying my time there and maybe that'll count as valuable experience down the road. I do plan on applying for SWE internships next summer to see if tech sales over a SWE career is something that I'd actually want. My question is how does somebody in CS break into a career in tech sales after college? Does the job come with good security and is it a job that people are genuinely happy doing?"

I went through the college admissions process last fall and ended up getting accepted to some pretty decent universities:

- University of Michigan - Ann Arbor

- University of Illinois - Urbana-Champaign

- University of Wisconsin - Madison

- University of Maryland - College Park

- Purdue University

- Northeastern University


Rankings wise, these universities are among the top ranked for CS. 
One problem though, I didn't get financial aid from ANY of those universities.

Because of this, I was basically forced to commit to my local college which to be frank is horrible. It has over a 70% acceptance rate and is barely known or offers any good programs. I felt my high school experience just vanish right there. All these AP classes I took, all the sleepless nights studying, the amount of time I spent studying for SATs, subject tests, etc just to end up at the same college as someone who slept through high school.


So this is where I feel I screwed up. Was it worth not taking over $150k in debt or will this just end up screwing me? I've heard so many stories of people going to top CS universities and ending up with fantastic internships and 6 figure jobs right out of college. If this is actually true, I feel like the debt could've been paid off and I would've gotten education at a top institute.


The current university I am going to be going too doesn't even have a proper career fair and career resources department. I feel like my opportunities are going to be so limited now plus the fact that I wasted all my high school studying like an idiot just go to the same school as someone who did nothing."

After going through a pretty lengthy and demoralizing interview season earlier in the year, I want to get back into interviewing for a full time position again. I had the opportunity to interview for the big companies and made it to the final round often, but never was able to get to over the ledge. Just a few facts about myself, I am a senior undergraduate who will be graduating in the fall with a significant amount of internship experience (about 1.5 years worth total). Fall time is always a huge hiring season for companies and so I was wondering if anyone could shed some light into reapplying for the same companies that I got rejected from and how they would view my application now. Also, any kind of moral advice to get through the difficulty of getting past the rejection to have some confidence in interviewing with these companies again.

​

Any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks guys!"
9a2mr5,4,2018-08-24,Stressed out because I don't have a timeline set for when I graduate; CS? Music Business? Time off?,bahgawdawman,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9a2mr5/stressed_out_because_i_dont_have_a_timeline_set/,"I'm going to be a senior but my timeline for my future is very uncertain. I'm a computer science major at NYU, but my resume isn't that great (no internships, not really any side projects, not that good of a GPA). I'm taking some important and useful classes this semester in order to have some cool projects and tools/technologies on my resume, as well as a class that helps out with my technical interviewing skills. However, this means I'd have to wait until the semester ends in December before I have a competitive resume, but tech companies in NYC generally start recruiting around fall, so I don't know how I can manage with that timeline since I'd have a more ideal resume after November. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I'm positive I don't want to do a programming job right after I graduate. I'm either going to look to take some time off, which could even be up to a year, or try to get hired at a position in the music industry, which is my #1 passion (and even that's up in the air because I can't even get an interview for an internship). 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is then, how comfortable can I be? If after I graduate, and I either don't start looking for a software engineering job until September at the very earliest, or I choose to go into music business and maybe decide to do a career switch into CS years down the line if I prefer that path, would things work out?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, what steps could I take to insure I can secure a music business job when I graduate, if I want to go for that?"

Now that I'm roughly four months into this job I'm beginning to realize that that was completely untrue. Development probably accounts for roughly 5% of this job. That along with several other cultural, managerial and technical problems I have with this position have me on the job market again.

The only issue is that this happens to be my first job. Before I graduated I had two internships, independently developed and published a game to Steam, worked as a Junior Back-End Developer in a contractual position and participated in several game jams / hackathons. I say all this to establish that I have a fairly broad development background for a new grad. This means I have plenty of stuff to put on my resume, but since I'm currently employed at this position I'm unsure about putting it on there as well. 

If I leave it off I feel like I'm being dishonest, and I have a gap in my work history from May to the present. If I put it on there then they wonder why I'm jumping ship so early. 

&amp;#x200B;

How should I handle quitting this job and getting a new one? Should I be upfront about my current position or should I just keep it quiet until the interviews?"

I live alone, which sometimes makes it even worse because I'm not around people unless I'm in class. I feel like I've developed mental issues (social anxiety, just anxiety in general) because I've lived alone the past few years. I feel like I'm out of my mind, and that life will never get better. Most of my friends from high school went to a school closer to home, but I wanted to get out and start a new life for myself, but that didn't work out too well.

every dish and every piece of cloth is washed, the whole house is clean and i dont have any real hobbies. i probably did more cleaning in the past week than i did in my whole life.
all i can do is to sit around and hope that time passes quickly so that i can go to work again. 

i always told myself that im some kind of ""lone wolf"" who doesnt need anyone and that i enjoy solitute alot, but these past 2 weeks have proven this so wrong. im a 22 year old male and i cant even enjoy the smallest things anymore, even my ""teacher"" told me that she knows that i would rather not have holiday at all, and would rather work trough the whole year. she is absolutely right, i mean i know that i would have a high risk of a burn-out, but this sitting around doing nothing is hurting my mental state, i cant be alone with my thoughts anymore, i need constant stress to shift my thoughts out of my head.

&amp;#x200B;

Current Situation:

I'm going into my 3rd year of undergrad for a major that's somewhat related to CS (Cognitive Systems). Unfortunately, I was not able to make it to the CS program at my university, so I decided to just major in something that's quite related so that I could still a decent amount of CS courses. I'm hoping to do something more related to web-development (+ UX, App Development) after graduation. However, my university does not offer much courses on web-development except for some databases courses. 

&amp;#x200B;

Current Knowledge/Experience:

I've taken all the necessary courses for a typical CS major up to the end of 2nd year, which involves mostly data structures/algorithms, programming in Java, etc. I've also been trying to learn web-development on my own through online resources like Udemy &amp; websites like W3Schools. 

&amp;#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not really sure where to go from here or what exactly I can do. I tried looking for some  internships for this summer but I was not able to find one so I was hoping to work more on my resume &amp; projects from now so that I can find one next summer before I graduate (I know that having work experience prior to graduation will really help with the job search). I was hoping to get some advice on what I could do, specifically

\- Where / how I can develop more knowledge that's good enough for an internship

\- Possible projects that I can work on 

\- Advice on finding internships / positions after graduating.

9a4ztn,102,2018-08-25,I got rejected from every single school I applied to.,littlepenguin123,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9a4ztn/i_got_rejected_from_every_single_school_i_applied/,"Right now is back-to-school season, which means app season, which means extremely stressed out seniors trying to handle schoolwork, apps (obviously), parents breathing down their necks, and questions about their major/dream school/SAT or ACT scores/etc. So I wanted to write a post for those seniors right now, and give advice that I wish someone would have told me one year ago when I was in the exact same position as you guys! Here we go--

So yes, as the title suggests, i was rejected from **EVERY. SINGLE. SCHOOL.** This is not an exaggeration. I'm saying, i applied to 15 schools, and was rejected from every single one. Here's a little bit about me to give you a perspective:

* female
* middle class (lived EXTREMELY blessed my whole life without any financial hardships)
* \~4.0 weighted gpa (its actually slightly higher but to be honest i dont remember the exact number)
* 1530 SAT
* 4/5 on all my AP tests
* extracurriculars include leadership, music, working with the mentally and physically disabled, tutoring young kids, and other things here and there

I applied to mostly UCs and a few other schools, and was rejected from all, except one mid ranked UC, which I was waitlisted on and then rejected from. So yeah, spring 2018 was literally one of the shittiest experiences of my life. Rejection letter after rejection letter, seeing all of my friends get into their dream schools, I probably cried every night, and even relapsed momentarily back into cutting my wrists. Being happy for my friends and listening to them talk about roommates, housing situations, classes, etc. was probably the most painful for me, because nobody tells you how much it's going to hurt to suck up all those sad depressed feelings and show your joy for their successes.

Also, when people asked me ""what schools have you gotten into so far?"" I had to awkwardly laugh and say ""nowhere yet!"" and try not to think about it constantly for the rest of the day. (Pro tip: **please please PLEASE** ask *""do you know what school you're going to?""* instead of *""where have you gotten in?""* it's so much less uncomfortable for people who are in the same position as me).

But anyways, I'm not just saying this to make you scared of the idea of being in my situation. It could very possibly happen to some of you, and it could also not. But if you happen to realize you may be heading where I was, here are some things that you should know so that you don't have to experience the horrible existential crisis that i did!

First of all, there are other options than a 4-year university!!!! I am currently attending my local community college, and my perspective of community college in general has changed SO much. There are so many people here who are here for so many different reasons, yet we all have the same goal: to learn! The professors and students are all very supportive of each other, and you can definitely still find a good group of friends who can influence you to be your best :) Other than that, gap year, internships, studying abroad, are all extremely good options as well.

Second, *most* people don't judge you for not getting into a certain university. Most of the people I knew were supportive and understanding, and never looked down on the idea of community college. I guess out of everything, I was just embarrassed to have been rejected from all of my schools, but once i realized that no one really cared that much, I was able to put my ego aside and be upfront about the fact that I was going to go to a cc. But if there are people who pity/judge you (which i guarantee there will be some), then fuck them and their small minded stupid asses, and move on. Toxic people are not worth your time.

Lastly, it is NOT the end of the world. Although it really seemed like I would be missing out on a perfect future of going to a university, having a dorm room, going to parties, etc. was ruined, I realized that 2 years of my life at community college are so insignificant compared to the many many more years that I'll live. Further, this is just another experience that will teach you so much about life and will help you climb back up to the top even stronger.

This post was honestly a huge mess but i guess what I'm trying to say is **(TL;DR)** if you don't get into your dream school, or any school, you will be JUST FINE!! 

If anybody wants to talk to me for advice or even just wants to take their mind off from the horrible stress that is application season, feel free to message me! &lt;3 Good luck to you all!!"

I'm a student in the math department, so I know enough programming to be dangerous, but not much more than that.  Right now I have been training models under different algorithms, mostly unsuccessfully (every attempt to do so with a particular algorithm has resulted in an obstacle of a different nature...), and I understand that getting a good model may require some tweaking before getting right.  However, the process has been time consuming (because training can take days at a time), and I've realized, a bit late in the game, that if I want to be efficient, I'm going to need hardware that's a bit better than my current laptop (for example, a decent graphics card besides Intel that enable gpu rather than mere cpu computing as well as more than 6G RAM).

My question is whether the university may have resources that are already used for research in the CS and engineering departments that is available for projects requiring heavy loads of computation. I know that the school has a very strong CS/ engineering department with people who work in computer vision in particular, so surely they have resources on this.  Is some of it freely available to students?

At this point I cannot afford to buy new hardware either in the form of schmancy graphics cards or a new laptop, but if I am able to use some extra resources (and maybe a little but of extra guidance on developing a successful model), it would be most helpful."

She came clean that she was at a party with her sorority sisters, and she made out with a random guy. This was around July, and she came clean immediately after the fact this all happened.

I might’ve handled this poorly, but I didn’t tell her that I wanted her out of my life. I was just trying to get at that I needed space. I communicated that poorly, so I told her that I didn’t exactly mean a break up, and just wanted space. 

So this brings us to now, or at least very recently, I started texting her around the beginning of August, and we arranged a meet up in a public setting to discuss everything. The meet up went well, and it seemed like the relationship would be fixed. The key take away was she said she wants to have me back. 

Then, it kind of took a nosedive because life happened, I was busy working shortly after our meet up, and I was just dead tired. I pushed away meeting with friends and social activities. All that stuff, because of work, got pushed to the back of my mind. 

I finally called her out of the blue, and told her that I still have feelings for her, additionally I followed up with mentioning the meeting we had earlier in the summer. I ended my piece with saying that I wanted a relationship again.

There was a long, awkward pause on the other end, and she just tells me that the feelings are no longer mutual. She tells me that she respected the space I asked for, but after the meeting she soon felt neglected because I wasn’t returning any of her Snapchats, or text messages. I basically just kept leaving her on “Read”. 

I tried explaining to her, and she should know this by now, that just because I don’t reply to a funny text or a Snapchat, doesn’t mean I disliked it, or thought it was stupid. I just find it ludicrous to have to reply back “LOL” after everything. I also explained to her that work has been crazy. 

She started to explain, in the form of an analogy, that me as the a ship’s captain that I sailed away and left her at the port, and that she found another ship to sail on (at first I thought another bf, but she was just trying to make a point that she moved on with her life) I asked what she meant, and she said that I started throwing signals that I was done with her. Which, wasn’t my intention, and I tried to back my stance on that. It didn’t work. 

After that long winded spiel, I have to ask, should I be surprised or upset that she closed the door on me? I wasn’t trying to lead her on either, it was never my intention. It just seems like my inactivity with my texts and snaps, that she moved on with her life. 

As I finished this all up, I texted her with a long lined apology that basically covered the whole me not talking much because of work taking my energy away. I followed up with saying that I don’t regret the memories we’ve had together. I also mentioned that if she ever needs a helping hand, that I’m still here. Not sure if it’s the smartest thing to do, but my heart said it was the right thing to do. 

It’s strange because she tried her best at damage control, and now it just seems like she’s saying “get out of my life”. "

Although part of me wants to go into medicine I dread continuing to go to school for 10 plus years and I don't think I can handle the workload of medical school.



Many people have been telling me that getting a biology major is medicine or bust, the job outlook for a bio major is very bad I dont want to get stuck with one of the hardest majors making 35,000 dollars per year.



I have a natural love for business and everything about it; combined with my love for medicine I decided I would want to go into the health care administration.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you guys recommend be my next steps; can I major in Bio and still go into health care or should I change my major. What steps should I take to be successful in my major, I am the type of person that needs to plan all his steps. Will I need a masters too?  And lastly what are some ways I can find internships in this field. Thank you guys

I am in a very weird situation at the moment and don't know what to do. I am going to to tl;dr it for you.

At uni doing computer science with 2 semesters to go. Currently doing 4 subjects this semester.

Started work full time at a new company as a junior software engineer 2 weeks ago.  Unstructured development processes, but using React Native which will be very valuable in the future. Poor pay. 3 fulltime days per week, affecting uni. Harder to get to. 

Recently got offer from a more renowned company for software developer intern. It's a popular company in Australia, employers would defs recognise it. Nearly double pay than current job. Better location. 2 full-time days per week so can handle uni and have a life. Likely better development practices but uses archaic technologies such as Adobe Experience Manager.

I feel like I'd definitely prefer the latter offer. I am passionate about the project that my current job is working on, but my primary goal is to make my dad retire. I should put my interests before the company's interests right?

Will the developer intern position be more valuable to me than the junior software engineer position?"

Culturally I have been Mexican all my life. First generation in my family. High school is very large and very competitive. 

Middle class (about 60k), only one income from my mom who is a single parent (has been since 2008). Two other sisters, I’m the oldest. I’ve had to spend a lot of time caring for them and staying at home, which is something I indicated in my app.

Intended Major/Field of Study: International Relations/Global Studies Weighted: 4.0 (will check again, school does it weird) (upward trend since soph year) UW: 3.73? Scores: ACT: 33 (retaking one more time?) Subject tests: World History (770), United States (720, plan to retake), Literature (700)

APs: World History, US History, English Lang and Comp, Environmental Science, Human Geo (self-study), Psychology (self-study), got 5’s on all of them except for Environ which was a 4, currently taking American Lit, Statistics, American Gov/Microeconomics, IB Global Politics. Took Intro to Poli Science over the summer.

ECs: 

- Marching Band (three years, couldn’t do it my freshman year), Section Leader (MASSIVE time commitment, it’s like 40+ hours a week just from practicing alone, and even more when we have competitions which are all day on Saturdays from 9 to 10 at night. It’s limited me from doing so many other things, like IB, Debate, MUN, etc. Talked about this in my apps.

- Color Guard (two and a half years), Assi.  Captain for Color Guard team, same thing as band in terms of time commitment and competitions.

 - Volunteered at an animal shelter since my sophomore year, 100+ hours

- Peer College Counselor at school (takes up an entire period of my schedule). We organize college events, give presentations , and meet with seniors from our school to talk about colleges and such. 

- Interned over the summer at our councilman's field office in California doing a lot of desk and computer work, answering phones, filing papers, etc. 80+ hours from that

- Currently doing research with a professor from California State University, Northridge on environmental politics and law. In contact with another professor from CSUN to try and do research on Latin American politics and affairs.

 - Interning at the mayor’s office / city council during the school year to work on campaigns and city policy (probably one of the best things on my app)

- Treasurer for Armenian Club (not Armenian), member of a few others clubs (Senior Club and Pet Club, etc.)

- Self-taught Portuguese over the summer (basic level but I'm pretty okay at it actually, still working on learning more and practicing) 

- Created a website for APUSH help and study guides (I’ve made multiple practice exams and study guides for people to use, has about 1,000 views in total)

Essays: Planning on talking about when my dad died during my junior year, its impact on my grades/personal life, etc. I don’t want it to be a sob story though so I’m being careful about it. For UC prompts I’m talking about leadership, creative side, educational opportunity, and challenge in life.

LORs: APUSH teacher (had her for 11th grade APUSH, I’m pretty sure she really likes and she actually said I was the best of her students last year which was nice, also I cried in front of her one time lol), APES Teacher (11th grade, likes me a lot I think). College counselor will write my counselor letter (since I work with her basically everyday as a Peer College Counselor she knows me better than my academic counselor, so I’m hoping she’ll write me a good letter.)

Concerns: I’d like to study International Relations but it’s super competitive especially for Georgetown and basically any other schools that offer it. Does anyone know any other schools that I may be matched with that are really good for IR? I also don’t have many ECs specific towards my major (other than the internship I don’t have much, I couldn’t do Model UN because it conflicted with my schedule). Also low GPA is low GPA but whatever I can’t do anything about it anyway, the only thing I have is that I had a really large upward trend and the fact that my dad died really impacted my performance in a way. Also my test scores (ACT/subject tests) are kinda low for these schools but I’m planning on retaking all of them before the November 1 deadline for EA."

I graduated from a big ten university this spring and after two semesters of an internship with the same company, I landed my dream (entry level) job.  Then two weeks later I was let go from the company.  This absolutely crushed me as I put my heart and soul and everything I had into attaining the position.  Shortly before my dismissal and starting around spring break of my last semester, I used all the positive momentum and “high” of graduating and getting my dream job to pursue a beautiful girl that I believed was my soulmate.  She let me sweep her up and she too thought I was her soulmate and man of her dreams...  so we started dating in April and we really loved each other.

Once I got dismissed from my dream job, it all went down hill from there.  I was unhappy and not fun to live with.  I felt like my life was out of control and I couldn’t control a lot of my emotions and my fear of rejection grew even larger.  All while knowing about ADHD and it’s common trait: rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD).

Well, now it has officially happened.  My “soulmate” broke up with me.  I lost my dream job and my soulmate.  The more and more I research ADHD, the more and more I believe that this stuff is inevitable for people with ADHD.  I tried my ass off to circumvent any issues that would arise due to me having ADHD.  I did everything I could to treat my symptoms, educate her on the disorder, and be honest with her about everything I was going through, but at the end of the day, who’s going to be patient enough to date and eventually marry someone with ADHD?

I lost my dream job and soulmate.  Where do I go from here?

Tl;dr:  I lost my dream job.  Then the depression drove away my soulmate.  I put 110% into both the job and the relationship.  How can I live life with any sort of hope if these sorts of things inevitably happen to people with ADHD, no matter how hard we try?

PS: I’m medicated, I meditate, I take a bunch of supplements, I work out (I’m a personal trainer btw), I journal, I’m into personal development, I’m not averse to therapy, I’m a nutrition and health nut, i read tons of books to live better and support my big dreams and aspirations, I take full responsibility for my life, I do what is necessary and difficult, not what is easy and expedient, I delay my gratification.  I do everything in my power to not let ADHD prevent me from living the life of my dreams.

Edit: it’s almost as if I knew these things would happen all along, like a self-fulfilling prophecy.  And I knew the self-fulfilling prophecy would come to fruition and it was like I knew about it and knew it was happening in the moment but I couldn’t do anything about it.  How can I avoid this self-fulfilling prophecy about ADHD, knowing what I know about ADHD from the tons of research and books I’ve read on it?"

Hello !

​

First of all, I'd like to thank you for all the answers and topics here, they helped me a lot :)

​

I am a computer science student (sophomore starting of september), from a 3rd world university (say ranked 1000 worldwide)

​

This year (as a freshman) I participated in GSoC with a really cool org, and worked on a cool project.

​

While I have some side projects (mainly: PHP &amp; Node.JS Web Dev, Python with Scikit-learn - Numpy data related projects)

​

I do have decent knowledge of algorithms and data structures (studying in CLRS, practicing in Cracking the code interview book )

​

Do  you think with such profile, I can land a summer internship -2019 or  2020- at top companies in the valley? And what do I need to improve in  your opinion to minimize the gap between a world's top university  student and a dirt's top university student?

PS: I know I didn't provide much information, sry."

I was originally studying CS but didn't end up majoring in it. Looking back I regret this. I remember going to a few career fairs during college but they didn’t go well. Every big company was there but there were also long lines of people and I didn’t really have a way to stand out. I simply didn’t take advantage of my college experience. 

I was applying to a lot of jobs, but I kind of got demotivated after not hearing back from most of them. It’s not surprising because I don’t have any work experience in this field, and I don’t have many personal projects outside of a few rudimentary class projects in a few courses I have taken. 

I want to land a well-paying job, preferably in software engineering since that’s really the only field I have some introduction to. As I see it, I’m nowhere near ready, and I’m willing to put in the work to try. 

So **TL;DR** , I have a few **questions**:

- As someone without any work experience, what are some projects that I can work on to learn what it takes to be a good software engineer, and stand out on a resume? 
- As someone with a non-cs degree, what are some strategies I should use while applying for jobs? Any sites you recommend? I created a Linkedin, but I legitimately don’t have much to put on it other than a college degree, so not sure how helpful it is.
- - should I apply to internships? are any of them even looking for students who have already graduated?
- I have the book Cracking the Coding Interview, as highly recommended on here, and started reading it. But honestly, if I can’t even land an interview to begin with, I’m not sure if this is where I should start. 

Thanks for reading this long post. Any and all advice will be much appreciated.

So I'm in the ""no internships"" boat, but as much as I would have liked to have an internship, I was a pre-med student before I declared a double-major in computer science. I only got approval to major in CS about 3 months before summer of 2017. I graduated June of 2018, so that timeline left me incapable of getting an internship.

I had a few hits on my resume and narrowly missed out on an entry embedded position at Honeywell, but overall, I still have a pretty bad response rate to my resume. I believe this is because of my lack of internships, so what I'm doing now is working on expanding my github with some new projects and rewritten old assignments, and also reworking my LinkedIn as I apply.

What I'm actually interested in asking: is there any value at all in having my research/internship experience from my chemistry/pre-med schooling on my resume? Is there any angle at all that I can take on my past experience and working with what I have to maybe use it to get a dev job at a health company or a research company? Or is this just wishful thinking and it literally has 0 value? I've gotten mixed opinions on this, from ""literally no one cares, don't even mention your double major"" to ""omg I'd totally love this if I were looking to hire someone, I can't believe you're getting such a bad response rate."" 

Does the software field care about any of this, generally?

I'm writing on my sock puppet account. _Disclaimer:_ This whole thing feels like it's more in my head, my inexperience in playing the job market shows, I think.

_Background 1:_ I've been with my current employer almost a decade. I started as an intern. I've organically went from a programmer, to tech lead, to systems architect. I'm now transitioning into a cloud architect (the growing pains are neat, though I sometimes miss the programming parts).

_Background 2:_ Last winter a friend found out I was doing cloud stuff, and (long story short) I applied to a position in their architect team. Again, long story short, my gross income could've risen about about 10%, but in the end I decided to stay in my current position. 

But that was the first time I had seriously thought of changing my occupier. The experience was somewhat ""vitalizing"" and also ""excruciating"" (sorry for the dramatic choice of words). I was open about the process with my supervisor. What changed in the end was that I got a team member, which was nice.

Fast forward to _present:_ An old friend and I was catching up over lunch, and they got really interested in my expertise. Again, skipping forward, my gross income would rise about 25%, other perks would be similar, and I'd be part of a team of programming architects.

And now I'm freaking out. And I've never had this strong sense of ""imposter syndrome"" before. I enjoy my tasks in my current position, but the compensation of the new position is really generous, and would help with my family's financial situation. I also feel like there are no ready suitable replacer for me in my current position, and my leaving might jeopardize a lot (however presumptuous that might sound). To oversimplify the situation :shrug:

I've understood that it is a _very_ good idea to apply to jobs regularly, at least to gauge your market value. Maybe I should've done this more during the last 10-ish years, and maybe then I wouldn't be so wound up now. The positions are quite similar. Of course the compensation, the substance fields, and the size of the companies are different. 

And of course this is a decision that is up to __me__ to make. I talked about this a bit with a mental health specialist I've been seeing as part of my work health care plan, and they've told me that I come across as a very empathic/sympathetic and I am not big into conflict situations _or_ change. I feel like I'd be letting someone down (or even _betraying_) whatever I decide to do, and I feel like my judgement is clouded by my dislike of chance.

I'm seeing my supervisor tomorrow to talk about this. I've promised to let the new company know about my decisions at the start of the week. 

Thank you for reading. Sorry for the long and rambling post. I had to get this off my chest. Any response is appreciated, but just shouting to the void of internet made me feel a bit better. I'm still stressing out about the meeting tomorrow, and the phone call after. Maybe I'll go do laundry now, and then stress out more. Cheers!

So I just completed a postgraduate degree in Quantitative Finance after having worked a couple of years in audit and sales in IT consultancy ( really not related to what the postgrad I just did, I know). I'm nearing the end of my internship for a bank where I'm developing a small application in Python and so I'm applying for jobs. In an ideal world I would like to become a quantitative analyst in financial markets (front office, something related to derivatives for instance) or a data scientist in finance, but given my modest quantitative background (MSc in Business Administration before first working experience and this past year as been really rough when it came to Stochastic Calculus and Mathematical Statistics) I am afraid this will not work, or at least this is my I tell myself. 

I am really curious as to what you guys might have as an input. Is there a job from where I can gradually grow into a quant position? Or maybe are there interesting sales position in the financial markets where a training in quant finance can come in handy?

Apologies for the naive tone of my question, I am really open to read what people with more experience might have to say. 

Thanks in advance!"

So I can answer questions for the next little while. Directed towards mostly first years, feel free to ask about courses, interviews, getting experience /whatever else


Edit: sorry ran into somethings at the airport. Replied to most comments I think now. Taking off soon, I will summarize things that helped me here;

Basically the key tips I would give are: work hard in your courses (aim for an 85, even if you miss you will land close by hopefully). Getting good marks means you learnt the course material well, so don't ignore your GPA, it does convey some things like your work ethic and ability to do well in pressure/deadlines. 

Work on side projects, they don't have to be all good. But have at least 2 good projects on resume, and a bunch of filler stuff. You can add class projects, use them. (But not if the whole class had the same project, this is where you had freedom in design/topics).

Getting an internship in first year is hard. So spend your summer learning easy but useful things like html/CSS/JavaScript/pickup the hottest frontend framework (you don't have to be an expert to write you're familiar with it on resume).

I didn't have an internship in my second year either, but I got a lot of good experience from workstudies. Apply to them. They are one the easiest ways to get experience. You will be paid min wage, but some jobs better than no job.


By the time PEY started, I had a solid resume with a lot of projects and 2 workstudies. I also picked up a bunch of frameworks/tools/languages to prop up my resume with, and projects with those to show some evidence. Believe out of 34 job applications, I got 17 interviews and 10 offers. But I ditched that for the summer internship. Company name is a huge help so thats why I chose the summer internship over smaller pey companies.

Just get started by working on personal projects, look for things that bug you, and try to implement a solution. Everything else comes naturally after that.

Also don't forget to have fun and make friends. It's good to not be lonely, helps your mental health, and that keeps you in shape for exams/all nighters/ days when you don't want to work

Also don't shy away from working hard. I know you hear a lot , ""don't work hard, work smart."" Do both and that's when you really start to grow and get better quickly.

Also another tip is to look at job descriptions, and work backwards from there to figure out which courses you want to take. Just use Google to find jobs, there's no secret job postings site.

And don't be stupid like me and apply to 3 companies in first year, and like 10 in second year. This year when i got this internship, I had a lot of other offers because I applied to like 50/60+ internships. 

But most importantly remember to have fun! It's a lot of work to get to a good job, so if you're not enjoying it, take a break. Think about things that make you happy, and figure out if you're just temporarily hesitant because you're stuck on something/seems difficult or you actually really hate coding 😂😂


Also I'm writing this as plane is taking off so forgive me for not having coherent thoughts / proofreading


P.S. all rules are arbitrary. You can probably get an override for prerequisites or take courses you shouldnt really be in, by just asking a human being in person. Nothing's set in stone 

One of the most useful things in me getting my internship was the help of an older friend who interned here before me. Find that person for yourself, they will guide you with when to apply/how to apply/ how to study/prep for interview/answer any questions you might have. Really find yourself that mentor. And if you cant right now, read other people's experiences online, be proactive and make sure to find yourself help, use all the resources you have at your disposal (i.e. google search)"

​

So I'm about to graduate from a masters program in computer science but have never had a job since high school, where I spent a summer at a defense contractor lab doing some RF stuff. I'm graduating this fall and need to get a job, but I have no idea how.

In regards to employability, I kind of wasted my time in undergrad. I'm going to an Ivy League school and I originally went there to be a linguist but I became disillusioned with the field. I also do a lot of architectural history on the side and am interested in design. I pivoted to computer science late in my junior year, and subsequently stayed an extra three semesters to do a masters, so I never felt like I had adequate skills to perform well in an internship until recently.

​

I know I'm supposed to go to a career fair and do a resume blast but my resume is almost pure flaccid. I was barely involved in any substantive extracurriculars; the only projects to my name are design exhibitions I've curated (And some ruddy course projects). My GPA is too low (Masters 3.02, undergraduate 3.58) for consulting jobs, and I have virtually no likely LoR for any fellowships. In the classes I've taken I feel like I've only scraped the surface of various fields and am still deficient in many fields; I don't know javascript or clang. Nevertheless, I'm a fast learner."

I'm an international Asian student looking to junior transfer into UIUC's CS + X Program, where X is likely to be Stats. My primary reason for transferring is an academic one as my current uni's CS curriculum is too rigid and doesn't allow much breadth into applied sciences and the humanities that I'm also interested in. UIUC is a top choice for me; I'm doing a lot of research into the school's atmosphere, academics, job and research opportunities, how it fits me etc. and I'm really liking it so far. 

While I understand numbers aren't everything, and recognizing that UIUC has extremely competitive EECS and CS departments, I'm curious if anyone here who was a transfer student to UIUC or has experience in these matters can approximate whether I stand a competitive edge. 

I hold the equivalent of a 3.5GPA in a top-ranked international university (think Uni Melbourne/UNSW) and am in the middle of fulfilling most major requirements e.g. Calc III, Data Structures, Statistics etc. with completion of 70+ credits by the end of my sophomore year. I also have a 1470/1600 SAT (770 in Math) and 760/800 on the SAT Math II and SAT Physics subject tests if they are of any relevance. My extra-curriculars are mostly centered around Hackathons, a CS-unrelated summer internship, and a couple of social clubs. Lastly, I get that being an international student would also make the process more competitive for me as most transfer students would be in-state.

While I won't be able to visit the campus, I will definitely try and reach out to the admissions office or an advisor at UIUC to obtain more information. 

I am sincerely grateful to you for any advice and feedback regarding how I can best maximize my chances for transferring into UIUC. 

All the best!"

**Background**

* Work experience: 6 years at matriculation. Operations Engineer at a system operator with consistent promotions (Associate, I, II, III). Started off in a 1y development program across all major engineering functions. Primary role is in operations and market analysis. Analyzing and understanding system performance. Working with market participants to develop guidelines and rules for the market. Working with reliability organization to analyze market participant performance and compliance.
* Extra curriculars: Not gonna lie here, no extra curriculars outside of my own personal hobbies.
* Undergrad school/major: Mid-tier, tech-focused private school in the NE. Electrical Engineering with Business and Math Minors.
* Other education/coursework: Undergrad Minors in Business Administration, Mathematics. Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. Have taken one course while working for funsies (Power System Planning). I won't put ""funsies"" on my application, lol.
* Race/nationality: White/American
* Sex: M

**Stats**

* GMAT Score (include breakdown!): 720 (47 Quant, 42 Verbal, 6  IR) (5 Practice Tests)
* Undergrad GPA: 3.33, Graduate GPA(MSEE): 3.97

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA: Passionate about energy, in particular the electricity industry. Would like to use MBA to utilize my technical understanding of electric system operations, electricity markets, and policy in a more strategic, financial/economic, and development role. Would like to land a role in an investment bank, independent power producer, renewable developer, or market research firm (wide array of opportunities).
* Target schools: UT McCombs Reach: UC Berkeley Haas

I am interested in CleanTech first, and Energy Finance second - hense McCombs and Haas are on the top of my list. 

I have a few concerns/comments here:

* GMAT is not yet taken, keep getting between 700 and 720 on practice tests (scheduled for Wednesday).
* Undergrad GPA is low(ish) BUT... I started off undergrad with a 1.8 or something first semester. Retook a bunch of the classes to wipe those off my GPA (they are still on my transcript). Obviously went through growing pains but learned how to study and continuously got better (got a 4.0 last semester). Got better grades consistently while also taking harder courses (including business, energy policy, and grad level power system classes). Got a 3.97 in my MSEE taking extremely difficult electrical engineering courses and also performing research, etc. Had multiple internships and also participated in extra curriculars through undergad and grad.
* No extra curriculars since graduation for grad. No excuse here, just working a lot of hours and wanting time to explore my own hobbies and my new home.
* No leadership roles at current company (i.e. lead, supervisor, manager) but took leadership roles in multiple projects including one for a major national reliability non-profit that will have far-reaching impacts. Not really that concerned with this since I have about two or three major projects that I took a leadership role in that I can speak to at length.
* My essays are going to focus on my plan, and how this is a passion of mine, and all my experience that I've gotten has been specifically targetted at growing in this industry.

Some quick questions: How low of a GMAT score should I be okay applying to McCombs/Haas? Do I even mention my low freshman year GPA? Do I submit a supplemental essay talking about how I grew from it and point to tangible results? How do I work around no extra-curriculars? Do I get involved now with the possible perception I'm just trying to bolster my resume? Will I get in? Are you all the best subreddit on reddit? Easy question - yes you are.

9ai1s0,1,2018-08-26,I'm burnt out and not getting any help,AnonymousPerson322,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9ai1s0/im_burnt_out_and_not_getting_any_help/,"So basically here’s the story.

Middle school was super easy for me at a public middle school.  I didn’t go to my local middle school but took the bus to a slightly farther school for the magnet and STEM programs there.  6th grade was good, I was adapting well to the environment of the school and doing well in all of my classes.  However, I think that I became too comfortable and privileged at the school.  I had straight A’s in each class, and whenever I wanted to during my 7th and 8th grade years, I could convince my teachers to let me out to go to my engineering teacher’s classroom and mess around.  My engineering teacher was too chill and we hardly did anything in that class, but we did a LEGO robotics competition that I was super enthusiastic about and really loved.

After 8th grade I applied to a super prestigious high school and got accepted.  It was much different than the middle school I went to, the classes were very difficult and there was a lot of work involved in them.  I also have a very difficult time paying attention during lectures which made it super hard for me to learn the materials in the classes.  I ended up failing my history class and had to take it over the summer.

I got a paid internship over the summer for $10/hour which was my first paying job.  I worked 8-5 every weekday.  This ended as school started up again.  I really enjoyed my time there and hopefully can work there again over the next summer.

Before the summer ended, I got another job at a local escape room, run by somebody at my church.  The job is a lot of fun, it doesn’t even feel like work.  I get paid minimum wage there but get fed and the work is entertaining.  I still work some weekends and week nights.  Shifts are 6 hours, from 11-5 and 5-11.  With the rooms running about an hour each, it wouldn’t logically make sense to have shorter shifts which is fine by me.

Anyways, school starts.  The point of the school program I am in is dual-enrollment, but it is incorporated with a college so basically at this point I am taking college classes on campus with other college students.  Even though it’s only been a week since it started, I have begun to hate it.  I’m not old enough to drive yet so my brother brings me and picks me up (he is a year older than I am).  My brother, however, is taking a class that goes until 5PM, while mine go until around noon each day.  This is really detrimental to me because I have to sit on campus for 4 hours each day and I have nothing to do, I don’t live on campus and as a high school student can’t participate in many of the programs that are available on the campus.  I have very few friends, partially because I don’t relate to many of the people at school and partially because I spend such little time with the people at school.  We all live far apart so it’s hard to find people to hang out with outside of school.

I am super burnt out because of school.  I can never focus anymore, I am super tired all the time, and I am sick of going to get an education for things I will likely never use in the future.  I believe that I would do better in some alternate learning environment where I could pick and choose what I want to learn about but have never tried anything like that.

Currently I am seriously considering transferring to my local high school.  I know people that go there who also go to my church.  At church, everybody talks to each other about school stuff because they are together so much, and I feel left out all the time.  Switching to this school would let me be more social and find some friends.  It is also much larger than the school I currently attend, which would increase my likelihood of finding at least a few people who would be my friends.

So have my parents been supportive of me during this?  Not really.  95% of what my mom says to me is to finish the online history course I am currently enrolled in.  I get no encouragement for succeeding at things, just a pat on the back.  But when I fail or lack behind, I get my devices taken away and basically anything that makes me happy is gone.  When I even brought up the idea of switching schools, my dad said it was a “cop-out” and my mom said from now on I can only work 2 shifts per week.

I have thought about running away before.  I would need to find somewhere to stay and support myself while I get away from my parents controlling me and telling me how to live my life.  I don’t know if it’s a reasonable idea but I have thought about it a few times.

So I feel really depressed all the time, have no friends, and my parents aren’t supporting me in my decisions.  What gives, Reddit?"

This mostly applies to the UK because that's where I'll be studying, but giving perspective on other European countries wouldn't hurt if you feel inclined to do so.  Thanks in advance

1). I got BCB in Maths, Chemistry and Physics for my A-Levels respectively with decent GCSE grades. On the ambitious side of things I hope I can get 3 paid summer internships and secure a work placement for my placement year for a total of 4 internships.   


Since It's very difficult and unlikely for me to breach into the industry for an intern position during first year, I am currently  considering using first year as a means to build a strong resume and portfolio to hopefully get a position during summer for 2nd year and so and so forth. If at all, how would my grades affect my chances and what personal projects and events would you suggest I take a shot at to build a quality resume? 

2). This is a short one, but any info on this would be helpful too. How much do summer internships pay on average in the UK and how does the pay compare to work placements. I heard that employers pay same for either and that the pay ranges from  £14,000 to  £ 25,000.

* **did you plead guilty to a crime?** I didn't plead guilty but to be adj wth the disposition sheet has to say guilty above adj wth. technically i pled nolo contendre

9alt6o,0,2018-08-26,Dealing with sexist friend,mgmtdrag,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9alt6o/dealing_with_sexist_friend/,"My boyfriend’s roommate/best friend and I have known each other for two years now. He’s a good friend of mine and I enjoy spending time with him when he’s not being rude/offensive. I’m not sure how to handle when he is being offensive, particularly the sexist comments. (I am a female by the way, and my friend is a guy.) Usually when he makes a joke/comment I get really heated and can’t control what I say so I end up fighting back. My boyfriend always says that his roommate isn’t being sexist, and that I’m making the situation worse and making it a bigger deal than it is. He believes it’s just a joke even though it offends me.

Example of one of our conversations:

Roommate: R and L, I heard you guys talking to J’s mom about how J and I are babies because we can’t handle things that are gross. Just because we have bad gag reflexes doesn’t mean we are babies! We just don’t want to clean.

Me: Well geez if you guys don’t want to clean and it’s your mess why do we have to? What if I put it in your car because you guys like your car so much?

Roommate: I’ll just buy another car because men make more money than women, and men are the breadwinners so I never have to clean.

Me: Well... in my particular case, I happen to make the most money here. (This summer I had a well paying internship.)

Roommate: wait what do you mean, you don’t even have a job.

Me: I had one this summer; and I could’ve taken a co-op if I wanted.

Roommate: L started this by bringing up that we are babies!!

I understand I fought back pretty harshly but he makes comments all the time like “women should be the ones to clean,” or “I won’t clean my room because my girlfriend does it for me,” or “men make more money than women, therefore men are better,” and commenting on women’s weaknesses. He says it “jokingly” yet it still offends me and my boyfriend always takes his side.

How do I deal with this without going insane?"

What are the chances with my current stats?,Seankala,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/9amop4/i_wish_to_pursue_an_mscs_at_georgia_tech_what_are/,"Hello. I'm from South Korea and I recently decided to pursue graduate studies a couple of months ago, and was wondering what my chances were of getting into an MSCS program in the US (particularly, Georgia Tech's MSCS).

I have one semester left and upon graduation I actually won't have a bachelor's degree in computer science, but a double major degree with a focus in international relations and computer science. I decided to pursue this rather ""random"" degree because I wanted to approach IR in a technical manner. Aside from the background info, here are my numbers:

---

## GPA

Current major GPA (only CS courses): **3.1/4.0**  --&gt; I'm thinking about taking an extra semester to retake courses I got C+'s in. This will raise my major GPA to around **3.35/4.0**.

If I were to somehow give an excuse for my low major GPA, it would be that making a shift from a social science to a STEM field was rather challenging, which resulted in my transcript having mostly B's and B+'s.

## GRE

I took the GRE recently and got a **163/169/6.0** on the verbal/math/writing sections, respectively.

## TOEFL

I haven't taken this yet, but when I took it two to three years ago I got a **118/120**.

## Experience

I don't have any research experience, but have done an internship at a place called ""Bitcoin Center Korea"" for a couple of months and worked there for the next year (this isn't really related to the field of study I wish to pursue, but if I were to put any experience).

----

Is there a good chance for me to be admitted? My plan is to apply this year, and if I don't get in then I'll retake the aforementioned courses and apply again next year.

Any feedback is welcome. Thank you."

So I just completed a postgraduate degree in Quantitative Finance after having worked a couple of years in audit and sales in IT consultancy ( really not related to what the postgrad I just did, I know). I'm nearing the end of my internship for a bank where I'm developing a small application in Python and so I'm applying for jobs. In an ideal world I would like to become a quantitative analyst in financial markets (front office, something related to derivatives for instance) or a data scientist in finance, but given my modest quantitative background (MSc in Business Administration before first working experience and this past year as been really rough when it came to Stochastic Calculus and Mathematical Statistics) I am afraid this will not work, or at least this is my I tell myself.

I am really curious as to what you guys might have as an input. Is there a job from where I can gradually grow into a quant position? Or maybe are there interesting sales position in the financial markets where a training in quant finance can come in handy?

Apologies for the naive tone of my question, I am really open to read what people with more experience might have to say.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a CS major in my 4th year. My goal is to work as a software engineer. 

&amp;#x200B;

From what I heard from my peers, it's pretty common to have done 2 internships - one as a sophomore (2nd year), and one as a junior (3rd year).

However, I started late, and as a result have only done one internship focused mainly on full stack web dev with some software engineering aspects. I did learn a lot during that experience, but I still feel like I'm lacking too much knowledge to be able to work as a software engineer.

&amp;#x200B;

So this year, I'm thinking about trying to get a software engineering internship to hopefully gain more experience in the field. However, from it seems that most places aren't looking to hire interns that aren't heading back to school for at least another semester.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions? I would appreciate any advice! Thanks."
9apxb5,37,2018-08-27,The Black Volga,Baba_Jaga_II,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9apxb5/the_black_volga/,"“Russia is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a enigma.” Winston Churchill may have said that in 1939, but it was an accurate depiction of the Soviet Union through the 1960’s and the 1970’s. The unsolved death of my friend during those times was an enigma that had given rise to much speculation of the “Black Volga”.

“Poyekhali!” Anastasiya exclaimed as she waved. The date was April 13, 1961. Vostok 1 was launched the day before from Baikonur Cosmodrome, with Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin aboard, making him the first human to cross into outer space.

“Poyekhali!” I repeated as I made my way over to her. Gagarin’s first word at lift-off was “Poyekhali!” which translates to “Let’s Go”.

“Would you care to grab some breakfast?”

“Sure” I answered. Anastasiya and I were interns at Baikonur Cosmodrome which means we both lived at the Communal Apartments and... We both had a mile to walk before we reached the dining facility.

I took a glance behind us as we walked down the dirt road. Not many people drove in the Soviet Union, especially in Middle-of-No-Where Baikonur. With the exception of the Cosmodrome, it was an endless desert as far as the eye could see.

Suddenly, I heard the rumbling of an engine and a high-end limousine drove by.

Anastasiya whistled. “A black Volga. The first delegates must be arriving early. I wonder which guest that might be.” Over the next couple of days Baikonur Cosmodrome was expecting an entourage of special guest. Delegates from the Central Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars, delegates from the American’s National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and even Nikita Khrushchev was expected to arrive.

The hairs on my arms and the back of my neck bristled as an uncomfortable feeling tingled down my spine. I stared at the trail of dust for a brief second before glancing a look back. I was certain that I didn’t see that Volga approaching.

Anastasiya and I eventually made it to the dining facility. After breakfast, I promised that I’d walk her back to the apartments after our shifts.

“Poyekhali!” I heard as I walked down the steps from the administration building later that evening.

We talked as we started our trek back towards the apartments. Vostok 1 was celebrated as a great triumph of the Soviet science and technology which demonstrated superiority of the socialist system over capitalism. Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin became a celebrity overnight.

“Do you think that he’ll be presented the ‘Hero of the Soviet Union’ Medal?” I asked.

The Sunset changed to hues of orange, and then almost a red which cast a rusty haze over the desert. I peaked a glace at Anastasiya when she didn’t answer and noticed that she stopped walking. I followed her stare and saw the black Volga parked on side of the road just a few dozen yards ahead. It seemed to have manifest from nowhere.

Cautiously, we approached. The black Volga remained parked and we observed that it was a very high- end polished limousine with white curtains that covered the windows and matching white rims. We noticed that the driver side window was rolled down and Anastasiya and I both froze. The driver was an elderly pale nun. She wore a tunic covered by a scapular and cowl and a thin veil.

“H-Hello ..” I stuttered but the nun simply scowled.

Anastasiya and I spared a glance at each other before I managed a nod with a smile and began to walk. The Volga remained parked and I felt the nun’s eyes digging into me.

Hours had pass since the encounter with the nun, but I laid restless that night. I couldn’t shake a feeling of impending doom. I began to feel short of breath and a slight pain in my chest. With a hand over my chest, I felt my heart rapidly fluttering and I believed I was having a panic attack.

At that moment, I heard screams down the corridor. The screams echoed throughout the apartment and with a heart-wrenching clarity, I knew it was Anastasiya. I shoved my way pass the tenants that had begun to crowd the halls.

“Anastasiya!” I shouted as I pounded my fist on her door. “Anastasiya, are you okay?”

The screaming had stopped, and a silence filled the air as a few neighbors helped me pry the down open. The sight before me had haunted me my entire life. Anastasiya was on her back, sprawled across the bed, with her head hanging off the side. Her mouth was slightly open and her lifeless eyes starred back at me. Through the window I could see a Black Volga silently driving away leaving a trail of dust in the night’s sky."

So I posted here not too long ago about what jobs to aim for coming out of college. I was unsure if I had to start in helpdesk or if I had a shot at something more advanced (no knock on those who do it, I've done it before at an internship and you guys are the backbone of most companies IMO). 

I was able to secure a Systems Engineer position (a real one not just a title) and I'm so relieved. Unfortunately the salary isn't quite what I was hoping for given my goal of paying off my remaining student debt ($11k) and stashing the rest after taxes, insurances, food, etc. to get married and buy a house with my girlfriend (been together 5 years now). I've been promised a salary review after 6 months and then another one every year, and I have confidence in myself and the company that I will see a raise or two in the near future. I also think this position is going to teach me a ton and I will for sure reap the benefits of it upon my next career move whether that is at the same company or elsewhere.

For the time being, I really want to maximize the amount of money I can make while my girlfriend finishes her last grad semester at college an hour or so away. My goal over the next year was to save $20k and pay off my loan, but at my current salary that isn't going to be possible without working another job. It could be done but I'd be eating ramen every night and have 0 money to do anything else. I am currently lucky enough to be living rent/utilities free with the expectation I save and get out soon haha. 

So my question is what jobs have you guys worked part time to make a supplemental income that also had a good balance with your full-time work schedule? Just wondering if this can be done. Thank you. "

Edit: I realized that I just made a wall of text but don't know how I can summarize it. 

I'm gonna start to my last year on my bachelors dagree next semester and Im a bit overwhelmed by the career paths I can choose and improve myself.

I have this philosophy that if you choose a career path which your unique traits as person does work, you can improve yourself better and climb the ladder faster.

I have experience on my internships as a full stack developer and unity game design. However I realized that even if I enjoy creating algorithms for whether for backend or for a script on a game engine, I love to research on a topic or a field and predict the outcome in the long term.

For example when I started my first internship as a full stack developer (the company had a friend of mine), they told me that they are using Ruby on Rails on the backend. It was my first experience as a web dev and started to research about backend languages, frameworks and libraries. I realized that using Javascript on backend with node and vue. Js on the front end could be better in the long term for the communication between their front end and back end team since they agreed on me and switched their architecture slowly (they were a small startup so it was easier for them tho).

On my second internship I was going to develop a web application for a really small company. I had to use Linux, I could go straight with Ubuntu but because I love to learn and seek, I searched about Linux, what is it, what is a distribution how they diferanciate etc. I found a perfect distro for my laptop which wasn't using Optimus and prevented the stability problem my gpu could cause in the long term. I learned how Linux distros work, how their packet management systems work, what are the best desktop environments to use im terms of efficiently.

So I thought that a business analyst might be a good fit for me since I love to improve myself on different technology and research. Also I have somewhat good social skills which comes from unprofessional theater &amp; acting background.

Is business analysis a good career path for me because of these traits I have? If so how can I improve myself about it, by working on a masters degree about it maybe?

Or am I wrong about this? Are there any paths that I could work about these? I'm having a career crisis :("

&amp;#x200B;

So I am talking in terms of things like training, culture for furthering educations, etc.

​

This applies to CS grads, but can also apply for other academic realms, I guess.

​

Which companies excel, especially for new hires, in initial training for their technology, mentoring, in house schooling, lectures and speakers, keeping you overall competitive, having above average tuition re-reimbursement rates, asking for help isnt frowned upon, etc.

​

So rather than critiquing on pay and benefits or boredom or cut-throat enviroment, I would like to know what you guys feel are the spots for becoming better.

​

I am looking towards NYC atm, but also want to hear about companies nationally.RN, my impression is a company like MSK or Rockefeller fits the mold, especially with how they take care of their interns, and get them going on things.

​

Granted, I know self improvement is something only you can assure, and one shouldnt expect another company to baby sit you. And it doesn't matter the company, but the team you are assigned

​

But at the same time, I am not looking for company ping pong tables or nerf wars. I would definatley favor a company that does stuff for non profits, like walks or runs for cures, or in company fundraisers, though. or have volunteer initiatives.

​

edit: one day, maybe in ten years, i want to move out west to a state like utah or montana, and being as competitive as i can in smaller markets can also help

Hey, all. I have to start with what has been going on with me lately (sorry but will tak a while to get to the question). About 3 weeks ago, I started having major anxiety and feeling down. Don't know exactly what started it, but I recall stretching my back and neck right around that time and then feeling off. I also recall having a few sips of rum to taste it two days in a row (I haven't had any alcohol in at least a year). On the second day after tasting it, I started feeling strange.

There could also be other factors, but all I know for sure is I am having serious anxiety and panic symptoms. So, I decided to go to a community health center to see a doctor. They had me talk to a social worker before seeing the doc. I had filled out a form that indicated I was experiencing anxiety and depression.

I described some of the symptoms I was having to the social worker. We talked for about 10 to 15 minutes. Told her I have been having racing thoughts (including random thoughts, words, and parts of songs just replaying and repeating in my head). Obsessive thoughts. We also talked about my life (it is complicated, but it is a mess and she recognized this is the case).

​

She was screening me to see if I need to see a psychiatrist. After hearing me out, she decided I am just really scared and anxious, and don't need meds unless I want something for the anxiety. I even asked her if she thought I could be bipolar or schizophrenic. She said she didn't think so seeing as I am 42 with no family history of those illnesses, and no drug use (other than smoking marijuana a handful of times 15 years ago).

​

It felt good to hear this from her, but my anxiety has taken control of me. I started doubting that I could be seriously mentally ill. I am just here to get a better idea of how good social workers are at determining if someone is seriously mentally ill. I have been told they have to study and do internships for years before they can even work, and that they are very good at spotting serious disorders.

​

I just want to know if I should even be worrying about having bipolar, schizophrenia, or the like after what she said? Is it indeed true that as a social worker she would know? I have doubts about my sanity all the time."

&amp;#x200B;

Graduated with a BA degree in IT a few months ago. Didn't really apply for many full time positions because I honestly didn't really know exactly what I wanted to do after graduating. After having some time and considering a few different paths I've thought about my personal career goals and decided that I want to go into the realm of marketing. Currently back at home for the time being and considering a couple of options...

&amp;#x200B;

1..) I've been doing a lot of research into graduate schools that have one-year masters programs in marketing *(M.S., NOT MBA)* and have specific concentrations to choose from. A lot are here in the states within the price range of what I would be able to afford and some are even out of the country. Long-term I think I want to end up residing in Europe so really thinking about doing a grad program abroad and using that time to network/get good internships that with all of the stars aligned could potentially turn into a full time offer. Plus I really think I'd benefit with a lot of the learning opportunities these programs offer since I didn't really do anything marketing related in undergrad.

&amp;#x200B;

2..) Although I have not had any specific offers yet I obviously could just go right into the workforce and do my best to find a full time job at this point. Only thing with this is I wouldn't want to end up in a position that I don't like for a year plus (life is too short). I suppose another issue is not necessarily wanting to find a job in the field that my undergrad degree was in... However I do see advantages to getting ""full-time"" experience first.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all I'm leaning more towards just getting the grad degree since the programs I'm looking at are short, and it would give me time to find internships while I'm completing the program to gain even more work experience in the field that I want to go into. It would also give me some valuable insight as to what living abroad or in different cities that I would want to end up in is actually like without having to commit to a full-time job yet and being locked down in a 9-to-5. Hopefully it would also give me some networking opportunities that I can also use to end up where I want to be, especially if I end up doing grad school abroad and can use my time to network locally.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts on just going for the degree..? Are there any major downsides to doing a short-term MS program with minimal work experience, as opposed to just going straight into working full-time? Would it potentially hurt my employment prospects in the future, even if I am getting some work experience like short-term and summer internships along the journey to the masters...? As I said before family/financial situation is such that cost of the programs I'm looking at is not necessarily a huge issue, but I wouldn't want to go with the grad school route in the spring and then risk being seen as ""overqualified"" after I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. also looking at doing internships this fall in the meantime just to get some more experience under my belt.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks."

Graduated with a BA degree in IT a few months ago. Didn't really apply for many full time positions because I honestly didn't really know exactly what I wanted to do after graduating. After having some time and considering a few different paths I've thought about my personal career goals and decided that I want to go into the realm of marketing. Currently back at home for the time being and considering a couple of options...

​

1..) I've been doing a lot of research into graduate schools that have one-year masters programs in marketing *(M.S., NOT MBA)*and have specific concentrations to choose from. A lot are here in the states within the price range of what I would be able to afford and some are even out of the country. Long-term I think I want to end up residing in Europe so really thinking about doing a grad program abroad and using that time to network/get good internships that with all of the stars aligned could potentially turn into a full time offer. Plus I really think I'd benefit with a lot of the learning opportunities these programs offer since I didn't really do anything marketing related in undergrad.

​

2..) Although I have not had any specific offers yet I obviously could just go right into the workforce and do my best to find a full time job at this point. Only thing with this is I wouldn't want to end up in a position that I don't like for a year plus (life is too short). I suppose another issue is not necessarily wanting to find a job in the field that my undergrad degree was in... However I do see advantages to getting ""full-time"" experience first.

​

All in all I'm leaning more towards just getting the grad degree since the programs I'm looking at are short, and it would give me time to find internships while I'm completing the program to gain even more work experience in the field that I want to go into. It would also give me some valuable insight as to what living abroad or in different cities that I would want to end up in is actually like without having to commit to a full-time job yet and being locked down in a 9-to-5. Hopefully it would also give me some networking opportunities that I can also use to end up where I want to be, especially if I end up doing grad school abroad and can use my time to network locally.

​

Any thoughts on just going for the degree..? Are there any major downsides to doing a short-term MS program with minimal work experience, as opposed to just going straight into working full-time? Would it potentially hurt my employment prospects in the future, even if I am getting some work experience like short-term and summer internships along the journey to the masters...? As I said before family/financial situation is such that cost of the programs I'm looking at is not necessarily a huge issue, but I wouldn't want to go with the grad school route in the spring and then risk being seen as ""overqualified"" after I graduate.

​

P.S. also looking at doing internships this fall in the meantime just to get some more experience under my belt.

​

Thanks."

As my summer internship wraps up (i am a senior), I would like some pointers what what to do in my situation after graduation. I did some local internships in web dev, and my current one at an AI company. As my first role out of graduation, ideally I would like to work doing DS/AI , but I'm not sure its feasible given a lot of roles require a MS / experience. That said I'm also ok with doing backend / front end as I have had some experience with full stack engineering (node, web dev) in my previous internships. Should my best course of action be applying to general engineering positions in big companies in the hopes of transition to data science roles or to apply directly to data science roles? Right now I mostly practice leetcode, so im not sure if thats sufficient for interviews."

Took an internship this summer at a medium-sized company. I was told from the beginning that it could turn into a more permanent position if I prove myself. Well, I did that. I’ve worked full time during the summer, and I’ll be going part time next week with school starting.

During the few months I’ve been here, I have:

- completely rebuilt and managed our Windows imaging system. They used to have an imaging process, though it wasn’t really properly managed and therefore they got away from it. This was a big deal for me on day one and I couldn’t believe they were manually configuring so many machines. We now have reimage and config times down to 20-25 minutes in total, which has made everything so much easier

- created a proper inventory system and process. This company has been around for a while, but they always used spreadsheets and they never worked for a multitude of reasons. I am nearing completion of this project and again, it will and already is making things so much easier to manage

- along with my reimaging process, I’ve been pushing Windows 10 across the company very slowly. We have a lot of offsite and remote users, so it will take some time, but we’ve made good progress thanks to what I’ve done above. Once I complete my other project, I’m going to begin a much more aggressive push

- normal help desk duties. This is definitely not the majority of my job right now, and probably won’t be since they do make an effort to avoid having people only work help desk

I enjoy what I’m doing, especially since I work with some great people and I am kept occupied all day with my projects.

Now the real question: what am I worth? I currently make $10/hr, which is the standard intern rate. I become an actual employee at the end of the month.

I think I have provided a lot of value to the company in the short amount of time I’ve been here. It’s also giving me a very large head start on other people my age, and will hopefully allow me to avoid being strictly help desk right out of school.

9au1en,12,2018-08-27,How can I quit my job that I just got and have barely started???,gblevand,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9au1en/how_can_i_quit_my_job_that_i_just_got_and_have/,"Hi there! I am currently in a really confusing situation which I am totally unsure how to handle and I'm hoping I can get some guidance on how to handle my current issues. Thank you in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

So some background: I've worked in retail for over 3 years now. I moved across the country for an internship and decided to stay where I am, so I applied for a few things to see if I could find a job and stay where I was. I got a call back from a company that I wasn't super jazzed about but decided to take the interview anyways, meeting with the assistant manager. I got a second interview right away, met with the manager and we discussed my pay (which is really good). He told me training was coming up soon, talked about getting me in for that, and had me sign some stuff for a background check, but was kind of unclear about the next step. Fast forward a week, I get an email from the company saying I was hired, contingent on passing the background check, which the manager had essentially already told me, so this wasn't new information. They also said in the email that I was hired at a rate of $1.00/hr, which was clearly a typo as we had already discussed my pay rate and I wasn't going to be working on commission or anything like that. I sent the manager an email the next day, checking in on the status of the background check. Never heard back. 

Another week after that, I get a call from the company reminding me to be in class the next day for training. I called back immediately, telling the woman that I didn't know I had officially been hired, and no one had told me that I was starting training already. She wasn't very apologetic, and said that when they do a background check, it means you're hired. For other reasons, I couldn't make it, so I started training the next week, a week behind the rest of the class. I came in early to catch up and the woman was going over things with me and talking about, ""Oh, when you come in tomorrow"" and all this stuff and I said, ""Oh sorry am I coming in tomorrow too?"" And she was like, ""Oh yeah, here's the training schedule"". So just all around very poor communication. 

Immediately starting training, I knew this was not going to be a good fit. When I actually got to the sales floor, the other women didn't help me at all, continually left me alone when there were customers ready to check out, and I had never even touched a register, had no idea what I was doing. Basically I keep getting left to fend for myself and I never have any idea what I'm doing, and the one or two other women who work in my section are usually too busy to help train me. My manager keeps overwhelming me with information and pressure about sales goals and bringing in my client from my last job (we house some of the same brands) and opening store credit cards. I am completely miserable, and I haven't even officially started working yet. This week will be my first week. I did know ahead of time about sales goals and opening store cards so I knew what  I was getting myself into with that, but the other complaints I feel more justified in.

I just accepted another position at a company that I REALLY want to work for, and the orientation starts in two weeks. So my question is, how do I quit my current job?? I don't want to burn any bridges, but I'm so miserable there. The position is technically full-time, but they start you at part time for a couple weeks and then move you to full-time, so I'm not even full-time yet, and I'm not sure if I'm supposed to give two-weeks notice. Any advice is welcome! I would also like to know if my complaints are reasonable or not so any input is welcome as well. I'm really nervous about quitting, as I've never quit a job like this before."

In what cases would that NOT be true? When is a master's in CS useful for this group of experienced programmers?

I counter-argued that there are some companies and institutions that are far more difficult to get into without a related STEM degree and internship. Take NASA, for example. Majority of NASA-related topics in computer science are about getting internships, and if you never took one, you don't have a referral, and you'll have a ghost of chance getting hired full-time."

  Currently, I'm a college sophomore and for some reason interacting with other people just makes me feel very uncomfortable. Whenever I even begin talk to someone (even family and friends),  I just immediately want to escape the conversation. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the other person, but I just don't want to talk. I'm not sure if anyone has ever felt this way before, so I wanted to ask. Even at networking events, I have a urge to just get out and not talk to anyone so I can be on my own. During icebreakers, as edgy as this may sound, nobody else's answers are remotely similar to mine and so I have no clue what to talk about during them.

Also, I wasn't always this way. Back in high school I really liked talking to people especially at work and at social events. Pretty much everyone in the school knew who I was since I even went to a bunch of clubs and even got elected to student government.

Overall, I'm really insecure about this because I go to a business school where networking and interviews are really important to land an internship or job. How about you guys? Anyone else going through or even gone through this kind of thing?"

I'm currently doing an internship in silicon valley. I like the area and the job oppurtunities a lot. After finishing my Masters Degree, I'd like to work here for at least a few years.

However, I don't think I'd want to stay long term. I'd like to buy a house and raise a family and that seems to be harder and harder every year due to rising costs. These rising costs contribute to the very large salaries in the bay area.

When I eventually make the transition from Silicon Valley to somewhere else, how would I determine what a reasonable salary would be? I assume that if I make like $115k starting, work 2 years, and then move to say Austin, it would be unreasonable to ask for a salary above $115k. 

How do you determine your salary expectations when moving away from Silicon Valley?"

So, I'm not really sure where to start. There are multiple reasons I want out of the USA, and I'm open to moving anywhere with Europe or Australia/NZ. 

I'm currently a junior at West Virginia University, and when I graduate I'll have a bachelor's in Political Science (area of emphasis in International Politics) and also a Bachelor's in Religious Studies (I'll also have completed a minor in philosophy, though I'm not sure that matters too much). Currently sitting at about a 3.40 GPA with multiple internship experiences, though I'm pretty sure none of those would be relevant abroad. 

Realistically, I'm considering two options, and a 3rd option as a last resort:

- Pursue another degree in another country so that I can get a visa, *especially* if that country offers free tuition for internationals/scholarship/Government assistance, etc.

- Graduate and try to attend school abroad for my masters.

- Or last resort. Attempt to get a job in the US for awhile and then use my experience/saved funds to try and move abroad. This is a last resort because in reality, I want the move to come sooner rather than later.

*

The challenges:

- I have minimal foreign language experience. I've taken 4 semesters of German in college, but retained very little. Foreign Language is one of my weakest points. Of course, I'm always willing to try to learn.

- My bank account is virtually empty. I receive no support from family, and I have very little money. This makes me concerned that while I would have enough to actually complete the move abroad, I wouldn't be able to afford housing, food, etc. (which is why I'm really looking for countries that do free schooling even for internationals).

In realization, I'm probably just way too optimistic that such a wonderland even exists - I feel like because I have very little money, I'll never be able to transition abroad.

I'm hoping that I'm lucky and maybe someone will help me find a place like this that exists.

Ever since I received the first rejection letter, to be exact lmfao. I got rejected from every college I applied to even though I worked my ass off in High School. Nothing made sense for me when I read those letters and it still doesn't. I enrolled in a local school to try and move on with my life but I ended up dropping out after my depression grew worse and I had a full blown anxiety attack. I've had therapy, meds and whatnot to try and pull myself together. I don't really see this year as a year I lost, well not all days at least. I'm trying to get better mentally, emotionally and I'm trying to grow as a person. I certainly did not plan to take a gap year, let alone under these circumstances, but the whole entire time I've spent crying has made me realize that I worry way too much. Yes, I worked hard and it didn't pan out. No, I have no idea of what I'm going to do now. Before this whole thing happened, I was sure I'd make it to a top school and be a great professional in my field. Now? I'm just trying to get by every day and distract myself with different activities (gym, dance lessons, reading, yoga, internships, writing) so I can go back to being healthy. I spent my senior year barely sleeping (3 hours a night), scoring the highest grades, spending every second studying and focusing every free hour I had with EC's. I think part of me being so upset...is that I felt entitled to a spot. I thought I was deserving of it because hard work was supposed to pay off. Well, it didn't. I was too blinded to see that there are thousands like me out there and sometimes, it's not about what I want or need, but what cards life gives me. I'm sure one day I'll look back at this time and laugh and think, wow I was a fool for crying so much and being upset. But now, all I want to do is just relax. Maybe I'll reapply this year, maybe I'll just go to CC, maybe I'll pursue my hobbies and something will pan out, maybe I'll enroll at some local school next year, maybe. Last year, my ""maybe"" thoughts were about where I would end up studying this year, how this last week of august would be like in college, how much I'd miss my friends and family. Now my ""maybe"" thoughts are more broad, I try to stay hopeful and open.  Even though I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone, I don't regret a thing. I'd rather deal with the aftermath of ""We are sorry to inform you"" (these past few months have opened my eyes) than deal with the ""what if I had applied"" keeping me up at night had I not done so.  I wish everyone good luck on whatever it is that you're doing, starting college, tech school, pursuing other paths, applying to college."

I'll be taking the Subject Tests in November the scores for which don't arrive in time for Williams's ED deadline - but do for Swat's. Although, Williams College has made Subject Tests optional - how optional are they, really? Will not taking the subject tests harm my application, especially being Asian? 

So I am in a major dilemma - should I ED Williams which is a) more competitive b) without subject tests or should I ED Swarthmore which is *relatively* less competitive and will consider Nov Subject Test scores?

i'm a recent grad and even long before i graduated i applied to their internships a bunch. automated rejection every time.

close to and after graduating, i applied to a million of their postings—internships and full time jobs, too. in all different cities. the internships even take recent grads, but i was rejected for every single one. in addition, the full time jobs i was applying to were associate/assistant account positions—rejected for every single one every time regardless of city and even though i met and often exceeded the requirements.

i went to a top school, did well, had two solid internships previously, and ...i mean i get not being assured an interview for all of them, but for the volume of applications i sent and how basic/entry-level the positions were, it seems absurd that i wouldn't get an interview for at least ONE. this is so stupid.

also given the companies that have offered me interviews, and often for positions that have less basic requirements, it seems even more ridiculous that i just cannot get through to this company at all. i mean, i'm over it, but i just got another rejection email for a position i applied to there like two months ago (a *summer intern* position nonetheless...ha) and i'm like...okay.

* is it because i sent so many apps—does that look bad to companies? i mean, at one point, i hadn't sent that many and still got rejected for the few i sent, when i first started.
* is it really the stupid taleo thing that prevents me from passing the portal despite how good my resume is?  i feel like this is likely because of how huge the company is. (i know about the keyword white font trick but haven't done it yet...i just hate that i'd have to do that)

in the latter case, does it just mean that i'll never actually be in contention for a job there? i've given up on it for now, but that just really amuses me.

and **i'm definitely aware of the fact that despite my meeting the requirements they still might not want me**. but like i said, given my background it just seems kind of unlikely. and given the number of rejections i've gotten, it seems more and more likely that a machine is just automatically rejecting me every time and that a human doesn't even see my apps.

any insight?

I am currently a Cyber-Security intern for the IT department of a small, city government with approximately 180 total computers under our jurisdiction. My supervisor has tasked me to come up with some possible solutions for our current state of affairs when it comes to managing updates across the network. Currently there is little standardization when it comes to hardware and operating system. The network has been built gradually with little thought given to expansion and managing. As, such many machines are outdated with a mix of Windows 7 and Windows 10 machines, and a dash of Mac and linux machines thrown in, this is because the city does not wish to spend the money to have a windows enterprise license. Each machine has only the operating system that it was purchased with. The servers also vary widely, we have one of each, Windows Server 2016, Server 2012, and Server 2000. Most city departments have their own VLAN. On to the point.
Currently NONE of the updates for any of the user devices or servers is being managed centrally. All devices are set to automatically update. Standard operating procedure is to leave computers powered on with one reboot per month to allow for installing updates. I feel that this system is inadequate as this makes updates haphazard and subject to the memory or whims of the users. If a large install is required after a reboot during the middle of the work day productivity is also drastically reduced. What I would like to do is provide a solution that allows for weekly update checks and installs across all devices, on the weekends when no-one is around. My supervisor has used Windows update server before and is not keen to repeat that experience. I have a few ideas but am not really sure what direction to take. Do any of you have advice to give on this matter. As a side note, I would prefer to confine updates to a server to then propagate across the network instead of creating a certain time when all the endpoint devices pull down updates, creating a spike in network traffic. Thank you in advance for your advice, and putting up with this long rambling post."

I work in smaller companies a lot, and I find people tend to generalize in skill sets (within their department) and work on smaller projects obviously.

I'm not worried about the whiteboard part of the interviews as much, because, being rigid as they are, there are already systems in place that explain how to follow through with its relative predictability of technical problems.

But company culture and understanding of how things operate at big companies are a different best altogether. I lack the frame of reference for setting proper interview expectations at large companies. And I need it in order to do better at the soft skills/getting-to-know-you part of the hiring process. 

So how do I make myself relatable to them? How do get the frame of reference that I need to understand what they're looking for?"

What do I do?,Spanish_peanuts,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9b4cd4/im_a_27_year_old_guy_having_a_problem_with_a_girl/,"This is gonna be a bit of a long post, so bare with me through this wall of text. I just wanted to make the history a little clear and what not.

I'll start with a little background. The woman in question is 23 years old, and an engineer in my workplace. She was an intern when I met her. I'm just a lowly forklift driver, but when we met we really hit it off. It soon came that we were either talking face to face, texting, or phone calls from morning till night every day. This went on for several months. We both made our feelings for each other clear, and everything was going great until I pushed a little too hard for more out of our relationship (i.e. let's be boyfriend/girlfriend). All of her feelings for me disappeared, but we had also became like best friends and we couldn't imagine never talking again so we attempted the ""just friends"" thing but that went horribly.

 I was still hurting because I was head over heels for this girl but when we hung out the one time after she called it off, she spent the entire day texting another man. It was extremely painful for me so I didn't hang out with her again. Some other stuff in my life went down hill hard and the depression caused by all these things together caused me to have a mental breakdown, in which my bestfriends wife took advantage of me when I came to the 2 of them, crying and looking for advice. After this I began seeing a therapist, who sent me to a doctor, who prescribed medication for depression and anxiety. I continued seeing the therapist every week for several months. I also switched to a different shift at work to get away from the stress she brings upon me. And that brings us to today.


I came back to the day shift last week after 7 months on afternoons because I missed my friends I used to work with who genuinely care about me. I have not spoken a word to this girl in 4 months now when I decided enough was enough, but in the past week I have seen her quite a few times. When I see her, my heart starts pounding, I start sweating, and I have the urge to run away. This girl hurt me so badly, I am honestly just terrified of her.

Today towards the end of the shift, a super nice 61 year old lady who knows nothing about the 2 of us asked me ""That girl over there, what's her job?"" I told her ""Shes an engineer."" And then I pointed to one of the engineering technicians we work with and said ""She is his boss."" She kind of laughed and said ""No wonder he's so grumpy, he works for a girl less than half his age"" but she meant it as a joke, nothing against the girl. I replied by saying ""Well she earned it, she worked hard and went to college. She was an intern here for 2 years. If he wanted that job he should've done the same."" 

I then find out that the girl has been saying bad things about me to my coworker's. Not her coworkers, but mine. The ones that I work alongside all day every day. I didn't want to know what things exactly because it hurt enough already. I know many of her secrets that could make her life a bit hellish, but I would never hurt her or her reputation like that. I still care deeply for her. It really hurt that when someone asked me about her, I had nothing but nice things too say, but shes saying bad things about me behind my back. I know I'm not perfect and when she broke things off I didn't take it as well as I should've, but I've always blamed myself and never blamed her and never spread things about her to anyone else.

This doesn't sound like her. The girl I fell for wasn't a jerk, and I knew her better than anyone (not being weird or creepy, but we spoke every minute of every day and we know literally everything about each other.) It leads me to believe maybe something is going on with her to make her act this way. I'll admit my initial impulse was a typical testosterone fueled, angry one. I wanted to confront her and ask ""What the fuck?"" In a less polite way. But I kept my cool and continued talking to that older lady whom made me feel a lot better. Sidenote, I dont usually lose my temper, I usually stay calm. But the impulses are there ofcourse. I have never yelled at this girl before incase any of you are wondering.

 (Shout out to the older lady for not judging me based off what the girl said about me and instead asking me about her and finding out if I'm as bad as the girl says. I thanked her and she told me ""Theres always 2 sides to a story and you never seemed like a bad guy. You were quick to defend her and that's honorable."")

My question for all of you is, what should I do? 

I've made an appointment with my therapist for tomorrow after work, but my mind is racing and I doubt I'll be able to sleep a wink tonight.

Should I calmly ask her why shes saying bad things about me? Should I ask her if shes doing okay, because this isnt like her?

As a reference, if I did decide to talk to her tomorrow morning it would go something like this:
""Hey, do you have a minute to talk?
Is everything okay with you? I heard you were saying some not-so-good things about me and that doesn't sound like something you would normally do.
I'm not mad, just hurt. I would never do that to you. But luckily I'm not in a position where a bad reputation can affect my work status and the people that care about me won't believe you anyways. So I'll forgive you if you promise to stop.
I've gone through months of therapy and I just came back to day shift, please dont make my time here unpleasant.""

Something like that. Ofcourse, if she does end up saying something IS in fact wrong, I will address it because well... I still care for her and I want to help her if possible.


Any advice would be helpful. This girl just has a knack for smacking my heart around, but she made me truly happy for the first time since my mother passed in 2010. That was a great feeling and I'll always be grateful for her giving me that gift, even if it didn't last as  long as I would've hoped. I dont wanna handle this the wrong way and end up hurting her or her reputation, but I also can't allow her to talk about me in a negative way too my coworkers or else I'll end up losing my temper when one of the guys inevitably goes too far. My stress tolerance is still on the weaker side."

9b4iur,2,2018-08-28,Effective Strategies For Job Hunting My Last Semester,lbz25,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9b4iur/effective_strategies_for_job_hunting_my_last/," 

Hi Everyone,

​

I am a senior in college who is graduating this December. I'm in a very good position where I have internship experience in both Finance and Sales. I've ultimately decided I want to work in sales and thus I am on the job hunt. I go to school in North Carolina but am looking for work in New York or Miami (both close to friends and family). This past week I have reached out to tons of of people on Linkedin and have applied to lots of job postings and have gotten tons of great results with lots of people interested. However a common response is that they want to delay the interview process until closer to my graduation.

&amp;#x200B;

If you all have feedback, please give me some ideas for the following questions...

​

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think I should keep reaching out to people and applying places or should I wait a couple months? In my mind, it never hurts to network and apply as long as I clearly state that I am graduating in December.

​

​I have the opportunity to take a couple trips to New York and Miami this October. If I were to schedule in person meetings with the people I've been connecting with, would that give me a leg up when its actually time to interview? My parents gave me 1000 dollars for miscellaneous expenses this semester so I want to make sure its a worthy investment.

​

​In your experience do a lot of companies hire in December until New Years? If I don't get something by then I feel as if I'd have to wait until after new years to start applying again after New Years.

​

Do any of you have any connections / good ideas for a role in tech, medical, or financial sales in New York or the Miami area? I'm looking to get into a software company, fintech company, or any healthcare related industry?

​

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've been getting a lot of interest, but I know that this is a numbers game so I want to be the most efficient I can possibly be!

IT is not super huge in my area, and I am panicking and scrambling to find work come the turn of the year. I feel quite helpless right now, as it is extremely disheartening seeing $15/hr help desk openings requiring 5 years of experience. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I’ve currently found myself in a bit of a dilemma...

I’d consider myself to be pretty capable, as I believe that I have a good level of knowledge, especially for working something like a help desk job or internship.

The downside is that nobody that I’ve reached out to will even look at me once they see I’m under 18. 

I’m planning on getting some certificates in September as hopefully that may make my situation a little more provable.

I’m writing this because while it seems to me like there isn’t much I can do except for wait or volunteer, I would love to spend my days working in-field (even if it’s grunt work for a while) rather than at a minimum wage job and doing it on the side. I may just not be thinking far enough outside the box.

All their friend's kids went to the UCs, Cal Poly, and a bunch of other expensive out-of-state universities.

&amp;#x200B;

All throughout my childhood, my parents ingrained this stigma in my sister and I that community colleges (and for some time, even San Jose State lol) are solely for students who don't study well. (I asked my sister if she would rather go to UC Merced or DeAnza community college for 2 years and transfer - she said UC Merced). 

&amp;#x200B;

I keep reading from a bunch of people on /r/college and /r/applyingtocollege and related subreddits and websites about how community college is this great place to save money and get gen-eds out of the way. But to be honest, I am unable to come to terms with what those posts say because of my upbringing. It's not like my family is poor.

&amp;#x200B;

I was very lucky to get admitted to a respectable four year university (I faced a TON of rejections in the application cycle) and for it to have lots of internship opportunities and chances for me to grow as a person.

&amp;#x200B;

If I hadn't gotten in, I would have possibly chosen community college. But due to the way community college was portrayed throughout my childhood, I probably would have been depressed and regret some of the choices I made in high school that resulted in me resorting to community college. My parents would have also been sad or dissapointed that community college was my final decision.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else with similar parents?

&amp;#x200B;

I still fail to realize how community college is actually a great place. I probably never will. "
9b5unc,1,2018-08-28,Top tier CS internship while an Electrical Engineering major?,BarakW,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9b5unc/top_tier_cs_internship_while_an_electrical/,"Sup y'all,

​

I'm an Electrical Engineering major with a CS minor from a large mid-tier state school, and want to get a software engineering internship at a mid-size startup or bigger in: SV, Seattle, or New York. I only have one summer left before I graduate, so I think this would be an important step towards getting a full time offer in one of these cities before I graduate.

Now, I know this is what everyone is looking for. However, I firmly believe that I'm skilled enough to thrive at such an internship. I have a &gt;3.9 GPA, have taken classes in fundamental classes such as object oriented programming, data structures, computer organization, and low level programming (I will also complete algorithm design and operating systems this year). I also just completed an SWE internship at a local startup, and did well enough that they're taking me on as a part time remote contractor this semester (with a raise!).

I do well in practice technical interviews, but am worried that recruiters are throwing out my resume as soon as they see that I haven't majored in CS.

​

Is there anything that I can do to stand out just enough to get past the resume screening part?"

I currently have no scholarships but I could possibly get some scholarships or internships in the future, so this is just the upper limit of the college debt I'm going to have to pay. At 30k a year, I am looking at 120k total college debt. I was wondering how long this would take to pay off with a Master's in Computer Science which has an average starting salary of 80-85k. I do plan to get a master's degree in 4 years as my college has special options to accelerate your education, but I may have to do summer classes as a result which could easily add up my debt to around 150k- but I would be graduating a year earlier so I would say it's worth it still. So how many years would it take to pay off this debt and still live comfortably. I have no money saved, no financial aid, a $1,000 scholarship, and no monetary help from my parents. (They said they'll give me $100 for each A I get, and pay for my books)
Oh yeah how much extra money will the loans cost to pay off at a standard interest rate as well. 

EDIT: I have decided that I am just going to cancel all of my housing for the next 4 years and just sleep in my car. This will save me $40,000 overall. I also am not going to use a meal plan and survive on homemade jerky and stuff, which my parents will have to pay for so this saves me on food. My expected debt is now about $76,000 which is definetly a lot better but still high."

I felt like they were both really unhappy, my manager asked me if I actually understood the scope of the project after like a 10 second silence and I sheepishly replied no. The 3 person meeting was literally silence for 1/3rd the 15 minutes I was in there.

I also feel like I'm underperforming, its just the work given to me is quite ambiguous and none of the other interns do the same stuff on any given week so it's hard to gauge on our own performances based off that. 

I'm also being paid quite well, around $US28 per hour, working 3 days a week from 9-5.

Looking for some perspective, I'm an electrical engineering / computer science undergrad with two years down, currently working an internship with the electrical design team at a power engineering firm. I have a previous internship at a semi-state aviation company (working on the telecommunication systems used between the pilots and air traffic controllers). I also spent a month in a financial clearing firm working with derivatives in London (this was when I realised that I liked business and finance far more than engineering) and I worked as a door to door salesman selling electricity contracts for two months I had off. My results are decent, I hope to finish up with either first or second class honours. I'm studying for the CFA while working my internship full time. I hope to have CFA level 1 in my back pocket in December, then forgetting about it while I finish my final year and a half of my undergrad. I'm going to apply for internships at energy trading firms for this coming summer. Then I plan to do a masters in finance at either a top school here in Europe or an Ivy League in the US, hopefully being able to sit the CFA level 2 while studying.

I want to work in commodities trading at a bulge bracket, specifically in energy. Do you think this is a good plan?

5) Microprocessors and Microcontrollers

6) Formal language and Automata Theory

**Background**

I am an engineering co-op student in Ontario scheduled to graduate in April 2020 (3 more school terms and 2 coop terms, which alternate every 4 months). My major goals are: 1) graduate debt-free 2) maximize the surplus cash I have on top of what I would need to pay off OSAP. 

I am not very interested in long-term saving (ie. retirement, house, etc.) just yet, mostly due to future uncertainty, which is why I would only like advice on how to maximize returns for the 2-year time frame that I'm describing.

**Current Situation**

OSAP loan: -$24k  
Expected savings at the end of the upcoming fall school term: +$17k (in a Simplii Checking account)  
USD funds: +$3k (I have this sitting in a Bank of America checking account from my previous internship, I left it there because I'm not entirely sure if I'll be returning to the US for my next coops and it would be useful for deposits and other stuff if I happen to return)

**Plan**

\- I'm expecting that each consecutive coop term will pay for itself (the 4 months while I'm on coop), as well as the following school term, with no additional savings - I think this is more of a worst case scenario since I usually end up with a little bit of savings

\- Out of that $17k in my Simplii Checking account, I plan on putting $5k in an Alterna TFSA HISA @ 2.1% as my emergency fund (to cover 4 months of basic living expenses). From the remaining $12k savings, I am thinking about putting 50% in the same Alterna TFSA for some more steady reliable growth, and then investing the last 50%

\- Based on the above points, my only additional source of income for my savings will be the additional OSAP that I get from my 2 remaining school terms. Since I received a $4k loan and $2k grant for this upcoming fall term (despite having worked for 8 months last year and making some good money), I think it's safe to assume I'm going to get another $6k from OSAP for each school term. This would put my total savings at $24k ($12k current + 2 school terms \* $6k OSAP).

\- I'm projecting a final total OSAP loan of $32k at graduation ($24k current loan + 2 remaining school terms \* $4k loan each).

**Projected Financials at Graduation**

Total OSAP Loan: -$32k

Total savings (splits 50/50 in Alterna TFSA and investments): +$24k

Emergency fund: +$5k

USD funds: +$3k

**Conclusion**

I'm basically just breaking even right now if you take into account all of my available funds and my total OSAP loan. Obviously, that doesn't factor in my Alterna savings interest income (which I imagine won't be too significant), the USD transfer rate (also insignificant), and any profit made on investments (assuming I make profit and no loss since I haven't actually started investing yet). 

I am looking for ways to turn that break-even into a significant surplus! If there's anything that I'm missing here, or something that I may be overlooking, please let me know. I'm also not sure whether the 50/50 split is a good idea, and whether I should put more into investments? I'm okay with the risk of losing some money and potentially graduating with debt, if it means potentially graduating with a nice surplus. I also don't really know anything about investing just yet, so any strategy advice there would be great too.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL/DR:**

||Current Situation (Dec 2018)|Projected Situation @ Grad (Apr 2020)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**OSAP Loan**|\-$24k|\-$32k|
|**Emergency Fund in TFSA @2.1%**|$5k|$5k|
|**Savings in TFSA @2.1%**|$6k|$12k|
|**Investments**|$6k|$12k|
|**USD Funds:**|$3k|$3k|

\- My projected situation @ grad in above table is just breaking-even, I would like advice on how to turn this into a surplus. Specifically, whether splitting my savings 50/50 between a TFSA and investments is a good idea, any investment advice, or if there's something obvious that I'm overlooking in my strategy.

I'm currently not in school but hope to enter into a two year college (Milwaukee Area Technical College) in January and once I'm done with my two years go to a four year college (most likely UW-Madison) and get my Bachelors in Computer Science there. I was wondering what classes I should take for the first two years if I want to transfer over to get my Bachelors. Should I get my Associate's while I'm at it MATC. What type of Associate's degree should I get if I want to go for a Computer Science degree. Also, what is your guys experience with getting jobs and what tips would you guys give me. Like what types of internships should I get and what kind of experience should I get. Another thing, its not 100% that I'll pursue this but currently it's my number one option. If you guys have any other options in the tech world I could possibly explore before I make a final decision that would be great. Thanks."

However, I also remember last year, when I applied to Twitter University, I solved their 3-problem coding challenge in an hour (given a week to complete the challenge), and I still got rejected. That made me believe that my resume was the thing that couldn't make the cut, despite getting the coding test and doing extremely well on it, and ultimately, I was a little annoyed that they led me to believe I was getting somewhere when I was gonna get rejected no matter what.

Similar thing happened with the Blizzard entertainment internship last year. I applied, they gave me a coding test, I solved 9/10 problems, and got rejected. Maybe they were looking for people that could solve all 10/10, so I don't know for sure about that one. To their credit, they said that they received a lot of applicants, so maybe they only wanted the best of the best.

So this leads me to ask if companies often to this, like Amazon or Google. I really hope I'm not being led on for nothing."

Would like some advice and perspective.,cracklescousin1234,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/9bft3v/my_job_is_cushy_but_im_feeling_lost_and/,"I'm coming up on my three-year anniversary at my current job, my first out of college. It's a decent job, with reasonably good pay and a reasonable work-life balance. The work is not particularly difficult, and the environment is pretty low-stress. Overall, it's a stable, comfortable career.

And yet I don't want to keep doing this forever. Honestly, this job doesn't capture my passion and desire, and it's not especially challenging or stimulating. I'd rather be doing something more cutting-edge and research-ish. I feel like I cheated myself out of a childhood dream, and I'm feeling frustrated and stuck.

And I guess there's where I'm at a loss. I'm not quite sure what my options are.

I earned my non-thesis Master's degree in electrical engineering prior to my job. I never really got into undergraduate- or graduate-level research because I didn't really know what opportunities to look for, or what interested me. And so even if I wanted to apply to Ph.D programs (not that I necessarily do at the moment), I wouldn't have the history of research experience or publications to be a strong candidate.

What other options are there? I know that national labs have open positions for Bachelor's- and Master's-level applicants. But I was told that if I did that, I would be seen as a lowly support staffer who would only ever do grunt work, and so such a career switch would lead to a dead end. I'm skeptical of that, but I don't know enough to make a good judgement call.

On a similar note, do university labs have openings like that for outside applicants?

Research internships are really only meant for university students, right? Is there nothing like that for someone a few years into his post-collegiate career?

And what else can I do on my own? I can certainly work on personal projects, writing software and implementing circuits on development kits and doing VLSI layouts and the like. I can also read my old textbooks to re-learn material from college that I forgot. Besides that, what can I do to be more current, and stay abreast of industrial and research developments? Are there any recommended sources for research publications?

And finally, besides just doing new stuff and tinkering, and reading everything I can read, is there anything else I can do to figure out what else I might want to do with my life?

Any help, suggestions, and general advice would be greatly appreciated. Or, maybe I'm just being an idiot and I should be told not to complain about the good things in my life."

I'm an Undergrad Sophomore and I'm applying for an Internship in Washington DC through my Universities PoliSci Department.  One thing that is stated that I ""must have a minimum of a 3.00 and not have been on Academic Probation within the last year. [We will consider requests to make exceptions to any of these criteria if you include a note below]""

So I mean I guess there's hope

My accumulative GPA now is 2.314 (last semesters GPA was 3.229),  and I was on Academic probation last year from my very first semester because of recovery from something truly fucked up that happened in high school.


I was a straight A student all throughout middle school and the first half of high school I was on track to graduate a semester early, so I doubled up on my 3rd year to graduate a whole year early, during that time, I had 6 out of my 7 were AP or ACP, so keeping that stress in mind, I'll now tell you what happened

for context, it should be noted that I am a MtF transsexual

I had this best friend in high school, been best friends since 6th grade, and I always had a crush on him but he was very macho straight, and I couldn't be with him because (at the time) I was a guy, and he was straight.  Skipping over a bit, including a year's worth of HRT (hormone replacement therapy), we eventually have a sexual encounter, and then naturally (because of how small my school is [graduating class of ~120]) word gets out and then everyone knows.  He finds it necessary to tell people that he didn't want it to happen (even though he initiated it) and that I forced myself onto him.  The only reason I could imagine him doing this is that he doesn't want to be seen as gay in any sort of way (small midwestern town).  Just having my best friend switch from being the closest person I knew to saying that I raped him was just...a lot.

Later in that year, another guy wanted to experiment with me to see if he liked it or not, but then backed out halfway through, and he knew people would find out too, so he used the established rumor of me being a rapist and the fact that an encounter happened as evidence that I raped him too, and even pressed charges that were later dropped.  Which, in the climate and mind of all of my other friends, solidified my status as a rapist.  

I was kicked from my lunch table, got into prescription drug abuse, attempted suicide, and was hospitalized for a week. 
And no one from my high school has even talked to me since that happened.  This all also really negatively affected my grades during that year.  Just having to go through all that, from having all of the people that were closest to me not only abandon me, but defame me as a rapist and then viciously rip away any sort of support system to having to give a legal testimony was just one of the most stressful things a 17 year old person could go through, I was walking around school so depressed that one of my closest teachers stopped me in the hallway and just cried because she didn't want to attempt anything stupid (sorry Mrs. H)

Anyways

My stress of having betrayal followed by abandonment bled into my freshman year of college.  I even had guilt about letting those things happen, because if those encounters didn't happen, there wouldn't be any accusations.  I had to start from the ground up building up my support network (which is doing pretty great rn, btw) and had to figure out and cope with the guilt and abandonment issues I got from that within the first semester.  

My first semester was a complete and utter shit show.  I was still learning how to trust people again, let alone just getting out of bed each day.  I know it seems like I'm a pity party rn, but I don't mean this to be.

I got my life in order starting at the beginning of my Freshman spring semester and passed all my classes with at least B's in all my classes, and A's in two of them, and I'm hitting the ground running this semester hopefully getting all A's
I've been clean from prescription abuse since Christmas

I just don't know how I should word it, professionally in an application without being too graphic or long or anything, or even too blunt

like how do i say 'my best friend said i raped him and then another guy said i did so then everyone thought i was a rapist and it ruined my life' professionally??

like i could push the ""vicitim of transphobia"" diversity factor really hard to try to get in, but tbh I feel like I'd be guilty about taking away someone's spot that could potentially be more qualified

any advice?

I don't think I can currently get in, because it has been 3 years since I was in college with a BA in computer science. I have no research experience. My GPA was approximately a 3.7. I had no plans to go into grad school at the time, so I did things like working part time for a CS company during the year, internships, and did no research. Truthfully I was only trying to get my professional career started, so my grades were not as important to me as my contribution to personal projects and open source projects. I also crammed my college program down into 3 years (+1 year internships), just to graduate as soon as possible.

However, I plan to go to grad school so I asked to interview for an internship instead. She told me that the internship hiring process starts later, so to connect again the following month.

A month goes by and I email her. No response. I wait a week and follow up again, and still no response. Is there any recourse I can take to get a response from them? The recruiter was replying promptly before, but now I’m being ignored. Would it be appropriate to reach out to another recruiter and ask about my status?"

And What should I look for a company for an internship ?,killwish1991,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9bj0ol/how_to_get_the_best_out_of_job_fair_and_what/,"Cirrently pursuing masters program in CS. I am still in the Fall semester, and I will soon be gearing up for career fair. I am looking for internships in coming spring and summer next year. 

Question 1:
My past experience of career fair, has been that it was crowded, with famous companies  both being too crowded. So at the end, You end up dropping your resume to booths and most companies ask you to apply online anyway. So, what is the additional benefit of attending to the career fair and what should I do to get the best chance of landing a phone screen or interview based on my interaction with the recruiter  ?

Question 2:
Also, If I do end up getting more than one interview and offers for the internships ( never hurts to hope :), what exactly should I look for in a company to decide to  intern there. During internship, money and location will be secondary to my goal of learning and getting the best possible experience. So, basically I am looking for what questions should I ask about the company and position during my interview and what other aspects should I consider while picking the internship that aligns best with my goals.

9bja81,87,2018-08-30,Advice to new IT Professionals,apersonhererightnow,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/9bja81/advice_to_new_it_professionals/,"I’ve been noticing a trend on questions lately and figured I would start a discussion.  People seem to come here and ask a variation of can I make it without -insert problem area-. The answer is almost always yes, but it’ll be harder. If you must question something, or ask yourself if it’s possible, it’s likely going to be an issue. To get a job in IT or to advance in IT, you’re going to need a combination of experience, education or certifications. 



Now, how can you get experience without a job? That’s difficult sometimes. If you’re in university, internships or hiring programs sponsored by your college are the way to go. If you are outside of college or coming to this later in life, it becomes more difficult. There are opportunities to volunteer for organizations or even some short-term contracting work, but it’s hard for most people to do this. This is because from what I noticed by the time some people think about switching into IT they already have family and financial responsibilities. 

 So it’s a matter of trying to find entry-level jobs that will accept you without experience. MSP’s, and Small businesses are more likely to take a chance on you if you're able to talk the language. They do have downsides though, as these places are usually filled with stress and people that were taught bad habits and so pass them onto other people.


Education. It should be simple, but it’s something that is asked several times a day. It boils down to this, yes, you should have it. The minimum people should shoot for is a bachelor’s preferably in Computer Science or Information Technology. While a cybersecurity, networking, and database degree will be accepted it’s just not looked as favorably as Computer Science. 

This is because the degree paths of the specialty degrees are too new, and not standardized across colleges, and that means it’s harder to vet what you know.  Anything less than a bachelor’s, it’s going to make your career more difficult. It shouldn’t matter, but it does, and you’re going to have to fight against people that went to college and just have the mindset that it makes you a better candidate. Rather than struggle, it’s easier just to accept the fact and get a degree from a respected university.

Certifications. This is a hot topic here.  Generally, what I notice is that people ask “What certification should I get to get started/advance in IT.” The response is usually A+, Network+, Security+, or even more randomly CCNA. Certifications can be useful, but without experience, it’s just a piece of paper. More so, because if certifications are being recommended they need to match what career path a person is following. 

If somebody wants to be a Systems Administrator, a CCNA is less useful, instead focus on RHEL or Microsoft certifications if somebody wants to go that route. Each specialty has its own certifications that are valued, but the answer is rarely CompTIA or CCNA. CCNA is only useful if you’re looking to go into big enterprise networking, and then the minimum you should have is a CCNP R&amp;S. I say this because most smaller organizations do not pay for the cost of running a Cisco stack,  and rather than spend a lot of hours studying something that you’ll never use, spend it on something that directly relates to what you want to do.



To flip this topic. What are some trends that you all have noticed? Do any of you have any advice that you can give people? Feel free to even call me out on some of these points as I welcome a discussion on these topics.

I have been tasked with designing a plan for a Data Science/Analytics focused major within a business school.  I realize the consensus on this sub seems to be to do CS/Stats as an undergrad major, but we have a large demand for a data focused major (Data Science/Data Analytics) major within the business school and that is the task I have been given.

I have collected a lot of information from other BS, BA, BBA programs, but I want to get some input from practitioners. Where else do you find experts who are passionate about a subject but Reddit?

(If this is against the rules please let me know and I will try to gather information other places.)

Any feedback you can give me will be helpful, however we have a great deal of flexibility in terms of designing new courses or using courses from across our campus so what I would like to hear from those of you out there in the trenches is what topics and or skills you think a freshly minted business major looking for a job in Data Science should have.

\*A little background that may focus the conversation:\*To avoid ""overfitting"" or producing a ""flash in the pan"" major we are creating the program as a track within our existing BS in Economics (not a BBA). So you can assume they will have covered: Calculus 1, basic probability, mathematical calculus based Micro and Macro Theory, introductory applied Econometrics (OLS, Logit, Probit with R). Also we project that \~50% of the students will also be double majors with CS, Math, Stats or Finance.

​

Let me provide a template that you should feel free to completely ignore :)

**Your background:**

Examples: Currently learning, Working as Data Scientist, Hirer of Data Scientist, Trainer, Professor etc... If it is in your flair then skip this one.

​

**Conceptual Topics that MUST be covered:**

Topics and techniques that everyone doing Data Science in a business setting should have. Possible examples:  Regression, Machine Learning?

​

**Conceptual Topics that WOULD BE NICE  to cover:**

Topics and techniques that would be nice to see, but are not deal breakers. Possible Examples: Linear Algebra, Hierarchical Models, Bayesian MLE, Frequentists MLS, Non-Parametic Estimation, Distributed Systems, MCMC?

​

**Practical Skills that MUST be covered**:Skills and tools that everyone doing Data Science in a business setting should have. Possible examples: R or Python/Pandas, Data Mining/Cleaning, SQL?

​

**Practical Skills that WOULD BE NICE  to cover:**

Skills and tools that would be nice to see but are not deal breakers. Possible examples: Hadoop, Spark, Matlab/NumPy?

​

**What would the ideal internship look like?**

We will be requiring internships and we want them to provide real signaling to potential employers.

I recently finished a Data Analytics internship in New York, but I came from being an electrician apprentice in South Carolina for over a year. In fact, most of my life has been blue collar.

Blue collar work is more fulfilling to me as far as the work itself, but often times, in order to make real money at it, you have to commit to long hours, and sometimes difficult hours like overnight. I would be fine with that, but I’m trying to pursue other things in life right now and it’s difficult to work blue collar and have a regular schedule. Also, leadership is usually lacking, and I don’t really feel like the bosses care about their employees at all. Kinda makes me feel miserable.

White collar work is less fulfilling to me as far as the work itself, but there are decent jobs with more regular schedules, and the leadership has more variety from company to company. But, a lot of times they want you to be “all about” your profession. For instance, as a data analyst, they want to know you’re super nerdy about data and read blogs and things like that. But in reality, it’s just something I’m good at that can make me money. And I should mention, even still there are plenty of employees who require long hours.

I have other things I want to focus on. I do a lot of stuff that I truly enjoy but doesn’t make me any money, and I want time to pursue them because they potentially could make me money in the future. But I also need a job that can pay rent. How can I navigate this?"

I've taken a few intro classes (DS, algs), but I don't yet have any major projects under my belt.  The only coding I've done in EE coursework is simulations in Matlab.

My Background:I've only just started Computer Science and I am an 2nd yr undergraduate student within London. (note this being my 1st tech job fair I will be attending) I am hoping to attend this event to meet people and talk about the industry face to face rather than browsing through various blogs/forums, this would also help me to address specific questions regarding job roles surrounding software development, UX designing etc. As well as make a few connections.As you can tell by now although I may not be looking for a job, I would not mind requesting any internships that may be available as this may help me develop my skills further/knowledge also if it goes well who knows I may pull out with a graduate scheme via this internship.

Skill wise I am confident with the following programming languages: HTML/CSS (JavaScript), Python and Java. Planning to learn C++ in the near future. Although I am not fully perfect at coding and do often tend to make a lot of errors during development.In regards to a portfolio, I don't have any projects other than basic ones that I had made but even that I do not believe will be sufficient to present. But I do know I have the skills and do still strive to perfect what I already know.  
However I have run an online graphics business that had sales units equal to close to 1000+ sales worldwide including (UK, USA, Canada, Australia, Europe)  being made on basic t-shirts, throws pillows, duvet covers, phone cases etc. Although it may not be entirely computing related I have learn't to become an intermediate user of CAD software including Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator among'st other tools as well as helping me to understand what it takes to focus on the ins and outs of business. Would this be something I could talk about?

Furthermore I would also like advise on what questions I should be looking to ask? I do have a list sorted out I was hoping if I could get any insight from yourselves.All advice given would be greatly considered and I am thankful for.I understand I may have asked a broad question, but given that its my first tech job fair within London, I am frankly quite excited and eager to jump in the deep end."

I’m graduating from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities with a major in Comp Sci and interned at US Bank (Minneapolis) as a software developer this past summer and received an offer to continue working full time after graduation. 

The salary would be 60k and I’d also get to continue working there part-time (20$/hr) as I complete my senior year. However, I’m really unsure about committing to this company so early on before even starting the semester and the furthest they can extend my response deadline is until next week. Even worse, I’d only get to continue working there part-time if I accept the full-time position. 

I’m originally from Los Angeles and an interested in going back home where there seems to be more opportunities for growth and being closer to my family after a few years in Minnesota. Moreover, my official tittle would be Application Developer II and I’d be working with the same team as in my internship. I fit in really well with them, made some great relationships during my stay there and they really want me to continue being part of the team, but I’m more interested in working in a tech company as a software engineer doing more backend work or in security. The 60k salary also seems lower than I expected (at least 70k) and I feel like I could find a better paying jobs elsewhere that may align better with my interests.

I’m just really torn between accepting this offer since I’d get to work part-time during school and wouldn’t have to worry about interviews (of which I haven’t prepared) and the hassle of applying to other places. On the other hand, I’ve had 2 internships thus far and have done decent enough in school (3.5+ gpa) that I feel like I can get a better paying job in better locations like California or Seattle. Or, I may find a much better paying job here in Minneapolis that would make it worth staying. Also, I can always apply to tech-oriented student jobs in campus since I could use the cash. However, this is all a big gamble with my biggest worry being that I’ll be stretching myself too thing and not finding another position after declining this offer. I’m specifically worried about technical interviews since I don’t have much experience with them and they just seem daunting. 

Sorry for the long post, but any advice regarding my situation would be helpful"

My dad went to the same school as me in the 80s as a Mechanical Engineering major and I know a family friend in his 20s who graduated from my school a few years before I started school and majored in Mechanical Engineering. He still lives at home and works in retail at Lowe's. My dad got a job right after college, but he got rejected from every job he applied to except for his job he still has up to today. These two situations scare me, however my school is actually known for having a lot of people get jobs right after college.

I am not sure how IT jobs would be after college. IT job opportunities (and internships) in NJ suck. There are lack of them except for the more complex jobs. Most of the IT related jobs in NJ are all the urban parts of NJ. The urban parts of NJ suck. Most of them are very dense, ghetto, high traffic, and parking is a pain to get. Working in NJ's suburbs would be really nice, because parking is damn easy, especially parking near those corporate offices. After I finish college, I really want to leave NJ, because I am really sick of the East Coast and the climate out here. I always dreamed to move out to the West.

Even if you feel it's improper or too soon.  You're doing the company more good working on something you're excited about.  Don't be afraid of hurting people's feelings.  Everybody wants what's best for them personally.  Do what's right for you.

I've been working as a full time Software Engineer for a little over a year now.  I'd like to share my experience starting off on the wrong team and switching after 7 months - something I would have never fathomed.

First of all - I had a wonderful internship with this company over the summer of 2016.  I had an chill manager and team, I got to do creative work building an app on my own terms, and had a blast with the other interns.  I thought this was the dream job and I was stoked to come back as a full time last July.

As it turns out, the job wasn't quite the same.  My manager had moved to a new group.  Our team had been reassigned to a different (boring) project.  Worst of all, there wasn't actually any creative work.  It was 100% testing, process, and reporting work that I had zero interest in.  Nobody was particularly keen to share their knowledge or help with these things either.  As I learned, they came up with fun throwaway stuff for interns to hack on, and saved the boring work for full times.  The small amount of interesting stuff that popped up was pieced out to the senior team members.

Still, I liked my team members and new manager.  We also had a cushy work-life balance.  I told myself that I could stay with this for 2 years. At least give them that much because of the good times as an intern, plus the fact they hired me back.  I had some sense of stoic duty, like they *need* my help, and felt I owed my time to the team.

I was an *incredibly* mediocre engineer on this team.  I was drowning in apathy.  I tried to avoid talking about work to anybody.  It was really killing me because I have such a diverse interest in technologies.  I love reading articles and staying current about new tech.  I think of myself as a creative person. I had done many cool projects in hackathons or college courses.  It's like, all of that helped me land this job, but it made me miserable in the job as well.

As time moved forward, my 2 year pledge to myself shrank to 18 months, which shrank to 1 year.

My breaking point was December 27th, when I came back into work after Christmas.  The sheer monotony awaiting me for an entire new year was too much.  Instead of working that day, I started researching. I told myself I was just building connections, not bailing outright.

I looked up people who authored documents about projects I wanted to work on and emailed their managers directly.  Yes, somewhat extreme, maybe even creepy, but I figured might as well go straight to the source.  As it turned out, this was pretty dang effective.

It tore me up to lead the ""double life"" of looking/interviewing for new teams while pretending everything was a-ok to my work friends.  I wasn't great with confrontation.  I don't like upsetting anybody.  Again, the people were wonderful, but the job content was just mind numbing.  Breaking the news to my manager was terrifying.

But the change has been so worth it.  I learned more in the first 2 months on my new team than in the entire 7 on my old.  I get to be creative.  I'm held to a higher standard.  I get to solve problems and contribute.  I swear, the stuff I've done since switching has been *at least* 10x as impactful to the company than what I would have done.  My rewards and career trajectory are *definitely* on a better path than before.

So you can all take from this what you will.  Do your due diligence for what it's like as a full time vs an intern.  Don't be afraid to leave what's comfortable.  People aren't going to hate you for finding what's best for you."

So it was a big thing that I got in at that young. Anyways, I came back as a counsellor this year. I had someone from Cisco and Novant Health talk to me about getting straight to the interview process for an internship. I also had an FBI analyst who was super nice and she helped me with some independent coding stuff. 

So the guy who runs the camp has known me since 2015, and I’ve only done two weeks of the camp but I helped out as much as I could and really enjoyed it. I know it’s not long but he graduated from my dream school so it’d be a huge help if he wrote a recc. I mean before the week ended he said that if I ever needed anything to just email him.

Here is my situation. I'm currently making a gap year between my first and second year of Master (degree in Business Consulting). The idea was to do two 6 months internships to get some work experience, and so far it's going great ! I'm 3 months into my first internship and i'm planning the next one.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't complain, as much as i've struggled to get the first one, today i have two great opportunities and i know i won't pick a bad option, the idea is just to pick the best one.

\- First one is an internship in a big Consulting firm, they came to me and asked if i was interested. The subject of the internship is directly related to what i want to do, i think it will be a nice boost to get on with my career and it pays really well (around 1300€/month).

\- Second one is located in Phnom Penh, Cambodia (I'm french btw, never stepped a foot further east than Poland). I'll be working as a consultant in a business incubator, working with startups and helping companies develop in South East Asia. It also is very interesting and i already have a background in business incubators (+ i'll do my thesis on this subject) so it's still good. It pays 150$ a month (i already started saving money in case i go there, so it's not a matter of money really)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think there is a bad option, i don't think i'll regret any of them. It's just that it might be the last 6 months i'll spend as a student, and i have to decide between something more adventurous, and something that \*might\* have a better short term impact on my career. Also, i never had the luxury of having to choose much, and when i see my friends struggling, i know it's rare and i need to think it through.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, 95% of people i asked told me to go to Cambodia, as it's a great experience, i'm young, i can afford to take some risk and i need to take advantage of my student situation as much as i can.

I've seen a lot of talk about a BS not being sufficient on its own to get into cybersecurity, and that makes sense with the necessary courses being less focused on any particular area for CIS, but it seems the MS program builds on that and focuses on one of a small number of areas of cybersecurity.

I am going to study CS at a top uni in my country in Europe in a few months. I just turned 21 and have spent about 8 months as a full-time Python (Django) developer at a small, but established company. I decided it would be better for me to quit working for the time being and go to college. I am going to be looking for internships, but I don't really know that much about the job admission process for internships in general. 

My goal is to get a Big N internship, so yeah, I've got loads of work ahead of me. What I am wondering about is how the admission process works in general. I have read here that you should apply as soon as possible, but I have to admit I am not that ready yet for an interview. I've finished like 80 leetcode challenges, the vast majority of them being ranked Easy, but my knowledge of data structures beyond binary trees and linked lists is basically nil, partly because I never had a reason to use them in practice. Also, I never used C, C++ or Java before for the same reason, though I am going to have to use them a LOT at college. I think that isn't too important though, right? I have a pretty solid understanding of Python and I would use that language before any other at a job interview anyway.

So I'll just condense this into a few questions:

1. Do the interviews take place in a short period after submitting the job application? For example, if I applied in September to Microsoft, would the interview generally take place soon after applying? Should I apply ASAP anyway?
2. How much of an advantage does having real world job experience yield? Should I still work on some personal projects? I have one personal project, a social network for sports, though I never deployed it as I really built it just to showcase my Django skills and get a job. 
3. How difficult are Big N internship questions in general? Leetcode mediums?

I've been doing a lot of reading over the summer and I've been thinking about after I graduate. I'd love to work in fintech, developing software for the financial sector, with my dream being to work in quantitative trading. 

&amp;#x200B;

However I don't know what the odds are of being employed in this industry given the degree I'll have. I do plan on working on side projects related to it in my spare time and applying for internships next summer in as many companies as I can. The problem is that I'm wondering would I be shooting myself in the foot for getting a job in an engineering field if the fintech dream falls through? I was thinking that if it did fall through I could always fall back on getting a job in engineering but how difficult would it be if I've spent my time working on fintech rather than engineering projects for the 2 years before graduation? 

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's important to note that I do enjoy my courses and I find electrical engineering really interesting. I'm not struggling with the degree either. When it comes to it I'd be more than happy to work in the elec eng field when I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

So is fintech/quant trading just a pipe dream if I stay on the course of electrical engineering? Would I need to uproot my life and pursue a degree in compsci/maths if I really wanted to work in the field? Perhaps I'd need a masters in compsci if I were to stick with electrical engineering?

9bu8u0,0,2018-08-31,Help with internships,marcolli,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/9bu8u0/help_with_internships/,"Hi r/Germany,

I'm in a bit of a sticky situation and was hoping you guys could help me out with some advice.

I've just finished my university degree in the UK this summer. Two months ago I was offered a 6-month internship in Baden-Wuttemburg, to work at an industry-leading establishment, from November to April. It was a written offer in an email, but I haven't signed any contract or anything. A week ago, they contacted me to tell me that I can't do the internship unless I'm a student. They were fully aware that I had finished my studies and even acknowledged this in their offer email.

I've spent the last week looking for university courses which haven't closed, and I had a couple of options on the table, including an arrangement with my old university. Today, they also told me that the university I am at must define the internship to be ""mandatory"" for me to work at this company. I may be able to arrange this still but it's looking very unlikely.

I'm posting on here because I want to find out if there's any other paths I can go down with the company. I understand that German employment law is a bit of rabbit hole, but I also don't think that the HR people at this company are completely competent, as it took them 2 months to realise the issue and another week since then to give me any more information. If anyone has any suggestions I'd be very interested in hearing them.

Ordinarily, at this point I'd probably just stick two fingers up and go and look for other jobs, but in my field this place is the best in Europe, so I'm still trying to figure something out. Otherwise, I'm considering if I should try to ""shame"" them into offering me some kind of employment. After all, I've lost 2 months of job-searching time thinking that I have something planned until next May.

If anyone has any advice on how I could proceed, I'd appreciate it greatly!

At that point I needed to work and ended up in retail, where I pretty quickly wound up a supervisor.  Went back to school part time for a GIS certification and then was fired from the retail job for reasons that were never entirely clear (some combination of them thinking I wasn't committed to it, not liking that I wanted a raise for supervisory work an wanting to hire the owners son anyway SEEMS to be it, but they would never say anything beyond ""it didn't work out and I won't call it a lay off"").  With the certification I got a couple of interviews for public sector planning jobs with no offers... It took me almost ten months in 2015 to get full time work after that, and it was back into retail computer/electronics sales.

I liked the computer part of it and shifted into a service technician (still store based) position with them, but was laid off a couple months back (the company really does seem to be struggling).  I'm trying to leverage the the almost three years in a computer shop and the GIS certificate into a help-desk role, ideally somewhere where I can start getting certifications and move toward better jobs in IT but have now been out of work a couple months with the only call being a single interview that it looks like I didn't get.  I'm still applying planning, but it's been four years since the GIS program, longer since my degree and at this stage I kinda get why employers aren't loving my applications...  But seriously, what should I be doing?

Am I just completely fucked?  It seems the only thing I can ever get is retail, which I hate and always seems to end up with no prospect of advancement, raises much beyond minimum or really even stability but I don't have a GPA that makes grad school realistic... Folks I know say it looks like I shouldn't be a complete non-starter for planning work, but I only rarely get interviews and public sector jobs around here never offer any feedback beyond ""it was competitive"" while the IT stuff is supposed to be easy to get right now but I've got super limited experience and fewer formal qualifications in it... I guess I might be overly freaking out about only having had one interview in two months, but I'm feeling like I might be tilting at windmills here. Help?

In Ontario for what it matters."

I'd like to land an infosec internship (ultimately). However, web dev is also attractive to me because I like programming and I am contemplating going to Thailand and freelancing web dev for some time in my life. Also, I find web dev slightly more boring than web dev, so if I got infosec as my 1st internship I probably wouldn't switch to web dev.

Do you think that it is a good idea to go to a web dev internship first, then aim for infosec?

Thanks in advance!"

I'm a Computer Engineering student (read: half-assed CS, half-assed EE) in Brazil with two years left before graduation. I am a dual national, so after studying for free here I plan to go to the US. My grades are very median here, but I don't know how they would translate to the GPA system.

I have been interning in a tech startup for around 4 months now doing pretty mundane work, only occasinaly touching a Ruby script or two. I don't know how relevant this info may be, but it is a half-time paid internship. However, there is a guaranteed promise that, after an year or so of working there, I will have the opportunity to join one of their programming teams.

On the other hand, I could try to apply for a master's degree at the end of the year and do that instead. The master's would be something related to CS, but I'm not sure how much more of a choice I would have.


What are your opinions?"

The last death in my family was my uncle in an car accident, because a drunk drove him over. I couldn't say goodbye, and not seen his grave yet, because he is living in a other country. My sadness destroying everything of me. I'm crying everyday, and don't find a way to get out this hell, without killing myself...

Sadly I've exhausted all the available resources to advance in my country so I have started looking for internship, volunteer, junior and just studying opportunities( only with scholarship )  abroad (Mostly interested with Canada, US, Sweden, Poland and other EU countries). Sadly most of companies I have approached take only local people so they just said no (and I couldnt get to contact somebody else other than recruiters). I was wondering if you guys have any idea what else I could try.

9bxeof,3,2018-08-31,"Having problems being long-term friendly with new people. And it's making it more difficult to find new jobs as the years go by. How do you become more ""known"" without making it feel like work?",StatusDegree,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9bxeof/having_problems_being_longterm_friendly_with_new/,"I am almost 36 years old and for my age, I don't really know a lot of people very well. While I've worked on-and-off for 11 years in a career, I'm about as capable as a new graduate when it comes to relying on a network of people for jobs. This seems like a big problem to me. Some new grads may even have a better pro network, actually, since I never took internships.

I have a small group of close friends, the ones I would be fine eating out with, drinking or playing video games together. However, they are clueless about the industry I work in (software development) and do not work in fields related to it. I've asked for them to help on referring me to someone for work, but they always come up empty-handed.

Then there's the group of people I work with. The ones who do understand my industry since they work with people like me. But I don't really get too friendly with them. I don't feel like we'd get along much if I'd meet them outside of a professional setting. Same with people I met in tech meetups. So they don't really feel close, and plus they get annoyed if I ask them for favors. Because I am unlikely gonna talk to them unless I want to get a favor out of them, so usually they do not reply to my messages.

Since finishing high school I rarely felt interested in making new friends. College was weird in that friendships were wishy-washy. It may have to do with me commuting to college, and not living on campus. My friends from high school are nice people but not very useful professionally.

But now it's biting me in the ass whenever I have no job and I have to go looking for jobs. It is making life overall much harder. So it's a frustrating situation... the friends that I am close with, at the same time, are not people that could put my name out there for jobs and vetting me for interviews.

How do I become genuinely interested in meeting new people without it feeling like work? After all, making friends should not feel like work."

Focusing on my future is hard, going to school is hard so I took a break this fall, and working is hard. The problem is, I want to be doing these things. I just figured it would be a poor idea to go to school this fall--the stress levels were way too high, and nothing had even started yet. I did go to a few lectures and nothing inside me sounded anything promising for the rest of the semester. If 2 months off in the summer didn't do it for me then I didn't see it getting any better at school.

​

I worked a very, very easy job over the summer as an usher. Every work shift felt like a grind regardless, and all I had to do was stand there most of the time and check tickets/help people find their seats and things like that. I stopped working in hopes of transitioning to school but that did not pan out as I explained above. It did help a little bit with the ""moving forward,"" aspect; I just felt this attraction towards one chick that was like that ""love at first sight"" thing which gave me hope but other than that I don't feel I truly got any sort of mental gain from the experience in spite of talking with co-workers, fans, etc.

​

All the while I waited 3 months for my first therapy appointment--I honestly should have called and tried to take cancellations during this time, but I felt kind of hopeless after they told me I'd have to wait three months and also wanted to try and stick it out by working and doing all the healthy habits that I was used to doing. I wanted to work through this the normal way. I tried other things too, like going on a road trip with a friend, and even went on a trip out of the country with my grandma. Nothing worked though. It felt like a high-functioning depression and constant anxiety. I tried antidepressants through a GP but they gave me bad anxiety side effects after just a few days (seeing colors, felt like I was entering an LSD trip).

​

At the moment, the sum of my life feels like my guitar, a TV show, and a sort of restlessness. I've told friends and family about it and like to share anything helpful information with them I find related to how I feel some days just so they understand. I play the guitar because it's proven to be something I can chip away at and it eases my mind ever so slightly. I watch a pretty good TV show in the morning, I just like the characters and it touches on real topics. But I've been more prone to binging a few episodes the last few days. Lastly, I still want to get better. I don't want to be depressed the rest of my life. It just feels like my whole life has been sucked away by this experience. I have been stressed out many times in my life however and made it through, but I fear that I've finally just gone too far or something. I liked doing hard work: the gym, math, stressful things that many people didn't like. It gave me pleasure, pride, a lot of positive emotions. Now, doing hard work seems pointless and I also don't know if I even like doing anything in life that isn't those things, mostly because it's hard to jump in to new things and even know if I'm going to feel anything. I have no good inspiration here, sometimes it feels like I'm trying too much even. I just don't feel anything from doing things most of the time. I tried going for a hike the other day and while it was fine, 90% of my thoughts were on the relationship and I could hardly focus on being ""in the moment."" Meditation is nice, but it makes me feel crazy still because it's like my brain doesn't want to not think about negative things. I literally counted to 400 something breaths yesterday just to give you an idea of why it drives me a little nuts lol.

​

I got an internship and interviewed and took it and everything. But honestly I'm not sure how I'll do at it. I don't even know if I'll be able to stick it out for the whole fall/winter. It's about 5 days of work a week, and I have absolutely no motivation for it other than that I'd need money to pay a $45/month gym contract. It's just the damn depression and anxiety.

​

I'm seeing a psychiatrist for the first time and trying meds again, it's been about 4 or 5 days, but then I hear people say that meds don't help or that they only mask symptoms. I don't understand what the point is then or how I will get past this. They have helped relieve some anxiety I feel like and made it easier to think about some things but I don't know I mean I don't want them to solve my problems but I do feel like I need help. I feel like I've been ruminating a little more about my relationship since starting some of them but I think that is just normal emotions, like now that I've gotten to the help I still have to face these feelings.

​

I finally got my first therapy appointment this past week. Then I found out it wasn't weekly, which sucked. She suggested intensive group therapy (3-4x a week) but it conflicts with the internship and honestly I didn't know which to choose so I chose the internship.  My next therapy appointment is technically in october, so I have to call and take cancellations. She made it sound like it would be a good idea to just see one therapist, so I am going to try and stick with her and not jump around or anything. But I won't be afraid to change if I need to. I'm just kind of upset about the lack of therapists and availability for help. They tell you to reach out for help but it takes months to get an appointment and it's not even a consistent thing? Maybe I'm asking too much, but so far I feel like I've only scratched the surface of my issues. I just don't know anymore. I hope the rest of my life isn't spent in a depressive episode, or going in and out, or whatever. It just doesn't make sense. I guess the fact that I'm needing this much help to get through this one thing signals to me that I could be in for a lifetime of hard times, what am I supposed to think??? Is it even a good idea to go through with this internship?
