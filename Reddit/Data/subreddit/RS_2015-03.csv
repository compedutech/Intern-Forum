I am a Senior graduating May 2016 with B.S. in Business Administration with emphases Computer Information Systems and Management.  I am in pursuit of any paid internship allowing me to gain more knowledge in any realm of within the CIS spectrum. Besides a wedding I must attend in May, my availability is completely open between May 10th and August 22nd. Pay permitting, I am also willing to relocate this summer from the Denver metro area in Colorado to complete this internship and be a part of your firm's team.


To give an idea of what I've studied, my CIS major has been composed of a general understanding in the topics of Object Oriented Development, Database Management, Web Development, Systems Analysis and Design, and most recently Networking. 


I have a working knowledge of the languages C#, Java, Python, HTML/CSS, Oracle DBMS. I also have familiarity with the programs NetBeans, Visual Studio, Axure Pro. I am also willing to educate myself on additional languages/applications in the CIS realm before this summer to fulfill any internship prerequisites.


Please feel free to private message me or leave a comment down below if you believe there is a position at your company that is suitable for me."

2xjg6t,2,2015-03-01,I (25/f) am having serious issues with procrastinating my schoolwork,procastinator5000,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/2xjg6t/i_25f_am_having_serious_issues_with/,"I've always been a procrastinator to some extent.  If I were to make a grand generalization, I could say that the reason I'm still working on my bachelor's degree at 25 is because I am a huge procrastinator.  I've been putting off my future for years.  Now I'm one year away from graduating and it seems like the closer I get to finishing, the harder it becomes to do anything.

But really, I don't know why I'm doing this to myself.  I didn't care about school when I was in high school, I never did any of my assignments.  I only started caring in college and for awhile, I was doing really good.  I was on top of everything and basically did a 180, from not caring at all to caring way too much.

But I was going to the community college part-time and, at first, I didn't know what I wanted as a major.  Then I picked something, pursued that for awhile, then changed my mind.  Basically, six years later, I was still in community college and back at square one.  I finally settled on being an English major, which is really what I should have chosen from the start.

I finally switched to a four-year college and now I'm going full-time and I'm one year away from graduating.  I have no idea what I'm going to do when I graduate and I need to go to the career center with a resume so they can help me set up an internship for over the summer.  I can't seem to get myself to do it.  I can't get any of my homework done until the night before it's due and I've been pulling a *lot* of all-nighters.  I have a bunch of homework for Tuesday and I haven't started any of it, including two essays.

I can't handle the stress that I'm putting on myself right now.  I don't know if it's because I'm depressed about my future and my situation or if it's because I can't handle taking classes full-time.  I always work part-time, three days a week, 8-hour shifts.  This is over the weekend, which is when I have the most homework.  I would hate to chalk this up to me being unable to balance working 24-hours a week and a full course load.  I'd almost rather this be depression or something.  It has to be, because when I have an entire day free for homework, I waste it doing anything else (especially redditing).

So I'm asking how people who have serious problems with procrastination ever managed to get over that.  How do you break such a bad habit?  I've tried organizing and making schedules and lists, but none of that worked.  I've also tried that add-on that lets you block certain websites to keep you from procrastinating by browsing.  I just go on them incognito instead or with a different browser.  It's pointless.

Does anyone have any solid advice for this, or personal anecdotes, or suggested reading?  Any help would be greatly appreciated."

I have a 4.0 GPA, having taken the honors version of every required math course. A member of two honors societies, hold a leadership position in one. I was the captain of varsity football in high school. I had one small internship at a local engineering firm last summer and just recently accepted to a big one overseas for this summer. My faults are not having completed all prerequisite courses and my HS SAT was very low (1500) I just recently applied to UCLA, Berkeley (specifically states ""not completing all prerequisite courses will not be considered for admission"" &lt;- bluff?), UC San Diego, Cal Poly SLO, USC, and Stanford (applied as PetE. requires SAT).

If in my position, what major and school would you choose? 
What do you think my chances are at Stanford (with a horrible SAT) and Berkeley?
Is it a better decision to go to a more hands on school like SLO?

2xk4vi,4,2015-03-01,Need transfer advice...,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2xk4vi/need_transfer_advice/,"Hi, sorry if this is the wrong place but I just am feeling lost in the transfer process and wanted to get some advice.
I am a second-year student at a small private college in Vermont. My college boasts ""exceptional"" career preparation and a very high (good) job placement rate in all majors. I came in as a writing major not really knowing what to do with myself, so that was reassuring for me. However, I ended up taking a risk and switching into computer science for my second semester so that I could do something with my life, and (luckily) it turned out okay, I'm pretty good at programming, and I love it. However, I'm just realizing I need to transfer--the CS program here is small and doesn't have a lot of theory/electrical engineering stuff. There are 50 CS students and I'm the only girl. Most of the people I meet here are interested in just doing the minimum amount of schoolwork and aren't very passionate--and those who aren't that way are only here because they got screwed over in their admissions process somehow. I don't feel it's an environment where I can meet my potential, and in CS I can get a great job placement rate anywhere I go. I have set my sights on UC Berkeley--however, they don't allow spring semester applications, so I won't be able to go for another year and a half (aside from summer classes). I really think I can get in--I have a 3.9, 2200 on my SATs, was student body president in high school and president of many clubs, I am an officer for our ACM chapter here, I am a pretty good writer... I think my application is decent, anyways. But I don't know what to do in the interim year. I don't think it's worth it to stay here because none of the credits I would take will transfer anywhere else, period. Is it worth it to apply and go to another school (such as CMU, USC, or some other top computer engineering school) for just one year while I try to get into Cal? Should I take the year to get an internship and go to a CA community college and then transfer from there? Will any of these options set me back in any way--aside from an extra year of school, which I am fine with? Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble--I'm just feeling confused and unsure about how to proceed."

This may be especially relevant for interns or new grads who have no prior work experience. 

I'm developing a program to help managers/employers equip employees/interns with the skills they need to do an excellent job without requiring an overwhelming amount of time and energy from the manager.

I need your help managers or employers: 

1. Do you feel there is a need for a program like this for interns/new grads with little to no work experience?

2. If this program existed, what types of skills would you like to see included? Some examples to provoke your thoughts: email etiquette, powerful powerpoints, excel data visualization, public speaking, taking minutes, relationship building, etc.

Flair: Work, Personal, School     
.     
I’m between a rock and a hard place with my education. After this semester I’ll only need 4 classes to graduate, which I had scheduled for Summer I and Summer II, however the one class that was irreplaceable was cancelled. Normally I could get a waiver and take something else, but I’m already taking two other courses that are outside of my intended field. I feel if I add a third it might dilute my degree too much. Also, I have virtually no industry experience since my one and only internship was very light on technical duties, since they were a startup and had all of their tech needs are addressed by another company in exchange for a profit sharing scenario. I possibly have the following options…     
.     
**Some pertinent information:** I’m a single dad, my 2 kids live with me full time. I’m a vet so my education is paid for and while I am actively enrolled in a session I receive a decent stipend. It’s enough for basic living expenses, and a small amount of the occasional babysitter (which I use for going to my classes). If I’m not enrolled I can’t afford my expenses and I currently don’t work because the daycare cost incurred would be too much for me to afford financially.     
.     
**Option 1:** Take intended classes for Summer 1, get a full time job in July, finish masters by taking one course a semester for Fall 2015 and Spring 2016.     
This is the kind of middle of the road approach, overall it seems like a horrible idea unless I can confirm that I have a solid offer by that time, with a reasonable salary. This would be a decent scenario, especially if it allowed me to move out of NY.     
 .     
**Option 2:** Take intended classes for Summer 1, Take more classes outside of discipline during Summer 2, get a full time job in Sept.     
This is the brute force, head on approach. I’ll have my masters, but I won’t have that focus in my degree and it may trigger some controversy if someone asks me why I would take courses that wouldn’t benefit me. However, if I got a solid offer to start somewhere in Sept. I could definitely leave NY and live somewhere with a reasonable cost of living. Also, I’m not even sure I can convince my department chair to sign off on any more waivers, especially since she’s already signed off on so many.     
 .     
With these first two options this could possibly cost me in terms of my initial salary of wherever I start. This will also probably limit my options. What concerns me the most is how it will affect my career in the long run because it might stifle opportunities to advance in my field.     
.     
**Option 3:** Take out a 10K unsubsidized loan to cover living expenses, do a relevant full time summer internship, take a full load Fall 2015 and maybe continue my internship part time, then get a full time job in Jan. somewhere else, hopefully with a significantly better salary. This option will probably be best for me long term, it just costs the greatest in the short term. Also, I'm worried that the debit incurred will potentially offset whatever I may gain from taking this route.     
.     
What would you do?     
.     
**EDIT #1:** My lease is up April 1st, my landlord has verbally agreed to extend my lease 2 months up until June, but that I might have to sign another 1 year lease at minimum if I want to stay past June 1st. Time is critical.     
.     
**EDIT #2:** My advisor is grossly incompetent. She couldn't even be bothered to send my department chair an updated course sheet for me earlier this month, something that would have literally taken less than 5 minutes. I know because that’s how long it took me to bring it up to date. Also, anytime I ask her for a waiver she says it's impossible. I've been avoiding her since last fall because she almost screwed me out of my BS due to some missing waivers in my file. Waivers that were supposed to be there, and I had an email paper trail with proof. After two months of driving me crazy, she magically figured it out. There's more to the story, but it's irrelevant for the purposes of this post. I have been taking care of my business and going directly to my department chair. I just contact her via forwarded emails letting her know that she needs to get waivers together, and I make sure to CC the chair so she actually does it. Paper trail FTW!     
.     
My current degree is Master of Science in Information Systems with a concentration on Security and Information Assurance. I've already finished my prerequisites (2 waived due to prior knowledge, 1 due to lack of availability before Fall 15) and I'll be done with my concentration this semester (taking all 3 required classes concurrently, it’s tough). I've already exceeded my limit for courses in other fields, I'm taking one each from Public Administration, Business Management, and Computer Science. I used some obscure excuse, but in the end it won't benefit me other than getting me my degree sooner. It would be different if I was getting a Master's in Business, but it's too late to switch now. The only classes that could fill the gap are either Public Administration or Business Management courses, a total of 7 options that could be used as a filler. These are even less relevant than the ones I've already chosen to take.
.     
Let me recount my waivers so far for a degree that requires 10 courses: 2 waivers for prior knowledge, 1 due to lack of availability, 2 waivers to allow me to take 2 classes concurrently with their prerequisite, 1 waiver for the Public Administration class, 1 waiver for the business management class, and 1 waiver for the Computer Science course because I won’t even be taking the prerequisite. Total 8 waivers so far, is it reasonable to ask for more? Especially since if I take a fall semester I’ll be taking relevant courses and be able to reduce my total waivers down to 4.     "

Apart from coding questions, does amazon asks any behavioral questions in their intern interviews - Question like side projects, most challenging bug, where did you learned the most and so on.

On a scale from 1 to 10, how hard is it to find an internship in the major tech cities? (i.e. places that everyone and their mom's dog wants to live like The Bay area, etc.)


I'm thinking that all companies who advertise probably get thousands of applicants per day, so I'm wondering if it's even worth applying.


Especially since I'm not one of those people who has a bunch of impressive projects or my own website, GitHub, etc... i.e. I'm really just a student, y'know?


And I don't know any of the *""tricks""* for finding open positions, so chances are if I've found the posting, 100,000 other people have seen it as well.


So this leads back to my question - on a scale of 1-10 how hard is it to land an internship offer at those highly-contested locations?

When I went and met up with him to talk we started off just discussing education, and as we talked he started talking about an idea for a a platform he is working on but doesn't quite have the time to commit to it. He said that he could just get any developer to work on it, but he believes we share a similar passion and that because of that he would like to get me working on it with them. I wasn't looking for a job by talking to him, and was actually more anticipating that he'd be pitching the program to me.

He actually asked me what my schedule was like, and how available I was to work with them, and I told him the truth that I'm likely going to be working on an internship for the rest of the semester, but over the summer I'd be free. He also happened to ask where I was living because he knew I didn't live in the city that the bootcamp is located in, and I said that I was living up at the school I attend, and off handidly mentioned I actually need to be looking for an apartment for the summer but wasn't sure I could get one being 17, and he said that he could actually work with me to give me a place to live as part of my compensation.

Being 17 and getting offered a job without even applying is a bit weird to me, and I'm not sure how to proceed. I know I would beyond ecstatic to be working with them because I would be working in the field that I care extensively about and would be able to work with people who do share my passions. But I'm not sure like how exactly does one proceed in a situation like this? I'm kind of lost on this one, and any suggestions is really great, thanks.

Edit: Also, I feel like this offer is exacerbating a bit of imposter syndrome. I've previously worked with educational advocacy groups, and I've been paid to program before but never working with either topic quite to this scope, and I fear what would happen if I were to fail and not be able to live up to their expectations. I mean I've taken jobs before where I didn't know how to do anything needed and I managed, but never something this big. Apologies for the wall of text."
2xn9ck,5,2015-03-02,Etiquette Q: Build Bridges at Low Paying Short Term Job or Get More $ and Burn Bridges?,jobquestionthrowawwy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2xn9ck/etiquette_q_build_bridges_at_low_paying_short/,"TL;DR: Fellowship starting in the fall. Got offered one short-term position that doesn't pay much or play to my skills but is in an interesting field. Am interviewing for a long-term position that pays much more ($ that would be REALLY helpful) but I'd burn bridges when I leave in the fall. 

Hi all,

Thanks for reading my post. New to reddit, so apologies for any mistakes in post. I'm a recent college grad: from fall 2013 to fall 2014 I was working at a fellowship position. When that ended, I did some freelance work, a part-time thing and a couple of unpaid internships- I also used my unemployed time to to start learning another language/apply to some fellowships. I basically haven't had a ""real"" job for six months, and my having money/savings situation is not good. 

Recently, I've been working on my LinkedIn profile, my resume, on cover letters, etc. I had an on-site interview for a good position, but didn't get it. I got 'let go' from my part-time job. Over the last two months, I had heard back from all of the fellowships I applied to- I got nothing. I heard from the last one maybe three weeks ago- they told me that I had been really, really close, but that ultimately I hadn't gotten it. It sucked.

Last week, I applied to two jobs. One was for a short-term position with not awesome pay. The work I'd be doing wouldn't be too technical: other people applying for the position are usually undergrads who are interested in getting a foot in the door in the field, and I'm overqualified for the work. The upside to this position is that it's in a field that I'm really interested in, and I'd make great connections. I have to get back to them early this week. I'm also interviewing for a position where I'd get to use my skills while developing new skills, at a very interesting company, for significantly more pay.  

Here's the good news: earlier this week, the fellowship that I had applied for and got really, really close to getting actually got back to me. They had miraculously found some extra funding, and would be able to fund me for two years. I'm completely overjoyed! 

However, now I'm left with a question. I wasn't sure about taking this short-term position because of the low pay, but I see that I could complete the job and (hopefully) build strong connections before starting my fellowship in the fall. If I got the other long-term position, I could make a lot more money, which would be really helpful during my fellowship term. (I'd also have the flexibility to take some time off to hang out with a friend on a trip we had planned, though I understand that this probably shouldn't factor into my job decision). But, I'd have to quit after being there for 4 to 6 months. Especially if they invest training in me, I feel like the people at the long-term job will resent that I quit, and I wouldn't be able to ask anyone there for a recommendation. One friend told me I may not be able to put it on my resume. If I didn't get this job, I think (perhaps wrongly) that I can get interviews for long-term positions that would pay a similar amount, but still, the problem of burning bridges in the fall when I leave would be the same with any longer-term position.

What do you think? I don't have a lot of experience with the job market, and I'd really appreciate any thoughts or advice.

I have a situation and I am not sure how to approach it. I will be graduating this August and am hoping to return to my previous employer where I have done my co-op placements (or internship).

I worked at ""Company W"" for 1 year for co-op placements. I started working there for a 4 month term, returned back to school, then worked there again for an 8 month term. I really enjoyed working there and I would love to return back as a FT employee after I graduate. During the last few months when I was working there, my assistant director (aka my manager's boss) hinted more than a few times how she would love to have me working here again and hope that an opportunity will come up at the department by the time I graduate. During the last week of my co-op placement, my manager gave me the highest rating on my co-op evaluation and said that I have done extremely well. He also said that when it is close to my graduation date, give him a shout and he will help me find a job. I also told him and the assistant director that I would love to work at Company W again. I know I left a good impression with them and everyone in the office liked me. After I left, I visited them twice since August 2014 just to say hi to everyone again. 

Earlier this year, I went to a job fair to see what kind of jobs are out there because I am worried that Company W would not hire me again. I met many recruiters there and they advised me to keep my Linkedin profile up to date. I thought it would be a good idea to ask my manager to write me a recommendation on Linkedin. I explained to him how I went to the job fair and recruiters might be looking at my profile, and it would give me more credibility if I had a recommendation from him.  He happily wrote me a pretty awesome recommendation. 

After this happened, I began to ask myself if I did anything wrong. I really would love to work for Company W again and yet, I went to a job fair and asked my manager to write me a recommendation so my Linkedin Profile looks more credible in case other recruiters are looking. Does it seem like I don't want to work for my manager anymore? Or am I thinking too much? 

I really want to ask my manager if there will be any opportunities available but I have no idea how to ask him. I am really scared to know his answer because my fate is literally in his hands. I don't really know how to word my outreach message to him. Is it too early to ask right now since I am graduating in August? I was planning to e-mail him this week but I want to ask Reddit first!"

I'm faced with a dilemma that I really need help with from someone that is more experienced or knows the software job market (and the way it works) better.

10 months ago I got an internship that basically consisted of developing Android applications for a small company, in which I went from knowing nothing about android dev to actually being able to make apps, although I'm still far from an expert.

Now that that internship is over and I have about half a year before finishing college, I figured I want to keep learning mobile dev for securing a career at that since I have 10 months experience already and I actually love it (although I need to make a living so what I like doesnt really matter). 

I'm trying to find another internship that can help me learn more before finishing college, and my problem is: if I cant find anything mobile related, what do I do? take something else (probably web dev) and learn something new from scratch, or make apps at home instead to further learn android despite no working experience for putting on my resume? Which one would look better on the resume or give me a better chance?"

It was my first job in a ""CS"" setting. I started off doing some scripting, which was ok since I still had to learn how the company worked, then moved on to some custom software using Java, but the work load has been stagnant for the last 2 months and I am being forced to do work along the lines of working on excel macros, ""installing"" excel sheets, access dbs. 

I am really unhappy with the direction its all going and feel like I am stuck. Since I am the only developer in this company I have no experience working in a team setting, the technology they mostly use is irrelevant(excel macros, lotusscript, SAP ABAP). The company culture is awful and they refuse to change the way they do things, and they think all their problems can be solved using excel sheets. The compensation is awful compared to the average, but I have to stay to cover living expenses.
I am having a hard time starting projects on my own because after going through a whole day of working here I don't have the time to give my full focus on something, and this job makes me try to stay away from a computer.
I started learning mobile so I hope to be able to refresh my resume with some new projects, but in the mean this job is killing my interest in anything. I want to devote %100 of my time learning new things and working on worthwhile projects with current technology but I am not sure if its a good idea to leave the current job.

However, I did get a a few responses but I am in awkward position for all of them.

One company responded within 3 days of submitting my application and the Sr. recruiting manager was impressed by my resume and wanted to talk over it. I emailed him back and never got a confirmation email for a set phone call. Last Tuesday, I realized he sent the email through their job system which was a noreply address. I am not sure if he ever got my message so I quickly searched for his company email address and resent with new times for next week. They also opened more positions and I am hesitant if I should reapply for those positions. They are identical to the position I applied for except it states Mechanical Engineering near the top.

Does that look bad on my part and would that ruin my chances?

The second company sent me a rejection letter for a design engineering internship position. They said we have reviewed your background and qualifications and find that we do not have an appropriate match at this time. It might be a generic bs response but does that take a count for their other positions? They have a manufacturing position as well and I was curious if I should apply to that as well?

Does it look bad if you apply to a different position within the company before/after getting a rejection response?

**TL;DR**: Im in a awkward position for some companies and need advice on how to proceed without killing my chances for an internship. Should I reapply to a position I already applied? Is it ok to apply for a different position from a company that already rejected you with vague wording(Not a good fit for the company or this position???)."

And networking wasn't my strong suit. I literally have no one that could vouch for me at an engineering firm/company. Because of that I landed no internships (they were hard to get) and now with my 2.87 GPA no one will hire me. 

I've thought about going into IT but I'm not sure if people are able to cut corners and just get higher level Certs or if you really do need to start out at the bottom with help desk / customer support stuff and get a compTIA A+.  

I just feel I would be better at IT work considering the struggles I had in school. I mean I've always been the go to computer guy in my family. I've built a NAS and have done networking, VM work, etc. I have programming skills. It's just gotten to that point where I've considered a change and was curious what you guys thought.

The system for job searching in engineering right now just really sucks if you have a mediocre GPA + no internships. I worked for a year for an aerospace company but all it did was put a better job on my resume. I didn't learn that much related to engineering.  

Thoughts? 

Anyone know someone who went from engineering (electrical) to IT?

As I sit here looking for jobs several months out of college, I see no prospects with the social science degree I earned, and on top of all that, I have no fond memories of college. Few memories that really stick out with me, you know, the ones you want to hold on to forever. Right now, college is just some haze that I don't like to think about too much. I have been meaning to write this post for awhile now, but was conflicted on how to format and direct it. Take it as you will though, advice or not, but here it goes.

You know those cliché portrayals you see of college life in the movies and on TV and all? You know, the ones where you have the time of your life, hook up with all the girls (this is from a male's perspective btw sorry!), and become the main man on campus? Yeah. Get rid of that. All of it. I found that the worst thing to do in college was to hold too tight to expectations. I wanted that college experience, the nights out that you remember forever, lasting friendships, the best 4 years of your life. Well, in the process of attaining that, it is easy to spend most of your time stressing out and worrying about how you haven't reached that yet. The truth is, that while some nights are fantastic, most nights are just average, and all those wild raging parties? Well, sometimes they aren't all that fun anyway, it depends on the type of person you are. Which leads me to my next point, 

You don’t need to try to be anyone you aren’t. Really! You will see plenty of guys, PLENTY, who appear to be the life of the party, and while you might be asking yourself why that can’t be you, you are not realizing how unique and special you already are. Find your own niche in college. Sure, try out the party scene for a bit when you first start out, but realize there is more to college than just that! If you have fun with it, awesome, but if you do not, and don’t enjoy drinking, don’t feel like every Friday night has to be a drunken ragefest. There are so many other things you can focus on in college. Yes I understand, it is almost impossible to avoid alcohol and partying in college, but my point is that doesn’t have to be you if you don’t want it to be. Which leads me to my next advice…

GET INVOLVED. Seriously. Do it. I know how hokey it can sound to join school clubs, because I felt the same way. Freshman year I felt I had to make my OWN social life, so I negated all the offers I came across to join clubs, and I totally regret it now. And not just clubs, just campus events in general, guest lectures, something volunteer related, a writing group, a science club, anything! I made most of my friends this way. And all the students I met at a freshmen wandering the town with looking for parties? Half of them dropped out freshman year, and the rest I never spoke to again. Don’t let anybody tell you who should and shouldn’t be your friends. Only you can decide this.

And now onto one of the most difficult dilemmas of college life, balancing academics and a social life. Well, to be honest, there is no one answer to this, because everyone is difference. Some people can ace exams with only a night's worth of studying, others need weeks of studying just to barely pass (that’s me right there). The big question of which is more important, a social life, or your career can be a huge stress inducer in college. Of course school work is the most important we will all think at first. Grades grades grades! That’s why we went to college right?? Wait… but what about the “college experience”? And making friends? And creating memories? Aren’t these supposed to be the best four years of my LIFE?? What if I am not actually enjoying myself? What if I really am spending too much time studying and not enough time enjoying life? I mean you only get four years and you will never relive them again! 

And so you see, this can be quite the issue. And here is my best advice. Combine them. Yup. Plenty of disciplines and major fields in college have clubs and activities attached to them. Go to lectures with people from your classes. Go to career mixers related to your field. Try making friends with people in your classes, etc. A social life doesn’t have to revolve around just going out and randomly finding parties. You can hang out with people who share your academic interests and in the process encourage one another to succeed. Trust me, my science major friends always party together. They have crazy fun and also do crazy good research.

As far as choosing a major? Oh boy this is a hard one. Mainly because there is no real answer to the conflict of what you love to study vs. what you should study. My best advice here is to think about what kind of degree you would love to say you have. Try this. Think of yourself maybe 5 or 10 years out of college at a party with other professionals, and someone asks you. “Oh what did you study in college?” What would you like to answer to them? What would you feel proud of having earned a degree in? Think about it for a bit, and realize you can start working towards that right now. As far as what is a good degree to pursue, well that doesn’t really matter. I am a firm believer that NO major is superior to any other major. You can excel at ANY major. Don’t let anyone tell you that you chose a “party major” or your major isn’t actually a “real” major. If you are passionate about it, stick to it, take every opportunity that comes with it, take any internship you can that comes with it, learn everything you can about it, and then see who comes out on top. As for what to DO with that degree? Well as someone who is having trouble trying to find out what to do with their degree, and is having great difficulty with it is well… I wasn’t prepared. I chose my major on a whim because I didn’t know what else to do. Please don’t do this. This is not a good way to choose a major. This is why I believe it is CRUCIAL to explore all you can freshman year. Talk to other students. Look at those bulletin boards you see around campus. See any cool study abroad opportunities? Any cool fellowships or internships? What fields are they in? What field makes you say wow that’s pretty cool! What field makes you think wow those people seem so smart! What field makes you say to yourself, wow I would love to be in that field! That is a good starting place. As for jobs after college, research what you can actually do with such a degree, and if the names of possible positions sound good to you, then awesome! You might have figured out a potential path!

So that’s all I have time to jot down for now. I hope it wasn’t too long. I just wanted to share this with people here. I apologize if my writing seems a bit sloppy and doesn’t reflect that I have a college degree, but honestly I am so tired of writing professional sounding cover letters that I just wanted to write this as it came into my head. I hope this helps new students with adjusting to your college life. I realize my words will not apply to everyone, but I hope people gain at least a little something from them. Don’t feel pressured to live college any one way. It’s your four years to make of it what you wish. Oh and also take some risks. Sit next to that group at the dining hall, raise your hand in that GE class, and talk to that cute girl who sits in the front of the lecture hall. Just do it. Take note of something she said during lecture and then ask her about it after class. Trust me. Take the risk. Don’t be me and sit at home 4 years later wondering why you never took the chance and what could have come. 

And so I wish you well in college and hope you have a successful experience whether you haven’t started yet, or already have. You will be bombarded with new influences and perspectives, and this is all great. But remember to always be true to yourself. I made so many mistakes in college that I wish I could do over. What I would give to start those four years all over again. I chose a major on a whim, largely just followed my dorm mates in whatever they thought was cool and followed them to whatever parties they knew of, and was always too shy to talk to that cute girl in my class.
To me the most important lesson is to just be yourself. No really. I know you probably hear it all the time and it sounds corny, but it’s true. Even if you are shy and introverted like me, people might just like you for it :)

I was pretty lukewarm most of my life, then I dated a girl and she got me into it, then I went to another state on an internship and decided to get involved in the local youth group as a mentor of sorts.  The kids loved me to death and they were great kids.  It made for a great summer and some great memories.  I've since left the church.  I'm not really here to discuss that but it's probably relevant.  I asked myself why I believed in God and I realized that the best answer I had was because my parents told me to.  In retrospect, it was a long time coming.  Anyway, I've got this group of kids that I'm a role model for and now I'm not sure that I can responsibly continue doing that.  It's not that I've seen them at all since this happened, but I've got a few of them on facebook and another sent me a friend request the other day.  They're all ""restricted"" so they can't see anything and I'm basically maintaining radio silence because I don't know what to do.  Interacting with these kids in the first place, I signed an agreement to exemplify catholicism etc. but they're 18 now so that doesn't really count.  Even so, I feel like not doing anything alienates them while reaching out feels like denying their faith (not something I'm really looking to do).  What do you think about it?"

2xs1vr,4,2015-03-03,Need (career) advice about my current situation as the IT guy in an educational institution in Eastern Europe,CheekusBreekus,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2xs1vr/need_career_advice_about_my_current_situation_as/,"Another career post, yup. Though I think mine is a bit more different because of work practices in Eastern Europe and my general situation, so here we go.

My situation is quite shit in large part due to my absolute lack of experience. I'm currently employed at my first job - the sysadmin at the IT department of an Eastern European university, top exact sciences uni in the country. I got the job offer straight after getting my bachelors. I've been working for 2 years, part time.
At first it was hell - I had absolutely no experience and during my studies I learned next to nothing about sysadmin tasks. This was my first experience with both Windows servers, Linux servers, setting up and maintaining all kinds of application and web servers used for educational purposes (got thrown head first into setting up and configuring Microsoft Sharepoint and Dynamics ax), advanced networks (those fancy industry grade routers, nuohmygod) Part time turned into pretty much full time, it's just that I was working days on end from home. During the first year it stabilized - I learned to manage all of my work in a more or less timely fashion (new software was the exception sometimes), but I was burned out as fuck.

At that point my part time salary was 280 EUR with no raise in sight. I also started getting shit from a single higher-up colleague about me coming in late/leaving early. The habit developed because of my overtime from home - I could manage it all a lot more efficiently from my home and was always there in person when it was required, no matter the time of day. Still, it was true that I didn't come to work at 9 at didn't leave at 5, I came after 10 and left shortly after 4. After having had the talk with said colleague, I'm now working 9-5, 2 times per week with whatever extra work is required from home.

Said colleague (and higher ups, to whom I talked about this later on) straight up said, that I shouldn’t be surprised if they let me go if ,when I finish my masters, I don’t go straight for the PhD. If I’m not into science, I’m a waste of resources for them. We’ve also hired a 2nd trainee sysadmin, the guy is even greener than me, but I assume that he’s supposed to learn from me and eventually replace me when I’m let go. (they assume that I won’t go for the PhD. I’m a good student, one of the top ones, but definitely not the Star student that they assume would want to get into science) The thing is, I’m really not sure where I stand. I’m gonna have my masters degree in IT in 9 or so months, so I still have time. Everything that I’ve learned – I’ve learned by myself. No tutoring, no nothing, just google-fu. Granted, the knowledge I’ve gained in these ~2 years is immense. Pretty much going from 0 to being able to handle my whole department in a timely fashion is a huge deal to me. Of course, it’s nowhere near a perfect sysadmin environment. Security and performance were never big concerns – getting shit done on time was, so I never learned any good practices in relation to that. The fact that we use loads of different software made it so that my primary concern was to get it all up and running without any issues, but I didn’t really have the time to delve inside any of those specific systems and set them up flawlessly, good practices were at least partially ignored. So here I am. I’ve started slowly considering my options. I’ve already sent my application to a small IT company that was interested in taking me in before I got the lucrative offer to work at my university 2 years ago, but for now all they can offer me is a free internship, but I really didn’t spend 6 years studying IT for this shit. 

Of course, there’s also an option of getting my PhD and doing, as they call it here, science, but I’m not sure if that’s what I want to do at all. The environment isn't terrible, but it’s definitely not friendly. Everyone seems to consider themselves a big time scientist with everyone else without a PhD being a dumbass code monkey/PC repair guy. 

In the end – it could be worse, but it could be loads better and since I’ve never changed workplaces, I just hope for some advice. Also I needed to vent, thanks.

So, I seem to have a lot of difficulty getting job offers.  I don't have much trouble getting an interview, but I often hit a wall after the interview and get declined.  

Here's a bit about me: 

- I go to a school ranked #10 in the nation for my program (Marketing Bachelor's)
- I have a 3.85 GPA
- I have great internship experience as a Marketing Consultant Intern
- I have many other related work and volunteer experiences
- I'm involved in extracurriculars related to my major
- I've had people in my school's career center and company recruiters look at my resume and they said it's amazing
- I've done multiple mock interviews and was told I did a fantastic job
- I have extensive training and knowledge on what to do in recruiting (thank you emails, follow-ups, what to say, how to sell yourself, how to answer interview questions, etc.)
- Personality-wise, the words others most use to describe me are: sincere, intellectually curious, determined, intelligent, driven, and conscientious (and I often get complimented on one or more of those in an interview)

Despite all of this, I haven't gotten a single job offer across 20 or so interviews. Every person I know is shocked by this. My friends, my family, my professors, people in the career center, etc. They all say I'll do incredibly well and be super successful, landing some great well-paying job out of college.  It's creating a ton of pressure on me when everyone I know has such high expectations of me and I keep failing.  I'm getting to the point where I'm losing hope because, as far as I know, I'm doing everything right, I'm doing everything I should be doing, but it's not working and I don't know how to fix it.

I perfectly aware that at my age I shouldn't be worrying about what will be 20 years down the road and the main thing should be finishing college. I wasn't big on high school and my first semester ( fall 2014) I managed to get a 3.8 GPA, which I'm trying to upkeep ( probably will drop a few points this semester because of a bs prof). 

Anyway, I have a lot of choices in terms of career and I'm very lucky to have them but for some reason I feel so incomplete. In reality I'm not doing anything and it's making me really anxious.

On Jan 1, I left to Russia for a week because I needed a change of routine for a little bit and I met a girl there ( daughter of my aunt's best friend) and I fell in love. I ended up staying there 10 extra days because of her and now I'm returning there at the end of this month.

I've decided to start my adult life since returning ( working, financial planning etc) but I can't seem to establish myself, I'm not sure what I want exactly. I'm going for a BS degree in Accounting but I'm just doing it for the versatility of it.

My current school schedule is tues/thurs 8-2 and fri 9am-12pm so I have a lot of free time but the problem is I always feel like I don't have enough time to do things. 

I work for a company as a personnel administrator and make $200 a month ( startup company by college students ). It literally requires me to work a few hours a week but still I feel so loaded from it because I have to work about two hours on campus but I don't wanna stay in school after school.

I also work for my mom sometimes doing clerical work whenever she asks but I don't really like doing it because I don't know what it's for ( I feel pretty left out ( It's a family business) )

My brother's wife is offering me an internship at a company she works at which would probably look good on my resume, but I want to spend 2/3 of my summer in Russia and intern in August.

In September I will take courses @ H&amp;R block to become a tax specialist to do income taxes for people and make some $ on the side and get experience. 

Also my brother told me he will teach me how to fix cars so I can buy broken ones and fix em for profit. Currently I'm searching craigslist for such and he tells me whether they're worth buying or not for flipping.

Now with all that background ( sorry for sloppy formatting, this is my first time with this) I ask you Reddit, what should I do?

I don't know how to find a niche except for just doing random things but the problem is, I feel so busy when I'm actually not, which provokes me to go home and ""relax"" because I feel like I won't get the chance to later.

I want to set myself up so that I can make money anywhere ( incase I move to Russia when it's time to start a family (I'm that confident that I'll be staying with this girl for a long time ( not being cliche, just seriously took a lot of thought, spoke to my family about it,she's just the best )))

What should I do as of right now? I started saving money up but it seems like I'm not spending any money at all. Yesterday I accidentally broke a sprayer nozzle from my car. It cost me $15 to buy a replacement and I was anxious throughout the whole day because of it.

My skills include : computers ( I know how to build em ( but who doesn't really), 110 WPM, fast learner, able to communicate well with others 

I'm pretty sure I have more skills, I just don't know how to classify them.

Once again, sorry for the sloppy format.

I'm very anxious and I would like a path or some incite on what I can do in the near future to set myself up for the future.

I want to move from this position because these positions pay more and advertise more opportunities where I can use and advance my programming skills (the main thing I'm looking for), and their offices are more conveniently located. While the current job I work at is great, I feel like I've settled in a little bit and I have run out of more programming-oriented projects to work on (my boss has done a great job of helping me come up with some projects to lead). 

I was wondering if alternating jobs in short periods of time looks bad on a resume. I've been at my current job for about 7 months now and my last job I worked at for a year before moving. I left the first job because it was purely IT help desk support and I was more of a ""to be seen and not heard"" type of employee.

I know I should just be trying to get an internship but I have been having some trouble since I haven't taken Algorithms yet so I have not been doing as well as I want to on technical questions. As a result, the only offers I have gotten are for internships geared more towards consulting and analytics. 

I am currently saving up money and will be continuing to do so in order to not work and have more free time for independent projects,etc next fall/spring semester.

- I have been upfront with potential employers about this but I do not give specific company names to anyone.


Since last fall I have applied to about a hundred job postings and had interviews with about 12 different companies. Some of them I got eliminated immediately some of them I didn't. I originally interviewed with Company A in December/January. I went through two rounds of interviews with them and they both went very well I thought. Then I didn't hear back from them for awhile.

Yesterday, Company A called me with an official offer. On this end it felt very ""out of the blue"" to receive that offer. I had assumed that they had filled the position with someone else. I asked for some time to think about it, and to email me the paperwork. Company A's HR gave me until the 3rd week of March to accept the offer in writing.

All in all Company A is a great opportunity, but personally I would like to work for Company B more. Company A is giving me a summer position only. The position I'm interviewing for at Company B is more long term. (1 year, full-time summer, part-time during school year.) Company B also is known to convert their interns to full-time employees while Company A is not known for that.

Do I approach Company B and tell them I've received an offer but I am still interested in their position? Would it seem rude to tell them that I have an offer from somewhere else? What I am most worried about is that Company B will drag out their interviewing process past the 3rd week of March. If I come up on the deadline of this offer with nothing back from Company B I will accept the offer from Company A. My financial situation kind of dictates that."

I want to keep it short and simple, and I hope you guys have some suggestions. 

I’m an intern at a production organisation. They asked me to map all processes in the firm, using process modelling. Which is going fairly well.

Now, we want those processes online, where employees can access them and it’s clear for everyone where the responsibility lies and there is something to fall back on. We want it in three layers where you can click on a task (within a process model)  which will open a new window/layer with another process model. See the link below for an example.

Now I would love to get some suggestions from you guys how we could do that. We will probably want it on a platform like Intranet/Sharepoint or whatever. I'm no tech so I have no idea how we can do it. I have a meeting with ICT tomorrow.

Cutting to the chase, I have the repo for their website (Angular) cloned on my machine. So I can make code changes, do whatever git stuff I have to do and that's all fine.  I was also setup with a remote dev environment where I can ssh onto the server and navigate to my  own personal folder /my_name. All the devs have their own personal directory like this. The directory contains another copy of the website repo with git and all that. The files on this server are hosted on a private site 'https:my_name/serverURL.com' All changes I make to code on the server can be seen at this address. 

My question is, what should my workflow be?  I would prefer to work on the local copies on my machine and make all git commands locally, but then I won't be able to test and watch 'https:my_name/serverURL.com' to see my changes. I could get a plugin to automatically push my local changes to remote but then wouldn't I also have to switch the remote git branch to correspond to whatever local branch I'm on?

From talks around me i understand that Erasmus program is some kind of party time then you can have fun from the EU budget (free money - all needs covered), make friends go to see another country, culture and don't bother to much about studies for short period of time.

Thing is I don't really care about meeting new people or seeing new country, culture at present. More important for me is IT knowledge in theory and practice. No time for funny time as I already wasted a lot of it with video games and now sometimes struggling (i.e. English language).

So, have you been in this Erasmus program and maybe could share your experience ? is it worth if i don't want/can't to socialize with beer and people (no offense) but rather to work/study and gain experience in IT?
The choice is complicated by the fact that i just finished one internship and was offered part-time job which is perfect for my studies. If i go to Erasmus, i most probably will lost a perfect part-time job opportunity.

I know it sounds lousy question, but i really care about the time i do have; don't want to waste it for entertainment. So was you participating in any Erasmus program and could you share your experience as IT guy. Any advice is welcome.

First job I had during law school was an internship with district attorney's office and my mentor was a real by-the-books, bulldog attorney, a really talented lady and a total ballbuster. So one of my first job is doing the Informations where basically I have to ""inform"" the criminal defendants of the charges against them. 

So they bring all the defendants from jail to the courtroom and I read the charges against them.  My mentor had trained me to read *everything* in the information completely and in its entirety. So the defendants are sitting on the bench, orange jumpsuits, handcuffs, all together and I read the first guys stuff. 

""Burglary, conspiracy blah blah blah."" Second guy, ""petty theft, receiving stolen property blah blah blah."" Then I get to the third guy 

""Your honor, may it please the court. This is the case of the Commonwealth of Wankistan versus Mr Hicky Redneck. The changes against him are a violation of the crimes code, title 42, section 6, subsection section A.2"" Like I said, my mentor wanted me to read EVERYTHING.  My eyes scan along and then I stop. I look up at the judge, he gives me a smile because I'm a greenhorn attorney trying not to pee my pants, I look over to my mentor who gives me the 'keep going' signal, and then I look at the defendant who is wide eyed with a look of sheer horror on his face.

 So I hesitantly continue ""Incest, a felony in the 3rd degree. Specifically in that the defendant did have knowing sexual intercourse with a blood relative, his sister, an individual who suffers from mental retardation..."" I then go on to describe even more specific acts mentioned in the criminal complaint.  

I finally look up.  The judge's jaw hung 6 inches off the floor, my mentor is looking at me with a mix shock and humor and I'll never forget the look on the defendants face, a look of pure shame and the other prisoners are just staring daggers at him.

I was supposed to do things by the books but after the hearings were over my mentor pulled me aside and told me that I ""probably should have just read the statute he violated and not the actual crime."" She said his time in prison was going to be...""not very pleasant after that"".

I plan on going out to my laptop between every ""interview"" and doing a quick read on their position(s) they are looking to fill and telling the recruiters that I am interested/qualified for that internship and that way I'll be able to talk about the position and look like I'm really interested.  

Is there anything else I should do to prepare?
Any tips for while I'm there?

My only downfall is my GPA, which isn't too bad (i hope).  It's 2.8.. is that a big problem?  I feel as if it's not a big deal because I am so busy with other things while in school. I'm in two engineering groups ASME and ASHRAE.  I'm working on a community sustainability project through ASHRAE.  I'm in a fraternity, on a hockey team, and have always worked at least one job.

Thanks for the help!  Any thoughts are appreciated."

&amp;nbsp;


On my resume I list the following as my expertise:

• Onboarding
• Talent Acquisition
• Employee Performance Reviews
• Social Media Branding
• Vendor Relationships
• Training
• Payroll

&amp;nbsp;

But these ultimately don't explain what I want to do in life. During my lay off I've been thinking. A lot.   


&amp;nbsp;

Ultimately what I've decided is that I really enjoy helping people. Motivating people. Telling people that they DO have a purpose. Helping people work through their problems and help them down a path to success. The issue is I've helped many friends/cousins/etc try to figure out ways to be happy, but I haven't sat back and looked at my own situation.

&amp;nbsp;


I'll stop rambling now and get to a list of what I enjoy that may narrow down a career:


- Sports 
- Lifting Weights / Sports Training
- Running
- Working with kids (used to work at summer camps and LOVED it) 
- Working with sales/forecasting
- Basic IT work (I am ""good with technology"" I guess is the common way to word this)
- Working with Social Media (while with Compass Group I ran their IG/Twitter for the East Coast)
- Motivating people (I've been told I should be a motivational speaker, but what basis do I have for that?)

**tl;dr - I've worked my whole life in food service rising through the ranks all the way to a Director position at a corporate cafeteria, but I've never enjoyed it. I need help finding a new career path with things I actually enjoy, not just what I've done my whole life.** 






&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


Life Background / What lead to this:

&amp;nbsp;


I'm 25 years old - I graduated from Penn State University. My whole life I have worked in food service from the age of 15 working as a dishwasher, moved to bus boy, eventually working on the line as a cook, and spending time as a waiter (typical restaurant story). I enjoyed aspects of the job, but never really was happy. I did this all through High School and when it was time to move onto college I naturally selected a major that I was comfortable with - Hotel &amp; Restaurant Management.

I never really thought about what opportunities it would lead to or the life I would have to live post college. I went through my schooling (Penn State University) and finished with a 3.4 GPA while completing multiple internships with ARAMARK (large company in Food Service). Post college I was offered many positions within food service, but because all of my friends/family/etc worked typical M-F, 9-5 jobs I chose to enter Business Dining - aka serving food to people at corporate locations Monday through Friday. 

I joined a company, Compass Group, and did business dining for 3 years post college and was NEVER happy. The hours were long (typically 10-12 a day) and the environment constantly reminded me of my High School job that I never really liked. I was promoted 2 separate times (held 3 positions in my 3 years with the Company). My final position I finally had my own cafeteria that I was running - from the kitchen, to the marketing, the the sales, accounting, management, etc...but I was thrown into a fire (insert lame Food Service joke here). The guy hiring me knew the cafe would close within a year as our client was planning on making major cuts to their blue collar division (the people I served). Whenever times got tough he'd tell me ""Don't worry, I've got big plans for you!"" This always kept me motivated as I thought there would be a light at the end of the tunnel...turns out my cafe was closed and my boss forced me into a catering/management role in a larger cafe. Most people would think ""wow, great!"" but at this point I was beaten down with long hours and a low salary. The new position would offer no bump in pay. I declined the position. My boss was furious (I believe me taking this role was his plan all along, but it was never discussed). He threatened to fire me if I did not take the position and I saw no other option but to seek help from Human Resources. After a 2-3 month dispute where I was forced to work ridiculous hours at random locations throughout the state I was finally laid off (unexpectedly). It was ultimately a blessing in disguise. I can now choose something I will actually enjoy doing. I won't have to wake up every morning at 4:00am and think ""what am I doing with my life?"" "

[Do you guys get a chance to enjoy the festival after your work is done? If so, what's your favorite aspect of Bonnaroo as an attendee?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xygej/we_are_jonathan_mayers_and_kerry_black_cofounders/cp4kzy8?context=5)|For many years it was rare that we got to enjoy but these days we get to check out more stuff. My favorite things are the smaller special parties like the parades (especially the one which ended w Portugal The Man playing our Mr T float) and more recently the ROBE RAGE. -KB.
 |One of my favorite aspects of the Festival is the week leading up during the build.  Watching projects, that we've worked on for a long time, come to life.
 |Love being on the farm and hanging with the team..some of my closet friends.
 |JM.

Each year we try and raise the bar and with that comes increased expenses.
 |The increasing number of festivals has created more competition for talent which increases talent fees.

[Given the recent increase in smaller, more genre-specific festivals that may be less expensive or less difficult to travel to, how do you see Bonnaroo competing for attendees in the future? Do you plan to transition to a more genre-specific event, or do you think the gestalt of Bonnaroo will continue to draw attendance despite arguments that your focus is too diverse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2xygej/we_are_jonathan_mayers_and_kerry_black_cofounders/cp4lfer?context=5)|We're going to continue to invest and raise the bar each year.  Lots of focus is being put into the overall experience….from on-site accommodations to art installations to immersive theatre.

2xz283,0,2015-03-04,Recommended IT Career Paths?,CoolJBAD,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2xz283/recommended_it_career_paths/,"Is there any kind of resource that has recommended IT career paths laid out?

I know with Cisco, you have the ability to move up to higher level certs and different types of Cisco certs, but for general IT is there such a thing?

Example: 

Becoming a Windows Admin

* Course/Basic understanding of General IT
 * Understanding the Internet Standards
 * Understanding OSI Model
 * Basic Computer Functions
 * Basic Hardware Repair
 * Basic Network &amp; Security




* Optional Certifications - CompTIA A+
* Working with various MS Operating Systems
 * Use of Win 7, 8.1 + Servers
 * Use of MS Virtual Academy/Dreamspark (if student)
 * Use of other resources for MS information
 * Setup Lap Environment

* Learn basic scripting
 * Python or Perl (Optional)
 * Learn Basic Windows Shell/Bach Scripting
 * Learn Basic Scripting 

* Gain real world experience (internship, computer repair for friends, etc)
* Get Certified with MS Basic Certifications for Desktop and Server Operating Systems

Something along these lines but for various areas of IT? I have a younger brother who wants to get into IT, and asked how I did it. I was rather unstructured and learned a lot on my own. 

Hell, these past two months I've learned how to set up a Hyper-V Server with multiple VMs. A few weeks ago, I created a VM, set up a 2012 box for 802.1x/RADIUS authentication, reissued a 3rd party cert, logged into our WLC to re-point everything. Last night I created a print server, installed/customized printers, deployed via GPO, figured out how a KIX script from the previous consultancy worked, and made it delete the old printers on logon.

I have never had any experience with any of those things. It just took some really late nights, lots of reading, some trial and error, and a boss that somehow lets me get away with this shit. But that's the thing. I have a job that allows me to learn more and I got it by sheer luck and curiosity.

My brother is 5 years younger than me, but at 19, he hasn't applied for college as no one else in our family has been able to go. (Our family has had a lot of financial issues).

I'm hoping that if I can help lay down a foundation for him, maybe it will give him a boost in the right direction."

I've hit a wall and after a lot of thought, I'm pretty sure I want to switch to IT. I've never been a particularly strong math student and after taking half a semester of Discrete Structures, I'm thinking that this isn't for me. I definitely think I'm pussying out here and that I could complete the degree, but I don't want to jeopardize my scholarship failing classes or scraping by with Cs. 

Ultimately, I'd like to write code when I graduate. I love programming -- I've got high As in OOP and CS1, but I have no interest in becoming a scientist. 

I think there's quite a few people who have made this switch for similar reasons, and I'd like to know how it worked out for you. Am I really shooting myself in the foot by switching, or will I be okay if I continue working on personal projects and getting internships while pursuing a degree in IT? "
2xzkdm,0,2015-03-04,Standing at a cross-road in my pathetic computer science career so far,random_person7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2xzkdm/standing_at_a_crossroad_in_my_pathetic_computer/,"I had been into computers and technology since I was a little kid. I had my mind made up all along that I will have a computer science degree. Up until college, I was the guy among my friends who knew it all about electronics.I was the guy they came to for help with computers and other stuff. When my friends and I took computer science in high school, they frequently asked me for help. I knew I was never as good as I made myself out to be. In school, I would open up a hidden directory on school computer with all the student accounts shown on it and I would show the Windows explorer window to my friends and brag about the fact that I got inside the system (I didn't actually have permissions to open those user account folders, but never told them). Even when I was doing computer science, I performed poorly on tests. For projects and homework, I frequently found myself going to stackoverflow to get help.

I learned Java from that class, but if someone tested me on it and gave me a decent task, I would fail at the first step. I taught myself c#, vb, js and php but over the past 6-7 years that I have used them, I'm only intermediate in it. Despite being into programming for that long (started around 12 or 13, now 20), I don't know a single language that well or ""good enough"" at it. 

I'm a college sophomore now in a community college. Enrolled in a computer science major that is designed to be transferred. I have almost nothing to show for projects. One simple windows phone music player app, a simple basketball info site and an attempt at an operating system in vb and c# (it was really just a collection of forms and screens) way back in 6th grade. I have one internship with an extremely small company for almost one year now, which I actually have because of a personal reference and the fact that the CEO needs someone my age to help build a product so school students my age can use it. So being able to program is a very small part of why I'm there. It's because the product I'm building is for school students and because I probably can get them to the website since I'm a student too and I know what others my age like.

So basically, while others (as can be seen on this subreddit itself) are making very advanced things and getting solid internships at massive companies with a great future, I'm desperately trying to land a reasonable internship with any company (I need a change from the current company now, plus a bigger and more reputable company would look better on resume). I'm a horrible computer science student. No, I don't understand floats, signed and unsigned integers, base conversions, add-subtract-multiply-divide bits by shifting, data structures. No; I'm not good enough to have a nice and attractive github project. I don't have a long enough attention span to watch hours of lectures, I lose interest if I'm not doing anything myself.

It seems that I've finally learned that computer science was never for me. Being in a community college puts me behind most, I don't have any good side projects or good experience on my resume. My skillset is even more pathetic. Oh well, time to make the decision of whether I want to continue struggling horrifically and stay with some really low job or think in my second year of college about what I want to change my major to."

2xzta5,0,2015-03-05,Fair compensation for a contractor at an early stage startup?,jewsus-christ,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/2xzta5/fair_compensation_for_a_contractor_at_an_early/,"I'm going to be working on a startup in my free time for a friend where I'm going to be doing small development tasks, intermittent work i.e. not every week and maybe a few hours at night after I get home from my day job.

He told me to let him know what a fair compensation is and that he's willing to pay equity, cash, or a combination of both if I so desire since he's worked with me before and knows that I have a good work ethic. I told him I would let him know.

However...I'm not sure how to come up with this number so that I can start bargaining. I know roughly how much my employer pays me per hour, so I can give him (that number + 5-10%) for the cash amount, but I kind of want to take some equity in case the startup takes off, and I'm really not sure how to give myself a ""fair"" amount of equity. Am I even being fair by asking for my salary converted to hourly wage + some percent?

They had an answer for everything and it made me feel very comfortable with the company. However when I went to the 2-day training weekend, I realized how much they are selling you on the ""internship"" the entire time. They are sales people and that's really the only thing I learned from them.

When I went home for the first weekend, it was super shitty! My RC (regional consultant) was a pain in the ass. She would call me everyday and dictate what I was going to be doing until we talked again, plus she had a super annoying voice. They tell you that you have freedom to do what you want with ""your"" company, but really they get SUPER PISSED OFF if you deviate from their plan at all. Plus they want you knocking on doors at 8am on Sundays, I don't care who you are, FUCK YOU if you do that.

When I made the call to the VP of the California region, he was an asshole. Once he realized that I wasn't going to be making him any money this year, he became a fucking dick. Everything I said was SUPER offensive and he took everything the obvious wrong way. I told him that I looked up to him for being an unbelievable sales and business person, and he spit in my face. ""You don't look up to me, you are just saying that because you want to make me feel better about you leaving the internship. If you really looked up to me, you would stick with the program."" I then told him that I don't want to work for someone who treats ""ex-employees"" like that.

Every weekend, for the second semester of college, you are at home. You are bossed around by super cocky people and given very little say. Then if you have any second thoughts about the program, they spit in your face and tell you how shitty of a person you are. In retrospect, they should have told me what was expected the first day and not fucked around."

It was your average interview, a little introduction, a programming problem, and then some questions from me to him.

It was my first real programming interview, and to be honest, I was nervous as hell, but I think it actually went pretty well. The problem wasn't too difficult and as he was giving me the problem statement I immediately identified that using a HashMap would perfectly help me solve the problem.

The one thing I think I did poorly on was my test cases; literally anytime I wrote a few lines of code that could lead to a mistake the interviewer stopped me and guided me towards figuring out the problem. From what I've read, I usually heard that interviewers let you carry on coding for a bit with your mistakes, so I wasn't sure how to take that.

After I solved the problem the interviewer took some time to talk to me about the importance of thinking of your corner cases and potential inputs before you write code, so that you don't spend time after you finish polluting your code with extraneous test cases and such. Being a novice programmer, I don't think like that yet but I truly believe it's a great ideal to hold.

I'm planning on sending him a thank you email today for interviewing me, and I wanted to know if you guys think that it would be a good idea to mention my lack of testing and how the interview gave me valuable insight? Thank you!

2y12dg,5,2015-03-05,DePaul University vs University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Computer Science Programs,DePaulSenior,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2y12dg/depaul_university_vs_university_of_illinois_at/,"Hello,

I am currently a student at DePaul University but am an accounting major. My younger brother, however, is a sophomore in high school and is very interested in obtaining a computer science degree. We live in the Chicagoland area, he wants to stay close to home, and most likely will not get into University of Chicago or Northwestern, so it looks like it will come down to DePaul or UIC.

Information from DePaul says their CS graduates average starting salary last year was ~ $61,000 but I cannot find stats for UIC. I am wondering which program would be better for my brother to attend strictly based on internship and job opportunities upon graduation (ie not considering tuition). 

If anyone can shed some light on this I would really appreciate it. "
2y167f,2,2015-03-05,Deciding between two data science master's programs,datascientistwannabe,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/2y167f/deciding_between_two_data_science_masters_programs/,"So recently a lot of these ""M.S. in Data Science"" programs have been popping up, and since I want to get into the field I applied for two: 

* The first is a conventional two-year/four-semester program at a large, prestigious university. It's also in the middle of a large metropolitan area so summer internship and networking opportunities are sure to be plentiful. I've looked over the courses and spoken to one of the current students and he says the classes are very good and taught by both well-known academic researchers and industry professionals, and there's a wide selection of electives to choose from so you can gear up your coursework for your sub-field of choice. The downside here is it would cost nearly $25,000 per semester for the tuition and fees (sans room/board and living costs) with little to no opportunities for scholarships.

* The second is at a very small, virtually unknown state school. It's 15 months, but it's still four semesters if you include the summer sessions. The upside here is it also comes with an internship at a data science facility--I'd be working 20 hours a week for those 15 months and receiving a $25,000 stipend. The tuition is a lot cheaper, too--around $10,000 total. And the last thing that makes this appealing is it's a full on M.S. in Mathematics instead of a ""professional"" or ""industry"" degree, which usually aren't as good. I've spoken to a current student and he says the coursework is fairly shallow for a graduate math degree--a semester each of Analysis, Algebra, Linear Algebra, SQL, and independent study along with two semesters each of Machine Learning and Applied Statistics (no variation--if I want to specialize in business intelligence or NLP or whatnot I'd have to do that on my own time). As for the internship, he says the work is interesting and you're doing actual data science work/modeling/analysis (not really sure what that entails) and the guy in charge of it is very well respected in the data science community (ICDSE committee member). 

The other option would be to choose neither. A couple months ago I started an entry level software engineering gig that pays $20/hr, so maybe I can work my way up from there.  

So ... Any thoughts or opinions on what I should go with?"
2y16sa,3,2015-03-05,[FL]Employer did not pay me in full and on time. Payday is tommorow and I'm still waiting on the rest of the money. He is also violating intern laws. Do I have a case in court?,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2y16sa/flemployer_did_not_pay_me_in_full_and_on_time/,"I was hired a month and a half ago. We agreed to $8.50/hr or $340/week. I wasn't sure if I was hired as a wage worker or a contractor. I didn't sign any paperwork but was asked to bring my social security card and my ID. Every website I design will reward me with an extra of 30% of what the client pays him, so if I work quick enough I could get $600-$1000 per week. I was hired as a secretary and paid to answer phone calls and stuff because I did not have any design experience, but not paid to do any design training. So my hours get cut off when the office closes and training starts. I'm also on a 90 day probationary period which my performance on the job will determine whether or not I get a raise in pay.

Employer came to me one day after several secretary screw ups, and how I'm not designing sites fast enough, and stated that he's losing more money with me than making it. I made several mistakes as a secretary, and as a result I was released from the position and moved on to web design, which while I'm still an intern, won't pay hourly, but by percentage(30% per website made and sold). I don't blame him since I wasn't being very productive enough. He wanted me to make one website per day for clients, and within four hours.

During the first three weeks on the job, I was a receptionist and was paid by the hour. However, training for web design and web marketing is not paid. Normally the office closes at 6pm. There were a few instances where I had to stay as late as 9pm or 11pm to get projects done. I logged in my hours for after 6, only to be reminded that I was not paid for it because I was training.

After doing some research on internship laws, it stated that unpaid interns are not allowed to do projects that would benefit the employer. I stayed at the office until 11pm with no car or a way home without him dropping me off, which he did, and all I did was write a script for him and constructed a video for him and his website. I only just remembered this recently, and was not paid for those hours. **I don't know how I can prove that the video made was mine, and I constructed it, and the script.**

I was scheduled to be paid on the 20th, but did not get paid until the monday after, but it was half. (he said he ran out of checks or something.) I was supposed to be paid at least $640 before taxes, and he only gave me $300 in cash and stated that he'd pay the rest at the end of the week, which he did, but it was an extra $180 instead. He said as soon as the client pays him, I'll get the rest. I try to be understanding as he is a human being and he's running a small business, not some big corporate company.

I reluctantly called him yesterday while he was in a meeting, and asked to be paid the remaining amount since the next pay day is this Friday. He said he'd take care of it the next day. The next day, he was never in the office, and that is where I put my foot down and state that if he doesn't pay me by friday, I'll report him to the department of labor, and possibly sue him for damages, overtime, and transportation and IRS taxes since I can't prove that he deducted taxes out of my pay(though he asked me if I wanted to). This Friday was the next pay day, and I'm giving him until that time to pay me the remaining $200+ plus the $680, that was from orking the last two weeks, for if he fails to pay me, I'm walking out and reporting him. 

**Should I wait for the client to pay him the money? Or should I just leave now? Am I being reasonable to the employer?**

Is what he's doing illegal? Is there anything I can do about it besides just leaving, because I lost my last job for this one, and all of my money from it, and at this rate since I didn't realize he didn't take taxes off until recently, I will owe the IRS a substantial amount of money that I can't afford. I don't have working experience, or I wouldn't be in this situation. There's no company out there that wants to hire me because I have no working design experience. I've been looking for a design job for over three years, and this was the first one I got hired in.

The problem is, I was not given any paperwork to fill out other than an application. I have heard interns don't require I9s yet, some of them managed to sue companies for millions for unpaid work. So I don't have any proof that I worked for him. Actually, I talked to his secretary and she stated that the i9 form is in the mail and after 6 weeks of being on the job, no paperwork is filed.

**Do I have recourse in court? Can I sue the employer for damages? What can I do without doing something I'm going to regret?**

**TL;DR**

* Been on the job for 6 weeks as a web design intern in training and a desk receptionist. Employer did not pay the full amount from last payroll. He still owes me $200 until tommorow which he will owe me $880.

* Was informed that I will not be paid after closing hours which is considered training hours. I naively did a project thinking it was training and the employer used my work, and I was not paid for those hours. He violated internship laws because of this.

* I have no proof that he deducted taxes off my pay. So he gave me a regular check, without a payroll information for the first pay period. So as a result, I could be owing the IRS a lot of money I can't even afford.

* I have given him until tommorow to pay me the rest of the money from last payroll and the current paycheck and if I don't get anything by then, I will report him to the Department of Labor and the IRS and I will consider the possibility of suing him.

* Wants to know if I have any chance at court."

http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2xono9/i_hate_being_young_and_naive_mom_is_demanding_300/

I'm still young and I wish someone told me about things like this when I was younger so I don't run into it. But I was blinded by desperation and the fear of never getting a new job, that I didn't step back and think about things. I've been looking for a design job for over three years, and haven't ran into any of them except this one.

I'm going to take your advice but this time, give him until tommorow to give me the money he owes me from 2 weeks ago, plus the current check because tommorow is payday. If I don't get a cent by tommorow, I'm walking out of the door, reporting him to the department of labor, the IRS, and considering my option of filing a lawsuit, because he also violated internship laws by not paying me for staying outside closing hours, staying until 11pm to make a script and promotional video for him that he used on his website that he's using to get referrals and sales. I set my hours until 11pm and he said he is only paying me for office work, and after hours is training. Internship laws state that Unpaid interns must do projects that only benefit them.

And there were instances that unpaid interns filed lawsuits against their companies for not paying them to do their projects.

The only issue I have is how to muster up the courage to say that I'm not getting paid. I have this fear that I'm going to do something I'm going to regret, because he's providing me training and experience and he will mention this. I can't afford to spend potentially another year to get a new job. 

After all this. What can I do to avoid this mistake again? How do I know who is an honest businessman, and who isn't? "
2y1qed,1,2015-03-05,Nvidia vs. Nest,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2y1qed/nvidia_vs_nest/,"So I'm a third year in college with two offers for internships at both Nvidia and Nest Labs.  
I'm having an extremely hard time deciding between the two. (Salary and location are not issues here.)

At Nvidia, I'd be doing work with customizing and debugging Android kernel (essentially linux kernel).

At Nest, I'd be doing applications integrations, which is essentially integration testing for mobile apps.

On one hand, I can get more stimulating and challenging work that would give me harder-to-get experience for future jobs (I like systems, gpu-computing, and HPC and eventually would like to work for a company such as SpaceX.)

On the other hand I have a chance of getting more connections in a trending startup that also gives me Google employee status, but the job itself sounds less interesting.

My offer for Nvidia would be a returning offer. Does taking that look a lot better than jumping among different companies, since it shows consistency and that a company wants me back?   
Would the chance of getting closer to Google be worth interning at Nest?"

Background: I have previous internships as a product strategist and business consultant however halfway through my schooling I shifted to majoring in only computer science (was a double with an engineering discipline). I love coding but I also love taking big picture views of software products as a whole. I am graduating in Dec. and am cautious of not getting software development experience in the industry before graduation but honestly I love product manager descriptions. I do not, however, enjoy being stuck on excel or gantt charts all day. I don't mind working on them but I prefer something more challenging. I have a broad idea of what everyday tasks may be like but I am partially guessing at this point. I also understand PM roles at larger tech firms are not for new grads which would put me at a disadvantage to find a full time upon graduation if I did stick to PM.

My biggest worry is that I'll get my degree and lack a good position to enter the workforce. Think some miserable cubicle job doing menial coding day after day (taking your lumps is one thing, being in a dead end position is another). I'm 32 with no professional experience so I already feel very behind. My original goal was to go to school for the degree and the exposure to the different parts of computer science and work on side projects in the meantime - side projects which I believe will teach me more then anything I'll learn in a classroom. So I worry that if I focus too much on my school I'll miss out on the more important things I should be doing.

So this is where I'm at - go to the more 'prestigious' school or a more convenient one that'll let me focus on other things for the next two years.

The thing I love about coding is that your skills matter more then some pedigree in this field. Going to a mediocre school and improving my skills on the side or going to a better school that offers more opportunities (internships, etc.).

I'm a Sophomore CS major in ENG, and I want to ask other CS majors about how the life of professional CS industry is like. 
In more details, I'm a CS major who just finished two most basic CS courses : 125 and 173. I had no previous CS experiences unlike some CS majors who had interests in CS since they were young. So, I am really confused if ""only following the school curriculum"" is fine to be a professional CS person after I graduate. Well, following the school curriculum and getting good enough to graduate doesnt seem to be that difficult, but what I really worry about is that I really don't get how CS companies work and how my learnings in college will help me with it. I have no internship experiences and not really sure what the CS companies are looking for. I don't know what to focus on when I take CS courses. 

I'm sorry for making the question too vague, but this is my situation right now; my identity as a CS major is vague. 

Let me rephrase my questions:

1. I'm not sure what to focus on when I take CS courses. What will be helpful for me to be a professional CS major in the future?
2. What is a good thing to do other than just following the school curriculum to be fully prepared for working in CS industry?

And there's grace for those feelings and those days. It's okay to rest and take breaks. Self-care is important. Having a life beyond work is too. It's healthy that i'm part of something bigger than just me. i'm part of a team, and something that means a lot to a lot of people. It's a marathon, not a sprint. 
[I wanted to thank both of you because due to you guys a lot of people know more about the battles that are faced but also that there are people that WANT to help! I just had a couple questions... 1-do you think there would ever be a book of the film? 2-any advice for someone who wants help but feels depleted  when they tell someone something private?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2y2y25/we_are_jamie_tworkowski_renee_yohe_founder/cp5qu5g?context=5)|Prob not a book about the film. There's already the original TWLOHA story. Renee wrote a book called Purpose for the Pain, and my first book comes out in May. i believe she has plans to write more as well. My advice would be to keep being honest and to ask for help even when it's hard. We've heard so many stories of people's lives changing as a result of them getting professional help.

A little about me, I am a freshman in college wanting to major in Computer Science and minor in Cognitive Science. It is a little early to be looking for internships or jobs but I like to plan and I want to get a early start on forming my resume to suit this field I want to enter. After a long time spent researching into potential careers that I may be interested in, I have come to find something I feel truly passionate about.

What is this career you ask? I'll try my best to describe it.

Names I can come up with are: Computational Neuroscience, Neural Engineering

The idea of [transhumanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism) absolutely **fascinates** me! Artificial Intelligence is really neat, but [Intelligence Amplification(IA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_amplification) is really what gets me excited. The H+ YouTube series is kind of what sprouted this idea and excitement for the future of technology. Researching, and hopefully developing products in this field is my goal and I don't really have any clue on what road to start down. 

I searched around on here and couldn't find anything similar to what I was looking for but if I missed it could someone send me the link?

I found [this](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/6140418) ad by Qualcomm on Linkedin and it seems to match with my interests.

I am also interested with any kind of CS work with the brain so even careers involving AI/Robots and so on still interest me. Brain Corp jumps out to me as a great option.




What I need help with:

* I can't quite find a label/name to categorize it under, when asked by family what I want to do it ends up being some long winded explanations that end in them being more confused than when I began.
* I feel like my interest isn't quite in a field that is actively being done, meaning that it's mostly in the research stage, so I am unsure of things like where I should intern, what companies I should aspire to work for, how to even find companies hiring in this field etc.
* What language(s) (if there are any specific languages for this field) should I begin to learn on my own to better my resume?
* Since most of the work being done in this field is in research, should I go beyond a bachelor's? It appears that research work is done by people with higher levels of degree's.
* Are there other companies that you know of that are doing what I am hoping to do?



Sorry for the long post, but I'd appreciate any kind of answer to any or all of the questions, I could really use the help! Thanks in advance!

2y3hsu,6,2015-03-05,Do research assistant positions boost a resume much?,Nixonite,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2y3hsu/do_research_assistant_positions_boost_a_resume/,"Hello everyone,

Does research assistant work carry much weight when it comes to finding a job? 

My situation is that I have a low GPA but a lot of side projects (on Github). I also have a data mining research assistant gig at the math department going on right now, and I might soon join another research group in the compsci department (also regarding data mining/ machine learning). 

I love projects, I'm a very competent self-learner, but I just don't like formal schooling very much. I am considering applying for some online grad school programs for compsci in the future if I can boost my GPA from my current level of about 2.66 to somewhere near a 2.9, and I'm hoping that all of this might come into consideration for an application. 

For jobs, I know that internships carry a lot of weight as it demonstrates prior work experience, but what about research assistant positions? They seem a bit different, and I'm not sure how they are perceived **in comparison to** internships. 

Any input is greatly appreciated."
2y3n86,2,2015-03-05,"Intern, Suspect I'm the Victim of Harassment",eridax700,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/2y3n86/intern_suspect_im_the_victim_of_harassment/,"I am going to try not to make this a rant/screed, but in trying to effectively paint a picture of the situation I'm dealing with, it seems like it's sort of turning out that way. Here goes. 

I have been working for a little over a month for a mid-size accounting firm as a temp-to-hire intern. The firm employs four interns in our department, of which there are three subdivisions and numerous managers. The manager that is ""in charge"" of me and the other interns has been extremely rude to me since day one; at first I thought it was just in my head but subsequent events during the third week of work made me think differently. 

To begin with, the manager in question has been rude from the first day. She will not smile or answer questions if I direct them at her or greet her should I see her in the halls of the office, even in front of other associates or staff members. She will actively stop speaking if I greet her when she is with others or alone. We have an ""optional"" (it is not enforced but participation is ""strongly encouraged"") happy hour event each Friday with alcohol provided. The first week of our employment, we had a training meeting to answer any questions that had arisen with interns during the first week. I had been provided contradicting information from her and other staff members I asked her who we were to speak to when addressing our questions and she informed me point blank that ""there is no reason for you to be in contact with me. If the other interns can't answer your questions, your buddy should be able to. You only need to go to a manager as a last resort."" This is in direct contradiction to her later actions; she has, on numerous occasions, provided extended personal guidance and training to two of the other interns. When I have asked her verbally for something, she sends me to someone else. At our happy hour, she  would not (and will not) interact with me at this event; at the first event held when interns were present, while playing a game she told me specifically to ""stand next to me because I don't want to be on your team,"" in front of others. 

The following week, while helping the other intern with a project, she entered another team-members cubicle and began to talk very quietly about me in a mildly disparaging, but indirect, manner. When she noticed that I could hear her, she stopped speaking entirely and hurried back to her office. 

During a weekly ""training"" event, three weeks previous, she asked all participants to contribute to the meeting by sharing something. She skipped over me as she called on people; at the end of the meeting she asked if anyone else had any contributions (we were sharing computer tips) and when I asked anyone was aware of the trick I wished to share, she said, very rudely, ""Yep, everyone knows that."" After the meeting, another intern, unprompted and in private, pulled me aside expressed condolences and surprise that the manager would be so rude to me in front of the assembled staff, and that she (the other intern) was very surprised that the manager ""hated someone else as much as [the manager] hated [the other intern]."" The following week during a mandatory ""check-in lunch"" with new interns, the manager, my ""buddy"" (a tenured staff member that acts as a guide/mentor) and myself went out for lunch; during the lunch, the manager refused to speak to me or look at me, and when I addressed her directly she answered (if at all) with one word replies. Likewise, during what are supposed to be bi-weekly check-ins witih our buddy and the manager, the manager refuses, point blank, to speak to me. She will not return feedback (verb or written) on any work that I have delivered (obviously not obligated) and I am no longer being assigned work in our scheduling rubric.

Today broke the camel's back for me. The interns were given specific instructions that, while overtime is permitted, if our work has been completed for the day and we have reached the 8 hour mark, we are permitted to go home- the firm does not want us ""milking the clock"" with overtime unless we have specific projects or needs to fulfill. Numerous times over the previous few weeks I have reached the 8 hour mark one hour early, as I have not been able to take a lunch in order to finish projects in a timely manner. When I hit the 8 hour mark at 4pm (an hour early) if all my work is done, my buddy (a senior, one step below a manager) has sent me home so as to avoid me going into overtime- again, we are expressly discouraged from working overtime if not necessary. Today my buddy gave me permission to leave but asked me to check in with the manager before leaving. I went into her office and had the following conversation: 

Me- ""Hey, I have finished all my projects and I don't have any more work for the day and because I wasn't able to take a lunch, I have hit 8 hours. Should I go home or should I stay?"" 
Manager - ""Working through lunch was your choice. I would stay."" 
Me - ""Okay. I should go into and use the hour of overtime, then?"" 

At this point, the manager (she wouldn't look at me) let out a very loud and annoyed sigh and said ""I don't know, whatever. Just go. I don't have time to figure this out for you. Just go."" (That's a quote. I wrote it down). 
This worries me greatly. Though our firm has policies in place regarding the expected work day length (8 hours) and time (8am to 5pm), I have on numerous occasions worked through lunch and been given permission to leave at 4pm by my ""buddy"" so as to avoid overtime.

In general, the manager is very cliquey. She has three staff level associates with whom she is very close; they frequently get coffee together and they also are very close and very open about their relationship outside of work. They plan after-work activities together during work hours and frequently spend work time talking about things they are going to do or have done together outside of work. 

I am at something of a loss on what to do. The work environment is extremely hostile- the members of her group of friends generally do not speak to me if I address them, especially in her presence, nor will they help me or answer questions if I ask. As I mentioned, they frequently plan extracurricular events (clubbing, bar hopping, shopping trips, etc) on office time, and while one of the interns is invited, the other interns, myself included, are excluded. She also spearheads group lunch and dinner activities, but I am expressly not invited (she will skip my cube when taking orders or discussing invitations and planning for the lunch excursions). 

On the one hand, I am not at work to make friends. However, I am extremely concerned- the firm was very strong about reinforcing the notion that ""we can teach you skills but we can't teach you fit. We're more concerned about how you fit in with the firm than anything else."" The fact that this manager will not interact with me directly is undermining my ability to learn and do my job well, and it also makes me extremely uncomfortable. The fact that another person on staff would express their concern for how rude they perceived this manager to be really is distressing. What's killing me is that I suspect that this manager treats me this way because I am gay. There are no other out gay people in our region's office, but the other managers and partners in our firm have no problem with it at all. I do not make it a point to ""advertise,"" but I have spoken casually about my partner in the past- being out at work is nothing new for me. 

Our firm does, unsurprisingly, have a non-discrimination policy in place that covers sexual orientation (and so does our state and city, I believe). Likewise, they have a code of behavior and conduct that explicitly prohibits unprofessional behavior. I am just at something of a loss as to what to do about this situation, however. I am now actively seeking employment elsewhere, but I am afraid from this last interaction we had that she will try to punish me in some way for this behavior.

Furthermore, I'm embarrassed and now feel extremely uncomfortable. I am not entirely sure on the company policy for handling this. We operate on the west coast. I am entirely comfortable confronting her, but I am not sure what the generally advised course of action is- report her? Do I report her for being rude or because I think she is treating me this way because I'm gay? Confront her? Talk to another manager? 

I know this was long but thanx for the time. 

Edit - I was a bit flustered when I wrote this yesterday and realize I didn't clarify my reason for posting. I understand that I ""harassment"" has a specific meaning, but was at a loss for the wording to use. I also understand that she has not done anything to indicate overtly that she is rude to me because of my sexual orientation. My question here is:

- What is the ""safest""/preferred course of action to get the behavior to stop?

I don't really care about her behavior personally; it's annoying, yeah, but life is annoying. However, I need the behavior to stop, not because it's embarrassing but because she is actually making it difficult for me to do my job and I am increasingly concerned I am making decisions that may be against firm policy at best and possibly creating liability issues for the firm at worst. I have been concerned about making certain decisions that might put the firm at risk. Her refusal to interact with me- she is technically my supervisor- has more than once put me in a position where I am unable to select and/or verify that I have selected an acceptable course of action due to conflicting information that has been given us regarding company policies and procedures. She is also, frequently, the only available resource to resolve these questions and she is the designated person to whom we have been directed to take these questions. In the absence of communication with her, I am frequently left having to make decisions that are of questionable value or done on the questionable authority of her subordinates and thus may expose me and/or the firm to liability.

Sales and helping people solve problems have been my interests since I began my career.  I have a solution-oriented mindset that drives me to find ways to run systems more efficiently and to help find ways to simplify tasks.  My joy in sales comes from finding the right people for the right product and helping someone make their life worry free.  
As a candidate, the following is what I will immediately bring to the table.

An effective sales leader: In my current role I consistently push our sales team to exceed sales goals and be ranked among the best in the Northeast. I achieved this goal by putting together weekly sales competitions, developing employee word-paths, and bringing a positive energy everyday to work. I was also able to showcase my sales abilities in my previous role by being a leader in overall sales and fleet growth.

A disciplined customer service guru: I have always displayed a careful approach to driving customer satisfaction by putting myself in my customer’s shoes. In all three of my previous roles I frequently lead a team to receive excellent customer satisfaction ratings. In addition, I had the opportunity to lead a team that earned the best-rated customer service on the globe, which further shows my dedication to ascertaining complete satisfaction.

A passionate problem solver: My roles in my pervious internships and career positions have all been driven by my keen interest in helping systems run smoothly and helping people solve problems. Even as a college athlete, I made sure to dedicate part of my day reflecting on how I can make the team better. It is this passion that has driven all of my career decisions thus far.

I look forward to contributing my skills and experiences to any opening within your organization and hope to have the opportunity to speak with you further about how I can be an asset to your team. You can reach me via PM

They're holding undergrads hostage even though the school already offered them a pay raise, what a bunch of selfish whiners."" You need an equally compelling (and short) message to counter this, not a 10 page defense based on misleading numbers and half-truths.


&amp;nbsp;


Biggest problems I see right now:

* **Your messages are too long** , people don't want nuance, they want snappy one liners like ""grad students are students, not full time workers"" or ""you're hurting the undergrads""
* **Your messages are not polished**, all grad students should have a 30 second elevator pitch and the *same* talking points about the strike, and it should hammer home the same theme every time. The poverty line argument is a good start, follow up strong
* **You don't have a human face**, gay rights activists learned this in the states, you need to make the debate more human (not %students live on $15,000, but meet so-and-so who came to Toronto and only has $15,000 and now her life sucks)
* **You need to make your arguments digestable**, nobody knows what graduate students do or what research is, make a simple analogy like apprenticeship or internship to explain to the average joe why you're not a student and should be paid. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/2xslcc/educate_me_please_on_the_ta_strike/cp351f6) is a good start
* **You let U of T dictate the debate**, then you get bogged down on the defensive, it's always ""U of T said this, but this is the truth"". Don't let that happened, you think Rob Ford spends all his time defending himself? Stick to *your* message


&amp;nbsp;


The union need to address the following in **1-3 sentences** each and make sure you're all are on the same page:

* What the hell do you guys want exactly? (e.g. peg the stipend to inflation is an easy sell, we want $8000 per person is not)
* Why does the poverty line apply? You're working part time.
* I thought the school already offered you a raise? Why are you still complaining?
* You should pay for an education and degree, not get paid to go to school
* If you can't pay for it, don't go to grad school, get another part time job like undergrads, or take out a loan like law or med students
* You're selfishly holding undergrads hostage! Why don't you strike on research instead?
* Your pickets are ruining my day
* People are scabbing, you guys will crack any time now


You guys seriously need some PR consultants, 5000 people saying different things is not conducive to an effective campaign. Good luck guys, I'm rooting for you."
2y5nu6,5,2015-03-06,Help picking between three internship offers...?,internthrowawaythrow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2y5nu6/help_picking_between_three_internship_offers/,"Hi. Looking for advice picking an offer between three companies. This is going to be my first internship (I'm a sophomore) so I'm actually not really sure what criteria I should be looking for.

1) Local corporate branch of massive bank. I'd be one of only a few interns there. Very unclear what work I'd actually be doing, but they promised me very individualized mentoring and it's close to home. Friend worked here last summer and said it was a little dry and the projects weren't very exciting. Pay is also a little lower than the other two. 

Edit: Forgot to mention why I'm even considering this one. They said that I'd be basically guaranteed an internship there every summer until I graduate, with a likely job offer at the end. Because I'm not looking to relocate immediately after graduation, I would be more likely to work here after graduation than the other two.

2) Huge tech company primarily known for hardware but trying to expand their software focus lately. Recruiter and interviewer assured me that I would be coding and in a technical role, but they don't have any of their projects planned out yet and can't tell anything about what I'd be doing. Huge internship program with a lot of fun opportunities, very structured, household tech name. Unfortunately the uncertainty means that I could be doing anything from software development to more general IT work where I barely lay down any code. The plans won't be finalized until well after the deadlines for acceptance. Recruitment process was also easy to the point where it seems like a red flag. Awesome location and housing provided.

3) Huge financial/insurance institution. Would definitely be doing software development. Long recruitment process, company flew us out and wined and dined us. Definitely care about interns. Very large intern class as well. Company has awesome work culture and is consistently cited as one of the best workplaces in America. However, name recognition is much lower than the other companies (average person would probably perceive it as less prestigious), and the location is far less preferable than the other two. Housing is provided.

Thank you!"

2.  Do top companies have a lot of automation tools for me to work on?


3. Did they already reject me from software? Would it be worth it to ask to be put into the Software pool? (I plan on using the QA internship to negotiate salary at other companies if the internship ends up being more manual than automation, so I don't want to completely burn the bridge)"

I mean I didn't really want to do engineering; I wanted to go few take classes and see where I fit in and decide on a major but my parents pressured me into getting into engineering same stuff like ""you're meant to be engineering"", ""you're good at math, go for engineering"", ""engineering gives good pay, go for it""...etc. I couldn't really take it anymore and I asked my dad if I could change my major two years ago and he angrily said ""why are you trying to change your all of sudden"" and I ended up sticking with engineering. Due to this, I had depression with no internship and currently only gpa of 2.4 (I even had to go see mental counselor).

I guess most of you will tell me to just graduate since I got less than a year left, but how am I suppose to get a job at this rate. All I've been doing these years is just keep having faith and telling myself ""just hold it in, it'll get better, keep it up"". Well, it's not working out at all.

I also have a post on salary negotiation for new grads in tech, as well as some more generic finance posts like how to handle taxes and credit scores. I have a lot more planned, like 401k advice, how to budget while at internships, etc., but I wanted to hear from you.

I've already secured a job at a company in the Bay Area for the first 4 months. However because they won't guarantee a position for the full 8 months, I am looking to do an internship at another company. I have a few offers from this term that I can defer to September to December. I've already done an internship in SF and I am already going back to the Bay Area. So for my last 4 months I'd like to go somewhere else.


&amp;nbsp;



These are my options:

* Amazon in Seattle, NYC, or Boston
* Mid-sized startup in NYC
* Startup in SF
* Find an internship in Canada
* Possibly extend the internship at first company towards the end of the first 4 months (Bay Area)


&amp;nbsp;



I've heard very mixed things about Amazon and I've heard that the experience largely depends on the team. Because this is so far in advance, it's hard to tell which teams need interns for Fall. For anyone who has been to Seattle or NYC, I'm wondering if you could explain the pros and cons of each?

2y69c1,9,2015-03-06,TIFU by using distilled vinegar to clean my desk at work and causing an evacuation and emergency response to show up,kalitarios,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2y69c1/tifu_by_using_distilled_vinegar_to_clean_my_desk/,"A good friend of mine showed me the power of distilled vinegar for cleaning.  It's eco-friendly, inexpensive and safe.

Today I decided to clean all surfaces of my desk and telephone, monitor stands and the front of my desk cabinets.  I work in a cube farm, but have a window seat as I'm in the corner against the wall.

The size of the room here is about 2000 square feet of open space, with a massive cube farm setup.  Mostly women from accounting (billing, finance, etc) and a few sales managers.

I finish my lunch, and proceed to clean it all off.  I bust out a cloth to wipe down the dust, and then a Magic Eraser and scrub the scuff marks off the desk and cabinet fronts.  I then took a spray bottle of white distilled vinegar and sprayed a new magic eraser with it and proceeded to re-scrub every surface.  Finally I used a damp towel to wipe the desk down.

Everything looked clean and smelled like a salad so I smiled and put the items back on my desk, one at a time, wiping them all off with the damp rag.  I proceed to continue working.

I work with headphones on, because we do a lot in Lync and remote desktop work, so I'm in contact with users.

Fast forward about an hour and I get an email from my boss asking why the hazmat trucj showed up on an emergency call.  He wanted me to call the main number back so I hit CTRL-P to print the email out and walked over to the printer.

As I got closer there was a bunch of people all upset, rubbing their eyes, someone was holding their head as if they had fallen down.  The facilities manager was standing there with one of the response members and a clipboard.

I pick up my document off the printer and joking ask ""Did someone break something?"" and got glares from basically everyone.

""There's something wrong, I need you to lock your computer and get your coat.  We have to evacuate.  In fact, everyone here stop what you're doing, lock your workstations and let's evacuate.""

Fast forward 15 minutes.  We're standing outside now, in 30 degree weather with people complaining, the HVAC guys and the hazmat truck belching diesel fumes into the air.

I didn't see my boss so I walked over to the facilities manager and asked again.

""Something spilled, we can't identify it, but people are complaining of headaches and someone said they were feeling dizzy and hit her head on the support column in the middle of the room.""

""What did it smell like?"" I asked, honestly curious as to what was going on.

""It smells like... I dunno, cleaners or processed food... almost like a big salad."" - a light bulb goes on in my head.

""Like vinegar?"" I asked him.

""Yeah, like vinegar. Why?""

""I used it like... an *hour* ago to wipe my desk down.  I don't like to use chemical cleaners on my equipment and desk.""

I immediately get eye rolls and groans.  The word traveled quickly around the 60-something pack of middle managers, accountants and interns.

""Well it gave me a fucking headache!"" this one woman said, as she stood there smoking and coughing.  ""You can't be using stuff like that in a workplace, I couldn't even breathe.  I had a headache and had to get out of there.""

Even more eyebrow raising was the woman who hit her coconut on the support column.  This is a 18 x 18"" brick column around a support beam in the center of the damn room.  It's in the corner of someones cube and not really in the way of the hallway.  Yet somehow she managed to get light headed and rang her own bell.

Fast forward 30 minutes later and I'm sitting in the facilities manager after everyone shuffled back in, holding the spray bottle of distilled vinegar while he looked up and logged the MSDS info for Heinz Distilled Vinegar.  He had this puss on his face like ""I don't need this shit.  I don't get paid enough.""  I scoffed.

""What?"" he asked.

""I chose to NOT use chemical cleaners because it's natural, eco-friendly and healthier than using aerosol and other cleaners.  All the stuff in the closet is bad for the environment.""

""Well we have 5 complaints and a workers comp claim from this now.  So you can't use it here anymore.""

I finally get back to my desk and there's a sticky note on my monitor with a smiley face on it.  As I log in, I have an email from my boss titled ""Not good""  Preview just showed ""This message has no content.""

TL;DR - A friend convinced me to switch from chemicals to distilled vinegar to clean my work desk. HVAC and hazmat show up and evacuate everyone for an unknown chemical spill/mechanical failure. Five complaints and one workers comp claim ensue, and I have to take the bottle home with me."
2y6hxr,1,2015-03-06,Have you ever been accepted into an internship/REU/job when your application was put in 6 weeks earlier?,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2y6hxr/have_you_ever_been_accepted_into_an/,"I'm a CS/math major at Georgia Tech. I applied to [this REU in robotics at CMU](http://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri_static_content.html?menu_id=464) at the end of January. I applied to several other (9) internships for this summer, and a few (2) of them extended acceptances within a couple weeks of my application submission, or have requested a phone interview from me. 

CMU, on the other hand, has not. They mentioned in the application that ""offers would be extended in the middle of March"". But I imagine that if I were seriously being considered, they would have set up a phone interview with me much, much earlier than that. Right now I feel like a ""backup"" candidate, in case one of their first choices doesn't accept the internship.

**My question is**: Have you ever been accepted to an internship/REU/job after 6 weeks (or longer), without hearing a peep from the employers in the meantime? Did you find out if you were a first choice?

CMU is my ideal grad school. It has (one of) the best CS programs in the world, and some of the greatest professors. My dream school (along with Berkeley). I'd even put off going to grad school for a year after I graduate while working in some internships if it improved by chances of going there.

My application to CMU looked really good.... I got a recommendation from one of the best roboticists in the country, and I've worked directly with CMU research software. So I'm confident, but at the same time confused as to why I haven't heard anything.

**TL;DR**: See bold above."

If they list 5 technologies as important to the job, and I know two well, one sort of, and have never heard of the other two....do I just move onto the next job or is it worth applying? 

At what point *is* it worth applying? "

2yatq7,1,2015-03-07,TIFU by having hot sweaty sticky sex in the dark,leone910,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2yatq7/tifu_by_having_hot_sweaty_sticky_sex_in_the_dark/,"This happened a few years ago. Just getting around to sharing it with the world.

I had been fucking this girl that was living in my city for a summer internship. We'll call her Crazy. Probably once of the best sexual relationships of my life. Crazy was hot... and a big emphasis on WAS... the past few years have not been kind to her figure. Sex just once a day wasn't enough for Crazy. We set our alarm early EVERYDAY so that we could wake up and have a fun romp before heading to work.

Completely irrelevant backstory... Crazy and a few girl friends has been to NOLA for a weekend, and a cabbie had enlightened them about the secret way to keep a boy around. You put ""the voodoo"" on them!! Literally bleed on them.. fuck them on your period.  Anyways, Crazy proceeded to fuck me on her period. Not that either one of us was going to go a day without sex. Crazy voodooed me. 

Somewhat relevant backstory... Not long after we started hooking up, CRAZY suggested I pull out and finish in her mouth. Now if you haven't tried this, YOU NEED TO FUCKING TRY THIS!!! BEST! THING! EVER!!! I was hooked. Every time, yes please. Pretty sure CRAZY regretted suggesting that move by the end of the summer. 

What started it all... I had drunkenly promised my little brother I would take him to Vegas for his 21st birthday. And no way did he ever let me forget that promise. So a week in Vegas... all that hot dry air. I got no less that one bloody nose every day I was there. Random fucking bloody noses that wouldn't stop for anything. 

Now queue my super horny fuck buddy, Crazy, after a week of me being gone. When I got back, we fucked around for a bit before finally heading to bead. Turn out the lights and... we're at it again (seriously, none of my other relationship has touched this amount of fucking). We'd already been going at it for a bit before this, so we both already hot, on top of my already hot natured self. So when I'm on top and we start to get sweaty, it's no surprise. We're really going at it, and the sweat is really starting to drip off me down onto Crazy. As I get close to finishing, I pull out and slide on top of her chest. Being the good little slut she is, Crazy instinctively swallows every last bit as I quiver a little bit while grinding on her chest some. 

More backstory... Crazy loved donating blood, but couldn't stand the sight of blood. Anytime she had blood drawn, she would pass out. Donating blood? Wake Crazy up when they're finished. Someone got cut? Crazy better steady herself and look away. 

Back to that night... At this point, I'm still straddling Crazy's mediocre chest. My dick still in her hand. I can still feel the sweat dripping off my face. I reach over and turn a lamp on. WHAT! THE! FUCK!! I had put the voodoo on her!! It looks like a fucking murder scene.

Blood is everywhere! My face, Crazy's face, smeared all across her chest, dripping down my chest, her hands. My fucking bloody nose had come back mid sex. Probably one of the only times we had fucked missionary style that summer. And what a time for this to be it.

As soon as Crazy realized that it's blood she's covered in, she starts hyperventilating. Her eyes tight shut. The only thing she could say is put me in the shower. I oblige and proceed to wash her entire body before Crazy ever opened her eyes. 

The aftermath... The rest of the summer went off without a hitch. Crazy moved back away to finish her masters. Albeit after she decided to stay with me her last week of summer before her classes started back. After her lease had already ran out, I should add. And oh, first day of class got cancelled? Crazy decided to stay an extra day. Four days later, class got out early? Only 5 1/2 hours to see me? Weekend trip.

I must have put the fucking voodoo on Crazy like a fucking champ. 6 months later, Crazy moved back for me. That was nearly 3 years ago. So much has happened since then... Crazy pitched all my shit pitched out her 6th floor window, had lawyers send each other cease and desist letters, Crazy had her new boy attempt to fight me, Crazy made enemies with everyone of my friends even while we were still dating.

Fucking voodoo. 

TLDR; Put the ""voodoo"" on someone by bleeding on them and they'll never leave. I put the voodoo on Crazy and she made my life a living hell. "

2yaxma,3,2015-03-07,"My GF is being asked by her boss to work off the clock. how illegal is this, and what would be the penalty for reporting her?",woffdaddy,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2yaxma/my_gf_is_being_asked_by_her_boss_to_work_off_the/,"Ninja Edit! I'm in New Mexico.

My girlfriend is the assistant manager at a tea shop, and over the last few months I've noticed some really shady business practices. It started when my GF was telling me about an ""intern"" that started working at the shop. after questioning her for a few minutes, I was able to gather that:

1. an 18 year old woman approached the store owner asking if she could volunteer at the shop to get work experience.

2. the owner agreed to the let the girl work, no pay (they gave her free tea) and with very limited duties (Taking out the trash, talking to customers about tea, and a few other cleaning tasks)

3. that after 2 months, the owner hired her and payed her in full for her previous volunteer time.

Now IANAL, but that sounds highly illegal to me, so I press a little deeper and find that there's a policy at work called ""always in purple"" (uniform is purple), and goes something like, no matter if you are in uniform, or on the clock, that if you are in the store, you should help out if you see something that needs doing (clean a table, assist a customer, fix the shelves). now I'm really worried at this point, because my GF is an assistant manager here, and I don't want her to get in legal trouble, so i told her that they should drop the policy to avoid legal issues. a few days later, she tells me that they dropped it and changed their policy. but now something else has come up. a few days ago, my GF and I were getting ready to go to a movie, when she gets a phone call from her boss. turns out, shes late to a class that she was supposed to be at. she apologizes and her boss says to forget it and to enjoy her evening. see, the owner runs a class on certain nights and asks her employees to come to it, its free for them, but they don't get paid to be there. but they also aren't required to be there, and can choose not take the class if they dont want to. but apparently my GF doesn't get that choice, and doesn't get paid to be there either.

so now I'm upset, what can be done about this? who should i contact? How Illegal is all of this? could my girlfriend get in trouble over this too?

2yckb3,781,2015-03-08,The Body Farm,bloodstreamcity,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2yckb3/the_body_farm/,"I'm not a guy who gets scared easily, but I'm also not the kind who keeps his head in the sand, if you know what I mean. When something doesn't feel right, it doesn't feel right, period. I acknowledge that most of the bad things that happen in life can be blamed on people or the world around us, but I also believe there are things that fall outside those two categories, at least until we prove otherwise.

Like what happened at the body farm.

I've wanted to be a writer ever since I was a kid, so forgive me if I get too flowery sometimes, it's the habits of a writer. As I'm sure you know, though, writing doesn't pay the bills, and despite my dream of earning a living by writing, I've always needed a day job to get me by. Through the father of a friend, I ended up getting trained and certified as an unarmed security guard straight out of high school, which I did all the way through college. It was easy, and the money was good enough for a while, but eventually I looked for something with a future in it. So long as my writing wasn't taking off, I figured I might as well build a career. After a long search I got a job at one of the major banks- which one I'd rather not say. 

Six years I spent working my ass off, climbing my way up the ranks. That was until five weeks ago when they decided they had too many branches open on the east coast, as well as too many employees working those branches. So I got the boot. No severance, no fanfare, no apology, I was out on the street, and as I soon found out, no one was hiring.

When things started to get desperate I paid a visit to this employment agency up the block from my house. I've never liked the guy who runs it, but as I said, times are desperate. So I walked in and signed up. They didn't seem too hopeful when I asked about other bank jobs, but when they saw the security guard experience on my resume' they perked up. As it turned out they had an overnight temp guard position they were having trouble filling. Needless to say I was hesitant to take what I believed was a step backward. Not to downtalk or discredit guardwork in any way, it just doesn't fit the direction I'm trying to go in at the moment. You'd think being an overnight guard would afford me plenty of time to write, but the truth is I've always had a hard time writing while completely alone. For some reason it makes me uneasy, and I end up getting nothing done.

The point is, I didn't want to take the gig, but a man's gotta eat. My choice was helped by the rate they were paying, which was at the higher end of what guards usually make. Against my better judgment I accepted. They made a few phone calls, wrote down an address and sent me on my way. “It's on the water,” is the only detail they gave. My old uniform was a bit snug but it still fit. I actually found that fact a little disappointing.

Around five o'clock I arrived at the address they'd written on the card, which it turned out was a boat launch to get over to an island, on which was the actual gig. I'll call it Twain Island, since I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to be talking about it in the first place, even though its actual name is one I'd never heard despite growing up close-by. After a confusing exchange with the older guy who ran the dock, he told me something which very nearly made me turn around and get back in my car.
  
“I need to see your phone,” he said. I was confused, but I took it out of my pocket and showed him. Then he said, “If that's a camera, I need to take it.” I made a joke, something like, “What's on that island, the Queen of England?” but he wasn't amused. I argued with him for a minute but in the end I handed it over. Like I said, a man's gotta eat. A few minutes later an even older guy came got me and took me onto the boat. Since it was only the two of us, and since I had no idea what I had gotten myself into, I tried to make some small-talk. The guy wasn't very talkative, but as we approached the island he made the second sketchy comment of the day, this one in the form of a question.

“Have you ever been to one of these farms?” I told him I'd been to plenty of farms, to which he said, “Not like this one you haven't.” I had no idea what he was talking about, but by then we were already pulling up to the dock that stuck out from the rocky shore. We docked. Before I could ask where I was supposed to go he was already pulling away. It seemed he didn't want to stick around long. There was a building up the way's a bit which looked like an old rec center. Given that I had nowhere else to go, I headed for the building. Halfway across the lawn was a sign which read, “[Twain] Island Forensic Anthropology Facility.” They were words I was familiar with seperately, but together lost their meaning. As I contemplated exactly what they meant, a young guy wearing a guard's uniform came around the side of the building and waved me down.

“I heard the boat,” he said. He introduced himself as Eric and handed me a walkie-talkie. He explained that, other than a few computers with an internet connection, all communication on the island was done by old-school means. In case of emergency they even had a two-way radio set-up. I asked him why I wasn't allowed to bring my cell and he said it was so no pictures ended up on the internet, which I'd heard from a friend who did guardwork at a high-end jewelry manufacturer, so it made some sense. It still didn't tell me what the hell was going on out on that island. 

I point-blank asked him. All he said was, “C'mon, I'll show you.”

We walked not into but around the decent-sized building, past a second, smaller building and into the woods beyond. Eric said something about the island being the alleged site of buried pirate treasure, but to be honest I wasn't paying much attention at that point. There was a strong smell in the air, pungent and sweet and downright awful which I found impossible to ignore. Eric noticed my face and said, “Ever smell a dead body before?” I shook my head no. He said, “You’ll never forget it now.”

At that point we came into a clearing in the woods where the foul odor really ramped up. I've always had a strong stomach, but even this was excessive. I felt a ball form at the back of my throat. There were two people, one male, one female, both roughly college-aged and wearing similar, gray coats standing over what looked like long, low cages made of chicken wire. As we walked closer I could see dark forms in the cages like piles of trash. The girl looked over at us and nodded politely but the guy didn't bother. She was pretty and he looked like a bug. It wasn't until we were right on top of the cages that I realized what they held.

The first body I saw, in fact have ever seen, was a woman's. Her skin was impossibly waxy with large patches of discoloration, as if the wax had been burned. She looked like someone had sprinkled rice across her, like a new bride. Unfortunately, it wasn't rice. The maggots crawled on her legs and pooled in the crevices of her neck. Her surprisingly white teeth grinned up at me, exposed, and her belly was inflated like a birthday balloon. My mouth watered from the rising feel of vomit but I managed to keep it in check. It helped to not look at her creeping skin.

He introduced the two as Bernard and Terri, interns from the [name removed] Institute, and said there were two more wandering around somewhere, as well as the man in charge, a scientist by the name of Doctor Christianson. Terri could see I was bothered, so she was nice enough to finally explain what was going on. “We study human decomposition,” she said. The goal was to better understand the process in order to help, among other things, police determine more accurate times of death in a variety of settings.

I looked at the five or six other cages, which she explained were to keep birds away, and asked how many there were on the island. “It varies,” she said, “but it usually hovers somewhere around fifty.” 

Fifty dead bodies. One island. No boats.

They said some see-you-laters and then Eric led me around the rest of the island, first to point out some of the other body sites- more corpses, some caged, some not- and then to perform a perimeter around the shore. He said I'd have to do at least two such rounds during my shift, which I was already thinking about skipping. It took about forty-five minutes for us to circle back around to the dock, which I noticed was the only way onto or off of the island short of risking the waves crashing onto the sharp rocks and the ring of slimy garbage. By then the sun was starting to set. Then he took me inside the main research building which as I'd guessed had been converted from a sports center dating back some fifty years. We took a quick look around at the operation and I saw the back of someone's head inside one of the rooms, but other than that not much registered. I think by that time my head was spinning too fast for anymore information to get in.

We left the main building and went to the second building which served as the guard's office. Eric pointed out the bathroom, the lockers, the eating area with stocked fridge, the flashlights, the desk with the two-way radio, which he showed me how to use, though by then he was eyeing his watch. He gave me a grin and asked if I was all set. I shrugged, which was the most sincere answer I could give. 

“I'll be honest,” he told me, “most guys don't last long here. Especially the night shifters.”

“Thanks.”

“If you take out the mental part it's the easiest job in the world. But that mental part...” His voice trailed off, and I knew exactly what he meant. What could be easier than making sure a bunch of stiffs stayed dead? And yet with the sun going down I was filled completely with dread, the kind where you want to run and scream in no particular direction. Before I could articulate the thought, the sound of a docking boat rose up, and with a nod and a few more last-minute instructions about filling out the log book, he was gone. 

“Next boat's at three a.m.,” he shouted from across the lawn, which seemed like a pretty important detail to be leaving for the last second. Ahead of him were the two interns I'd met, Bernard and Terri, along with two others. Terri waved and I waved back, pretending to be unphased. On the boat already, aside from the old man operating it, was a man whose face I couldn't make out from a distance other than a beard. I assumed it was Doctor Christianson, though I had no way of knowing for sure.

After the boat chugged away and made a line for land, I looked around at the dimming island, inhabited by me and fifty rotting corpses, give or take, with the wind kicking up off the ocean, and wondered how I'd ended up that way. Just a month earlier I'd been sitting comfortably behind a desk in a warm bank. It was incredible how quickly life could shift beneath your feet.

I retreated back inside the guard's office and immediately decided to stay in it until the boat came to get me at three. I locked the door. Screw the promises, screw the temp agency, screw the Twain Island Forensic Anthropology Facility, I wasn't about to go stumbling around in the dark on an island full of dead people, caged or otherwise. There was no way anyone would know one way or the other whether I'd done my rounds or not, and I had a hard time believing that anyone would want to get onto the island, let alone be able to pull up to the dock and get past me without being heard. 

To pass the time I had the internet, thankfully, and that got me past the first few mindless hours. Before I knew it the clock over the door read twenty past nine o'clock. Outside it was pitch black, while inside it was way too quiet, so I pulled up some music videos and let them play in the background, a huge playlist of classic rock songs, as I opened a text file and thought of some story ideas I'd like to explore. Not surprisingly, most of them had to do with zombies coming to life and attacking the living. Nothing really stuck, though, and I began to have that familiar uneasy feeling that comes whenever I try to write alone. After a few minutes I stopped trying to fight it. I closed the file and then my eyes.

I'm not sure how long I was asleep. What I do know is what woke me up. With my eyes still closed I started to become aware of a sound under the music, the playlist still coming out of the computer's speaker, which was faint but getting louder. It was far off in the island, but I could make it out as clear as anything.

And I know it sounds crazy. I really know it does. But it was a woman crying.

When I realized this, my eyes shot open. I jumped out of the chair, grabbed my walkie-talkie and flashlight and ran out of the office, turning on the flashlight as I came around the building. I stopped for a second and shone the light into the forest, catching nothing but the trunks and leaves. For a second I wondered if I'd actually heard the cries or if I'd been half in a dream, the way light sleep messes with you, but then I heard a shout, definitely a woman's pitch, and I bolted into the woods. All I could think was some idiot had found their way onto the island, maybe even a group of idiots, thrill-seeking kids, and hurt themselves on my watch. I would have to carefully forge the log book to cover my ass on this one.

That already familiar stench came to my nose as I came into the first clearing. My flashlight picked up the metal of the cages. I stopped running. I remembered myself, where I was and why I had locked myself in the office. Those cages, just sitting there in the dark. Corpses staring up. Maggots and flies. The cries had stopped, which had me thinking either I was being pranked or much worse: I was too late to help whoever it had been.

I did what I swore I wouldn't, which was the job they'd hired me to do. With a major amount of hesitation I did my rounds. Either I would find the woman, I figured, or I could honestly tell the Doctor that I'd secured the island when they found a body in the morning. Another body, that is. A new one. As I walked the edge of the island I formed a joke in my head about how they could leave the dead woman where they found her and just add her to the guest list. The joke always ended with me saying, “You're welcome.”

I'll be honest, I didn't do a full perimeter, but I did do most of one. Other than half of a hollowed out horseshoe crab I didn't find anything, so I cut back toward the first clearing where I'd sworn the woman's cries had came from. I walked slowly in case I came across any more body sites, especially the uncaged kind, which I didn't want to stumble over in the dark despite the little yellow flags that marked them. The smell would probably warn me first, except for the really long-gone ones, the piles of bones which still stunk but not nearly as much. Needless to say, I was relieved when I reached the clearing.

The beam of my flashlight caught the top of the cages as I walked between them, using them as a guide back to the office without really focusing on them. For some reason I still don't understand, maybe because my eyes picked up something different in the dark, or maybe I felt a change in the air, I shone the light into the last cage, the first I'd seen a few hours earlier, where the bloated woman had grinned up at me.

My feet stopped. So did my heart. What my flashlight saw, what I saw, changed me forever. And I know it sounds crazy. I really know it does. But the cage was empty. 

I got in closer to get a better look, because there was no way what I was seeing was real, but I was horrified to find it was. The body was gone, the only thing left of it a long patch of dead grass, a puddle of half-dried fluids, and strips of what looked like leather but I knew wasn't leather. The cage around it was left exactly where I'd seen it. Only the body had disappeared.

As I stared down at the empty cage, my walkie-talkie crackled in my pocket. It made me jump a bit, the sudden noise in the night, and I fished it out of my pocket where I'd forgotten I put it during the perimeter sweep. But if the first sound made me jump, the second made my skin crawl worse than one of the corpses behind me.

A woman was whispering on the other end. I turned the volume up and pressed the speaker to my ear to hear better. The words were too low to make out, only the distinctly female tone, the same as the one who had called out from somewhere in the woods. Nervous, I brought the walkie-talkie to my mouth and pressed the button on the side.

“Hello? Who's there?” I tried to sound like I was in charge but it wasn't convincing. I let go of the button and brought the speaker back to my ear, straining to hear the whispers.

A laugh. A woman's laugh, high-pitched and delirious, came through the speaker. 

Instinct took over and I ran. I ran away from the cages and out of the clearing, into the woods and out of them again until I was running between the two buildings and back into the office, slammed the door shut and locked it. My pulse throbbed in my neck and I tried to catch myself with my hands on the desk, taking great, big breaths of air in.

Breaths of air. Stale air. Not just stale, but wretched. Sickly sweet and pungent, the smell of those bodies had somehow moved into the guard's office, even though none of the sites were anywhere near it, even with a strong wind to push the air around the island.

It was then, as I pushed myself up off the desk, that I thought again of the missing body. The woman's body. The woman's voice on the radio, the whispers and the laugh. It was then that I realized not just the air had gotten into the building. 

I looked at my hand- a smudge of something black was on my palm. There was a matching one on the table.

I also have some questions that might not be as straightforward to answer, but I can't help but ask: I got a B in my first Calc class, and it looks like I'm going to have a B in Calc II as well. How much does this affect my chances at admissions? I'm well aware at how selective the process is for CS and have begun to consider my other options, but I keep telling myself ""Your fine as long as you do better next quarter"" and it never happens... :|   Another thing I've been wondering is what type of things I can be doing now to strengthen my application when the time comes to apply.

I'm currently employed full time. I work in Brooklyn, 8am to 4pm as a data analyst.
Ideally, I'm seeking a position that would allow me to earn extra money while doing something I'm enthusiastic and passionate about. However, I'm willing to make some compromise if the situation seems right.  
I have advanced knowledge of Excel, intermediate level of SQL server. 
I have experience working with SSIS packages, data transformation, and data visualization. 
Software testing and QA have been part of my current job as well, I find this field interesting. Most of my QA experience has been manual testing, but I've been attending professional development courses, and well as sharpening my technical skills, to get more involved in automation testing.   
I can write advanced Excel functions, and create dynamic spreadsheets that are integrated with SQL tables.  

I have a Bachelor degree in Design and Digital media. 
I never had a job in this field, but occasionally have projects, personal or professional, that would keep my skills sharp. 
I'm proficient with visual design, typography,  and my Photoshop skills are up to par. 

I'm also a musician, my passion lies in the audio field. 
Engineering, sound design, composition, anything to do with music production interests me. (I can DJ any event, if that’s what you need) I had an internship at a recording studio in Park Slope during my college days. This was a great learning opportunity, but it never led to a job, so I had to look elsewhere for real employment.

I'm motivated, very organized, and have a hard work ethic.
My current living situation is changing and I need to find a side job which can help pay the bills.  

I'm willing to work in any of these areas mentioned. I'm very adaptable and resourceful. 
I'm available weekday evenings at around 5pm, and on weekends. 
Resume, work samples, or any other information available upon request. 
Thanks for your consideration.

I'm very excited to have the opportunity to work for them. HR called me this Friday to discuss the details of the offer. Unfortunately, my cell phone was about to die so I have decided to call them back on Monday.

The problem is that one of the internship locations is in a city I do not want to stay in for the summer. I interviewed at one of the satellite offices in the city I go to college in. It's a great city, but I would really like to intern at their headquarters in New York City. I am considering moving to NYC after I graduate so it would be great to experience the city for a summer.

How do I mention to HR how I want to relocate? I do not want to seem unappreciative because I assume they would want me to do the internship in the city I interviewed in. I was thinking of mentioning how I would like to be closer to family (I live in Boston), but thought that would sound weird. How should I approach this?"
2yda65,19,2015-03-08,How do I undo effects of being emotionally neglected as a child?,invisibledenizen,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/2yda65/how_do_i_undo_effects_of_being_emotionally/,"I was mostly neglected as a child, if I was paid attention to, it was so that my mom could scream at me or say things children shouldn't hear. She told me that she wanted to die and that she didn't know what to do with my brother when I was in elementary school. I still remember how anxious and worried all this made me, now I constantly feel vague anxiety. I felt very hopeless; perhaps I have learned helplessness from this? I don't think she was emotionally stable. She yelled at my brother almost every day over the smallest things ,and would get...panic attacks or the equivalent. She would have trouble breathing and she would say that she was dying. One time when I was 7 she started screaming at my brother with me in the car, and she threatened to crash it into the brick wall of a gas station. I don't even remember why. I never saw my dad much. He only started paying attention to me when I started getting accepted to good colleges, so he could brag.
All the attention was on my brother, who did poorly in school, didn't have friends, and overall had many problems. I always felt like I was in the margins, and was invisible most of the time. I did try my best in high school though, without any emotional support. The only thing my mom really did for me was buy me necessities and sometimes money, and make me food. She has a huge garden so I suspect she feels as if she has failed raising my brother and I.

I'm saying all this because I think that this is where all my problems stem from.
I constantly feel like people look down at me and treat me differently. I don't have any confidence and I feel like I am being judged every time someone is nearby. I don't feel comfortable unless I am alone, or in a huge crowd of strangers. Most of my friends in HS didn't treat me well, never remembered my birthday, called/messaged me first, included me only 20% of the time. They didn't respect me, I wish I knew why.

I tried my best in high school and finally got away from my family. Now, I'm a freshman at college in one of the greatest cities in the world and there are so many opportunities for me. However, I find myself unable to make stable friendships or relationships with anyone. I'm always sad and I feel like I have a lot of potential but I can't reach it. There are so many opportunities like studying abroad and great internships but I apathetically watch them all slip by. There is so much that I can do but I find myself using all my energy just waking up and doing normal things like dressing myself. I have no energy to talk to people, even though I am extremely lonely.

I want to change but I don't know how to. How can I start to change and mend old wounds so I can think and function like an average human? The free counselors at school don't help much, but I'm on a scholarship and can't afford anything else.

If you read all this, thank you so much. It really means a lot to know that someone finally knows.

The actual process of building the case took a long time due to needing access to some tools via friends. I absolutely could not have done it without the two of them though, so I hope they know how much I appreciate the help!


Onto the actual design decisions, I wanted to create a case that offered something no other case on the market could offer. 

* Minimal footprint
* Vertical airflow (even though natural convection is far less effective than the forced convection of fans the idea is still appealing
* Clean look and related to the Marvel theme I've been developing on this side of the room. Venom is one of the coolest villains and the color palette works really well for a simple look.
* Maximum airflow for minimal noise. The whole case is designed to work with no additional fans with direct access to airflow for the GPU, CPU and the power supply.

I've had a couple of successful internships, and have much better business knowledge, soft skills, and practical programming skills, than the majority of CS students. I work specifically in the mobile web sector, and have taken on a fair amount of freelance work in addition to the internships.


**Goals:** Take a year off of school to work as a software engineer so that I can gain more experience, money, and connections. These things are specifically what I need to focus on to maximize the chance of being in a position to start a successful tech company within the next few years.

**Situation:** I fear that obtaining a full-time junior role will not be possible. Having a salaried junior role would mean I'd earn more than a co-op or intern, but it'd also means a longer term commitment is expected. I don't want to lie about my intentions to secure a long-term position, but at the same time, my primary goal is not school, but to position myself for success for any future companies I may start. There is a good chance that I'd stay at the company for longer than a year, and go straight to my own venture.

**Question:** If I'm *planning* on taking 1 year off of school to work, should I be trying to obtain a salaried junior-level position? Will it be necessary to acknowledge the fact I plan on returning to school, or can state that I'm moving on from school to start my career early? "

I have a good Masters program on my resume in interaction ux etc. (computer design) and worked for one of those shiny companies as an intern (apple/microsoft/twitter/facebook etc. trying to be anonymous so I won't say which one) 

I've been working for almost 2 years at a good but slightly less shiny company. In the last year things have gotten pretty bad. I'm still producing good work but my manager's incompetancy has left me so distraught I'm nearly comatose when I get home from depression. 

Recently things happened where I might be fired. I should fight it I think it is based on false perceptions the manager has put forth...but really I just dont' want to be here anymore. 

I came close to a good job out in SF but came in close but not quite....and came close to another at another shiny company but once again, close but not quite. 



The fact I keep coming close but not quite is getting to me. And the firing may happen fairly soon. My sense of self is very related to doing good work....people ask what my goals in life are but really my career is might top priority? So the fact this manager has left me feelign lost for so long...


Basically I should be able to get a good job. But I'm just feeling incredibly lost...I keep on applying to jobs but I don't know what I'll do if I'm fired. My family is all in areas where I wouldn't be able to find work. I'm sure if I can get to SF/NY/Seattle I can find a good UX/Design/Tech job but I don't know how to afford that first step...part of that is my fault I've been trying to pay off my student loans quickly rather than saving (I honestly didn't expect this firing, I thought I was safe for a few years). 


TLDR: I'm sure I can get a job in SF if I can get there, I have a good resume, but my current job has left me so depressed I worry I'm coming off badly in communications. 

Sorta second...part of this problem is that I've walled myself in. If I can escape this explosion and get to a next step, how do I not end up alone again? Right now I'm making 85k but feel more alone than when I was jobless out of undergrad. "

I'm a single 29 year old Irish male, with a degree in computer science, advanced degrees in robotics &amp; space science, and I'm currently doing a PhD in computer science. I've done internships at the European Space Agency and NASA JPL. I will be submitting my thesis September 2016, then performing my defence before Christmas. I am really tired of Ireland, it has no job opportunities in my field and there are a couple of startups in the Bay Area that have gotten my attention.

The broad strokes, I want to live in the US, work in robotics companies, build experience, if I work hard enough and with a bit of luck, start my own company. I will need to get a job with a company before leaving, they will vouch for me, and I can get a work visa for a year, if I have read the rules correctly.

Questions:

* How many months/weeks do companies give if someone is moving from abroad before starting the position?
* How many months before September 2016 should I be applying for positions?
* After getting a position, how long does it take to get a work visa?
* Then, after how many years would I be in a position to apply for citizenship?
* What income tax will I be paying (~$65,000 starting salary)?
* Are there additional taxes that I would be paying?

I know that the cost of accommodation in the Bay Area is insane. I've been living the student lifestyle for long enough, but it is OK if I have to settle for something similar in the Bay Area for a while.

Questions:

* What online services are routinely used for searching for accommodation?
* How much cash I should set aside for first month's rent and security deposit?
* Are there any other charges that I should be considering?
* Will I have to get a place with roommates?
* Are there cities I should avoid due to the crime rate?
* What commute time should I be looking to hit?

I've been pondering and decided there are two options: 

**(1) Go three semesters in a row.  Graduate May 2016.**  Summer, Fall, and Spring semesters all back to back.  I would graduate quickly but the tradeoff is that I don't have any internships or work experience so I would be trying to either get an internship after college and job hunting with zero experience.  

**(2) Take summer off.  I haven't been able to land an internship so work at a crappy job over the summer.  Go Fall, Spring, and then Fall 2016.  Land an internship Summer 2016.  Graduate December 2016.**  The advantage of this is I feel if I did this I would have a better resume/portfolio when I got job hunting.  I could have an internship which would demonstrate experience.  The tradeoff is graduating 7 months later could be worth thousands of dollars if I could theoretically land a job earlier without delaying.  

**I need your advice reddit.  Should I graduate faster or should I go slower for the possibility of landing a summer internship?  Any and all advice is welcome.**"

I recently started working at a new company. This happened about a month into the job or so. It was an internship at an engineering firm, and I was loving it. I would perform my work well. A little too well. I began finishing everything my boss assigned me with (at the time, my responsibilities were very dependant on what was going on that day) faster than they anticipated the work would take. This led to me being assigned more responsibilities, which entailed me working with more different coworkers.

One of my coworkers was giving me the run down on how to file certain paperwork. I had been thrown a bunch of different tasks that day and was ordered to come speak to this coworker and help her with whatever work she had for me. At that point I was just wanting to begin working again. I had a lot on my plate that needed to get done.

It's important to know at this point the coworker was assigning me work that she normally does, but she couldn't do since she was flying overseas. Her mother wasn't doing too well so she was going to visit her.

My coworker was making small talk with me, and I guess I was kind of spaced out only thinking about finishing all the work I had to do. I was only half paying attention to the conversation. I'd pick up key words and answer with an appropriate response.

I had been reading the paperwork she handed me when she began her next sentence. All I caught was ""... and my dad took my mom ..."" and I replied with ""oh that's sweet of him"". I assumed what I didn't hear at the end of the sentence was that he was taking her out somewhere so I complemented him. She finished explaining to me what I needed to do and I went on my way.

Fast forward a couple weeks, she's still overseas and I've been filing the documents. I overheard a couple coworkers talking about the whole situation and overheard something about her dad having passed away years ago.

Then it hit me.

When she said ""my dad took my mom"", she was implying that her mom passed away.

I didn't think about it at the time cause I hadn't known about the whereabouts of her father.

I don't know if she noticed but I feel awful for saying it almost immediately after she ended that sentence.

TL;DR Complemented my coworker's mother passing away"

Hi there,

I'm a 3rd year (out of 4) Computer Science Student from the Northeastern United States desperately trying to find work here in London, or elsewhere in the UK for the coming Summer.


So far, I'm having no luck at all. I just don't have enough contacts here to ask around like I would back home, and my University doesn't really provide placement help for non-graduates looking for temporary work.


As far as eligibility goes, I have a work visa permitting me to work full time until the end of the Summer (with the option to extend), so I do not require sponsorship.


My specialty is iOS app development and Web Design and lately I've gotten pretty good with Database Applications. In the past I've worked at Hewlett-Packard and Bose Corporation as an Intern.


Whatever the position, I'm absolutely committed to learning and making myself a proven member of the team - I would just like to devote more time to another country in this point in my life while I can. And what better way to do that than to work, and learn!


I have a resume handy, if you'd like me to send it to you please comment or PM me! Thanks :)"
2yfyok,1,2015-03-09,Need some career advice.,sirdarkpaw,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/2yfyok/need_some_career_advice/,"First some background. I have been working as a Junior IT Assistant (basically a paid intern) for the last ~2 years. We are a 2 man team. I have been doing mostly help desk for roughly 60-70 users while my boss (the IT Admin) handles the bigger stuff. I assist him with the bigger stuff when I have no help desk calls. I currently have an associate's degree in computer networking. My current employer will pay for certification classes. I submitted a request for CCNA classes, the VMware Install Configure Manage class, and Linux+. I am still waiting for approval on those. I have some basic experience with VMware's vSphere. We have a small cluster (3 physical servers) with a NetApp FAS2040 for shared storage. I also have some basic experience with Citrix XenServer. We are currently moving our cluster from VMware to XenServer. I have also been tinkering with Linux for the past ~2 years. I have played around with LAMP stacks, samba, NFS, iSCSI, drbd, pacemaker, glusterfs, and ceph. I have also dabbled in FreeBSD with HAST/CARP/ZFS. I was never able to get a working script for automatic failover with devd though (was successful with manual failover however). Currently I am mostly interested in virtualization and storage.

&amp;nbsp;

So, on to my question. I want to get into datacenter engineering/administration and specialize in virtualization/storage. What would my best options be? What other classes/certs should I look into?"
2yg9dt,3,2015-03-09,Am I being creepy?,[deleted],socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/2yg9dt/am_i_being_creepy/,"Hey folks, how's it going?

I'm having a bit of a trouble discerning whether this behaviour of mine is getting creepy to some people.

To add a bit of context, I'm working as an intern in a company and I know someone who is working nearby. We usually see each other when grabbing a coffee.

All pretty natural till now. Thing is, sometimes I can be awkward as fuck. The person I know usually is sitting together with the company she's working in and she is still getting to know them. Usually I come compliment her everyday, but then quickly leave since I have no conversation topic.

There is also another problem: I ain't really discreet when staring around. Today I was staring around, trying to see where she was so I could compliment her (I didn't find her). As a result, I might have ended up staring a lot at the company workers. I don't know why, but I got a feeling in my gut that they were feeling bothered. Might have been just me too...

So that's my question. Should I stop visiting so much? Of should I try to fit in? Or do anything else? I don't really want to become ""that guy"" and get into trouble with the other company, I might Work with them one day...

Sorry if I broke any forum rule, it's my first post here...

I worked a part time technical support role in the halls of residence the whole time while I was studying. Also maybe relevant was that I got diagnosed with Aspergers' during my final semester but I don't don't like to be treated differently because of it - I like to do things for myself. I suffer with anxiety and depression at the moment.

I graduated back in January 2012 staying around my university city in the West Midlands/Black Country (originally from rural Norfolk the east coast of England which is where my family are all based) and things have kind of gone downhill since then. I couldn't get any work whatsoever for the first year after graduation and I applied for all sorts of stuff. 2013 started off OK when I got an 8 month low paid programming graduate internship with my university but unfortunately it was very poorly managed so I didn't really learn much from it and much of the time I had nothing to do and couldn't motivate myself to self teach on initiative - it was nice to have a routine, somewhere to go every day, and enough money to just about survive and get by though. As part of the internship I was placed with a startup games development company for the remaining 4 months and helped with data entry and light development tasks relating to Unity3D. 

After the internship finished I tried to start my own business making apps for local businesses but unfortunately couldn't get any customers through networking or marketing so that wound up around April or May 2014.

I started a job working for an app development agency in May but unfortunately despite showing them my previous work in the interview and being very honest about the depth of my skills they let me go after a week. This is desspite saying they were happy for me to learn iOS dev on the job because they had assumed a bunch of prior knowledge I didn't have and they couldn't afford for me to keep learning at the pace I was going at and ""needed to make money out of me right away"". Obviously this made me feel pretty shitty and demotivated - I thought I'd finally got a job with a decent salary only for it to be crushed in front of me.

Anyway I feel like I've burnt out on computers recently and find it incredibly difficult to engage with learning anything about them or pursuing a career related to my degree. At the moment I'm working an early morning 6-9am cleaning job at my old university which I started back in October which is OK - gets me out of bed and keeps my finances ticking over. I also volunteer at a women's refuge where I help the clients to learn basic IT skills which I find rewarding.

My ideas about what I'd like to do are pretty widespread and not all things that would necessarily provide an income (at least to begin with). I'd like to try something where I can express myself like stand up comedy, public speaking, music, writing, etc. which I could in theory do alongside a menial job like I have now. I also like the idea of working for a charity of some kind in a paid capacity as I've been enjoying my voluntary work and feel that work in that sector could be rewarding.

Autism support staff from the university have suggested that I perhaps consider studying autism/aspergers in adults at a postgraduate level (at a different university, this one doesn't run courses in it) as I'm apparently very candid and self aware of my condition and how it affects me and others. I'm not really opposed to this and feel it could be interesting but I just don't know. Also I'm not sure I'd be able to get on without having a prior qualification at undergraduate level in the subject although I could try to justify my application or personal statement with life experience.

I just have no clue what I want to do next and while the cleaning is OK and gives me time to think I'm not sure I want to do it forever..."
2ygcaa,2,2015-03-09,Leadership difficulties in a small startup,tbutlah,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/2ygcaa/leadership_difficulties_in_a_small_startup/,"I'm in the CEO position of a small software startup that I cofounded with one of my best friends along with one of his friends. We've been around for a little over half a year now and while it's not been enough to sustain ourselves solely from the business, we've been making passive income. I own about 3/5 of the company while the other cofounders own around 1/5 each. 

So for the entire time we've been operating, we've been having weekly meetings, sharing ideas, and I thought we had great team cohesion. However, recently the cofounder who is also one of my best friends went off on me for micromanaging him and ""treating him like a child"". I'm only 20 and haven't had that much leadership experience, but have taken leadership classes through ROTC that stressed the importance of not micromanaging your competent subordinates. Like most young leaders, before he called me out I had had the image in my head that I was doing an outstanding job and giving the perfect amount of freedom to my cofounders, while also checking their work over for quality. 

For background, I am supposed to be in charge of the technical development of the product, and he is supposed to be in charge of  everything non-technical, such as marketing, customer support, etc. As the CEO, I also make the major decisions, usually swaying in the direction of the recommendation of the cofounder whose area the decision would affect. My friend came to me recently saying that he thinks we should move over to a new, much more expensive marketing style and I reacted in a somewhat hostile way to the new idea since we just changed marketing styles and it showed no effect in sales. This was admittedly a bad move on my part, since he usually does alot of research before coming to me with these things. I start to accept the idea more as he talks me into it, but I know that even though he is a very good researcher and one of the smartest people I know, he has a bad attention to detail. For this reason, even though I was pretty much sold on the idea at this point, before I okayed the spending of money I asked to see the chat log of a conversation that he had with a marketing expert since neither of us have any experience in marketing and he may have missed or misinterpreted something in the conversation.

This is where he went off on me, complaining that he always does so much research only to have me second guess him and disregard his advice. He said he doesn't feel like he has a purpose, that he just researches things and presents them to me with a recommendation just to have me look over the research he went through himself and decide against his recommendation. He brought up that in his former internships with somewhat prestigious organizations he would be able to write articles that would go straight up on the website without review, because people there trusted his ability to research and decide. A direct quote from him is: ""you dont start with the presupposition to question someone's work. Then you're undermining their integrity, their autonomy, and questioning their intellignece"".

Obviously I have failed as a leader since one of my cofounders feels like he isn't taken seriously and what he does is useless. However, keep in mind that we're friends that have known each other over 6 years so the dynamic between us is different than just a typical leader-subordinate relationship.

My question to reddit is: what are some strategies that I can use that will give my subordinates freedom to work on their own parts of the business autonomously and be happy, while also maintaining control of the business, ensuring quality and that proper decisions are being made? Also, how does one do the same thing, but specifically when in charge of a development team and responsible for controlling the quality of software being produced by your team (it seems like there would be good books on this topic). 

While our current startup is small and may not grow that much more, these questions are very important to me since I'm sure at some point in my career I'll be in the same situation again.

Thank you!"

I am a recent graduate. By that i mean i graduated in 2012. So it has been a while. I graduated with a Bachelors in Finance and Business Management double major. I was also dumb and did not do any internships during college. I didnt need them i said... : ( anyway...I was working at this decent size company  that was expanding as a production line worker out of school. They had several office positions open while I was there and even entry level accounting position. They told me to keep applying and I ended up waiting almost 6 months for the accounting position to open up when he said about a month. 

So I apply to these office positions and I get none of them. I dont even get interviews. For entry level accounting. I later hear that it is because they couldn't afford to lose me on the line because I am a good worker. I am finally gone from there.

My whole life I have done basically manual labor jobs and jobs where I build things. Never had to answer phones or things like that. So I dont have any job experience. 
So fast forward 6 months, me and my gf moved for a promotion for her to a smaller city. So now I have been trying to find a job here. and NOTHING. I have had interviews. Im using staffing companies. But apparently no one wants to hire me with no experience. I dont know what else it would be. 

I am great at excel, pivot tables, vlookups, macros. Great with computers, I fix them on the side. I can answer a darn phone and transfer calls or do data entry. but apparently not. 

Now that I am just ranting, I ask. What should I do? What CAN I do? I am more than capable of performing these jobs. 

I don't exactly know what I want to do in finance but I have not even had a chance to see what there is. I just want to get in somewhere and work my way up and gain experience. 

If you have any suggestions or advice at all I would love to hear it. Im at the end of my rope. We are thinking of moving again, but I have no money to move. I am thinking of getting my MBA but I dont know where I could go around here now that we moved. Any help is appreciated...

English 1C (Critical thinking skills, developing argument, analysis of argument)

2ygww7,3,2015-03-09,Lessor/lessee issue,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2ygww7/lessorlessee_issue/,"Hi LegalAdvice!  So I have a bit of a story and I want to preface it by saying that I should have looked for help sooner but was stupid about it.  So I am in grad school right now but last year I was only here for half a year due to graduating early.  In order to avoid subletting I joined my girlfriend at her apartment building where she actually worked and lived.  In order for me to legally live there they had me sign the lease that she was already on.  She worked for her rent basically and told me every month that it was fully paid off.  Fast forward a bit and I moved out in December for an internship and because of graduation.  (Note, this original lease was for August 2013 to July 2014.)

Towards the end of the school year (May or so) she told me that she was basically forced out of her job and this place had basically terminated her lease.  She moved somewhere else in May and I thought all was well.  I received no notifications for late rent/fees/damages or anything.  Until January 2015.  I received a call saying that they had been attempting to contact my ex for several months because we owed damages to the tune of $15,000.  Yes, 15 grand.  I was incredibly scared of this.  So I contacted my ex and she told me she would pay the entire amount after working out a payment plan of 1 payment of $1,000 and 23 payments of $400.  I now realize after receiving this initial call I should have gone straight to a lawyer to see the extent of my liability and find out what could be done.  But because she said she would pay the full amount, I didn't worry about it.  I did sign the payment plan along with her because I figured I had to since I was on the original lease.

The first payment was due 3/1 and, of course, it wasn't paid by her like she said.  The complex gave us until 3/5 to pay and as of today it still wasn't paid.  So I finally asked for a list of all damages and a copy of the original lease and said I was going to talk to a lawyer.  Thankfully, they sent both promptly.  

The list of charges are as follows:
Balance as of March (when it looks like she stopped working there): $772

Rent charges from March until July: $4,350

Skips, abandonments, evictions (rent September 2014-July 2015) (not sure how they can charge us for this or what this is exctly): $1,020

Damage Fees: $7,700 (this includes things such as replacing both beds, new furniture, replacing the carpet, deep cleaning, etc.)

And other miscellaneous late charges and fees for the remainder.

A few points I want to reiterate: 

I did not receive any notices telling me the rent was not being paid.  My ex kept saying everything was fine and that when she moved out in May they terminated the lease.  

I received no notice of these damages or any other fees until January 2015.  The lease was over July 2014.

My ex told me nothing about these fees or late rent or charges.

So today I set up an appointment with a lawyer for this Wednesday (3/11) and gave them the itemized list and original lease.

I will make edits as necessary but am not even sure where to start with asking questions.  What am I actually liable for?  Is there any way to avoid this entire thing?  If it gets sent to collections, how bad will this destroy my credit score?  Please help.  I know the lawyer will help but what should I expect and bring to the meeting?  I want to be fully prepared.  Again, I will answer any questions and make edits as necessary.  Thanks everyone!

I think it would be cool if we shared our stories. What we struggle with, how we came to find out we had ADHD, and how we are doing now. I always find reading about other people's experiences encouraging because it reminds me that even though some people may say ADHD doesn't exist, there are others out there who have had a similar experience to mine.

My Story-
Growing up, I always talked excessively...to the point of driving my parents nuts at times. I had a difficult time not talking in class, I was always sketching in my notebook, and I was horrible at studying and taking notes. Yet, I did well throughout K-12 because I was a good auditory and visual learner. It was college where things really started to become apparent.

I started off at university excited about being on my own, making new friends, and experiencing new things. After my first year, I switched majors and schools. I floundered a lot after my first internship (which I was fired from for being late/non-attendance). I switch majors again, but dropped out of school because my parents decided to stop paying my way (I can't blame them). 

I ended up moving home, getting married a few years later, and managed to do alright for a while. I tried going to school again, but only lasted one quarter. Went through job after job and decided to try school yet again. Did well the first term, but once again started to struggle. Around this time, I was struggling with some health issues, which doctors believe is affected by stress levels and anxiety.

So, I started researching anxiety. I subscribed to the subreddit. I didn't suffer from panic attacks, but a lot of things resonated with me. One day, someone posted about having ADHD and the anxiety related to their struggles. I hopped over to the ADHD subreddit and was blown away. Everything I read sounded just like me. Within a week I had an appointment with a psychiatrist and a few weeks later was officially diagnosed ADHD-C.

I broke the news to my husband immediately, but he already knew I had it and I had been talking about the research I was doing, which helped. I told my mom next and we talked about signs of it growing up like me always forgetting my textbook when I needed to study or the one time I forgot my music AND instrument for a band concert! I have since shared it with my dad and older brother and they have been fairly supportive.

I started medication the day after my psychiatrist told me my diagnosis. The first day was amazing, but the good results have quickly faded. I am able to keep a regular sleep schedule overall, which has been helping immensely. I still need to learn how to better control my focus and accomplish the things that are difficult for me to complete (like homework).

At this point, I'm only at the beginning of understanding what my diagnosis means, but this subreddit has been beyond helpful. Several apps have also helped me along the way. EpicWin for iPhone is my to-do list app of choice. It makes my to-dos an RPG game which is awesome. Also, Forest for iPhone helps me force myself to put down my phone for a period of time.

So what is your experience so far? What tools have you found that help you manage life?

TL;DR: I'm very thankful for this subreddit. It is one of the most honest, open, and supportive places I've found. Share your story and coping mechanisms if you would like! "
2yhlyb,0,2015-03-09,Is there temp or internship opportunities for CS?,urfaselol,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2yhlyb/is_there_temp_or_internship_opportunities_for_cs/,"Got a question for ya'll. I'm a biomedical/mechanical engineer who's looking to transition from medical device R&amp;D into software development. The problem is outside of scripts I made in matlab/labview I don't have a hard coding portfolio. I know how to code and I don't think its hard to learn but the problem is I don't have much time to devote to teach myself or do projects with my job and all.

I would much prefer to be able to learn on the job and develop a portfolio like that since I'm the type of person who very much needs a project in order to really learn how to code. Are there any temp agencies or companies that are willing to let me intern while learning? I'm a very quick learner and for me it's all about knowing the syntax. The logic is fairly easy because I come from a technical background.

Thanks!"
2yhpwk,76,2015-03-09,I've been without a Mech Eng. job for over a year since graduating due to depression that has finally been treated. How should I explain the length of time I've went without engineering work? What things can I do to improve my chances of getting an interview in my situation?,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/2yhpwk/ive_been_without_a_mech_eng_job_for_over_a_year/,"I've tried posting this elsewhere but it was taken down.  I could really use some advice from other engineers and would appreciate it greatly.   I'm NOT looking for resume advice specifically - although that's one of the tangential queries I had.  This is moreso concerning being so long post-graduation and the effect that is going to have on hiring prospects - how I can explain it if I land an interview - and things I can do to improve my chances. I have these anxieties in the back of my mind and would really appreciate some words of wisdom.   Here's a bit more about me:

&amp;nbsp;

I had some crappy things happen after I graduated from a U.C. in NorCal and I spent over a year in a pretty bad depression – It caused me to miss out on an internship experience at a large winery in central california.  I was in a bad mental state, lost all self confidence, and had to get a temp job as a gas station cashier on graveyard shift to make some money to live off of while I searched for mechanical engineering work – but the depression and resulting lack of any confidence in myself meant I wasn’t really looking very much.  The months just flew by burying myself in the internet and before I knew it it’d been over a year and I was still in the same hopeless place. This past November I finally realized that I had to work my butt off to get out of this hole or things were looking pretty dark and I’d never get my life and career going.  I signed up for the A.C.A. and was able to get medical insurance to cover antidepressant medication (which I started taking in college until I graduated and lost the school insurance), and quit the graveyard job which was just making digging out of my depression more difficult .  This along with regular exercise and meditation turned things around immensely and I finally studied and passed the E.I.T. certification test last month and am ready to start my job search.

&amp;nbsp;

I don’t have any internship experience – I wasted all my summers in college, something which I regret immensely.  Currently instead of posting my employment history which is full of things like gas station attendant, pizza maker, etc. I’ve opted to instead have a section titled ‘Relevant Experience’ where I list experiences like my Capstone Design project where I worked in a group with the Cal Dept. of Water Resources to develop a prototype UAV soil salinity mapping system.  I garnered a lot of experience there and gained a major interest in control systems design, worked with 3D printing, worked under budgetary and time restraints, and reported to superiors on project progress similar in structure to a business environment.  I figure it's better to list my relevant engineering projects I've worked on rather than irrelevant part time jobs - but I also wonder if it's important to have my employment history just to show that I've at least had a job this past year even if it was as a cashier.  I can't list both or it'll be two pages long - so I'm not sure which is the best course of action.

&amp;nbsp;

To refresh myself I’ve also spent all of my free time since I’ve gotten well brushing up on my CAD skills with all the major CAD programs and FEA suites I can get my hands  on(ProEngineer, Solidworks, AutoCad, COMSOL), and am doing case studies from component design textbooks to keep myself thinking about engineering.    

&amp;nbsp;

While I don’t have any industry experience yet, and academic pursuits are vastly different from industry,   I know I have the capabilities to adapt and learn quickly. I just need that one chance to get my foot in the door that first time so that I can make an impression and I’m confident I will excel. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m full of anxiety about being out of school without engineering employment for such a length of time – a lot of my daily thoughts are about no one giving my resume the time of day once they see that. I’m pushing through that negativity this time though and am not going to let it hold me back.  I’d eventually like to go back to school for my Masters so that I can pursue my life’s goal/passion of working in the space industry – but first I need to get a job anywhere in the field for some years so that I can manage my student loans and get my life moving forward.  I currently live in the East Bay Area so I’m going to be applying to the various oil refineries and power plants in the Martinez area – as well as anywhere else I can find in the rest of the  Bay Area. 

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for reading.  I hope this can stay up - I could use any words of wisdom and advice you can give


&amp;nbsp;


Edit:  Thank you so very much to everyone who has taken the time to share their suggestions with me so far. I have a lot more ideas on how to proceed now and most importantly I'm more optimistic and hopeful. And thank you mods for not taking it down - being able to get this advice is helping a lot.

My last job was a part time law firm job that ended in May, so I have quite a gap in employment. For a variety of reasons, at this point I honestly have no desire to be a lawyer.  I have IP law experience, court internships and customer support experience (pre-law school) working for a tech company. 

I am more interested in working as a licensing associate, contracts manager, in policy etc. (basically, jobs in the legal department of companies, but not in an attorney role). One problem I keep running into is that the job postings will specifically state that the job is a non-attorney job (some will even specify that attorneys will not be considered for the role).  

So my question is, would it be appropriate to reach out to a hiring manager directly via email explaining that I am a JD (not technically an attorney, as I haven't passed the bar), but am genuinely interested in a particular non-attorney position?  Would it make sense to attach a copy of the cover letter and resume I submitted, and use the body of the email to explain why I am interested in the particular job?  

Any advice on how to communicate the fact that I am genuinely interested in a position for the long-term, without sounding insincere?  I'm concerned that I come across as ""overqualified"" or at risk of leaving the company because of my JD (and pending bar results), and I'm not sure how I could go about alleviating that concern. 

I'm starting to feel pretty depressed and really feeling the weight of my mistakes.  Any advice would be much appreciated!"

2yihn3,4,2015-03-09,I keep getting overlooked...,dtwoprod,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2yihn3/i_keep_getting_overlooked/,"Hi family.

Here's the deal. For five years, i've been out of university and I got only ONE job in my field (Radio, TV, and Film). During my time in school, I worked MANY a/v related jobs and internships to get experience (like The System said to do). I graduate, cater my resume to whatever job i'm looking at and I get the same, tired message:

""Thanks for applying. We found someone more suitable for the job. We'll keep your resume on hold, blah blah blah"".

From 2010 till now, i've worked mainly as a substitute teacher and an English teacher in South Korea. While I was in Asia, I did manage to get a few more media related gigs (independent and with companies). I decided to come back to the states in 2013 to try again. 

I got a job in 2014 as a production assistant at a small TV station. They asked me what I expected and I told them that I expect to get a full time gig within six months. In those six months, I tried two times to get a full time gig (one in the newsroom and one in creative services).

I was denied both. 

The newsroom director said my ""...writing was good but it didn't sound like something reporters would say"". The person that got the gig had the same mistakes I did but still got it. The difference between her and I is she was a recent graduate.

The people in creative services decided to use my editing skills on my sixth month there but they refused to put me on full time payroll. ""We need you to help the editors when they're swamped. We have a full plate and we still don't think you're good enough for this spot.""

After the 8th month, I decided to go back to my parents. It's been the same thing prior to the TV gig and i'm getting real sick of this. I maintain a good attitude and do what i'm supposed to do but I feel as though the RTVF field is very clickish in regards to who they want. Going back to South Korea is an option but i'd like to stick around here at home at least and get a FULL time gig. 

TL;DR Why can't I get a job in my field despite having the experience and catering my resume to what they're looking for?!"

2yj1ny,3,2015-03-10,I dislike my life.,Bronzehawkattack,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2yj1ny/i_dislike_my_life/,"Those of you who dont want to read a teenage boy rant on about how he dislikes his life please move on.

To start off, I dont feel like life is worth living. The things I get enjoyment out of are small things like videogames and anime, and those are two reasons why I dont just let myself die. Its so weird how a large reason I want to continue living is to see the end of an anime I love, or the sequel to a game I want to play. Another reason is that I want to live to a point where technology will be good enough where I can feel like im living in my fantasy worlds that ive dreamed up since I was like 7. It doesnt exactly feel plausible but I have hope. Another reason I dont want to die is my Dad, my Mom and my best friend. I feel like all of them would be sad if I died, I dont want them to feel like I do. This feeling fucking hurts, but as time goes on and the future looks more and more bleak the reasons I want to die start to outweight the bad. Ill try to list of negatives from the most minor to the more serious ones.

- I have horrible acne that wont fucking go awat. My face looks fucked up enough as it is but the acne just makes it worse. This will sound self-entitled as fuck, but I dont want to go through so much effort to stop the acne. Its unfair that everyone else I know doesnt have to worry, they dont have to use face cleaning products and shif. Worst part is, is that recently ive taken my parents advice and started using a face cleanser and the acne seems like its just multiplying if anything.

- Im a fucking loser. Seriously, i look up to and wish to replicate fictional characters. Everything I do is me just trying to be a shitty imitation of fictional characters I respect. I realized this a long time ago though, what I just recently realized though is that ill never be able to be like them. Not even the most realistic characters (Except for fucking Tomoko from Watamote, I seem to be the real life incarnation of her except male), I wished I lived in a fantasy so bad but I just dont. Im always being smacked back to reality by adults, no matter how hard I believe I can be something an adult has to play the reality card on me. Because if theres one thing adults hate, its teenagers who think they're special. I know I wont be able to be amazing at anything I do but fuck, please atleast allow me to think it. I dont care if its a dellusion I just need something to live for. Ive been off topic on this bullet point for awhile so let me go on the next already.

- Im either average or bad at everything I do. I literally go to the WORST school in my county, yet I cant even make the honor roll. Im not even at the top of my class at anything, and if I went to even a decent school I would quickly be the worst in my class as the recent standardized test I took proved. I admit this isnt to no fault of my own, im fucking lazy and cant pay attention to shit. I always find myself daydreaming about how good I am at something or how prepared id be for something a regular person wouldnt be, when in reality id break down like any regular person. Even at the things I take pride in such as videogames, I get my ass handed to me by people on a regular basis. Anyways you get the point by now.

- Theres one basis for everything I wanted to do in life yet im losing faith in. The basis for every decision i make is to help other people, and I take other people into consideration a lot. But im losing faith for multiple reasons that range from bullies in school to the assholes I see on the internet. Ive learned recently that a large amount of people are assholes. I dont feel like elaborating too much on this because we all browse reddit and we all know how awful people are on here.

- Im bullied in school a bit. Fortunately its not as bad as last year because these bullies atleast dont straight up say what they want to say to my face. Last year was the worst because they would make it very clear they were disgusted with my existence, if one of the bullies got paired up with me they would all have to say something. I never even did anything to them either, thats what hurts me the most. I dont have to provoke anyone yet ill still be the enemy of people. Its so unfair, whether im out in the real world where it will be my skin color, or in school where they just hate people as a spirt ill always be unwanted. And teachers see the ways some students treat others and dont say a thing at this school. They dont care about us, why should they when theyre teaching at a shitty school in the first place.

- Even disregarding everything I said earlier, I feel like this last reason is the main reason I want to just die and thats because I feel my future is bleak. Im not in a position headed for success and I feel ill never be. Im ugly, I go to a shitty school, I get shitty grades, my family isnt exactly rolling in money, college costs money and I have none of that, even if I take out debt to put myself through college ill still have the problem of living long enough to find a place to intern at all while trying to sustain myself, then after that getting a real job will be a bitch if I even get to this point, then ill be in my 30s after finally being able to get a job but now im in debt. Yayyyy welcome to the game of life, want to play again? I wont even have time to enjoy shit during all this. After highschool my life will be all down hill. I plan to kill myself after its over for this reason. 

These arent even all my reasons for why I want to die either, but at this point I just want to get to bed so I can get tomorrows schoolday over with.

And thank you ahead of time for anyone who took the time to read that shit and thank you even more if you respond. I just needed a place to rant and get help, thank you."

So I actually double-majored in computer science and meteorology. I'm currently in my last semester! Yay!
I don't have any internship experience with computer science, but I did do a nice internship with NASA before my senior year started. My current GPA is 4.0.


Last semester, I went to a career fair at my school. There I met with a couple companies, and one of them gave me an interview right after the fair. I was asked for a second interview, and then they offered me a job.

The salary is 55k and the job title is Software Testing Analyst. This offer was given to me in December and I had to two weeks to accept or decline (I thought this odd since I wouldn't be working for them until June). The company is very large and the location I would be at is in the southwest. 

First off, is this a good offer? My boyfriend keeps saying I could do much better, but I think for the southwest this is pretty common? I'm not really sure. I thought it was about 50-60k starting.

Anyways.

I ended up accepting the offer. Many people close to me lost their jobs recently, so I was a bit anxious about just getting a job after college in general. I did research the company a bit and most people seem to enjoy working there. The benefits are great, they have a good amount of paid holidays and vacation time, etc...

Well, I had emailed another company that I met at the career fair shortly after it was over inquiring as to when a good time to apply would be (since I wouldn't be graduating till next semester). They never replied. Until today. I just got a voicemail from them asking if I was still interested.

I was quite interested in them at the career fair. But I've already accepted the offer from this bigger company. My boyfriend and my family keep telling me to try for it. But I'm not sure if that's bad practice. 

Any advice/insight is appreciated :)

TL;DR: Accepted an offer in December for a large company. Don't start till June because I'm graduating this semester. Another company has asked me for an interview recently. What do?"

2yk7az,3,2015-03-10,Is it possible to automatically link a new table in a new separate tab to an existing overview table in a different tab,[deleted],excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/2yk7az/is_it_possible_to_automatically_link_a_new_table/,"I'm currently interning at a company and I have a question.

Every month my department has a specific meeting. One person makes minutes of this meeting (in Word) and I (the intern) have been compiling these minutes of past meetings into one spreadsheet. This is done to get an overview of the topics that are discussed. With pivot tables, we can get an idea of how important certain subjects are.

Now I'm trying to make a template so that (in the future) the person who makes the minutes, can immediately write them in Excel, and immediately see the impact it has on the overview.

How I have everything set up now: one excel file, the first sheet is the overview of all the meetings (in a table) with their topics and such, the following sheets are all the separate meetings. I already linked them so that when I change something in f.e. jan'14, it changes the same cell in the overview table.

My question now is: can I make it so that every time a new month(sheet) is added to the file (so after a new meeting was held), it can automatically add the contents of the new sheet into the overview table (first sheet).

I was also thinking of changing it so that every single month is a separate excel file and there is 1 file with just the overview, but I wasn't sure if I could get them to link properly then?

Any suggestions are great. I just want to make it easy so that the next person doesn't have to copy, paste and link everything every single month, but just has to press a button (or two) and it does it for them.

Or do I have to provide separate tabs for the upcoming months already in advance? That's doesn't sound like the best solution for the future though?"

I'm an incoming student who will be studying Economics and Business with Eastern European Studies at UCL starting this September. I have always been interested in consulting, and I want to make the most of my time at university to network and try to decide for certain if consulting is something I want to/am able to make a career out of. So I have a couple questions:

1. Do top consulting firms recruit from UCL? Clearly I'd love to start a career off at companies like MBB, but of course I'm interested in other firms as well. I want to be sure that I do everything possible to make sure I can land a good job out of university.

2. What are some tips for networking and connecting with potential employers? Are there any activities/societies I should involve myself in that will impress a consulting firm? What other consulting-centric things can I do at uni that will help me kickstart a career?

3. Are there any great consulting firms out there that I don't know about, but should keep my eye on? I'm pretty new at this, so basically all I know are the really big ones (McKinley, Bain, Boston).

4. Any other advice, especially related to networking and internships, is VERY much appreciated.

As a side note, I'm also open to working in Eastern Europe, especially Russia or Poland. I speak Russian nearly fluently so language is not an issue. Would consulting firms consider this a plus, or would they not care if I'm bilingual?

Thank you! Once again, I can use all the advice I can get, and any information you can provide is truly a huge help to me. :)"

The recruiter sent me to another recruiter (from a different company).
I found it strange, but figured it wasn't a reason to stop pursuing the job.


It took weeks for him to set up the interview, which he blamed on their end.


I finally got to the interview, I thought it went swimmingly.
We had good chemistry.
In regard to the coding question, they mentioned that the one they usually use would be to easy, which I found very odd. ( it was to write a method that calculates area of a rectangle and prints if it is a square). So in the end I drew out a diagram of of how the rails framework works.


Based on all this, I felt great about the interview. All my instincts told me it went well.
At that point I asked the recruiter for contact info for a thank you note. He said to send it to him, and he would pass it on (not ideal, but fine).


He called me later to say they rejected me due to lack of experience.
I am suspicious, as they had literally said I was too advanced for their usual coding questions.


I asked him for the contact info, no response.
I tried to find the contact info for the people I interviewed with, but to no avail, I an going to try again by going  through the main office HR.


My questions are: would I run into issues by going to a company directly and asking  for feedback (or an internship) because I went through a recruiter first?
Is it crazy to be suspect of the recruiting people involved for the decision in this case?

Any other thoughts or advice would be welcome and appreciated

I'm currently starting my third unpaid internship working with a non profit start up because it's related to what I'm planning on doing for Grad school.  My previous two internships were a campaign internship (2 months) and a Senate Aide internship with a U.S. Senator (3 months). Neither of these internships offered a paid position during or after completing the internship and were explicitly for experience. Any possibilities for employment would mean relocation and an industry I'm not keen to work in (long hours, high turn over).

I'm desperately trying to find something. I've been applying endlessly to entry level administrative positions. I've joined an employment agency and performed very well on all the testing - proficient in word suite, professional level typing/data entry speed/accuracy.  Although I haven't seen so much as a 1 day offer from the job agency.

Collectively I have 5 months of office experience through my internships working directly with the public doing phone calls, scheduling, data entry,drafting official correspondences, public interface, recruiting/organizing volunteers, research, writing, etc. 

I'm currently working at Macy's as a sales associate. I've stayed purely because I'd like to have a current employer to list on my resume, although I do perform well at my job (top sales/credit performer) and I'm well liked by management. They've been entirely supportive of my plans to move onto better things as well. 

I'm at the point where when interviewing for low paying jobs I encounter a lot of scrutiny and suspicion from employers who assume I can easily find a better jobs. The decent entry level positions I'm applying to are completely unresponsive.

Location is a bit of a challenge. I currently live in a fairly rural area with a small metro area nearby and job prospects are rough. The majority of jobs are medical/insurance related and require special knowledge. I just received another rejection email from a insurance company in the middle of typing this.


I'd love any advice on how to improve my current position/ resume. I'm just at a loss of what to do to improve my chances of landing anything beyond minimum wage.

2ylpx2,6,2015-03-10,Drop important algorithms course because of low grade?,haldyon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ylpx2/drop_important_algorithms_course_because_of_low/,"I am a third-year undergrad taking the algorithms course at my university, arguably the most important CS class we have, especially for interviews.  However, I am not doing well.  I got a 50% for the first midterm, while the average was 75%.  My homework grade is around a 70%.  The course grade is 25% homework and 75% exams.

It seems that the optimistic situation would be 70s for the other two exams.  That would give me a D in the course.

The drop deadline is in a few days, so I can't hold on to see how I do on the second midterm.  I am strongly considering dropping the class because my GPA is already not good (2.95 out of 4).  I know many companies do not ask for GPA/transcript, but there are still many that do.  Either way, I would like an acceptable GPA.  If things go worse than expected, I might fail the class.

However I hesitate dropping because this class is fundamental for CS theory and interviews.  I have done two internships in the past three years of college, one at a well-known company, one not.  I will be returning to the well-known company for another internship this summer.  But the truth is I am weak in technical interviews.  I have not read CTCI and there are many interview areas where I am unfamiliar with and would probably fail.  I had several interviews for this summer but got rejected from all of them, which is why I accepted the return internship at last-year's company.  I know I can study interviewing on my own, but it would be more convenient to do it while taking the algorithms course and get it out of the way.  Also, many sophomores are taking it, so if I dropped and took it next semester as a senior it would make me even more behind.

As to why I am doing poorly, I am taking this along with four other math/CS classes, so I am always tired and stressed.  I go to sleep around 4am most nights and wake up in the afternoon, missing most lectures.  But it has been more than a year that I've had this habit of sleeping late, not going to lecture,s and cramming for homework and exams, and I feel like I don't learn well during lectures anymore (yes I'm not the best student).

So I would appreciate your advice on whether I should drop the class and why.

Summary

Yes drop: probably get D or even fail, bad GPA, some companies care about grades

No drop: material is important for interviews, get required class over with

Thank you!"

2ym2fc,3,2015-03-10,Old lessor trying to charge 15 grand. Help!,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2ym2fc/old_lessor_trying_to_charge_15_grand_help/,"So I posted this early yesterday with no response.  I am trying again to see if it gains any traction.

Hi LegalAdvice! So I have a bit of a story and I want to preface it by saying that I should have looked for help sooner but was stupid about it. So I am in grad school right now but last year I was only here for half a year due to graduating early. In order to avoid subletting I joined my girlfriend at her apartment building where she actually worked and lived. In order for me to legally live there they had me sign the lease that she was already on. She worked for her rent basically and told me every month that it was fully paid off. Fast forward a bit and I moved out in December for an internship and because of graduation. (Note, this original lease was for August 2013 to July 2014.)

Towards the end of the school year (May or so) she told me that she was basically forced out of her job and this place had basically terminated her lease. She moved somewhere else in May and I thought all was well. I received no notifications for late rent/fees/damages or anything. Until January 2015. I received a call saying that they had been attempting to contact my ex for several months because we owed damages to the tune of $15,000. Yes, 15 grand. I was incredibly scared of this. So I contacted my ex and she told me she would pay the entire amount after working out a payment plan of 1 payment of $1,000 and 23 payments of $400. I now realize after receiving this initial call I should have gone straight to a lawyer to see the extent of my liability and find out what could be done. But because she said she would pay the full amount, I didn't worry about it. I did sign the payment plan along with her because I figured I had to since I was on the original lease.

The first payment was due 3/1 and, of course, it wasn't paid by her like she said. The complex gave us until 3/5 to pay and as of today it still wasn't paid. So I finally asked for a list of all damages and a copy of the original lease and said I was going to talk to a lawyer. Thankfully, they sent both promptly.

The list of charges are as follows: 

Balance as of March (when it looks like she stopped working there): $772

Rent charges from March until July: $4,350

Skips, abandoments, evictions (rent September 2014-July 2015) (not sure how they can charge us for this or what this is exactly): $1,020

Damage Fees: $7,700 (this includes things such as replacing both beds, new furniture, replacing the carpet, deep cleaning, etc.)

And other miscellaneous late charges and fees for the remainder.

A few points I want to reiterate:

I did not receive any notices telling me the rent was not being paid. My ex kept saying everything was fine and that when she moved out in May they terminated the lease.

I received no notice of these damages or any other fees until January 2015. The lease was over July 2014.

My ex told me nothing about these fees or late rent or charges.
So today I set up an appointment with a lawyer for this Wednesday (3/11) and gave them the itemized list and original lease.

I will make edits as necessary but am not even sure where to start with asking questions. What am I actually liable for? Is there any way to avoid this entire thing? If it gets sent to collections, how bad will this destroy my credit score? Please help. I know the lawyer will help but what should I expect and bring to the meeting? I want to be fully prepared. Again, I will answer any questions and make edits as necessary. Thanks everyone!

It is almost impossible to get in contact with my ex now. She has blocked me from almost all means of communication and is refusing to answer any of my calls, texts, etc. because I am trying to be responsible and find out the entire situation."
2ym4bq,3,2015-03-10,Should I drop out of co-op?,madskillsmonk,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ym4bq/should_i_drop_out_of_coop/,"So I am looking for some guidance on my situation, specifically whether or not I should drop out of my schools co-op program.

Background: Second year computer science student, landed a sweet internship last summer with a startup in Toronto (where I am from), 
and without the help of my schools co-op directory/resources I landed an internship with a mid-sized (fairly well known) San Fransisco based startup.  


The reasons I am debating dropping out of co-op and pursuing a regular computer science degree are:
* I can graduate in 4 years instead of 5
* I don't really need the guidance/help finding a job , as it will only get easier having this summers job on my resume 
* I think that when I graduate I will want to go to the startup that I worked at last summer so the earlier I get there the better off it would be (something about getting into a startup earlier rather than later, etc).
* Taking a year/semester to travel after graduating (in 4 years) wouldn't put me too far behind


The reasons I want to stay in co-op:
* Extend my university career an extra year (kind of don't want to join the real world yet)
* I would get an extra 2 work terms before graduating; 2 different work experiences to make me more well rounded
* I want to get one at a big 4 before graduating and if I drop out that would only give me 1 opportunity (Although after accepting my offer for this summer I received an interview/coding test with Amazon, so it's likely that I would be able to get another chance next summer)
* If I land 1 or 2 of these jobs at bigger companies I can make a lot more money (this summer salary is pretty standard for Bay Area, $43/hour USD), whereas the startup paid significantly less (about $18/hour CAD).  I'm not in it for the money but having a decent amount saved up before working for a smaller company with the risk etc would be a good idea I think
* I have to do a mandatory 8-month co-op in my fourth year, so I was thinking about doing it at my previous company, thoughts on this?

So, any advice?"

I graduated college in May of last year with a bachelor's in Marketing. I've been interning in a company for a little over 3 years. I'm now looking to begin my career. I've been applying left and right. 

I interviewed in a marketing agency here in NYC and was notified today that I got the job. Its parent company is well known in the industry. When the company recruiter called me 4 months after I applied, I was caught off guard. He asked me some questions like what I'm doing now and how much I'm looking to make and how much I'm currently making (I know, I know). I annualized my salary for him (rough estimate) but told him that I'm paid hourly and I don't work full time; it is a paid internship. I told him I'm looking for 40-50k, after doing my research. He said they have 35k budgeted. I said I'd like to hear more about the job before dismissing it (it would be stupid to immediately say no). He made it clear though that they're really looking to fill the position asap. 

I had my initial interview, and I was exactly what they were looking for. But for one reason or another, they had me interview at a sister company. That was fine with me because I wasn't thrilled with the interviewer (who would have been my boss). The second and third interviews also went really well (boss and boss's boss). I passed the background check. And I got a call today from the internal recruiter who told me that everything went well and they really like me and want to hire me. He said something like, ""So the salary is $35,000 like we discussed, and we're sending the offer letter in the mail which details the specifics"". I asked if I was going to come in and discuss it further and he said no not really. So I said thanks and I'll call him back tomorrow. 

The thing is, I know that they're low balling me. Checking glassdoor showed me salaries in the same ballpark as what I'm being offered, but I know someone who is a manager in the sister company, and he told me that I'm definitely being low-balled and that I could/should push for at least $5,000 more. 

Now, as someone who is just setting their career and without any negotiating experience, what can I do? I liked the environment; it's friendly and casual, but from both the job description, the company itself (their parent is huge), and what my friend on the inside told me, I know they're low-balling me. 

The recruiter is a friendly guy, only a few years older than me. But I know he has an agenda, being a recruiter and all. I just feel like this whole thing is extremely rushed. On one hand, yes it's a job and I'm desperate for one after searching for so long. On the other hand, it's ridiculous that they haven't even hinted at negotiations. And yes, I know that it's my job to bring it up because they're trying to get cheap labor. But it's like they're pushing me through the doorway. 

Thanks in advance. "

REALLY worried about putting it on my resume,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2yn14f/did_really_badly_at_an_internship_really_worried/,"Last summer I did an internship at a very small startup in California doing web development in Rails. I worked remotely (work from home) in a term of three other interns. There were no full time developers, and not a single line of code was written before I started.

My boss is the CEO and founder of the company. To make a long story short, I wasn't able to accomplish much and screwed up quite a few things on the project. She is PISSED at me and won't respond to my calls, texts, or emails. She also made me sign an Invention Assignments agreement which states that all work I do belongs to her company (it's only enforceable in California).

This internship is the only internship I have, so I want to put it on my resume. I'm a senior and currently still looking for a full time job. However, I'm really worried about putting it on there because:

1) Let's say if I get an offer from a company and then they do a background check, which requires employment verification. So if they call her, she could tell them all kinds of bad things about me, and then they would probably have a bad impression of me and take back the offer.

2) What if employers require a reference from her? She will have nothing good to say about me, and my offer will be revoked.

3) She's not responding to my emails so I can't sign the Termination part of the Inventions Assignment agreement. So again, if my future employer calls her for the background check to verify employment, she could tell him that I am still bound to this agreement and they might revoke my offer for this.

4) Or what if she just doesn't respond to the employment verification background check at all? Like if they call and ask her if I ever worked there, she could just hang up and refuse to talk to them. And I'm pretty sure she would do this considering how much she hates me.


Guys, I'm REALLY worried and would like your advice on how to handle this situation. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!"

How should I prepare/get up to speed?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2yn8de/got_a_job_during_campus_interviews_joining_in_34/,"I got a job about six months back during campus interviews. I still have 4 months to finish this semester before I join. The company is still in startup phase and employs about 150 people, and pays quite well.  

I faced about 5 technical interviews of about 30-45 minutes during the recruitment, which were mainly about data structures and problem solving using trees, strings and arrays.  

The company is product based (single product)  and mainly develops that product for multiple platforms (Android, iOS, WP8, BB).  

These are my concerns:  
1. The company recruits 1 or 2 students from all the top colleges, and hence has all the kickass people working in it. I'm from a medium college, and though I was the only one chosen from my college, I know that my skills cannot match the people from the top tier colleges (I did an internship sometime back with 2 people from top tier colleges; got my ass kicked).  
2. That being said, and with only 3 months to go, how can I get job ready? I don't want to feel alienated and miserable and worthless (and get fired in the worst case scenario) because people around me are much more smarter.  
3. I'm solving questions from SPOJ and Hackerrank to hone my problem solving skills, and data structures. Is that enough?  
4. I suppose they'd give me an option to choose a platform I want to work on when I choose. Which one should I choose? I never did Android, but developed some for WP8.

So far, I have had interviews with 6 of the companies, feel as if the technical portions go great, &amp; every time I am able to solve the questions relatively quickly (e.g. 45 min coding problem, done in 20 etc.) and then we go on to talk about interests etc. Then, after the technical interview (usually the 2nd-3rd phone interview), I am in limbo. Usually from 2-3 weeks, before I get denied. 

I know they are large companies (vmware, yahoo, dell,  etc.) but is it strange to have an interview go well and then just go into the void? I felt especially with vm (which was specifically a rails position) that I spoke with the hiring manager too early in the process and faded out of memory as he interviewed the last 2 candidates. But outside of that I have 0 idea as to how to improve my internship prospects. 

I have been denied left and right, and have had an internship last summer (through an referral), yet many of my friends with minimal experience and (even miss coding problems) are still able to land internships. Also I am not socially inept, yet it always seems as if me and the recruiter get along great, while the technical people give off a cold disconnect (but still nice). 

However it seems pretty inefficient to apply to jobs with 2000 kids hunting for 2 open positions, so it may be the lottery effect that is killing me. In either case I am not sure how to find positions for more specific work that would fit my skill-set (ideally ruby/rails or java). 

*Excuse any grammatical errors, as this was written quickly. Also note, as an unrelated thing, I am not advanced in my formal coursework because I started my cs degree late after teaching myself while doing biology. But this has never come up, but perhaps some of the ideas such as (searching algorithms etc.) are indirectly questioned without me knowing? 

ANY ideas/help would be greatly appreciated. thanks!

* confusion due to past work experience, projects, skill set

My mind is scarred right now. Throwaway because reasons... Back story, I am a female in college right now (the female part is relevant) and I needed a new laptop last year so my dad helped me buy a new MacBook.  Fast forward to last summer, at the end of my IT internship, my department gave me an old PC laptop to use since my major uses mostly PC and they were just going to throw it away.  Since I now had 2 laptops and my dad's desktop was way outdated, I left my MacBook with him while I'm away at school since technically he bought it and also it's almost fool proof for him to screw up since all he uses is Safari anyway. Now to my fuck up, which just happened minutes ago.  Like I said my dad doesn't really know how to work the computer, just uses it for internet browsing so he asked me about a pop-up that kept alerting him to a software update.  I told him it would be good to update, but warned him that it would restart the computer when he updated.  So he needs to save his internet tabs because he uses the same Safari window everyday and just adds more tabs when he wants to open a new page. Whatever, one lesson at a time. Well he asked about saving the tabs he has open before he restarts the computer so he doesn't lose them... Actually I think his words were ""oh I should write down those pages so I can come back to them after the restart...  As in he was going to write down each URL by hand so that he could type them back in... *facepalm*  Anyway, I showed him how he could bookmark the pages so he could just come back to them and even gave him a little lesson on the shortcut (⌘-T) to open a new tab. This is where the fuck up happened.  Showed him how to open a new tab and how it automatically has little icons on the new tab page that show his ""Bookmarks"" and ""Recent Pages"".  I'm talking and chatting away and keep using that ⌘-T shortcut to show him how opening a new tab works and not really looking at the screen, but I keep explaining to him how it's got the icons on the new tab and he's trying to cut me short.  It's when I actually have my fingers pointing at the screen that I realize his ""Recent Pages"" includes Pornhub. I quickly try to exit out of the new tabs I've opened, but like I said I opened a handful of tabs to show him how the shortcut works so I'm just clicking the X as fast as I can. I cut my lesson short and fake a yawn and tell him I'm going to sleep, all while trying to pretend I didn't see it as I lean in for the most awkward hug of my life.  We both knew, but will never acknowledge it.  I'm going to go browse /r/interestingasfuck now so I can clear my mind. Oh god ew ew ew"

They asked me to go back.

It was three days ago I was picked up tired and hungry on that dock. The captain had found me with a dying flashlight in one hand and a turned-off radio in the other. This time I was the one who didn't say much, I just got out of the boat, drove home in a daze and fell asleep in my bed. I spent a lot of the time since thinking about what I'd experienced on Twain Island, the rest of it applying to jobs who didn't call back. I went back and read what I wrote. It sounds almost ridiculous now, like the ravings of a wild man, especially happening so soon after I woke up. The more I thought about it, the less real it seemed.

As I was applying for other guard jobs, the guy who runs the temp agency called me to tell me the Forensic Anthropology Facility had contacted them to ask about hiring me again. With no hesitation I told him I had no interest in going back to that island. While I was at it, I thanked him for not warning me about the nature of their research. He swore to me he didn't know- I didn't believe him- and told me before I made up my mind that they were willing to raise their rate by almost thirty percent. “I think they’re tired of giving the free tour, if you know what I mean,” he said. 

It's hard to argue with that kind of money when you're unemployed. There was still the whole matter of the disappearing body, and the creepy laughter, and the traces of death in the guard's office, which were three very good reasons to never go back. I couldn't exactly ask him about all that without sounding insane, so I asked him the next best thing. “Did they have any complaints about the last time,” I asked. The way I figured, if a body got up and walked away on my watch, they might think I had something to do with it.

“If they had any complaints,” he said, “I doubt we'd be talking right now.”

He was right, of course. The whole thing was feeling more and more like something I'd dreamed up. About an hour earlier I had checked my bank account, which was getting grim, and now here I was saying no to a cushy paycheck. I thought of Eric's advice, how it was the easiest job in the world so long as you could manage the mental bit. Then I thought of my dad who worked in high-rise construction for thirty years, and once drove himself back to a job site after having his thumb sewn back on so he could finish out the day.

God help me, I went.

A thought occurred to me as the boat captain drove me over to the island: what if the body actually had gone missing and they were luring me back to question me about it, or even catch me in the act of doing it again? What if they'd gone to the cops but didn't have enough evidence to accuse me? My stomach sank, and I looked over at the old guy at the wheel. He looked back at me with a funny look in his eye. Maybe it was something. Maybe it was nothing. It was too late to turn around now.

When I got to the island it was still bright out, which helped get me off the dock and onto land, and I was interested to notice that no one had come to greet me when I arrived. I took it as a good sign and went to track down Eric. It didn't take long- he was at the computer in the guard's office.

“I didn't think I'd see you around here again,” he said with a laugh. Apparently the boat captain told everyone how ready I was to leave when he pulled up the other day. It was a little embarrassing, but to be fair no one had prepared me for the kind of shit I'd shown up for. Eric found it hilarious but I could tell he understood where I was coming from. While we were on the subject, I asked him if he had ever heard anything weird on the island, especially on the night shift. He asked me what kind of weird. “I don't know. Stuff moving. Voices.”

He got a soda from the fridge. “Uh oh. Don't tell me you're the superstitious type. That doesn't really fly here.” As he chugged the soda down I assured him I was a rational person, but he seemed skeptical. According to him, despite Twain Island being an island there were still plenty of animals that lived there. Some swam over, others came over on boats or floating garbage. “We’ve asked Doctor Christianson about animal control but he says it would ruin the balance of nature, which is important for their data or whatever. I think he just doesn't want to pay for it out of his grant money.”

It wasn't the first time I got the vibe no one liked the doctor. After I finished catching up with Eric he threw away his empty can and announced he was going to complete his final rounds before it was time to go home. I think he expected me to hang out in the office, like he would if he could, so it surprised him when I headed out in the opposite direction. I wanted to reacquaint myself with the island and the interns. Based on the look he gave me, he definitely thought I was a crazy person. 

The real reason for my walk was even crazier than he suspected.

No one was working in the main clearing, so I used the privacy to check the cage where the body had disappeared, or where I’d convinced myself it had, at this point I didn’t know what to think. It had been an uneventful return so far and I doubted I would get such a mild reception if they suspected me of something as gross as grave robbing. So as you can imagine, I was especially confused when I found the woman inside the cage. There like she never left. She was less an inflated bag of maggots by now, more skin and bones than the last time I’d seen her. Her rotting body was oddly comforting.

When I turned away from her, Bernard the intern was standing at the other side of the clearing with a clipboard in one hand and a ruler in the other, checking on one of the other bodies. I don’t know how long he’d been there but when I turned to leave he threw me a look too nasty to ignore. Instead of heading back to the office as planned I went his way and struck up a conversation. Something pointless about the weather which he stayed quiet through. When I was done with my bit, he not-so-subtly changed the subject.

He asked me what my interest was in the female specimen, and the way he asked it I understood what he was implying, which by the way is disgusting. I didn't know how to answer him without sounding insane, so I told him I'd heard some sounds out this way the last time, but when I came to inspect the site there was nobody there. But what he said next made my legs go cold.

“Did you move her?”

It took me a second. I said no, no, I definitely didn't, and would have no reason to, and I asked him why he would ask something like that. He didn't want to say at first, but after I asked a few times he told me the photos hadn't matched up from one day to the next. Specifically the position of the body.

I asked him if it was possibly animals, the ones Eric told me lived on the island, the garbage-riders. Like I was a child who'd asked a dumb question in class, he tapped the cage next to him with his foot and looked at me to say, “that's what these are for.” “What about gases,” I asked, all those things that happen when we decompose, couldn't that move a body? With no lack of attitude he assured me he knew which movements were natural and which ones weren't. “She was definitely moved. If it was you, you're better off coming clean.” I could see he wasn't going to bend on this, so I told him it wasn't me, and if he didn't believe me it wasn't my problem, and I went back to the guard's office. But I'd be lying if I said our conversation didn't weigh on me for a long time after that.

By the time Eric got back from his final rounds I was in a dark place. My thoughts were spiralling down and I was angry at myself for coming back to the island. I was giving strong thought to quitting and hitching a ride back on the late boat, and Eric could probably tell, since he was acting especially light and jokey, trying to improve the mood in the guard's office. I suspected it was less for me and more for himself, which he proved when he casually dropped that he had some big plans for the night, which would have been ruined if I hadn't shown up.

At that point Terri popped her head in for a few minutes to say hi and ask Eric a question about the alarm system in the main research building. Before she left she told me it was good to see me again. After she was gone Eric chuckled and said how obvious it was that Terri was into me. I told him that was bullshit. “Why do you think they asked you back,” he asked. 

“You were tired of giving the free tour,” I quoted. 

“There's other guys they could have asked. And she brought your name up like five times in the past three days. Said you have 'kind eyes.' Who else were they gonna bring back?”

I didn't put much faith in what Eric said, but it beat thinking about other things. It didn't hurt that Terri was pretty cute- in a weird, works-with-dead-bodies way. The thought of asking her out distracted me for a while. Soon enough I was alone. The boat came and left and like an idiot I didn't get on it.

I spent the first hour like the first night, on the internet, visiting the usual time-wasters, but after a while I started to think about what Bernard had said. To be honest, it pissed me off. This guy, this bug-looking prick, doesn't even know me, wasn't even there that night, yet he thinks he can throw around disgusting accusations. Pretty soon I wasn't paying attention to the screen- I was thinking about cornering Bernard in one of the more private areas of the woods and giving him something real to accuse me of. I'm not an outwardly violent guy, but that doesn't mean I'm incapable of it.

Something by the door caught my attention. Movement. I turned in time to catch a spot of darkness moving past the window, and for the second time that day my legs went cold.
 
The shadow was in the vague shape of a person. I’d like to say that I jumped out of my chair, flung the door open and jumped on the intruder like a damn security guard, but the truth is I stayed as still as I could. I listened to the grass rustle and I didn’t move a muscle until the sound was gone. A minute later I stood at the open door, shining my flashlight into the dark. And even though I didn’t want to, even though I hated to admit it, I found myself surrounded by the very familiar, very strong smell of rotting corpse.

My first instinct- and it would be yours, too- was to step back inside and lock the door, radio the police and shut myself in a broom closet until help arrived. But I also knew that dead bodies don't get up and walk around, that those things don't happen except in movies. I pictured my dad and what he would do in this situation if he was still alive. He would find whoever was screwing with him and jam his reattached thumb into their eye. My undetached one would have to do. 

Due to an overcast night the woods were already black. The way the flashlight's beam pierced the night reminded me of footage of deep-sea divers. I moved quietly between the trees and toward the main clearing and strained to hear even the slightest sound of footsteps or movement in the woods ahead of or around me, but other than the wind and the ocean I couldn't hear a thing. What made me happiest, though, was finding the woman's body in its cage where it belonged- even now that sounds like an unbelievable thing to find relief in- and after a quick check I discovered all of her roommates were in their respective cages, too, at least in this site. Taking courage from that I decided to finally do some proper rounds. There was a mystery on that island, something the employees weren't telling me, and it was time I figured it out.

I moved into the woods at a sharp angle, aiming to reach the shore at a particular spot I'd seen with Eric the other day, a point at the island's heighest where he said you could see a small cave opening at low tide. The point itself didn't matter so long as I had a target, though something about the overcast night got me confused, not being able to use the moon or stars as reference, and after a couple of minutes I found myself turned around. As it turns out, the island is larger than I'd thought at first, and it's very possible to get lost on it. I tried to correct my path using the sound of the ocean- just keep heading toward the waves- but after a minute I came into a clearing and was surprised to find it was the one I had left a few minutes earlier.

If I were a smarter man I would have said screw it and returned to the office, but my decision to find answers had made me too stubborn to take the easy way out. Instead I turned around and headed once again for the same spot on the shore. This time I made an even sharper angle. There was no way I was going to end up back in that clearing.

The good news is, I didn't. The bad news is I became completely disoriented by the night and the tree after tree after identical tree, and it wasn't long before I couldn't even tell which way the ocean was, the sound of waves coming through from all directions. Twice I came across body cages but I didn't stop long enough to get a look at them. It was bad enough putting my back to them in the dark. Thinking about their dead eyes on me put some speed in my step. If you've ever been lost, you know the feeling of frustration and hopelessness it brings, how you kick yourself for being so stupid. You blame yourself for every mistake you've ever made. Whether or not you believe in God, you start making pacts and promises. “If you just get me out of this I promise to be a better person,” even though you fully intend to forget everything you said the moment you're found again. Bottle up that feeling and let it loose on an island of cadavers, and you'll start to understand what went through my head in those woods.

When I got really desperate, I started to notice the smell of rotting meat.

With the breeze blowing so erratically through the trees I couldn't get a bearing on which direction the stink came from. Whether it was following me or I was following it wasn't clear. Only one thing was: it was getting stronger. I didn't know if I should walk slower to keep from stepping in something or run away from someone pursuing me. As much as I wanted to check the trees, my flashlight stayed trained on the ground, and thank God it did. Out of nowhere I came across a body, a pair of purple feet sticking up from a patch of green ivy. It wasn't even marked with a flag, which I thought was extremely dangerous, and if it had been, the flag had fallen and disappeared under the thick vines. The body was muscular, definitely a man, and as I got closer I saw it was missing its head and one of its arms. Flies buzzed on its freshly ruptured skin. Their whining voices got under my own skin, into my eardrums, and nausea bubbled up in my stomach, the taste of acid at the back of my throat.

I threw up behind a tree. Doubled over, wiping my mouth clean, a stick snapped somewhere in the woods under weight, as if someone had stepped on it. I straightened up and aimed my flashlight toward the sound of approaching footsteps, and I called out, “Who's there?” The beam of light found feet, not the corpse's feet but walking feet, feet wearing shoes, feet attached to legs and pants and a gray coat.

“You're contaminating my site,” the bearded man said. I didn't have to ask him for identification- it was Doctor Christianson. “The other guards don’t come this far inland.” 

“To be honest I’m a little lost,” I admitted to him. 

“This isn’t the place to do that,” he said as he walked over. I agreed completely. I told him I thought everyone had gone home by now. “I’m one of those fortunate few who does what he loves,” he said. “I get lost in the work.”

I wasn't sure how the statement made me feel about the doctor. On the one hand I admired his work ethic, but on the other a man who can get lost in this kind of work doesn't exactly make you feel comfortable being around him at night. “You missed the boat,” I told him, but he shrugged it off. “If I call for another, another comes,” he explained. 

“Did you happen to walk past the guard's office a little while ago?”

His face shifted. “Are you keeping track of me?” I shook my head no. “You worry about people trying to get onto the island. I'll worry about what they do while they're here.”

I nodded. There wasn't any arguing with a prick like that. He pointed me in the right direction back to the buildings. I thanked him and went to leave, but at the last second I turned back. There was something I needed to know. “This really doesn’t bother you,” I asked, but his expression told me everything. He was tired of this question, and not just tired of it, above it.

“I find it fascinating, not that I need to. The data I gather here will give police the evidence they need to catch countless criminals.”

“I guess I can’t get over the fact that they used to be people. That guy right there,” I pointed, “do you even know his name?” 

The doctor no longer looked like he wanted to humor me. “By any remote chance, do you know why I asked you back,” he asked. I told him probably because everyone else said no. “Because I don’t like to answer questions. That's why I chose an island for my research in the first place.” 

“They say no man is an island,” I offered, because I couldn't think of what else to say.

“'They' are worried about being popular.”

That certainly wasn't a problem he shared. I thanked him for helping me find my way, but by that time he wasn't paying attention to me anymore, he was studying the headless man and taking down some notes, so I left without another word and headed in the direction he'd said. It was surprisingly easy to find my way back after that. Within twenty minutes I was standing in front of the open door of the guard's office. As I entered the building, I tried to remember for the life of me if I'd left the door open. I tell you, I could have sworn I closed it.
 
I took a quick piss in the cramped bathroom, washed my hands and grabbed a soda from the fridge, downing it in three, long swigs. I threw the can in the garbage pail where it joined Eric’s and a few others. It seemed they were more concerned with recycling people than they were aluminum.
 
There was a big cork-board hung up in the eating area with a bunch of random things tacked to it- health notices, old flyers, a few articles cut out of medical magazines- but it was the photo that caught my attention. It was one of those unflattering pictures people love to take of each other at work. Messy hair and a few extra pounds only matter if it’s a picture of you, right? It seemed like a recent photo, probably taken with one of the digital cameras they use to photograph the bodies and printed out on the office printer, yet I didn’t recognize the guy in it. He was in fairly good shape, arms bulged against the short sleeves of his guard’s uniform. On his right forearm he had a tattoo of a green snake wrapped around a red apple.
 
I thought back to the body in the middle of the woods, where Doctor Christianson and I had talked. No cage, no flag, pretty muscular, missing the head as well as one of the arms.
 
Missing an arm. The right arm. 

Just to be safe, I locked the door.

#### Two Huge Mistakes New Entrepreneurs Make…And If You Should Even Be One.
 
A while back I was able to interview Andy Drish. Andy is a really cool guy who opened my eyes to a side of business that I’d never really dabbled in before — software. He is one of the founders of The Foundation, which is a company that helps people learn to start a software company from scratch inside six months.
 
We talked a bit about what starting a software company looks like, but there was one thing that kept coming up in our conversation that didn’t have anything to do with software, yet fascinated me…the mindset of an entrepreneur.
 
How some people have it, and some don’t.
 
And that’s a good thing! Not everyone wants to be an entrepreneur. Some people would rather plug into an existing model or business and do work that is meaningful and fulfilling, even if it’s not their name on the side of the building.
 
Depending on your personality, you could fit that mold, or you could be someone that wants to create a business and employ people. Either one works, so long as you have that passion and freedom to create value in the world.
 
I’ll let the conversation speak for itself. Check it out below:
 
#### Enter Andy
 
##### Andy’s Early History
 
On The Turning Point Where He Became an Entrepreneur:
 
So a few years ago I went through my first little quarter-life crisis.
 
I broke up with my girlfriend of over five years.
 
I quit my job.
 
I left my puppy and I moved.
 
I did all of this in the span of seven days
 
It was insane. It was the craziest time in my life. I quit my job to start growing my business, and I had this whole plan in place to focus on and succeed in that, but then the break up happened; it was unexpected and it was such a terrible thing.
 
To be honest, I started a period of binge drinking and studying pickup. Lame, right? Pickup is like a whole world of guys learning how to talk to women — that’s pretty much it.
 
I hadn’t been single for five years so the first thing that I wanted to do was learn what the pickup lines are that work. I went straight for the tactics.
 
&gt; When you don’t have what you want in life, you think tactics will get you what you want — but they won’t.
 
It took me about six or seven months to realize that it’s not actually the tactics. You need to learn how to become a man, become confident in your own body, and just comfortable with who you are.
 
Then, none of the words actually matter.
 
##### Andy’s Business History
 
I did all sorts of stuff in college:
 
Sold a course teaching people how to give presentations, sold T-shirts, tried starting a little internship company hiring college students
 
Some of these failed, some of these succeeded. By fail or succeed I mean they may have only made a couple of grand here and there.
 
Eventually, I began blogging a lot and making a lot of friends online and eventually launched a membership website online. We went from having no idea at all to six weeks later, a website generating income.
 
It was generating $6,000 a month in income, then six months later the entire site shut down and fell apart.
 
The reason it failed was because I didn’t have my core mindset right, which is why I’m so passionate about that stuff now.
 
I knew the strategies and tactics to build something profitable, but I couldn’t sustain it because the strategies and tactics stopped working. The strategies and tactics alone wore out, and then the entire business crumbled afterwards.
 
So after all that experience, I built a marketing company to help real estate agents get referrals in their business. That went really well, so well in fact that I sold that business and co-founded The Foundation with my business partner Dane Maxwell. That was just a couple years ago.
 
##### The Most Common Mistakes New Entrepreneurs Make
 
Before we get into the mistakes, there’s an important concept that I want people to understand: the window of entrepreneurship.
 
Peter Shallard in [The Shrink for Entrepreneurs](http://www.petershallard.com/)[1] taught me this. There’s a window of entrepreneurship for every business, and it’s first two to five years of getting started.
 
Whether that window is two years for you or five depends on how quickly you get started and how hard you work. It’s the stage in your business where the only thing that helps you succeed it is how quickly you take action, and the amount of action you take.
 
That’s the number one priority above everything else. You want to keep moving forward, take action as quickly as possible, because the more action that you take the more experience you’ll get and the more lessons you’ll learn early in your business’ life. Sometimes we learn lessons when it’s too late, better to learn them early on.
 
So, what usually happens is that when you start your business, you have a lack of opportunity, you have a lack of ideas, and you have a lack of money.
 
But then, some where in the 2–5 year range something shifts, and all of the sudden you go from lacking all of those things to having your baseline needs covered.
 
Now that your baseline is covered, the decisions that you’re making are not being made out of lack or panic. They can actually be strategic:
 
Which direction are we going to go? What’s the big picture? Where is this company going to end up?
 
To stay in business you really need to start thinking through things a little bit more at this point. When you’re in the beginning stages and you’re just trying to get your product to market, the most important thing is taking massive action as quickly as possible until you can get to that place. Once you’re sustainable, start thinking bigger picture for your company.
 
&gt; When you’re in the beginning stages, the most important thing is taking action as quickly as possible.
 
So that’s the first mistake. New entrepreneurs don’t move quickly enough to shorten the learning curve.
 
The second mistake that I see new entrepreneurs screwing up too often is that they don’t have a connection with their customer at all.
 
All they do is sit around with their ideas. They map them out on their white board and they never actually talk to the people who are going to be paying the money.
 
We have a mindset module in The Foundation called _The Fastest Path to the Cash_. The fastest path is always talking with customers.
 
People ask what it takes. What does it take to actually have a business? It’s not business cards, logos, or an LLC. It’s not even a website up and running.
 
None of that stuff matters.
 
The only thing that really matters is having a customer who will pay you for the problem that you’re solving.
 
The only way you know that your customer is going to write a check is making sure you are giving them what they want, and that comes from communication.
 
##### Are You Even Cut Out To Be An Entrepreneur?
 
There’s a certain element to being an entrepreneur. There are entrepreneurs that start businesses, but there are also some people that just aren’t born to do that. They just ultimately don’t want to do that.
 
I look at our team for example. We have some people on our team who are absolutely incredible and they’re creating tangible value for the company because they’re doing work that provides massive value to the world.
 
They’re not just sitting in a cubicle checking out Facebook and talking about how they hate their lives. They love the work they are doing. So you don’t necessarily have to be an entrepreneur to be massively successful. It’s really doing work that is creative in nature, work that aligns with what you want to create in the world.
 
#### Enter Cole
 
My thoughts to Andy when he shared this idea:
 
Yeah. Totally, it’s fulfilling work. I have those people within my organization too.
 
We call them intrapreneurs.
 
They’re not technically entrepreneurs. But within the organization they work for, within the umbrella, they have their own freedoms even though they’ve got the guidelines of, “Hey, you’re helping with the marketing.”
 
So it’s not that they just show up and pick a new thing to do every day. They’ve got the guidelines of what needs to be done but they get to do it in their own way.
 
Not everyone is born an entrepreneur, not everyone can be or the world wouldn’t work. If every single person owns their own business, then there would be no one to help build those businesses, right?
 
I actually watched a video of Gary Vaynerchuk explain that concept pretty recently. He says:
 
&gt; A penguin cannot become a giraffe, so just be the best penguin you can be.
 
He’s basically saying don’t try to be something you’re not and only become mediocre at it, focus on what you’re good at and be the best.
 
He talks about how within his organization, the top fifteen people who are not entrepreneurs but are helping him are going to be financially set for the rest of their lives.
 
They follow the leadership of Gary and are technically employees, but have the freedom of expressing themselves in a way that is completely fulfilling. And because they’re helping build his brand, monetarily they’ll be rewarded in ways where they never have to worry about income again.
 
##### My Closing Thoughts
 
Some people that might be reading this right now struggle with that.
 
_“I don’t have an idea.”_
 
_” just don’t have the risk tolerance of being an entrepreneur.”_
 
_“I like knowing that if I showed up, I get paid.”_
 
Well then, what’s important is to align yourself with people like Andy, Gary Vaynerchuk, or myself who are holding the flag and moving forward but desperately need people who share the vision, share the passion and just would like the leadership to be set in front of them and then having the creative space of their own to work as well.
 
The world can’t be 100% entrepreneurs, so if you’re thinking it might not be for you, then the concept of intrapreneurship is something you should study.

2yow9y,1,2015-03-11,"I need to choose between working at a prison for lots of money or working IT at a school for a whole lot less money, with the slight possibility of a promotion that will pay as much as the prison.",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2yow9y/i_need_to_choose_between_working_at_a_prison_for/,"I am 20 years old with a little college, but no degree. I am living with my girlfriend's family, paying really low rent. I am an ""assistant technician"" at a high school, i.e. I am an intern who gets paid minimum wage. Right now, there are a few actual technicians and one network admin and one director (the big boss). The ""network admin"" does literally nothing all day except eat and watch movies on his work computer and the big boss is looking to get him fired, but the network admin is friends with everyone at the district office, who are in charge of whether he gets fired or not. So in short, if he gets fired, a technician will get his job and I will get a technician's job, starting at around 50k.


My close friend works at a prison and makes 150k (including overtime) and if I got a job there (pretty easy to get), I would make 50k initially and it would increase every year, getting to about 100k in just a few years. I would get free health, life, dental, eye insurance and I would have no limit on the overtime I could put in (1.5 times normal pay).
I have 3 options I am considering.


1. Stay with the school and hope the network admin gets fired so I can have a technician's job, making minimum wage while I wait.


2. Go work at the prison (it would take quite a while for the job to start, at least a year from when I apply. I would work my current position until then.)


3. Try to get an IT job somewhere else that is a real job, not a minimum wage ""intern"" job. This would require me to study for and get a few IT certifications, which I wouldn't have to do to get the technician's job at my current workplace. I estimate it would take me at most a year to get the two main certifications and maybe one or two more optional ones. I have also been looking around and there are no open positions for any kind of administrative IT job, network admin, technician anywhere close to me, and I don't want to move.


I want to make money, but I also know that I should work in a job that I enjoy, and not one that is just for money. What should I do?"

-I have a GED, and I have not taken the SATs

-I am only 18, so I cannot claim independence for FAFSA, nor can I take a loan without a co-signer AFAIK

-It will be hard to get a scholarship from FAFSA because my mother's theoretical income is very high. However, she pays a large chunk of her income to loans, which is something the FAFSA doesn't consider.

-I am not very good at networking, I'm not a charismatic guy

Is coding/computers a good field to go into?

I have no issues with doing internships and volunteering to get a leg in on my resume either.

I've been interviewing with companies for internships as well as reading CTCI and I'd like to refine my interviewing technique since it might be holding me back a bit.

Occasionally I still rush into solving a problem by beginning to write the code immediately. Nowadays, most times I'll ask the interviewer if they mind that I first just kind of speak to them conceptually about one or multiple ways that I might tackle the problem. This latter way tends to help consolidate my thoughts and help give me a better idea of how to actually write the code. I can also try to think of questions I can ask that may clarify what they're asking for or what the problem requires. This is helpful especially since I have a tendency to be quite nervous and freeze up at the coding portion itself - even when I've solved the problem on my own before just fine in the past.

While I'm sure the type of interviewer also determines which process they'd respect more, I'm trying to figure out if I can just stick to one that's solid.

Is there a good step-by-step process that you would normally use? Obviously no single process can just solve the problem. But at an abstract level is there one that you've seen to be really helpful in guiding you to the solution while also giving the interviewer a nice look at how you problem-solve?

Any tips would be great!

I am currently finishing up a 4 year MIS degree at my university while working for a major consumer packaged goods company on their IT team as a project analyst. I was originally offered this salaried contract position after my internship with the company with fixed hours of 25 hours a week to allow for school with flexibility to work more or less depending on school work. I've clarified this with my director. However, as the project progressed and timelines delayed, I found myself putting in more and more hours due to key dependencies and responsibilities I have with the project. Since taking this part-time job, I have lightened my school work quite a bit and I am about a year behind.


The question and dilemma is should I focus on graduating once my contract expires and return to school full time (I have about 2 and 1/2 semesters left of courses)? Or delay my graduation while continuing to gain experience? I have already received a indefinite verbal extension from my director however I believe that my pay will remain stagnant until graduating. 


Thank you for any advice you guys can provide.

TL:DR - Quit Project Analyst role to focus on school full time or continue and do school part time until graduation? "

I am on a YINI sandwich course and after months and months of application forms, cover letters, CV and various interviews, I have managed to land a software engineering job for next year.

However, I am very worried about my ability to actually do the work. The job involves development of embedded systems using languages such as C. I have recently started learning C but am only as far as making relatively basic text-based applications (i.e. taking some form of input and making it output the correct response). The most advanced part about my work is that I am thinking heavily on the memory usage of my programs and using things like malloc - but even this isn't really an advanced skill. I have never worked on embedded systems in my life and have no idea how to go about it. Th employer told me that they do not use an OS 99% of the time and this, once again, is not something I am at all familiar with. It took me a few days to properly set up the C compiler on Windows, I would be completely lost having to go through doing something similar when I don't even have an OS. I will be involved in the development of large safety critical systems and thus any work I do must be absolutely perfect which just adds to the pressure!

So far, this is all feeling well outside my comfort zone. But I don't know whether it is meant to. Will it be acceptable if I turn up and have absolutely no idea how to go about doing any of this or will I simply get fired within a few days for wasting their time? Am I expected to know how to do the job or will I be taught all of these skills on the job? I am worried that the other interns will have far more knowledge than I do and I will be the dummy of the group, holding everyone back.

(Job/More School),[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2yqrc1/at_a_crossroads_and_need_advice_jobmore_school/,"Ok I have come to somewhat of a crossroads in life and could use some advice. Some friends suggested looking online to get a wider array of opinions, so here we go. I can clarify anything btw if needed. Sorry for the length, but I feel like the whole story is necessary. 
 
 I graduated college in 2013 with a degree in criminal justice and an internship with a state level criminal justice organization.

Ten months later I was hired at a county level police force. Halfway through the 24 weeks of academy, I realized that I am not cut out to be a police officer. I loved the law and investigative side of it (I was top of my class the whole time), but I couldn't shoot or fight worth anything. I do not thrive in a paramilitary environment. Plus being a cop is a profession where you have to really want it. The only reason I chose it is because it seemed like the logical next step from a criminal justice degree. I made the right decision in leaving. 

After I left the academy I started exploring cyber security. A contact at a major company told me to go get CompTIA Network and Security certifications and then come back and talk to him. I knocked out security right away. I took the network class, but never got around to taking the test. (Subnetting and binary needed more study and it fell to the wayside after I got my part time.)

It is now one year and 70+ applications later since I left the academy. I've been working part time for a family friend. 

At this point, I've considered going back to school for a degree in IT with a focus in systems and security. (Offered through a local county college very close to me) It would take roughly 2 years if I also take summer classes. My parents have graciously offered to help me financially and house me again. However, I would still need to take out loans. I feel like this will give me a better understanding of tech and computers over just doing certifications. 

Here are my choices:

A.) Continue to look for jobs in the criminal justice field. (That hopefully don't require a paramilitary academy.)

B.) Go back to school for IT degree and sacrifice 2 years I could be working, and spend a lot of money to do so. However, this might open more opportunity than just having a crju degree. 

C.)Stretch out my IT education while working part time. (Will this cost more in the long run?)

D.) Focus on getting certifications over an actual IT degree. (I feel like I will need more than just Network+ and Security+ though...) 

Both my family and friends have asked me. ""Well what do YOU WANT to do."" Honestly, I have no clue. There is no magnet pulling me one direction or another. I have absolutely no clue what to do or what I want.  I feel like going back to school would be very beneficial and fun, but I'm still weary of time and money commitments to an ultimately unknown endgame.

It's an interesting project and I'd get to mess around with awesome technologies that I wouldn't have had access to but I'm worried I just won't impress. I'd be the youngest person in the group by 4 years and am sure they have a lot more capabilities than I do. 

Another possible down side is that it's unpaid, and while in the grand schemes of things that isn't too bad, I had another internship last summer and was paid incredibly well, and I feel like chasing the money again this summer."

However, I feel like I'm not learning that much at all. I'm always asking for work and always seeking out new projects, but given the already established nature of the product my team is working on and the established nature of the company, there's not really much to do.

2yrthd,1,2015-03-12,Feeling Bad About Life Decisions and Need Help,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2yrthd/feeling_bad_about_life_decisions_and_need_help/,"Hi Reddit,

For the first time in my life I'm feeling lost and could use your help. What I write below will most likely include lots of unimportant details so I will put a tldr at the end. 

To give a little back story, I am a 24 year old male. I moved out to Los Angeles to become an actor at 17, (yes I know it's cliche) and realized that I wasn't truly passionate about the craft, so I quit at 23 with nothing to show for that time. I had been testing out the waters at community college while acting by getting my prerequisites done for a communications degree, but decided after finishing the courses that I wasn't too keen on that path, so i switched to a business marketing degree and managed to get accepted into Pepperdine and a state school last year. After considering the pros and cons, of going to Pepperdine, PROS being that it's a beautiful campus, has a fairly well known name in some circles, and looks good (maybe) transferring to other schools, CONS being; Pepperdine is 60,000 a year, is SUPER religious, an example being it requires 4 spiritual gatherings a month (basically a way to get you to go to church every Sunday), tacks on so many additional general education requirements that it would take three years to graduate even after transferring, that I decided on the state school which is around 6000 a year.  Here are some of the reasons why I feel so behind (besides being a 24 year old still getting my bachelors which makes me feel like a loser). 
1) I still have to complete one general ed course, business calculus, which I am taking at the community college level. I just recieved a 43 on the first test, and must get a C or above in the class to move forward with my education.  The class is a roadblock to my upper division courses and is the only course I am taking right now. You may all wonder how I could do so horribly;  I actually did better than most people in the class, except for the 3 people who are naturally good at math, and he doesn't curve the grades. I don't like laying blame on teachers, but feel powerless in this situation. I'm putting tons of effort into a class I hate, feel screwed by the teacher, and must do well in the class to take upper division courses for my bachelors degree at a state school. Which brings me to number two.
2) I'm not knocking state schools, but I'm wondering if I could make it into a better institution or if it's even worth it at this point. I was considering applying to USC, but the way my Calc class is shaping up, that may not be an option. On top of that, I'm worried that any extra time in the school system is going to be more detrimental than useful.
3) I have been lucky enough to have been helped substantially by my parents up to this point. My education is taken care of, as is my housing, and I even have a trust fund left by my grandpa that pays for groceries etc, while I'm in school. The issue is that this actually makes me feel like more of a loser. I have zero money saved up, and I feel like the least I could have done is saved the money I get each month. The only work experience I have out here is catering and bartending, which isn't a career path I want to go down nor does it do much for my resume. I am currently unemployed to spend (waste) my time trying to do well in the business calculus class, and don't have any internship opportunities lined up.
3) My dad is a lawyer and lost his job for a second time. The first company went under, and the second company hired him and decided they didn't really have a use for him. Watching this process has made me realize that you can fail at something you don't like , so I'm stressed about what to do with my life. I was considering law school, another long stretch of school late in my academic career, but I doubt it would make me happy.
4) What does make me happy? Well as you may have guessed, math isn't my strong suit. I consider myself a decent writer, and am currently working on some children's books and a script. I have an app idea, and two documentary ideas, but that is always my problem.  Lots of ideas, little direction, little follow through, and nothing substantial to show. 
5) I'm mildly depressed.  I realize a lot of the stuff above seems trivial, but it's amplified by a lingering uncertainty of what my future prospects are.

Tldr; I am 24 still in school, have no real work experience,  no money saved up, don't know what career path to take, and am feeling overwhelmed by my lack of direction.

I will do my best to answer any questions in the comments but there will be no further updates, no sudden revelations, no continuation of this story. What is done is done and what will happen is unavoidable.

I'm sharing this with you all because if I don't tell someone, anyone that might listen, I might go mad overthinking it. Maybe it will also help me make sense of what has gone on the past few days and come to terms with a lot of skeletons in my closet. I wish this were only about my old man, some things are better left buried and...well...every skeleton has been dug up and plastered on the walls. 

This is one of those very few times where I don't have to alter much at all save for a few personal details. Maybe that's the most disturbing part. 

My father suffered two successive strokes at the tail end of 2010, it was sudden, unexpected and it devastated our family to see him in hospital struggling to write his own name and having severe trouble remembering anyone save for his wife. By the time I had concluded the 3 hour drive from university to visit, he was in better spirits, talking away to himself about his favourite John Wayne film and openly questioning whether he was a fun man to be around, making the nurses and interns chuckle as they tended to him. My dad was the light of any room and we loved him for it. Even with one half of his body numb and undoubtedly terrified out of his mind not knowing anyone, he still wanted to make other people smile. 

My mother stood adjacent to his bed, conferring with the neurologist in a hushed tone, looking over at my father as if staring at a dead man walking. I'll be honest, it was very much like looking at two worlds operating simultaneously within that room. My father seemed completely fine bar the hospital gown and slightly drooped face, my mother looked like she'd already accepted his fate and the neurologist didn't look any better. Maybe I'd just fooled myself into thinking the best of things out of sheer exhaustion. 

Anyone who has ever dealt with a stroke victim knows there's always damage of a collateral nature, often times it manifests itself in the ugliest and most dreaded form; memory loss. 

Initially, it wasn't anything too bad. Occasionally we'd catch him having conversations with people who weren't there or forgetting names, but he was still the same no-nonsense builder he'd been since I was born. Except now he harboured frustrations from not being able to work and keep occupied, so his ramblings became longer and far more laboured. Trying to get a man who worked his whole life to succumb to the monotony of early retirement at 58 can be a trying and upsetting process for anyone involved, let alone the victim of it.  

A year later, we were informed he required invasive brain surgery to remove a grade 4 aneurysm in his frontal lobe, had it been to the left even by a half centimetre, it would've been deemed inoperable. Lucky us. I remember how scared he was the night before the surgery, sitting there in that cold, sterile room. A man pushing 60 surrounded by men 10-20 years his senior in medically induced comas wasn't the most comforting of situations. Up to that point, it was the most terrified I'd ever seen him. I still remember the weak smile he gave before we left him alone in that room. It was the look a man gives you knowing it may be his last, it was a look that screamed to me;

""I'm scared, but I love you both."" 

My father was not a superstitious man, none of us were. But he was always open to what comes after death, remaining doubtful that there was any notion of a deity or afterlife. But the night of his surgery, I saw doubt in his eyes. He told me what to expect if he didn't make it, what to do with the money and to continue my university studies no matter what. He even told us what to do in the event he came out of surgery different or brain damaged, which to put in his own words was:

""Pull the damn plug."" 

We went home that night and didn't sleep, we knew his surgery was early hours of the morning and neither of us could bear waking up to the sound of an early phone-call bearing any kind of news, so we opted to power it out until midday when we'd get the all clear and could come visit him, undoubtedly cheery and making terrible jokes.

We got a call at 7:30 in the morning. 

In between a nervous breakdown and flippantly ignoring the laws of the road we got there in one piece. We were greeted with the specialist giving us a laboured handshake, proceeding to explain that due to the aneurysm bursting during open surgery, he was forced to make a choice: Let my dad die on the operating table or try to save his life with a very, very risky manoeuvre; cut off the blood &amp; oxygen supply to his brain in order to clear away the majority of the aneurysm, patch his skull up and hope he lives through the weekend. 

He essentially allowed my father to meet the reaper and shake hands. I was grateful, don't get me wrong, but in those early stages it was...difficult. 

I will never forget the first time I went into the brain injury clinic in Oxford, where the horror began.

Where I looked down the hall, through a sea of coma patients floating in the sea of purgatory where what was, is and will be permeates the very fabric of time. Expunging the soul from a hollow shell and beckoning it towards the decrepit, emaciated, contorted and ominous looming creature standing at the epicentre of it all, waiting for each soul to slip away from the body...it is there that I stared death in the face. 

And it is there I watched him grin at me. 

I find it hard to describe the sequence of events properly, it's almost like remembering a dream or re-telling an old story alongside a friend and neither of you is 100% certain of which details were right. 

But something within me convinced me that what I saw was a side effect of the grief, because when I blinked a couple of times and allowed my eyes to adjust to the darkness of the morose ward, the figure disappeared and I became completely focused on my destination at the end of the hall. 

Anyone who has ever been to an ICU ward will tell you it's not just the smell that is off-putting, it's the sheer silence save for the automated machines. The awkward, crushing silence. If the sounds of death could be manifested, they would present themselves in the form of steady beeping and forced breathing. 

Not many things prepare you for seeing one of your parents in such a state of incapacitation that they are barely recognisable to you. You're told by the Neurologists and attending nurses that you won't recognise them, but you always scoff and in your head just assume that 20 years of being around your parents every day gives you a warranted sense of assurance that you could never forget the contours of their face, the stress lines in their forehead or the silly way they part their hair. 

Standing there in front of the figure bloated from chemicals and being wired up to machines to such a degree that skin is barely visible through the gown, I felt like all familiarity had been banished from my mind. 

The machines did their job with precision and efficiency, monitoring his heart rate, brain activity and most importantly his blood pressure. If that spiked, it ran a high risk of further complications, so it would send out a loud alarm for the nearest nurse to attend to. It all worked fine, until I started talking to my father. 

It was during the middle of our conversation, assuring him that all his affairs were being attended to and that if he wasn't able to make it, not only would I finish my university degree at the time and that my first born son would be named RJ in his honour that something went wrong. 

The beeping rang out, cutting the unnatural silence like a gunshot. The nurse calmly walked over and adjusted the machines, explaining that his blood levels were elevated as if in response to hearing me. My heart broke at the notion because even at that point, I had resigned myself to the fact he was already gone. 

I said my goodbyes and promised I'd return tomorrow with my mother. It was only when I reached the other end of the hall that I heard his blood level alarm ringing out again, the nurse hurrying over and giving me a pained look as she passed me. 

Something had made his levels spike to dangerous heights; it was lucky she was there. 

I felt a chill as I left the hospital to get in my car; I had a sense of foreboding that didn't leave me until the next time I saw him. 

***

Christmas came and went, no signs of change in his condition despite our silent pleas. Mum stayed awake almost constantly and I blocked out the pain where I could with music, video-games and ironically, by writing. 

Relatives said they'd pray and go to church, friends kept us company. Both gestures were appreciated but neither did any good in the long run. Just a temporary bandage on an ever expanding wound.

It was New Years Day when we got a visit from one of our neighbours, Ray. He was a kind, reserved man who generally didn't go outside unless it was a priority; with him being a few weeks short of 90, I certainly couldn't blame him. Seeing him at our front door that afternoon brought with it an odd semblance of comfort, he offered his sympathies and asked if he could speak to us, my Mother was suffering from a migraine and retired to her bedroom, leaving us to chat. I poured him a glass of Brandy, my dads favourite and asked him what he needed. 

""You know, in my life I've seen an awful lot. Nearly 100 years on this Earth, most of my friends and family now buried, save for my wife &amp; Son. Death has made himself very acquainted with me over the years."" He smiled wistfully into his glass, swirling it as he spoke. ""I still remember the fear on my best friend Bill's face when we stormed the beaches at Normandy. He was only a scrawny lad, ""switch"" we called him. But he was one of our own and we looked after him as we would a little brother. On the boat over there I remember him looking out to shore and muttering under his breath, almost pleading. I put my hand on his shoulder and asked him what he was doing. Not breaking his gaze or even blinking, he replied ""Making a deal with death."" 20 minutes later we hit the beaches and Bill shoved me out of the way before I tripped a land-mine. He lost both his legs and bled to death right there.""

There was an uncomfortable silence, I didn't really know where this was going but maybe he was trying to relate to our situation and I have to admit, it somehow felt comforting, like a grandfather telling you stories as a young boy.

""He was only 19, poor lad. Gave his life for queen and country...and for me."" Ray stared up from his glass; he looked tired. ""He coughed and choked as he spoke to me. Told me to look after his family, watch over his little sister. Then...then he apologised."" Ray's hands began to shake and he stared at the photo of my father and me from a holiday long past, propped up on the mantlepiece. 

""Why would he apologise?"" I asked, hoping I wasn't prying too much into an old mans past.

""Because he saw Death looming over."" Ray replied, his voice cracking as if he could remember that day with infallible recall.

""That's understandable though, given his injuries..."" I trailed off, going into detail made me uneasy.

""No, lad."" Ray said, his hands shaking as he downed the last of his glass, 
""He saw Death looming over **me**."" 

There was an uncomfortable silence. I didn't want to be the one to rationalise the situation, I was far too mentally exhausted for that. Eventually, Ray elaborated. 

""You've seen it, haven't you lad? Something that shouldn't have been there."" He stared at me, unblinking.

""Look, I know what you're saying, but I don't believe in ghosts or supernatural entities.""

""And you think I do?"" He laughed nervously. ""Perish the thought, war took away any notion of demons, ghosts and gods from my mind. Man is the true evil in this world; there is no need for something else to fill that void. But Death, well he's a part of life whether you want to accept that or not."" He poured another glass of Brandy. ""Death has always been shown as a hooded creature with the scythe and the skeletal features, but that's not what most folks see. That's not what I've seen. Judging from the look on your face, that's not what you've seen either. I won't pry any further and I didn't come here to talk you to death. But I did come here to accomplish three things: Offer my sympathies, let you know I understand on many different levels what you're going through and to issue you a warning."" 

""A warning? Why?"" He stood up to leave, shaking my hand and saying nothing as he walked to the door. It was only when he crossed the threshold and turned back that I saw why he was so reluctant to tell me. 

The look. The pained, terrified look on his face when he stared into my eyes.

""Because I've seen him recently, leaning over your father and wailing."" 

He bowed his head and walked down the road, muttering as he did; if it hadn't been so quiet, I may not have picked up on what he said. I wish I had been unable to.

""Pity, he's so young...just like Switch.""

My dad, incredibly, woke up out of his coma on January 8th 2012. He'd had a tracheotomy and was unable to speak while it healed. 
This was more frustrating for him than anything else--not only unable to communicate properly with us, but due to the trauma his brain had received during surgery, he had virtually no memory of us. 

The only times we could get him to communicate were if there was only one person there. He seemed to really struggle to pay attention otherwise, like there was simply too much to focus on. He would never meet our gaze, either. Always looking over our shoulder and nodding, some basic form of acknowledgment that ultimately amounted to nothing. Just simple understanding from a simple man.

It was around this time we saw he wasn't getting better, we ended up sleeping a lot less, fearing the worst.

He saw a neurologist three days after he woke up and they informed us he'd suffered ischemia of the brain, which by proxy was causing something akin to Alzheimer's disease. Slow, but progressive. No timeframe was ever given and we were told he would regain most of his memories over time, but would ultimately lose them over the next few years. First his long term, then his short term. We were devastated; it was heartbreaking to watch him struggle. We made the best of it, and eventually shades of who he once was returned, like light shining through the cracks of a cocoon. He was happier, calmer and more child-like than he once was. 

I often felt when visiting that I was now the parent, the proverbial torch handed over to me despite him having survived the ordeal. The only thing that disturbed me all these years was his reluctance to be left alone anywhere. You have to understand that my Father was by no stretch of the imagination a timid or weak man. He had worked for nearly 40 years as a Plumber and Builder; he was small, but strong and fiercely independent. To see him reduced to a man who would have panic attacks when he was left on his own and not be able to explain why was more troubling than anything else. 

It was only this past weekend that I found out why. 

Virtually every time I make the 300 mile drive home, regardless of what time it is or how exhausted I am, I will sit in my living room with my parents and catch up. I'm an only child and it took them 12 years and the better part of £27,000 (Nearly 60,000 dollars) to have me through IVF and I was doted on, even at 23. 

Once my mother would go to bed, my dad would pour a glass of whiskey and we'd talk about politics, life, love and where it all goes. Sometimes we'd discuss the entirety of his injury, other times we'd discuss where he'll end up. But he would never ask me anything, just sit and listen. 

This particular night, after a hearty laugh over his weight gain due to the medication he was on, he asked me something that still resonates within me. 

""TJ, do you know how many visitors I had while I was in the hospital?"" 

It took me a moment to mentally count them all--I had to include the ones from when he'd been in intensive care and non-responsive.

""12 including me, mum, your siblings, my best friends, my ex and your two childhood friends.""

He gave a weak, grim smile and stared down at his glass, much like Ray had done some years ago. 

""No, son. **13**.""

""Dad, you said visitors. I didn't include your specialist.""

""I don't remember much about the recovery process, but I do remember all the voices and smells of the people who visited me. I couldn't tell you when or most of what was said, but lying in that bed I got to remembering any and every encounter pretty well...and there was always one visitor who set me on edge every single time they visited.""  

""Why? Was it something they said?""

""It was the sounds he made, TJ. The godawful mixture of laughter and soft sobbing coalescing all at once like some horrible chorus of emotions. It got worse when I woke up. Can you imagine what it's like to sit in a hospital bed, throat healing up, unable to speak or scream but fully aware of your surroundings? I knew nobody and understood very little, but I still understood the concept of fear."" He took in a deep breath. ""Lying there in that bed, waiting for my 13th visitor to arrive, long after you'd all said your tearful goodbyes. He cut the air like a razor blade, he moved freely like blood from an open wound, his face...oh god his face TJ...the expression was frozen in anger, fear, joy, loss all at once. He would lean in close, making that horrible fucking sound and stare...just...stare at me, night after night. Unflinching, the sound never ceasing. You never forget a creature like that.""

He paused for a minute, lit a cigarette and took a long drag from it, his shaking hands subsiding with each second he inhaled. Once he'd finished, he stood up and turned away, walking towards the conservatory doors, his frame shaking as he did. But not because one side of his body was weak--he wasn't even using his cane. 

He was sobbing quietly, his back still turned as he tried to hold his composure while talking to me.

""On the last day, before I was transferred to the general hospital, he came back. He crawled into view, each awkward motion of his limbs complimented by the cracking of dislocated joints, as if he were an old-world spider. There was no grace, no swiftness, no finesse in his movements. It was like watching someone with Polio move without their braces. The sounds didn't stop until he reached the foot of my bed. One large snap cut the air and he rose slowly, the black eyes never stopping their incessant stare, not once. His face wasn't a mixture of emotion anymore, it was just rage, the kind of rage where laughter seeps through as a nerve reaction. No other sounds save for his heavy breathing. He got off on my fear, it fed him. It was only after he saw me cowering that he leaned in close to whisper in my ear.""

My dad turned around, his eyes bloodshot and tears streaming down his face. In 23 years I have never seen my father cry--it was unnerving. But not as much as what he asked me, that's something that will haunt me to my very grave:

""Why, TJ? Why didn't you tell me what was wrong? You never had to go through it alone, I would've understood, I would never have wanted you to die alone like that. So afraid, so isolated...so young.""

The floor fell from under me, I felt faint. How could he know? There's nobody who could have told him. Not to mention he has no recollection of my teenage years. 

He put his hand to his mouth, tears flowing freely down his cheeks.

""So much blood, so much pressure. He was waiting there, bathing in the blood. He was waiting on the other side for you, he was there when your heart stopped, he was there when the physician spoke to you...when the skies turned back and no light could be seen...how could you let his happen?!""

I struggled to find words, this was not a conversation I ever wanted to have with my family. This was my past, not my present or my future.  

""Dad, I...""

""How could you let this happen to my boy?! He was innocent!"" 

I froze. Dad was no longer looking at me; his gaze went past my shoulder to something residing behind me.  

I didn't just feel a chill run down my spine in that moment, I gained a sense of dread that I can only describe as the instinct you possess when you feel your life is in imminent danger. Worsened only by the fact that I heard no response from behind me or felt any presence. I also felt an overwhelming sadness. 

I wasn't just worried about some supernatural entity behind me. 

I was watching my fathers mind deteriorate right before my eyes. 

""My boy...my poor boy...he deserved better than this. HE DESERVED BETTER!""

My dad threw his glass at the wall behind me, falling to his knees and sobbing as he did. My feet acted before the rest of my body did and I went straight over to him, pulling him in for a hug as he broke down, repeatedly asking why. My mother walked in alarmed and saw the state he was in. 

""Put him to bed, TJ. We'll talk in the morning. I'll clean up the glass."" My mother sighed. She might as well have been ageing in front of me from the stress that's been put on her the last few years.

I managed to get him to his feet and he silently complied, he passed out as soon as his head hit the pillow. 

""At least he's at peace for now,"" I thought. 

I barely slept that night, my dad's story repeating in my head and the unshakeable image of this creature becoming more vivid in my head. I suppose it's a very atypical reaction to being scared, not wanting to sleep for fear of opening your eyes to something looming over you in your room. 

I was more scared of what my father knew and who had told him. 
Some skeletons are best left in the closet and thrown in a deep hole. But someone told my father where to dig and what he'd find. 

***

I was due to go home the following morning, though truth be told I wasn't sure I wanted to go anywhere until this was resolved. Unfortunately, bills don't wait for anyone and if I still wanted a job to go back to come Monday morning, I had to leave. I gave my mother a hug and told her I'd be down for Mother's day; she smiled weakly and told me to call when I was home. Typical mother stuff, but I could tell she worried and she really needed a holiday. 

I shook my father's hand and he pulled me in for a hug, tighter than usual. 

""I love you son,"" He croaked.

""I know, Dad. I love you too."" I patted his shoulder, this kind of behaviour was somewhat foreign to us despite everything.

""And I'm sorry, I really am."" His voice began to crack.

""It's okay dad, you've been through a lot and you had a bit too much to drink. Happens to the best of us."" I forced a smile, the pit of my stomach still uneasy with the incident fresh in my mind.

""Not for that, TJ. I'm sorry because he's getting closer. I'm sorry because I thought I could reason with him, but he's a force of nature and he does his job perfectly. I'm sorry because he knows.""  

""Knows what...dad?"" 

His grip on me tightened. 

""He knows your time is nearly up...and he never leaves a job unfinished. He just waits. Death is ever patient. He let you go once, he's not going to do it again. I'm so sorry, son."" 

I didn't know what else to say. I patted my father on the shoulder and attempted to recompose myself. 

I finished my goodbyes and got in the car. As I backed out to the sombre wave of my family, I saw my neighbour Ray tending to his garden. He gave me a short nod, took off his hat and bowed his head as I passed.  Even he knew. 

 I put on my iPod and let Pianos Become The Teeth blast through as I screamed on my journey home, unable to do anything else.  

*""Pity, he's so young...just like Switch.""*

On September 24th 2007 I was diagnosed with a brain condition that puts immeasurable stress on the brain to cope with the high amount of information constantly surging through it 24/7. There's still a lot they don't know about the condition.

*""He was there when the physician spoke to you, when the skies turned black and no light could be seen.""*

I was told the pressure would eventually form an aneurysm in my head, one that over time would grow and eventually kill me.

*""So much blood, so much pressure. He was waiting there, bathing in the blood.""* 

There was a timeframe given but for the sake of some of modicum of privacy I will not go into it. On May 18th 2008 I attempted to take my own life; I was unsuccessful in my endeavour and have not relapsed since.

*""He was waiting on the other side for you, he was there when your heart stopped.""*

My mum knew about the suicide attempt; my dad was away on business and while he knew I had a problem, he never thought it'd get that bad. After much begging &amp; pleading, my mum agreed not to tell him. Neither of them know about my illness or what will happen. I still don't know who told my dad or how he could know. 

*""He never left your side, not once.""*

I think the worst part for me as a rational man is the validity of his statements, particularly the last one.

*""He knows your time is up...and he never leaves a job unfinished.""* 

It was only 3 months ago I had my last scan.

The aneurysm has grown

He is always waiting. 

He is getting closer. 

He never leaves a job unfinished. 

*""He deserved better.""*

Additionally, school is going well.

I'm thinking about the possibility of finding a junior/entry-level development position before I finish college, but am not really sure if that's feasible to look for (or achieve). As an alternative, I am planning on going for as many full-time internships as possible to optimize my experience before I graduate. Both of these considerations will slow down the completion of my degree; however, I feel it is probably worth it.

I am a Computer Science/Information Security major at John Jay College, currently as an upper level Sophomore.  Part of my coursework for my major will involve a semester long internship as a Senior, but I am looking for something that will give me some real world experience and a better grasp of what I will be doing after graduation before my capstone internship.

I have very basic C++ programming skills and 3 years of basic networking experience from my time as a Time Warner Cable broadband installer, as well as a high level of computer literacy and a Master Certification in Microsoft Office.  I also held a security clearance in the Army and had a high level of knowledge of communication systems.  I also have a strong work ethic and a great ability to quickly learn and adapt to situations.

Essentially, I'm looking to learn as much as I can about the world of computer science, programming, and information security as I can.  I have a lot of school still ahead of me, but would love the opportunity to get some real life experience in any capacity so that I can better put together the pieces while in class and ultimately, beyond.  I am also open to working as an unpaid intern, I really just want to get my feet wet.

If you would be willing or able to help me, please PM me.  

Thank you."

2ytyz8,2,2015-03-12,Is there any hope?,lambdadot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2ytyz8/is_there_any_hope/,"I have been looking for a job for the last couple of months yielding in mixed results. I would really like to work in a position that centered around programming day-to-day. To give you some background, I recently graduated from a state university with a BS in CS with a GPA of 3.95. While in school, I avoided doing internships out of fear for being judged for a past transgression. About 8 years ago, as a result of a bar fight, I was convicted of felony assault and served 6 months of jail time. Now, when filling out applications, I am having trouble getting callbacks, or when I do get them, I am rejected after a more formal application is filled out. Specifically, after they ask ""Have you ever been convicted of a felony?""


I guess my question is, does anyone have ideas for a suggested career path for me with this in mind? When deciding to go down this path, I envisioned graduating from school and someone understanding my situation and giving me a chance to work in a normal environment. Now it just seems that things are bleak, and I might have wasted time and money attempting to be something that I cannot."

 I applied to:

Marietta. -accepted.

University of Oklahoma -accepted.

Penn state -accepted.

Colorado School of Mines -accepted.

University of Alaska Fairbanks -accepted.

University of Texas Austin -rejected.

Texas A&amp;M --accepted into school but not Engineering.

USC - haven't heard yet.

Georgia Tech (for Materials Engineering) -will find out Saturday.

I have narrowed my choices down to Penn State, UAF, and Colorado School of Mines.  What do I do now? I understand that Mines has the superior program, but I also believe that UAF has the advantage of being the only Petroleum Engineering school in Alaska (better internship possibilities). Is there anything that might sway me to pick one school over another? 

I have tried looking for statistics on internships and job offers but all I found were old reports from CSM in 2012 (before the industry got hit). 

Finally, if I got accepted into Georgia Tech for MSE would it be wise to pursue that over Petroleum Engineering?

2yu7p2,1,2015-03-12,How to make the best of a somewhat misleading position,vunsr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2yu7p2/how_to_make_the_best_of_a_somewhat_misleading/,"I worked as an intern at this large pretty successful company (20k+ employees nationally) as a basic tech support installer setting up computers and software. When I was initially interviewed, I had no idea what position they wanted me to work but didn't care as I needed an internship plus they paid well. I was happy to continue as an intern there, but that area didn't have a need for interns so I couldn't intern there again. I took an internship with another department that worked more on supporting applications in a developer kind of role.

I primarily worked with a vended program, creating forms and working within that program to add new features (no actual coding was involved). After that internship ended, they offered me a position and I accepted figuring it was mostly going to be what I was doing with some additional tasks added. Well, the first month of my actual employment I'm getting directly into a C# MVC application which I had some trouble getting up to speed with, mostly because I haven't actually had a ton of experience writing C# besides a couple classes at college. My degree was designed to give a little knowledge of coding, requirements, business use cases, databases, etc. so I was not like some people who just had 4 years of computer science and lots of time to code and so on.

I started working on some SQL related stuff and found it immensely more enjoyable, I still have some trouble with it since I didn't have any really intense courses on it but I am far more comfortable with it than C#, MVC, or Javascript. Recently I have been assigned more work in the C# space, but again I feel very novice here as I honestly don't like programming that much. When work is over, I generally am done and don't want to deal with coding anymore which I know is different than many who really enjoy it.

With that said, what should I do? I work with wonderful people, the working arrangement is excellent, and the pay is decent but despite writing a few simple C# applications in college I am miserable at it in reality. My manager is a senior developer and has mentioned that I am welcome to ask any questions, but I feel like if I ask some really basic questions they're going to think I'm useless and just get rid of me. Give you an example: I struggle with basic Javascript stuff pretty badly. I only figure it out by just changing a bunch of random parts of it until what I want works, I never really know what I'm doing. I've tried using like Firefox's JS debugger but I have no idea how it works or how to use it. I've never had any complex tasks assigned to me either, so I feel like if they give me one they'll know I'm clueless.

I'd be more content to put in the effort to learn about SQL, databases, and things like that as it seems easier to grasp but I don't really know what role that would be, maybe DBA? I'm generally left to do my tasks so I don't have someone breathing down my neck, but I feel awful when I take way too long to do something I know shouldn't be that hard and I am intimidated to ask questions that I feel are too basic. Are some people just not wired the same way to truly understand coding? I did great in my programming courses but I had specific directions, they were pretty simple, and had very little outside of the core program. I feel like I jumped from those simple programs to advanced level, and because I haven't coded regularly I sometimes don't even remember basic coding concepts without looking them up again (which I think makes me look even worse when I don't know what recursion is off the top of my head).

Advice please? I have worked at this company for over a year, I'd like to keep working here and even with the same people but I think I'd almost need to be spoon fed to learn this programming in a proficient manner which I can't see them doing. How much skill level do most companies expect from a basic developer? I had assumed from the work I had been doing that that was what they considered a developer, since I know that differs from company to company so when the C# stuff came in I was a bit surprised but I did at least have some knowledge of it."

The position is a contract to hire for a major corporation and I'm there for 6 months on a contract before they decide whether or not they want to offer me a full-time position, and in turn in which I decide whether or not this is the kind of place I want to work. The way this was sold to me by the recruiter that I spoke to was a position on the development team. Every developer that intereviewed me was on the development team working on new features for this company's software, every question I asked about what kind of projects were being worked on now and what my first few weeks-months would look like were answered by things about working on the development team. 

Cut to my first day, and my manager immediately brings me to the support team and says that I'll start off there for a while in order to get a general idea about the codebase and domain and would be transferred to development a little later on. Met with my manager today to discuss what was expected of me in terms of what I should learn from support and to get a timeframe on moving to development and he answered that due to the scheduling of the releases I wouldn't possibly be moved there until around August, right after my contract ends if I don't stay on full time.

This has kind of upset me as it seems like I'm expected to work here for months as my first real entry into the industry and be judged upon this position that wasn't described to me accurately. Is this kind of thing normal, for developers to expect to switch between support work and development on new features? I feel like I was pretty fortunate to get this job so quickly being so fresh out of college with no internships or big personal projects for my experience, and it seems like quitting after not even two months might reflect poorly upon me, but after today I just feel as though I should look for a new job that will actually have me doing what I'm hired to do."

I was very enthusiastic about working on the search engine, but was put into MCS (Microsoft Consulting Services). 

While consultancy isn't bad experience and I would still get to code, I believe that it won't be optimal for a year-long internship as a large part of what I do will be client communication. I am fearing I will dread the entire process and won't develop as a professional and person much from it. 

Another issue I find is that I will essentially won't be making too much of a difference in the company. 

Am I underestimating MCS? Or am I being completely unreasonable? How would I go about communicating that to the company?

I'm potentially needing to pick up python fairly quickly, and I'm wondering what the best learning resources are for someone coming from Java.  I have about a year experience with Java and programming in general, no 4 year degree, and was lucky enough to land a paid internship with a good company.  They've been trying to find a spot for me full time since September when I started, and my manager is going to our HR guy tomorrow or Monday with a proposal to get me a spot writing automated test scripts using python, selenium webdriver, and redwoodhq framework.  I had just finished the javascript course at code academy yesterday, and started the python course today (just found this news out a few hours ago), and there is a *ton* of information here in the sidebar and the wiki.  

Just from playing around on my own, I do have some experience with selenium webdriver and cucumber on the java side, and QTP on the vbscript side (much less there though).

That being said:

* What out of the resources here (or elsewhere) do you guys think would get me prepared the quickest in case his proposal goes well (here's hoping!)?  

* Are any resources more popular than others? 

* Would any of them be better suited for people coming from the Java side of things? 

* I was looking up redwoodhq earlier, and I like the interface/built in IDE(kind of?), but what is the most popular IDE for python?



I'll edit this post if I think of anything else.  Thank you guys and girls in advance for any responses, and wish me luck!  If this works out, I'm 31, and I will have successfully exited the job carousel of retail, restaurants, and car dealerships for a career in IT in only 13 months!"

I worked with this company for about 8 months and learned so much about developing projects in different environments, working with servers, and learning new skills (PeopleCode/PeopleSoft) and applying them in practice. (Fortunately and unfortunately) I recently had to quit since my partner got a great job out in SF (SOMA). We just moved early this month to SF from NYC and I've been searching for a job for a while and no luck. I'm stressing out. I've had interviews (with little web dev projects to highlight) and have passed coding challenges, but I am still rejected. And I feel like it's because of my lack of web dev projects and my inability to do white boarding challenges (I panic and freeze). So, I've been looking at schools like HackBright, gSchool, App Academy, etc. to help boost my web dev skill even though I have a CS major (and yes, I understand algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented languages like Java). (Fortunately) I got accepted to one of them which I was super happy about, but some people are telling me I should definitely be fine with my CS degree and I should try harder on my job search...

So what should I do? I was using CodeSchool and Codecademy to get myself up to par with my web dev skills. My biggest block though is not knowing what projects to develop and add to my resume and that's why I'm resorting to these schools because I feel like they have a great web dev/full stack development that may push me in the right direction and guide me with projects.

I have one week left to decide or my spot at the school is given up. I'm being torn in both directions. Any advice?

*****
TL;DR: I graduated last yr as a CS major with an understanding of Java, data structures, and algorithms, but no web development skills. I've been applying to backend, full stack, and software engineering jobs, but no luck. Should I enroll to a web dev/full stack bootcamp to increase my skill-set?

So I'm looking for advice on my situation right now. I accepted an Internship with a major mobile communications company, in more of a QA role, with the opportunity to write some automation code. While not my dream position, i accepted it because I didn't want to end up with nothing. I know that's a bad thing to do but if I didn't take it and ended with nothing I would probably be jobless after school and that was the thought process. I've been intern searching for a more software engineering type role, and have two interviews in the next couple days for an insurance company and a health care side software company. 

My question is, do you think it's a good idea to resign from this QA internship in a big name company, to take a more coding and development based internship? Or would it be better to take it and go through it, keep working on learning and side projects, and try and get a better position when graduating? My main worry is I don't want to get stuck in the QA field because I really don't have a passion for it, and I've heard that you can get stuck pretty easily. Thank you all for the help and insight, sorry for the wall of text. "

Went to College &amp; got a Bachelors Degree. Couldn't find a stable from 2007 until this year. &amp; the job isn't amazing but it pays the bills &amp; is within the field of Graphic Design.

Due to always having short term jobs (6 months at a time usually) &amp; then long gaps of unemployment, my finances were never consistent and I fell apart. I had to settle on my credit cards &amp; shut them all down. I still owe my student loans, which all went into default.

I always wanted to work within entertainment, but I only had 1 internship &amp; once that company went bankrupt &amp; I got laid off, I never got a job in that ever again. I tried &amp; still want to Voice Over work, but I never had the finances to support classes with my voice coach. It was just last year when he basically said for me to just focus on getting my life stable first &amp; then dropped me entirely.

My relationships turned out shitty. I was with a girl for 9 years before we finally ended it. Because of a co-sign on the lease, I'm stuck living with her. I did meet a great girl and still dating her but she now lives in another state because she had no where else to go &amp; we couldn't get the finances to move in together in time. Even so, she's emotionally avoiding me so I'll assume she'll break up with me soon.

I'm really at a loss of what to do anymore with my life. I feel like at this point I have no goals or drive. Just work, go home &amp; repeat till I eventually die.

I wanted to make something of my life. I never did drugs, got arrested or other bad things. I hate the life I have now. I literally feel like I can't do ANYTHING. 

My credit is shot, I never can get jobs with a decent salary or jobs in the field I want, my student loans are in default. I'm stuck living with my Ex while my current GF is living in another state emotionally avoiding me.

I'm just so burnt out &amp; feel like such a damn failure. I really had nothing but good intentions but it was always other people who got ahead instead of me.

I need something...I just don't know anymore"

2yx0sb,2,2015-03-13,Help - Masters Student with Anxiety/Depression/ADHD,ajered,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/2yx0sb/help_masters_student_with_anxietydepressionadhd/,"I'm a first year Masters student who would be in their second semester right now, but I elected to take the semester off as I missed five weeks of my first semester to be home and take care of my Dad who was put into hospice and passed away in October. After returning to school five days after the funeral I hit a wall and spiraled into the worst depressive phase I've ever experienced. I also have generalized anxiety disorder. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and have also been (finally) diagnosed with inattentive ADHD/ADD. 

Because of my depression after missing so many weeks of the semester I'm still playing catch up with some of my classes during this leave of absence period. I'm a perfectionist and always worry about what others think of me, teachers and professors in particular. When I returned to campus last fall after my Dad's passing, this one professor in particular had told me (more than once) in a casual way that he wants to work with me on my PhD, and he even told a friend of mine he met at a conference a month later the same thing. I was flattered, but I automatically felt the need to keep up appearances and impress him, which didn't end up fairing so well with major depression and anxiety already plaguing me. 

Nonetheless, I am still finishing up a project in a course he was teaching and when I was getting ready to leave campus at the beginning of February to head home he told me he wanted the project turned in by March 1st. Between the anxiety of starting the project and the impending deadline and lack of energy and wherewithal due to the depression, I started on it later than I wanted to once I returned home and despite working 6/7 hours/day on it for about a week I still wasn't finished by the 1st. I emailed him that day and told him that not having it finished yet certainly wasn't for lack of effort since I was working as hard as I could on it given everything going on (in addition to having to attend a family funeral/having family in town staying at my house the week before the first). I told him I would have it finished as soon as possible.

I never got an email response from him, which feels like a slap in the face and has revved my anxiety up and subsequently flared my depressive symptoms up again because I feel as if he hates me, thinks that I'm a poor student and not the student my 3.9 GPA, three internships, awards, and great recommendations say I am and always have been, and that I'm ruining a potential PhD opportunity/my future. I'm still working hard to get this project completed so I no longer have to worry about it, but it's just been so tough to do with my anxiety/depression having gotten worse. I feel like he thinks I'm just a ball of excuses when it comes to not performing when the going gets tough. I'm not sure what to do at this point. My family/friends keep saying, ""I'm sure he doesn't hate you, he's just probably thinking 'she will get it done when she gets it done'."" They think I'm making a bigger deal out of this than it is, which may be true, but that's what anxiety has pushed me to do my whole life - overanalyze and obsess. 

He's not an idiot so he probably has some idea that mental illness might be an issue given how unmotivated I was to catch up last semester, but I'm wondering if I should defend myself; let him know that this isn't me as a person nor a student and I'm trying to combat mental illnesses right now and those have been making it difficult for me to get things done. However, I worry about the stigma that comes with mental illness, and I don't want admitting that I'm having these issues right now to shoot me in the foot either. I'm sure no advisor wants to work with someone who has a history of severe depression and anxiety.

Has anyone been in a similar situation or can offer me any guidance on how to handle this now? Sorry the post it so long. Thank you for taking the time to read it if you got this far."

How should I approach this?",cutapacka,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2yxje1/graduating_in_may_would_really_love_to_travel/,"Hi all! I'm about to graduate in a few months and head into the uncertainty of post-college life (yahoo!). I should be focusing on job hunting, but, to be honest, I'm more excited about the prospect of taking a trip my brother and I have been planning for the last month. We both feel somewhat deprived in the travel-realm and have a strong urgency to do a backpack-type trip throughout Europe. He's at a crossroads in his career, and I'm at this natural transition point, so we're feeling like this is an opportunity we cannot waste.

Of course, with such a ""carpe diem"" adventure comes reservations, mostly from my end. This trip would most likely be in July and last for over a month, so the question of whether I should attempt to find a job now or wait until I return is a big factor. In spite of my lack of enthusiasm for the job search process, I've been fairly career-focused throughout my 4 years in school. Several internships in the bank, and one I'm currently invested in this semester, I'm a little afraid of losing my momentum if I don't find a position right away. If I get a job now, however, I doubt I'll be able to ask off for that much time right away, and if I wait until after I return, I have this awkward 3 month limbo where I can *maybe* get a part-time job to save up money, or maybe not, considering I won't be able to cover the entire summer. I'd make this whole thing easier and just shift our trip to either May or August, but unfortunately my brother's time-table is a little less flexible. 

 I hear so many regrets from older and wiser folks about not taking advantage of their time when they were young to travel and see the world, I have the travel bug and would hate to shelf my dreams for practicality and have the same regrets down the road. I know this is a common conundrum many young people may have and uncertainty comes with the territory, so any insight or personal experience you may have would be greatly appreciated! "

2yxrmo,0,2015-03-13,Question about MVC architecture,recheej,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2yxrmo/question_about_mvc_architecture/,"Hello. I'm a graduating Comp. Sci major and I have a question about how I usually design my code. In past projects I've been a part of (have 1 internship), there's always been a database involved. When designing the code we've usually had a database class to handle all the database writing/reading. 

I wonder if this is the right way of doing things (according to MVC). Just to give you a clearer example, say we were storing information about cars in our database. We'd create a Car class. This would just have the properties of the car (model, year, color, etc). It wouldn't have any logic about going to the database and retrieving car information.

The database class is where the retrieval and storing of cars would happen. So in the database class we'd define a method called: getCars(). It would go to the database, retrieve the table information, store them into a Car object, and return the list of cars.

Again, is this the right way of doing MVC? Or would you want to put logic about getting/inserting cars into the Car object? Some clarification would be greatly appreciated."

We're getting close to the stage where they have to offer me a contract to sign that we need to present as part of the visa application I believe. 

My current visa expires in about a month so I'll be working abroad from home for the next few months until (fingers crossed) I get the h1b and they're more than happy to let me do that.

The company has a great working environment and some really cool people work there - I really enjoy being there but I wasn't on particularly great wages at all for a software internship...some of the internship offers I've seen thrown around here are pretty crazy! I didn't mind though because I was mainly there to learn and I was getting enough to live relatively comfortably. However, the company has a bit of a reputation for 'low balling' offers and I'm a bit worried that they might try that on me based on a couple of things I've seen/heard around the office.

So my question is what would you expect the average wage for an engineer with a year's experience at this stage. I want to point out that I am very grateful to the company for taking a chance on me at the start and they're willing to pay for my h1b to get me back into the country as well as letting me work from home for the next ~6 months. So, while I am extremely grateful, I'm also wary of them trying to 'use that against me' when it comes to the contract offer and offer me something quite low.

My role is data/applications oriented and I'd be considered a pretty key member of the engineering team right now as I'm the only person working on my project and I've been doing it for a year now.

I'm not saying they **will** try to pull something but I what I want to get is an idea of my worth I guess. I'm not looking for a crazy salary but I'd like to get somewhere around the average for a junior dev in the city.

**TL;DR:** Coming up to the end of my internship, company sponsoring h1b...I want to know what the approximate average salary I should be looking for is for a dev with a year's experience in SF."

In the Boston region, there are a lot of tech companies, so I'm not worried about ultimately getting an offer. However, I learned Twitter in particular wants you to be fast. I assume that that was the reason they declined to move forward. 

During the coding part of the interview, she asked if there were optimizations to reduce the solution I had created from O(n^2 )? It took me ~10 min to figure out an optimization, and I stumbled around for a bit, but I ultimately found one closer to O(nlogn).

During that time where I was trying to come up with an optimization, the tone of the conversation changed. It changed from positive on her end to trying to speed this along. By about 5 mins before the scheduled end of the interview, she basically asked me to stop where I was, and asked if I had anymore questions, which was to be expected.

I went ahead and finished the project with the optimization we discussed after the phone call was over, but quickly received an e-mail saying that they didn't want to go forward. 

Sucks. You never actually know the reason I guess. Maybe it was something else that caused it, but it seems pretty clear to me that speed was the reason. Oh well."

The reason given for this was ""a high level of change within the business organization."" I can sort of understand, there was a new and ambitious CEO appointed while I was interning. Still, this is a huge change from my original plans - I was going to just take a month off to spend time with my family after graduation and then start working.

I'm nervous because I have a mountain of school loan debt that I want to be paying off immediately. I'm also concerned with how a late start would affect the start of my career relative to my peers. I've talked to other upcoming grads that are in the same position as me (also hired by the same company and deferred) and we're planning on calling HR on Monday to learn more about what exactly is going on within the company and who made this decision. What kinds of questions should I be asking?

I don't want to be unemployed for like 5 months (and definitely don't want the deferred start date to turn into a rescinded offer)... it seems to me there are a few options:

1. Return home and find interim work there. My hometown is extremely boring and I'm not sure I could get more than a short term gig in retail/food service, so this is not really something I want to do. I would get to spend more time with my family, though.

2. I could also stay on my campus, since I currently work part-time as a lab tech. The pay isn't great, but it's been good enough to cover monthly expenses during college. However, I absolutely love my work and my supervisor. I told my supervisor a while back that I would be graduating and leaving for the new job, but nothing has occurred for my replacement, so I may be able to stick around and continue working there. My current housing lease is good until August (I'll have to pay the rent in any case), and I could probably stay with friends for the remainder of the time until starting with the new company. I like this option more than #1.

3. One of my friends suggested that I try to leverage my position and said that I need to look at other companies, but that seems a bit excessive to me... I don't have any other offers currently and haven't been actively looking because I wasn't expecting any of this.

I really like this company as a whole (starting salary is great and there is plenty of opportunity for advancement), but I'm not sure what to do in this situation. It really sucks... I feel that start date deferment is a pretty big deal to drop on a new graduate who is just trying to start their career. Any advice? Am I overreacting?

TL;DR: Upcoming college graduate, got a sweet job from summer internship, start date was deferred to October instead of June from I previously selected, need to start paying off loans ASAP, need to know what to ask HR and what to do in the interim (see options 1-3).

EDIT: Whoops, title should say ""What to do?"""

2z1ho1,6,2015-03-14,Pointers from my job hunt,bonny_peg_o_ramsey,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2z1ho1/pointers_from_my_job_hunt/,"I finally received a job offer yesterday. /jobs has been a great source of information and inspiration to me through this exhausting process and I wanted to share some details/opinions about my search in case it helps someone else. First, the statistics:

•Number of resumes submitted: 208.
•Number of phone screens: 17 (8.1% success rate); Number of interviews: 14 (6.7% success rate).
•Elapsed time between submission of 1st resume and offer: 150 days.
•Elapsed time between submission of 1st resume and 1st interview: 37 days.
•Elapsed time between submitting successful resume to the place that made me the offer to the actual date of offer: 51 days.

My situation: Mid-career with lots of experience in finance. I made a career change to non-profit work in 2011 and as a result my network is primarily in finance, not non-profit work. To add to the difficulty of my search, I relocated in autumn after quitting my prior job. As a result I have few relevant contacts in my new state of residence. I lived off of my savings while I looked for work.

Because of my situation I primarily had to rely on sending in resumes and applications in response to ads on Idealist, Indeed, USA Jobs, LinkedIn, HERC, Craig’s List, etc. I did not have contacts in the organizations I was applying to. 

I have a decent resume highlighting a number of tangible accomplishments. However, most of my accomplishments are in finance due to my newness in non-profit work. My hope was that showing my accomplishments in finance would show non-profit organizations that I was generally competent even though I might not have as much specific experience as they would like.

My goal was to have an offer by mid-February (didn’t happen). I had decided to employ the “nuclear option” if I didn’t have an offer by February: pursue returning to my prior career area. I did end up reaching out to my finance network via LinkedIn asking for any finance leads in my state but happily my offer ended up being in non-profit work so I am still on my preferred career path.

My opinions based on my experiences:
•If you do what I did and quit without having another job lined up, make sure you have sufficient living funds. Calculate the amount you will need to cover your living expenses and double (or triple) it. My job search went on longer than I thought it would and to top it off I had some expenses I had not planned on (mainly expensive care repairs). I had the “nuclear option” so I wouldn’t go completely broke before finding a job.
•Some people advocate applying for jobs 8 hours per day but I did not find that possible. I aimed for 4-5 hours per day because after that I was usually completely drained. On some days I would find 10 or more relevant jobs to apply to in that 4-5 hours, but on other days there were only 2-3 worth applying for. I did a lot of weeding before deciding to apply for a specific job. I made sure my skills were applicable and relevant, and that I actually wanted to do the job in question. Then I would tailor the cover letter so it pointed out why I was qualified.
•Applying for jobs from Thanksgiving through New Year’s Day is very difficult. Few places seem to want to hire until the holidays are over and their new budgets go into force. In the 75 days from mid-October through December I had 4 interviews. In the following 75 days I had 10.
•USA Jobs and HERC were a waste of time for me. My lack of success with HERC is explainable because while I was qualified for the jobs I applied for, my job experience is not in an academic setting. USA Jobs was ridiculous. I was qualified for all 34 jobs I applied for but I received zero callbacks. Note that I am a white male and not a veteran, so that may have had something to do with it. My job offer came through a job I applied for on LinkedIn’s job board. I also applied through 5 temp agencies but only one of those provided any leads.
•The three facets of your job hunt need to be airtight: 1. Cover Letter/Resume 2. Phone Screen/Interview 3. References. You do not want a prospective employer to have any doubts about your ability to do the job and if any of these three are weak, you won’t get the job. Focus on fixing the weak link:
•If you are not getting phone screens you need to change your resume/cover letter. Do not be general (“I provided exceptional customer service”) but always give specific metrics whenever possible (“my customer satisfaction rating based on anonymous feedback was in excess of 85 %”). When I changed my cover letter and bullet pointed the top 4-5 requirements of the job I was applying for and how I met those requirements, my number of phone screens went up.
•The more phone screens/interviews you do, the more polished and confident you will be when presenting yourself. My first interview was absolutely terrible. I was nervous and rusty and not surprisingly I did not get an offer. At the end of my current job search I had a polished “spiel” that was focused and to the point. Interviewers could not fluster me. Try to practice with someone before the actual interview so you can tell your story effectively.
•Be absolutely certain your references will give you glowing reviews. Have a friend call them and pretend to be a hiring employer if possible to see what they will say. If a prior supervisor will only give a lukewarm recommendation, do not use them. Instead, use a prior co-worker who you got along with. You want a potential employer to think you are great after they speak to your references. While I can’t be certain, I believe I lost one job offer due to a so-so reference from a prior supervisor (who I removed after that and substituted with a co-worker). 

The hardest part for me was staying positive through this very slow and draining process. I had a high GPA, decent internships, many tangible work accomplishments, good references, and I still did not get offers. The whole ordeal ground me down. Some days the best I could do was to send out one or two resumes. To stay in balance I exercised, tried to get enough sleep, ate a balanced diet, etc. Even after 10+ unsuccessful interviews, I had to go into the next interviews with the attitude that the prior interviewers were wrong about me and I was qualified to be successful at the job in question. Each interview was a brand new experience and had I gone in beaten down I would not have been a good candidate. I faked it when I had to and was confident but not arrogant, tried to be pleasant and humorous, etc. 

I think everyone on /jobs knows that job hunting is tiring and oftentimes arbitrary. Hang in there, keep plugging away, and make necessary changes if any part of your application process is not getting the results it should be. Best wishes to everyone going through this awful process.

I never felt smart enough in school to try hard, I hated math, and writing, and never tried hard because I didn't think I could amount to anything. In high school I had little interest in going to college because I didn't think I could get into a good school, or succeed enough after graduating to justify and pay for the student loans. I didn't even bother to take the SATs. 

I've taken a few classes each semester at a community college, mostly to get a job and that's it. I work full time, but even then I can't afford more than one or two classes at a time. I haven't even thought about graduating because I still feel that it would be pointless. 

In the last year however I got into forensics, and discovered a passion for Latent Print Processing. I recently interviewed for a great position with a sherifs department, but I got rejected because I didn't have a degree or a date for graduation. I refused to get a student loan until I am 100% certain that I will get a job in that specific field I major in. Even then, I'd rather pay for school on my own, out of pocket. I hate loans. 

I really don't want to give up in this field, but financially I just can't afford to get a degree, even from a technical school. No matter how hard I try, I just can't justify taking out a loan for it. I've convinced myself that getting a degree is pointless unless I already have a foot in the door in the field that I will major in. However getting rejected from the internships has caused me to doubt the odds of getting another opportunity, so I am on the edge of giving up on that as well. 

I am completely self-reliant, even to a fault. I don't like asking for help, from my parents or anyone else. I am also not a very optimistic person. "

* Company A: A big, traditional business and financial news organization (think along the lines of NASDAQ, Bloomberg, etc.)
* Company B: A young, quickly growing, shopping-based startup (think like Jackthreads, etc.). 

I would have relatively free reign to work on a project of my choice at either position. I narrowed it down to these two thanks to my positive experience during my time in the environment and my interest in the work. I'm an undergrad, so which one do you guys think would look better on a resume in the future?

2z398l,10,2015-03-14,constantly lonely,lowest_point,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/2z398l/constantly_lonely/,"I’m a junior in college and things have gotten to a point where I’m pretty sure I’m depressed and constantly lonely.

I have basically no good friends here. I have some friends who I do homework with, hang out for a couple hours, etc, but we don’t really ever hang out for the sake of hanging out, because they have their own friend groups (I have no “friend group”). though when we do hang out and do work, I have fun, and can feel happy for a while. but we only meet like once or twice a week, so it's not really enough.

I volunteer/work at this place on campus. Everyone there is really nice and chill, but even so I still have social anxiety there. and there’s also this girl there that I like a lot. Unfortunately, anxiety makes me pretty much unable to initiate conversations with or even make eye contact with this girl. I’m awkward as fuck in groups of people when she’s around, and it just makes me feel like an incompetent loser. Originally I thought she was interested in me, and she lingers around me quite a bit, but it’s probably more out of pity or being friendly. And plus, if anything, my actions (barely looking at her, rarely initiating conversation) probably make it look like I don’t like her, when it’s the opposite.

I’m surprisingly ok with talking to her 1 on 1 though. Like we would walk from work to the bus stop for quite a while and can talk a lot. that’s one of the few moments anymore when I actually feel happy and not lonely, but then when she leaves I instantly feel lonely again, and then just depressed because of how hard I’m trying, knowing that it’s all pointless because I’m sure I won’t have courage to ask her out or anything before the semester is over (and she’s graduating early in 2 months, and is from a different country). Also I’m 21 and have never been on a date ever.

meanwhile I have nothing to look forward to anymore. I tried so hard to get a summer internship this summer, but completely failed, and fucked up several final round interviews from anxiety and awkwardness. so I’ll likely be spending the summer at home with parents, and I don’t really have any friends at home either (and last summer was horrible, I basically stayed home the entire summer playing videogames and being depressed). then I’ll come back to school next fall, with no friends, no job prospects, essentially nothing to look forward to.

It’s not even like I have no confidence or anything. I’m studying engineering, so I’m smart and hard working, but I’m also good at art and being creative. but what good are any of these traits if you’re constantly lonely with no friends, and awkward in social situations when trying to make friends? my major just feels like a chore lately (thankfully my GPA is still ok). and none of my hobbies even hold my interest anymore.

I guess a lot of this rant is off topic for an anxiety subreddit, but I really just feel like I’m at my lowest point right now, and anxiety is what caused all of this. And at this point, I don't even see how getting therapy or medications to mitigate social anxiety would even improve things. feels like the damage has already been done. :/"

2z4fob,3,2015-03-15,Graduating Soon - Need Advice,redethmoid,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2z4fob/graduating_soon_need_advice/,"I'm about to graduate with an Associate's in Medical Coding &amp; Billing.  Previously, I got an Associate's and Bachelor's in Mass Communication, but couldn't find a job in the difficult economy.  I re-trained in what I was told was a more promising career by my father who is a registered nurse.

I trusted his advice, worked hard and am set to receive my third college degree soon.  My parents helped me through school, and they would like me to land a job soon so I can become more self sufficient.

I've had the time to research the field and my prospects, and everything leads me to believe it is a very competitive field, demands experience and certification and is difficult for someone to break into.  My father believes I will find something in the medical billing/coding field before October (when I can take the certification test in ICD-10).

If what I've read about finding a job can be believed, I think it will be difficult, if not impossible to find something by this time.  If I don't find something by October, I don't know how I will explain this to my parents.  My father is an optimist and is sure I will find something.  I don't tell him what my odds are realistically, because I know he would think I'm simply being negative.

I don't want to be accused of not trying hard enough, or criticized.  I've also been told not to look for non-medical related jobs that might be easier for me to get, such as part-time work to put on my resume.  I've been unemployed for a couple of years.

With everything I feel like I'm up against, I don't know how to explain or break it to my parents that I may not be considered until I (hopefully) get certification in the billing field.  If I get a non-medical part time job to gain recent experience, show I'm employable, and possibly get some references, I will annoy my parents by not focusing on the exclusive health industry field.

My only other option is to take an unpaid internship (are there paid ones anymore?).  It's been too long since I've worked, and while I appreciate the value of an internship, I need to start making some income again.

I've read a lot about unemployment, the economy, the real unemployment rate and so forth.  Assuming its all true, and that it isn't part of some political or ideological bias/agenda, I'm less likely to be considered as a long time unemployed person than an ex-convict.

I guess that pretty much covers my scenario.  If anyone can offer me advice, or just show I'm not alone because they're in a similar situation, I would appreciate it.  "

I've been spending the last two months now researching and researching and researching ideas for graduate school, and I feel like I'm going in and out of rabbit holes with no kind of progress being made. I have been trying to follow the scheme laid out in the following link as to how to find the graduate program that best suits me:
http://www.nextscientist.com/choose-graduate-school-program/

Although the advice laid out in that link matches most closely with advice I have heard from professors and peers already in the graduate system, and I agree with its overall direction, I have one problem with it: I have no idea what I want to study. 

Having majored in biochemistry means that I have a tremendous number of options for which direction I could start going in. And because I sadly didn't get as much research done in undergraduate, I didn't get any individual, invigorating experience that could mold my interests for a particular field. Additionally, I got my Bachelor's in America, but moved back to my family in Europe and am having difficulty having my degree to be recognized enough for an internship or job. They don't really seem to offer post-bachelor classes here either, so I don't know how I can catch up on the few classes I need to better find a job (e.g. some math, some computer science). 

It has been incredibly difficult trying to move forward these last  few months.... I feel like for every one step forward I make, the circumstances push me two steps back. Can anybody recommend me a possible path to take? Although I am open to online classes, I'm unsure how many graduate programs would accept them as valid credits, and additionally, the lack of connection with professors and other staff might hinder my attempts to find new sources for references and/or connections. Although I would prefer to stay in Europe, I would be open to moving back to the states if my American Bachelor's degree only helps me get the classes or internships in America.

Thank you all so much for any advice."

2z4xqc,2,2015-03-15,Input on the viability of my current programming skills in today's job market.,nutramoil,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2z4xqc/input_on_the_viability_of_my_current_programming/,"I am getting to the point in my career where I am very interested in changing employers because my current employer and very specific line of work is leaving me very unfulfilled.  I am wondering of the viability of my current skills and obvious weaknesses that can help my marketability in the work force.  Any and all input, positive or negative is welcome.

**Short version:**

I do not have much professional programming experience in modern languages but I do have 7+ years of professional engineering experience using a proprietary language.  Is it reasonable to hope that the experience I have can translate into a job that does utilize modern languages?

**Long version:**

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2008.  Got a job with my current employer as an intern my last semester of school.  I transferred departments in 2009.  I have been in my current department since that time starting out in a Tier 1 paygrade, and basically being a code monkey.  I have since received two promotions and am now a Tier 3, which is classified as a Lead.  

We work in the process automation industry.  We use a 20+ year old proprietary programming language.  I write the programs that control manufacturing processes using a DCS, not PLC’s.  Best I can describe our language is it can be similar to Fortran and Basic.  There are GOTO’s and GOSUB’s.  The variable types we use are 16 bit integers, float points, flags, built in timers, and pointers.  We do not have any built in data structures but we do have ways or imitating things like an array or even an object to some degree.  We have standard control with things like IF statements and For loops.  There are many other things in our language that work closely with our DCS.  Over the years we have standardized the way we do things to include abstractions along the lines of Object Oriented, but not objects exactly.

I have experience with other languages such as Python, Java, C++, C#, and a few others.  I personally have found that, in general, if you understand the logic and how to program, that picking up the syntax and tools of most other languages is not overly complicated, but some time is obviously needed.

I have extensive experience in the complete software development cycle.  In that, we are involved in meetings with customers and other involved parties to gather requirements, initial documentation and reviews, programming, testing, customer acceptance testing, installation, startup support, and final “as built” documentation.

I also have extensive experience leading projects, typically on the smaller 1-2 person size.  We work very closely with the customers during the entire life of a project.  Our interactions with customers includes, but not limited to, design meetings with process engineers, regular meetings to address any issues, training of on site personnel including process operators.  It is typical for us to run on site meetings and training sessions for a wide range of people, operators, plant engineers, corporate engineers, etc.

Lastly, I am pushing 40 years old.  I know this should not matter, but I am also not naive and realize companies may go with youth over someone my age if they can low ball a younger person.  I am not looking to break the bank in my salary and given the right situation, I would be willing to accept a bit less than I make now.


Thank you again for taking the time and I appreciate any feedback.

2z4xqy,2,2015-03-15,"A long story, but I need some guidance.",limacharles,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2z4xqy/a_long_story_but_i_need_some_guidance/,"This will be a bit long winded, perhaps, but I'd like to give a full frame of context to the situation before I get advice on it.  

I am a 26 year old male.  When I was 17, I enlisted in the Marine Corps, and remained there for 7 years working in various positions related to system administration for intelligence personnel and executives.  My last duty station had me flying around the world constantly working for the top exec's in the military (think General Petraeus), and was generally a high-adrenaline job with lots of perks balanced with a ridiculous tempo and level of responsibility/anxiety.  

Also, at 18, I proposed to my now wife.  We maintained a long-distance relationship for about 6 years before we were finally married in 2012.  I have always considered her a soulmate, and while things are kind of tough right now (that in a moment), I love her.  A year later we had our daughter, she is now 2.5.  She is wonderful, high-energy, very smart, and makes life better.  However, any parent can understand what having a 2.5 year old is like.

So there's the familial situation.  But, the crux of my problem arises here.

In 2008, before I left for Iraq for a year.  I bought a basic DSLR camera.  That day subsequently changed my life.  I became an avid, talented, and passionate photographer.  By 2011, I had plans to attend a university well known for its photojournalism program.  I was fully invested in this...to say it was a passion would be understating it.  Nothing has given me 'life' the way that this sort of photography did, the capturing of people in these candid struggles or moments of joy.  If you know much about the scene, photojournalism is imploding.  Sports Illustrated just let all of its staff photographers go not too long ago.  For that reason, the fact that I was coming off years of intense weekly travel overseas, and the family which I felt would be relying on me to provide us with income, I gave up my dream.  To some of you, this will sound silly.  Many people have creative passions and need to sacrifice them.  I'm sure many of you have probably gone through the same thing, and maybe it's your advice I'm truly looking for.  The matter of the fact is, 3 years ago, when I made that decision, it severed my soul and nothing has really fixed that since, not even my kiddo.  

I attended a different university, and pursued a degree in Computer Information Systems.  I was excited, because I saw a few facts about the school which made it more competitive in this area.  That said, it wasn't what I really wanted to do or at least I realize that now.  I had to make a decision on what to do for school quickly, because I only had about 4 months remaining before I separated from the military.  I had a really good career in the Marines, won some shit, was well respected, got job offers on the way out, etc.  Now I'm stuck in what turned out to be a really shitty CIS program at a school which doesn't have much else to offer me.  Now that I'm 3 semesters left before graduation, not much I can do about that.  I rely on the GI Bill for both part of my mortgage and my education.

I've been dealing with depression for about a year now.  Just over the last two months I've been going to therapy on campus.  The therapist seems pretty good, but it's my first experience.  Basically I feel like I have nothing in my life to live for other than my wife and child.  I want to escape my situation.  Part of the reason I'm there: both parents are alcoholics, absentees and just narcissistic needy people.  I've had a highly dysfunctional situation with them since about 17.  My father has recovered, but mom is still fucked up.  At Christmas, I got in her face about it when an opportunity presented itself.  I don't ever get really angry at people, but if you've seen August: Osage County, it was like that scene when Julia Roberts takes Meryl Streep's pills.  I reasoned with her as long as I could until the delusion made me see red; I slammed my fist on the table so hard I thought I broke something.  It's the second time we've confronted her about it.  She just left and said she'd call me when she had seen someone.  Of course, she never saw anyone and tells me that the conversation we had was enough to fix her.  I don't believe this at all.  The therapist said it was her way of pinning the problem on me.  My mother is a master manipulator, and the only reason I see through her bullshit is that many times in life I feel I'm the same way.  These flashes of anger, and the inability to walk through my problems logically, along with many other catalysts, are what finally drove me to therapy.

I'm now faced with this situation.  It's hard to describe without all of this language above.  I've internalized all these problems for so long and am just now speaking about them with my wife and someone else.  I feel like I've been on a journey to nothing for the last 7 years.  Seeing my military career in retrospect, while I acknowledge some of its benefits, I doubt that I did anything to make the world a better place...it feels like a waste of time.  Now I've invested 2 more years in another waste of time...the college experience is wonderful, but the program I chose ruins it weekly.  I have an internship with a good company, and this year the internship is something new: program management.  I did really well last year, and they offered me anything I wanted.  I chose this because it gets me away from IT, and it lets me help people with something not computer-related.  I'm considering being a teacher, but that field, too, is imploding in America.

I feel like I'm on a journey to nothing fulfilling in my own life.  Saying this still makes me feel selfish, but part of what therapy has taught me is that all of my ""shoulds"" and ""that's selfish"" have gotten me to where I am now...feeling lifeless.  So, I don't know what I'm asking for, in the end.  I'm hoping that someone out there, someone older, wiser, and with a reasonable head on their shoulders can help me digest this shit.  I realize that my situation is unique, but in some ways typical, at the same time.  I also acknowledge that I am very fortunate to have options in my life for my career, and that there are many people worse off that I am.  Truly, what I'd like to do is help those people who are worse off.  That's why I was drawn to photojournalism's mission, and that's part of why I'm drawn to teaching.  I just don't know.  

I know that's an eternal post, but I don't really have a TL;DR.  I'm just drifting and I'm afraid of where I'll end up.

Thanks.

Once upon a time, Sarahlita j’Zart had truly believed that she knew everything there was to know about law and lawyers - after all, she had worked for a handspan of years in one of the busiest law firms on her planet that dealt regularly with multiple hands of species and cultures all the time. She loved her job and the chances that it gave her to work on contracts and licensing that helped to smooth over the various bumps and detours that would otherwise get in the way of so many species interacting with each other. But to tell the truth, she had become somewhat bored with the day-in and day-out regularity of it and so, when her friends had told her of a months-long sightseeing space cruise that they were booked on and how much fun it would be, she allowed herself to be dragged along with only a token resistance.

And then the accident happened, along with it the rescue resulting in all of the passengers being stranded untold light-years from their home, and Sarahlita j’Zart was exposed to Human law and swiftly realized that she knew absolutely *nothing* at all about what lawyers really did and how wonderfully complex the law could truly be.

Humans had laws for *everything* - laws governing not just trade, but for what the very *concept* of trade could be, covering everything from a tangible widget that went *meep* to the very idea of a thing that didn’t even exist yet. Laws that stipulated how often something could be used, how it could be used, and what would happen if you tried to use it outside of the limits that the contract defined. Rules that helped enforce how money was exchanged between multiple parties and who was entitled to what in case certain conditions were met or not. The Humans even had laws and rules that dictated how families and their assets should be split up should they decide that they no longer could be a cohesive unit, the basic concept of which Sarahlita still could not understand.

Another amazing feature of Human Law was if someone didn’t like how a law was designed or being enforced or just thought it was unfair for some reason, they could actually do something about it and invoke a special action called an *appeal* where an elevated group of lawyers would listen to the reasons brought forth and then might agree to actually *change the law* - there were even laws that specified how *that* could occur. The concept that laws could have laws layered upon each other like thin slices of *pactur* stacked up and waiting to be drizzled with *kilapa* before being consumed was so completely unheard of to Sarahlita that when she finally understood the idea, the implications were nothing short of a religious awakening to the Dulutewae woman.

When the local government had announced that the Department Of Alien Affairs had been formed in order to help with job placement for the dispossessed alien passengers, Sarahlita wasted no time in filling out the required forms and turning them in, much to the confusion of the DOAA clerk who had only been on the job for two days and wasn’t sure what to do with it. Eventually someone figured out what the new government office was supposed to be doing and Sarahlita’s paperwork started to be moved around, finally landing on the desk of someone who knew someone else that *might* just know a good place to put an alien humanoid that fancied herself a lawyer.

---

Marty Mosely looked up at the soft tapping on the open door of her office, the noise being generated by Sarahlita j’Zart, one of the interns. The Dulutewae female was holding a stack of papers and some law books in her arms, and said, “I’m sorry to bother you Marty, but I had some questions about the Robertson case.”

Marty set aside the brief she was reading waved her in. When the DOAA had told her that one of the aliens was interested in learning more about how human law worked and if Marty would consider taking one on as an intern, she had been intrigued, but skeptical, as were the rest of the partners in the firm when she shared the request with them. But to their surprise Sarahlita had quickly shown that her interest wasn’t just some passing fancy and that she had a real passion for learning everything that she could about “Human Law” as she called it. Whenever Sarahlita wasn’t performing whatever duties were asked of her she could be found in the firm’s law library, reading book after book until the office closed up for the night and he was told to go home to get some rest - otherwise she would gladly sleep at the office with a law book as a pillow, often with paperwork from a previous case stacked neatly next to her.

 The alien’s linguistic abilities had also turned out to be an unexpected asset, especially when it came to dealing with cases that had some international component, having already proven to be a key factor in correcting two of them that would have otherwise resulted in serious legal issues down the road for their clients due to translation errors that managed to creep in. Marty knew that during the next office leadership meeting they were going to offer the Dulutewae woman a chance to go to law school on their dime just to have first crack at her when she graduated, certain that she would be at the top of her class and that having her on board full-time would put the firm at the forefront of international business and contract law.

“What do you have, Sarahlita?” Marty asked, clearing a spot on her desk and indicating an empty chair as the female alien stepped over, her footsteps making an unusual noise for a Dulutewae as she did so. Marty looked around her desk to see what was causing it and exclaimed, “are you wearing *shoes*?”

Sarahlita paused in her movement towards Marty’s desk and replied, “yes, they came in today. Aren’t they fantastic? It took me months to find someone who still made shoes by hand instead of being mass-produced in a factory and was willing try to make a custom pair for me. I thought it would be more professional if I had them. I’m still getting used to them, of course.” Suddenly her face shifted and her ears drooped. “Is that ok? Did I do something wrong? You’re not upset with me, are you?” Marty had spent enough time around the woman to realize that Sarahlita seemed concerned that she had offended the human somehow.

Marty considered her words carefully, before replying, “no, not at all. But nobody wants you to be uncomfortable. It just seems like you’re trying to be something you’re not, first with your clothing -” referring to the tailored business wear that Sarahlita was wearing that would not have been out of place on a human woman instead of the smock-like garment the aliens preferred “- and your earrings.” The latter was apparently a big fashion trend among the Dulutewae, as were smartwatches, which the aliens preferred over a traditional phone, using them much in the same manner as the old Dick Tracy comic books did. “And now your shoes.”

Seeing that Sarahlita seemed to be getting upset, Marty hurriedly continued, “and they are very nice by the way. But what I mean is that I hope you don’t think or feel that we expect you to wear Human clothing or do things that make you uncomfortable physically or otherwise, just because you work here.” If she did feel that way, Marty was going to have some very strong words with the rest of her office staff and remind them of the diversity clause in the office rules. The last thing they needed was some sort of intergalactic discrimination lawsuit.

Sarahlita clenched her hands in front of her, the oddly jointless fingers writhing together like a dozen tiny snakes as she blurted out in a rush, “I know that and everyone is so wonderful and I have never felt more like I belonged somewhere than here working with you and everyone else on law that is so complex and fascinating and interesting it’s just that...” Sarahlita trailed off, appearing to run out of steam and unable to articulate what she wanted to say, until she suddenly rattled off what was obviously as phrase in her native tongue that Marty didn’t understand but waited patiently for the alien to continue.

Eventually she did, and Marty got the whole story, which was quite the eye-opener to her.

---

“...so it turns out Sarahlita basically has supplanted the firm as her family-herd unit and has apparently identified with us - as a group - so much that she feels like she needs to emulate our mode of dress and behaviour patterns. I’m worried about her and what she thinks the next step might be to her becoming more ‘human’.” Marty was curled up in the loveseat with Amanda, the two of them looking out the window at the lights of the capital through the large picture window in their living room. Amanda made a *hmm* noise in her throat, which pleasantly vibrated the back of Marty’s head where it was positioned under the taller woman’s chin.

“Both Samuel and Elsa had mentioned how Ruxzcon seemed to get a little gung-ho about ‘being human’ for a while, but it seemed to be short-lived. I’ll ask around, but maybe the simplest solution is just to put her back with her own people.”

Marty shook her head, which had the unpleasant effect of making her hair tickle Amanda’s nose, who had to suppress a sneeze before something ugly and disgusting happened to the top of Marty’s head. “No, I don’t want to do that - it would seem like we’re rejecting her. I just want her to be *herself*, not some alien caricature of what she perceives a human to be based on where she works.”

Amanda shrugged. “So show her what humans are really like, not just a bunch of lawyer bookworms in fancy suits. Ouch.” Marty had poked her rather hard in the leg. “Take her out on the town for a day or three. It’s DC, there’s always something happening, all sorts of cultural events and other entertainment going on somewhere. Flag it through the DOAA and they might even reimburse you in a few years.” Amanda was referring to the new agency's excellent ability at being yet another layer of government bureaucracy: quick to make demands but slow to return the favor.

“That’s a better idea than any I’ve been able to think of. I’ll see what’s available and let the rest of the office know what I’m doing.” Sighing, she squirmed and twisted around until she was looking directly Amanda, and gave her a quick kiss on her nose. “And now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to go upstairs and wait for my very smart spouse to join me before she has to jet off somewhere exotic yet again.”

“Hur är det? How are you?”

“Hurr are deet?” CB repeated. “Hur ar det? Hur ar det?”

“Jag är väl. I am well,” the Swedish language program promoted CB after he tapped the keyboard for the next phrase in the series.

“Jag are vell. Jag ar vell. I guess that’s right.” Tapping the next one, he muttered, “probably sound like a goddamn idiot. Glad nobody’s around to hear me make a fool of m’self.”

“Vill du ha lite-” the program started just an emergency tone sounded that caused CB to grab his headset and jam it on, fumbling for the command that would terminate the teaching program that was still trying to give him instructions in Swedish.

“*Prairie Dog*, *Prairie Dog*, this is a tower control. *Prairie Dog*, please respond immediately,” the demand blared over the speakers and the headset at the same time, making CB’s ears ring.

“Tower, this is *Prarie Dog*. I hears ya, what’s all the fuss about?” CB replied, dialing down the volume a bit before he got permanent hearing loss.

“*Prairie Dog*, STEREO has detected a large CME at 15:30 zulu that will cross your trajectory in 41 hours unless corrective action is taken.” Tower control was referring to Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, a pair of satellites whose primary job was to study the Sun and provide early warning of any Coronal Mass Ejections, eruptions of stellar matter that flung high energy particles towards Earth and typically did nothing more than provide viewers with a pretty Aurora Borealis light show when they impacted the Earth’s protective magnetic field.

However, larger CME events could cause disruptions in the terrestrial power grid and communication systems and, for any space craft that were *not* within the confines of Earth’s magnetic field, serious damage to any electrical equipment not suitably protected against the effects. What was worse, anyone unlucky enough to be aboard any such space craft was in very real danger of getting an up close and personal experience to the kind of damage a large-scale dose of cosmic rays could do to the human body. Unfortunately, the comic books got it wrong and exposure to cosmic rays didn’t give you superpowers - unless you considered being cooked from the inside or going blind if you were lucky a superpower. Typically, CME events were slow-moving beasts and normally took up to a week to make the trip from the Sun to the Earth and even the larger and more energetic variety no faster than four days.

CB swore before he toggled the mic. “Less’n two days? Guess I’d better get a move on and get the hell out of the way then, and tell whoever was asleep at the switch that I’m gonna kick his ass when I get dirtside. Has Mars base been informed?” CB climbed out of his command chair as quick as he could and started putting things away and securing his living quarters, making sure everything was locked down nice and tight.

“Affirmative *Prairie Dog*. Mars base personnel have been informed and will be retreating to the pre-designated safe area during the exposure window.” This was control’s way of telling CB that the scientists and engineers back on the base were going to hide under the main water storage tank, since Mars lacked a proper electromagnetic field like Earth did and thus had no built-in shield against CME events other than the bulk of the planet. One of the things that the still-yet-to-be-completed overall dome structure was designed to do was provide that kind of shielding among other things.

Unfortunately, the *Prairie Dog* had even less shielding than the Mars base, mostly comprised of the steel cargo containers that made up the outside shell of the ship. While perfectly capable of dealing with the standard background radiation that permeated the solar system, they were woefully inadequate when it came to solar flares and other stellar ejecta such as large CME eruptions. While the scientists had figured out how to duplicate the artificial gravity systems from the *Jewel of Paxs’wan’l* that was the key component to the *Prairie Dog*’s ability to get off the ground, they had yet to recreate the ceramic plating that the damaged cruise liner used as shielding for both external high-energy particles and internal exotic ones. Which left CB dashing around preparing the ship for the only option that was currently available: run like hell.

“As for the late warning, prior analysis had the CME decaying to negligible levels which was obviously in error. In any case, we believe that you should be able to make it to safety within the remaining time frame,” Tower control continued in their dry tone of voice, but CB was certain that they were just as worried and upset as he was, and whoever screwed up was already scurrying like rats for whatever cover they could find themselves. 

Once CB was satisfied that nothing loose was going go flying around and crack open his skull, he got back into this chair and fastened his own safety harness and started typing in commands on the control board to adjust his current vector. “Okay dokey tower, message received and understood. *Prairie Dog* performing emergency thrust maneuvers at this time. Let’s see how much stress this bucket of bolts can take.”

---

From the outside the cargo ship appeared to twinkle, tiny thrust vectoring nozzles jetting plasma as the boxy *Prairie Dog* performed a series of rotations that ended up with the craft aimed at a specific spot in space that was currently unoccupied. However, at the end of the projected burn time, that vacant area of space would be where a 7,918 mile diameter blue-white ball of dirt and water was projected to be at, and that is where the MPD engines that suddenly bleached blue plasma pushed the ship towards at an ever-increasing rate.

Inside the control room of the ship, CB was very glad that he had insisted on the extra-cushy command chair when they had last retrofitted the ship. It had been a impulse request and CB had made it primarily so that he could watch NASCAR in comfort, but he was never more glad for the extra padding then he was now. While he wouldn’t admit that he was actually scared, he kept one hand firmly gripped on the chicken switch that would cut off all thrust if he felt that he couldn’t take it any more.

The rotation pattern and burn sequence was all done by computer control, the ship’s software calculating what was needed in terms of directional changes, thrust vectors, and burn patterns in order to cover the needed distances in the desired time frame. Normally, the flight computations were designed to maximize the lifetime of the engine components and the available fuel, which typically meant a quick burn at the start and the end of a flight with a slow cruise in between - but with these limits removed what remained of the equation basically boiled down to how much propellent was currently on board and a desire to not kill the pilot in the process.

 Unfortunately for CB, not killing the pilot simply meant that the flight computer was allowed to abuse the pilot up to a certain point, forcing CB to endure 2.7 g’s of constant thrust for a little over an hour after which the engines throttled back to a more tolerable .85 g’s as the *Prairie Dog* drove towards the turn-over point, after which the entire process was repeated. By the time Earth was in view and CB was on final approach, he had black-and-blue marks where the safety harness had pinched him something terrible and he was madder than a rattlesnake in a hornet’s nest, along with a nasty headache to go with it.

“...I don’t give a good goddamn that anyone is goddamn sorry about any goddamn thing!” CB was yelling at the specialists in charge of tower control who had come out to apologize in person after he had landed. The assembled group were all trying to look elsewhere and fidgeted nervously as the diminutive pilot raged at them from the back of the ambulance that had he had been forced into, the medical technician that was examining CB’s bruising only adding to the Texan’s irritation. 

“Quick poking at me you idjit, you’ll get your turn. You dumb sumbitches had better start paying better attention to what the hell is going on out there and get your shit together, because mark my words, next time y’all fuck up it’s gonna get someone killed! Space is dangerous enough as-”

#***BOOM!***

The ground shook and what sounded like a hail storm rattled and pinged against the front the ambulance as everyone along with CB ducked reflexively, one of the gathered specialists falling to the ground with a cry of pain. Within a second sirens and klaxons started sounding, and everyone started yelling and screaming as dust and the smell of dirt and chemicals filled the air. CB looked stunned for a moment, and then his face went hard as stone as he showed that he still had vast untapped reservoirs of anger he could call upon.

Grabbing his shirt and jumping down from where he had been sitting, he bellowed, “if that was something blowing up because of ya’lls fuckup, I swear to *God* I’m going to stake each and every one of you out on an anthill and invite the coyotes to come and watch!” The attending physician had already left CB and was kneeling on the ground next to the moaning specialist who was bleeding from a wound in his leg. “Quit standing around your morons, get back inside in case something else explodes. What the hell is wrong with you? Never seen blood before? Help the doc, pick Larry up, and get the fuck out of here. Bunch of goddamn pencil-pushing jackholes,” CB ordered, struggling into his shirt, the soreness in his arms and back making it more difficult than he was willing to accept.

Moving around the ambulance which looked like it had been peppered with large-bore buckshot, CB could see that confusion was reigning supreme with people running to and fro, some calling for medical attention while the rest were apparently just wandering around trying to find out what was going on. The loudest calls for help were being answered by approaching sirens, the requests coming from what was the apparent center of the blast - a mangled wreck of what was once a forklift and it’s driver.

“Poor bastard,” CB muttered, crossing himself as he did so. He figured that there was nothing he could do to help and would only get in the way, so he continued onwards towards the *Prairie Dog*, looking for any damage to the outside from the blast, which he assumed was caused by the propane tank - which the forklift used as fuel - exploding for some reason.

Fifteen minutes later he and everyone else were escorted away from the ship by security after being informed that there was a possible bomb threat on board and that they needed to get to a place of safety while the ship was searched from top to bottom, first responders having already determined that the source of the explosion was not the propane tank as first believed, but instead had originated in the cargo from Mars that was being offloaded from the *Prairie Dog,* the detonation triggered by a simple timer.

After being told what had caused the explosion that killed the father of four who was driving the forklift, CB had to be physically restrained from returning to his ship before it was cleared for launch, the short Texan so blinded by rage at this point that he was willing to ignore the risk of flying back through the remains of the CME just to get the bastard who had loaded a bomb on his ship. It wasn’t until the base doctor threaten to bench him indefinitely for medical reasons that he finally calmed down enough to listen to what he was being told, eventually agreeing to wait for whomever it was that the government decided to send with him to perform the actual investigation and arrest. But only until the *Prairie Dog*’s engines were fixed, the bells of the thrust chambers having been damaged by the shrapnel created by the Martian geological sample that had been packed around the explosive device.

“Iffn’ your police-like person isn’t on board by then, I’m leavin’ without’em, and we’re gonna be doing it *my* way,” CB threatened. Short of disconnecting the power supply to the ship or otherwise locking him out which would leave the Mars base stranded, everyone was certain that the Texan would keep his word, so they scrambled to find someone to send with him in time.

The pounding on the door to his rented room woke Chalal d’Nori from an uneasy sleep, vaguely disturbing images turning into tattered wisps that fled as he cranked open his eyes and looked up at the stippled pattern embedded on the ceiling, unable to remember how he had gotten there, but glad that this time he had at least somehow managed to avoid falling asleep in his clothing.

“Com’on Chalal, open the damn door!” The demand was punctuated by the person on the other side rattling the door knob. Chalal rolled himself out of bed and managed to get his feet under him before staggering to the door and unbolting it, almost getting knocked down the in process as it was thrown open.

His manager Adam strode in like he was making some sort of grand entrance and said, in a tone of voice that Chalal felt was far too bright and chipper for this time of day, “about time you got up. Get dressed and packed, we need to get going. Chop chop, time is money.” The human pushed Chalal towards where his clothing was neatly hanging and waiting. As he reached for it, Chalal asked, “what’s going on?”

“Opportunities, Chalal, opportunities. We have an early flight that I don’t want us to miss - I’ve got you booked into the 8pm show at the Riviera, big money room, big chance to step up your game. Speaking of which, get any last night? I saw how those two girls were hanging on you, the redhead and the brunette, hot hot hot,” Adam asked, a predatory grin on his face and a look in his eye Chalal hadn’t seen before and didn’t like very much.

Chalal shook his head. “I don’t recall any such human females, and it would be impossible to consummate such a relationship in any case.” Struggling into the shirt, he had to accept Adam’s assistance to finish the job, the smell of whatever the man was using as a cologne filling Chalal’s nostrils and making him slightly nauseous and his upper stomach going *squish* in agreement.

Straightening Chalal’s shirt and giving it a final pat, Adam said, “well, next time you can’t get it up, send them my way. I’ll take care of that and any other business you need, no problem. Okay, grab your stuff and let’s get out of here.” As Chalal picked up his suitcase and walked towards the door, his gait still a little clumsy, Adam looked around and nodded, satisfied with the state of the room before he made his own exit, the predatory grin still firmly fixed on his perfect face.

My problem however is that I may not be able to finish these courses until well into fall of 2015. I can’t re-sit these exams whenever I want, they’re only given 2 or 3 times per year (depending on the course.) So this means I’ve got a ton of empty space between now and then. 

I’m trying to get a job as an engineers/project managers/ architects assistant or something similar at a construction, architectural, or engineering firm. I do have internship experience, but now for the life of me, I can’t get seem to get anybody interested in hiring me. I’m so bummed out.

I know I can just study for my exams, but it feels like such a huge waste of time to not do anything except study for months without getting any practical experience. I’ve pretty much exhausted my personal network and I’m starting to reach a dead end.

I'm set to graduate in the fall of 2015 with a B.S. in Statistics (Applied Probability and Statistics concentration) with a lot of financial math/actuary classes (And there subsequent prereqs such as stochastic processes) as well as data mining classes, and my second major is econ/math (the math is mostly upper div linear algebra proof classes) which is a B.A.  I attend the University of California, Santa Barbara my upper division GPA is currently  hovering around a 3.2 for both majors.  Before attending UCSB, I studied at a community college focusing on electrical engineering, so i have a strong science/math background (I was accepted into UCSD/UCD for EE but decided it wasnt for me). I'm looking into entering a masters program to further my learning.  Since I am graduating in the fall, most of the master on-campus master programs only do fall admissions.  This leaves me with about an 8 month window.

1)What GRE scores should I expect to have to get into a program such as Columbia's, stanfords, or Berkeleys?

2) Stories about getting financial aid through teaching assistance? Was it hard?

3) Any references for summer internships or companies looking to hire entry level datascientist /business intelligence?

4) Thoughts on Mu Sigma? They are the only data analytics/science company recruiting at my school.

I grew up in the silicon valley, which is most likely where I'll be heading once I graduate, but im open to other locations.

I was wondering if someone could help look at my resume and help me improve on what I could do better. 

I know that recruiting doesnt start until my 3rd year, but I have always been told that I need to ""start now"" and get a leg up on as much experience I can in preparation for recruitment. What do you guys think? Should I be worried and feel bad if I don't land any internships this summer?

I'm a grade 12 student in Ontario and I'm having a bit of a conflict deciding on which university to go into.  I have been accepted to the CS program at UofT Saint George and the co-op CS program at UofT Scarborough. UW is waiting until may for the bulk of their CS acceptances but I have a decent chance to get in with an average slightly under 90%.

The co-op at UW is very well known and many students intern at SV companies at some point. UofT has their PEY program but it's not as well known. In terms of material, I've heard that UofT is just as good, if not better in some areas such as math. I'm in Toronto so I can commute to both campuses mentioned and that will save a good $8000 + some other fees per year, adding up to approx $50000(?). That's not a small sum of cash for my family. Would it still be worth it to go to UW?

Additionally, can anyone chime in on UofT's PEY? I like the idea but since it's a single term I'm afraid of being placed in tech support for a year due to the lack of experience or knowledge. The co-op program at UofT Scarborough seems more forgiving since there are multiple terms but I've heard that the opportunities aren't that great. Most people say that UofT SG &gt; UofT Scarborough but I'm leaning toward UofT Scarborough due to the shorter commute and the multiple co-op terms mentioned above. Also, UofT Scarborough students can still apply to PEY from what I've read.

My goal is to work at a SV company immediately after graduation or at the latest 1-3 years after graduation. I understand that UW would likely be the best option for me if I want to reach that goal, but I also know that with hard work and good experience I can also reach the same goal by going to UofT. Maybe I'm overthinking it?

Thanks for reading and also thanks in advance for the help!"

I plan on landing an internship (hopefully programming) beginning next summer, before starting school full time in the fall.

1) If I were looking for a programming career after my MS in IT, would that be feasible? (I know software engineering would be ideal, but maybe IT would be more broad?) 

2) Is it worth it to get my Masters before getting my ""Big girl"" job experience versus an Internship (I feel like this would really get my foot in the door and prepare me for better careers down the road)? 

3) With my undergraduate and graduate degree potentially gear toward IT, would it still be difficult to even nab a programming internship? I have browsed the market through military resources and there are so many available , most require a CS or related computer degree. 

I guess my concern is since I have been in the military 4 years, while it has allowed me to achieve my undergraduate degree and my graduate degree debt free....that's 4 years that I am behind the tech experience curve. 

Thanks! :) "

I went to graduate school in math, decided it was not for me, and then went on a job hunt for any job that involves me writing code (I have some experience but no real-world experience). This didn't go well (it was very hard to even get an interview). I got accepted into a MS CS program and I am looking for internships now. I'm not doing this just for a job, but because I am interested in formal verification, programming languages, and homotopy type theory (I may apply to PhD programs). I was just wondering what companies might think of a BS physics / MS compsci guy and whether that will make getting a job as a software engineer easier if (when?) academia doesn't work out."

I did well on the interview, since they asked basic algorithm questions but I'm not sure how I'll be able to perform at the company.

For instance my first ever programming class was java and this was before I knew anything about what programming was and how it worked. Now i've taken a class on C and am in a class for C++ and am most comfortable and have the most practice using C++. Now when I say comfortable, i'm being very general here because i'm still learning pointers (although I have a really good grasp on classes and using separate files to organize them...if that means anything). I've taken classes on computer organization and architecture and discrete math but that's it. 

I'm supposed to be graduating in like a year and a summer but feel like I know so little. I knew practically nothing going into this major and have come a long way but feel so far behind the rest of my peers, but I am very happy with computer science and enjoy it a lot. I know I need to get an internship for experience but I honestly don't feel qualified just from reading some of the things on here. I've only used an IDE like Xcode and a little bit of Visual Studio (just to compile and run my programs) and have starting messing with the command line interface and using a text editor (sublime). I learned how to use makefile to compile multiple files that a program uses and can run it through terminal but thats it. I know a few commands from reading things online and the rest of my knowledge of using the CLI is from my own readings and online, nothing from my courses.

My classes havnt really prepared me for an intership or real world experience, just teach me the basics of these languages and that's it. **Basically i'm just trying to describe the extent of my knowledge and asking what is to be expected when applying for internships and what I should look for, work on and keep in mind** because I don't know how much I don't know, and I get the feeling its a lot just from coming across this subreddit. It's kinda stressful and i'm worried graduation will be get too close before I feel somewhat qualified for an internship and then it'll be too late."
2zbnbq,6,2015-03-17,How do I renege on an internship offer I've already accepted?,reversecs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zbnbq/how_do_i_renege_on_an_internship_offer_ive/,"I decided to accept an internship with a very large bank a couple of months ago. I was really not super excited about the company or what I would be doing but it paid well, I was able to commute from home, and it was the only offer I had. So I decided to accept. 

The entire recruitment process was very off putting. They only gave me two behavioral interviews, and they were really just why do you want to work for a bank/ in finance. Note this is not some investment banking job, it was just a regular technology analyst position in chicago, paying $33/hr. I had previously been in contact interviewing with all of the big 4 tech companies but was outright rejected from 3 and placed in limbo for another, effectively I thought I was rejected from all of them and was rejected from the biggest finance companies like Jane Street, etc.. I was just contacted by one of the big four last week for another interview and received an offer today. I really really want to take this internship over the one I've accepted. They treat their employees so much better, the financial benefits are so much better, and I would have a huge name on my resume. The experience would be invaluable and I think I would learn much more. This is a company that I would seriously consider working for full time whereas I would not consider the bank unless it was my last option.

I'm not sure how to go about reneging on this offer but I know for sure I want to do it. I would not be able to live it down if I didn't take this new offer. How do I go about turning my back on this offer  gracefully? I have 0 interest in coming back to this company ever again, or even into the financial industry in general. I just want to do my best to be as polite as possible and make to make the conversation as least awkward as it can be. I also came in contact with this company through my universities career fair so I don't want to get banned from that for my senior year (im a junior).

TL;DR :

I have company A which I accepted an internship offer for only because I thought I had no more options, and I suddenly got an offer from company B which I would much much rather take. I WILL be reneging on company A but I would like to know how to go about doing that gracefully."

First of all let me introduce myself, I am just regular mid 20 year old girl from Thailand  who has always wanted to work full time in big city … I was former intern at a law firm in Sydney Australia. I applied for this job and I got interviewed early January 2015 and they accepted me to work as an intern Monday to Friday 9:00 – 18:00 (but when I was working there I actually had to work overtime everyday and they never paid me one cent for overtime work)  I signed a 3 month internship contract with them, on the date I signed they said to me as an employee I have to give them notice a month in advance if i should resign . However I was there as an intern so I thought this rule would not be applied for me.

I started working with them on 27th January 2015, I worked very hard every day and did many hours overtime every day.  As an intern they never trained me properly one on one or even provided me step by step guidelines on the tasks i was required to do. They assigned me many tasks to do each day, and the only feedback i got from them was negative. It was hard believe me …

Until one day I felt that I couldn’t work for them anymore when one of the lawyers asked me to find a training institute that could “BACKDATE RECEIPT of training course” believe me I had felt sick in my stomach the whole day when I was told I needed to do something illegal and it’s really wrong.  So after I finished my work that day … on the 18th February 2015  I got back to my place and sent them my resignation letter straight away. (I know I didn’t give them any notice. And they should know that they should not ask me to do illegal thing…. )  And I had waited for them to contact me but they didn’t do anything so they didn’t want me back and I thought I didn’t cause them any inconvenience. (if I did cause them any inconvenience they would call me to go back to the office to discuss the situation but they didn’t .)  So on the 9th March 2015 I emailed them to ask them to pay me my remaining salary

But they sent this back to me on the 16th March 2015.

I'm graduating at the end of the year with a BE in EE, where I've focused on computing, DSP and embedded systems. I still really enjoy hardware and low-level stuff.

I may soon have a very compelling offer from a well-known software company. It would be very difficult to turn down, but I'm worried that starting my career in software will prevent me working in hardware, signal processing or electronics further on in my career. 

Does anyone have any related experience or anecdotes? Did anyone start their career in this way? Will ""software engineer"" confine my resume to the bin for future hardware jobs?

More info: I'm in Australia. I have pretty good marks, a year of internship experience doing firmware/electronics, and am a pretty active electronics hobbyist.

2zc3l2,4,2015-03-17,I am frustrated,RustikTie,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/2zc3l2/i_am_frustrated/,"TL;DR: Lack of communication at work, got told to improve in certain areas and they'd improve communication. They didn't, I did. My work is ignored. Frustration. I'll probably get fired. 

I got this job on September last year, it’s my first actual job and at the time the manager of the place was a friend of my mother who had previously given me an internship and decided to keep me. She was ill and sadly died in November, it hit really close home and everyone at work was devastated too, the e-marketing guy got promoted to replace her and everything started going crazy. I was minding my own business and trying to do something useful there but communication between us was awful even though we were a small team of 4.

 

Months passed and from the HQ (our team is set up in a different country) they fired one of my coworkers. She was incredibly hard working, had been working there since day 1 and she got fired without a previous notice. I feel the need to add I found out about this when she came back the next Monday to pick her things up. My manager and my other colleague knew that from a week before.


Next day I got called into the manager’s office, as I said, communication was awful, so I knew it wasn’t good news. I was told the HQ ordered to fire me too, but he believed I could still be important there and he wanted to discuss that with the HQ that evening, but some things should improve from my part.

 

We had a long talk and agreed that I would be on time everyday, a new dress code was going to be applied, I'd have more initiative and take on things on my own without asking permission and send a weekly report to him with call logs and anything of importance that’d happened during the week. From their part they’d try to be more communicative and helpful. We’d try that for a month and if it worked I’d stay.

 

I’ve been arriving everyday 10’ early, they still come in 10-30’ late. I’ve been taking care of things on my own but they’ve been ignored. I’ve been sending weekly reports with important info and they haven’t been read. I feel they’re even more uncommunicative than before and I’ve been dressing with my mum’s clothes as being a 20yo with no experience I didn’t have any ""work clothes"" and don’t want to risk speding my money if I’m not staying there because I have a rent and studies to pay for.

 

Since my coworker was fired they hired 4-5 new girls to work part time and I wasn’t even introduced to most of them.

 

I was decided to keep my job if things took a turn, I need it if I want to keep living on my own, I hate depending on my parents and they really can’t afford much now, but after all this I don’t even think they’re considering keeping me. It's incredibly frustrating. 


I’ve already started writing my CV but was also wondering how can I address my first job experience if it comes afloat on an interview? I’ve actually learned a lot about what not to do customer service-wise and on the administrative side but don’t think ranting about my first job is a good idea in front of a potential employer.

 

Also, is my experience normal? I don’t want to work an office job for the rest of my life but it’s an option while I’m still studying, I don’t think I’m overreacting but I'd love some input. 

Sorry if I made any awful mistakes, English is not my mother tongue."
2zc47j,3,2015-03-17,Two job offers from companies which couldn't be more different,crazy_rat_lady,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zc47j/two_job_offers_from_companies_which_couldnt_be/,"I'm in the UK, graduating this year and have been undergoing the application process for software development roles. Last week I was offered a position on a graduate scheme operated by one of the biggest telecommunications companies in the world, which is very exciting. Then the company I interned with last year for the summer found out, and apparently really wanted to hire me - so offered me a job on the spot. And now I'm completely torn.

I loved that internship, it was fulfilling and I learned so much and produced actual projects which they are using now. I liked the people and the work. Commuting-wise, it would probably be better for my partner and me, since I'll have to spend a lot and travel a lot (roughly 1-2 hours both ways) for the telecom job, but I had already accepted that and been figuring out the best way to do it.

The internship company is tiny due to having a very niche product, but it's by no means unsuccessful. In fact I'm told they're growing, slowly but steadily, and there would be plenty of work available for me. Of course I would also have plenty to do at the telecom, so those cancel out. I have a better idea of the sort of projects I would be undertaking at the smaller company due to having been there before, but don't really know at the telecom, but I don't mind too much - I'm just interested in solving problems, I'm not experienced enough to have any real preference as to what kind. I think both positions would be fulfilling in that regard.

The money is similar enough (especially given that it will cost me more to travel to the telecom job) that it's not really a factor. Both are generous salaries.

I think it has to come down to what is better long-term. My problem is that I really don't know which side of the fence I'm leaning on, I could convince myself either way. I'm so flattered that the boss of the small company wants me to work there so much, but I'm a people-pleaser and I know that a good part of me wants to accept it just because doing otherwise feels like disrespecting the offer (and it's a really good offer, giving me some modicum of special treatment due to how well I performed during the internship. So it's not like I don't totally deserve it but... it still feels handed to me.)

On the other hand, it'll be harder to get the opportunity on the scale of the telecom again, whereas I could apply to a position from the other company in the future. I think that I know I would enjoy the small company and it feels like the safe option. It's not a bad option, but it is safe. And I'm concerned that I would be choosing it for the wrong reasons.

I suppose I'm writing all this to clear my head and ask other people - both currently working and currently applying - what their instinct would be? I've talked to family and friends and most say go for the telecom, but a close friend who works at the small company spoke to me at length yesterday and I'm back on the fence. It's a lovely problem to have, I know, but not an easy one to resolve! Thank you."

Here is where I also messed up majorly.
I am an EE and CE grad, but I have mostly been heavily invested in software development since sophomore/junior year. My skills in software development far eclipse my other skills.

you can see how one would be confused from my most recent work experiences are:

1 Electrical Engineering internship

1 Software Engineering CO-Op

2 Embedded Software internships

I had used programming in every work experience I had to great deal and my class/elective path was almost strictly software engineering electives wherever I could in addition to the EE/CE classes. I took pretty much every Computer Science course that a normal Comp Sci Major would take (there is a lot of overlap and I didnt take some more theoretical as opposed to engineering/development courses) but I don't have the named Computer Science degree.

I'm passionate about software development, and I am not really passionate about Electrical Engineering or embedded software development. I have been getting offers for embedded software development as someone who sees my resume would think I am very qualified in that, but it is a career path I do not enjoy as much. I feel like I am taking too much time right now in my search and it is obviously a big red flag to recruiters about me searching for 3 months from such a prestigious school and in-demand major. I feel like if I accept offers for another embedded software engineering job, it will cast me as an embedded software developer concretely instead of the software developer I am. 
I honestly still do not know why I am getting very few interview offers in spite of what I have said. Even considering this, due to the demand of software developers, I should atleast have some sort of response because I am still very qualified in software development in terms of having a past 5-6 month co-op and related internship and being in a directly related field with experience and knowledge of various programming languages. I have also placed well in programming competitions and judging from my peers in compsci classes, I am amongst the better coders.

I would like some advice, and ask if I should be concerned about my situations and what practical approaches I should be taking.
I am currently living with my parents. I don't have debt and have considerable leftover internship/Co-op money.

‘E points at me, an’ ‘e says, I’ll nevah forget how ‘e said it, ‘e says, “You’re, you’re a Leprechaun.”
 
Now, I ain’t got no bloody clue what tha ‘ell a damned “Leprechaun” is, an’ I tell ‘im so. ‘e just waves ‘is ‘and at me and says, “You know, the little fairies who dress in green suits, and have bright red hair.”
 
Now, it’s true I got me some mighty fine ‘air, and me muther done stitched me good clothes, but tha ain’t no reason to call a Leath Bhrogan what ‘e ain’t. I was about ta let ‘im ‘ave it, when ‘e asks me, “You want a drink?”
 
Now, any self respectin’ Leath Bhrogan ain’t gonna turn down free drink. “O’ course,” I said ta ‘im. “Where abouts do we find it?”
 
“Up there,” ‘e says, pointin’ ta tha sky. “I’m a rather prominent member of the HFY Irish Pub.”
 
Soon as those words left ‘is mouth, I froze, standing motionless. ‘e was from THE HFY Pub. Not a drinker in tha universe ain’t heard o’ tha’ Pub. Waterin’ ‘ole for the best o’ the best, where tha drink flows free an’ the women ain’t much less. “Hell yes,” I says.
 
Tha Fuzzy man looked a’ me an’ grinned wide. “Wait til they see I’ve found a Leprechaun.”
 
---
 
When we got ta tha’ Pub, ‘twas everything I had imagined. Glorious. Tha drink flowed free, joy was rampant an’ there was much carousing.  Fuzzy led me inside and shouted, “Hey everyone! Look what I found, just in time for St. Patty’s!”
 
When everyone ‘ad looked over, due ta tha fact Fuzzy ‘ad one o’ tha loudest voices tha’ ‘ad ever punched me ears, he shouted, “It’s a damned Leprechaun!”
 
“Is it now?” asked a deep, rumblin’ voice. Upon findin’ tha source o’ tha’ ocean o’ a voice, I was greeted by tha sight o’ the largest man I’ve ever laid eyes on. Fecker damned near touched the ceiling wit’ ‘is ‘ead an’ ‘e was wider than a feckin’ cargo ship. Tha metal *groaned* when ‘e walked over.
 
I looked up an’ up an’ up tha’ bastard’s body ‘fore findin’ ‘is big, grinnin’ face. “An’ who might you be?” I asked the moving mountain.
 
“Oh, my name’s Max Findale. But you can call me Max.” ‘is face split in a grin tha’ looked like a mountain cracked in ‘alf.
 
“And if you’re on good terms with him, you can call him Cocksmash!” Tha second voice came from another large human. This one smacked ‘is hand down, up rather, on Max’s shoulder and grinned down at me.
 
“Fer fuck’s sake, Clint, don’t you be spreadin’ that around!” Max growled a’ tha other man. For his credit, Clint did na’ seem too concerned tha’ ‘e had pissed off a mountain.
 
“But it’s so much fun to see you squirm, Maxie.” Clint’s face was split in a great smile, tha smile one gets when fuckin’ wit’ a good friend. Tha’ ‘splained why ‘e was na’ afeared o’ tha giant.
 
Max shook ‘is great ‘ead. “We’ve got a pool game to finish, anyhow.”
 
Tha two men wandered off, arms around each other. I could not see well, but it seemed tha’ they were tryin’ ta knock each other over while they walked.
 
Fuzzy tapped me shoulder. “Don’t mind them, they’re a little strange. Overly friendly and touchy. Though t’ be honest, Max is like that with most everyone he likes...”
 
“Are they partners?” I asked tha Fuzz. ‘Twas a logical question. I ‘ad nothing ‘gainst that stuff, I just did na want them ta get too far ina their drinks and come find me. I am a very attractive fellow, as ye know.
 
“No! Well, maybe. I don’t know. I don’t even know if they know.”

“I heard that,” Tha mountain rumbled ‘cross tha bar, eyes on tha pool table.
 
I nodded me ‘ead. Made no sense ta me, but it ‘twas best to agree with someone who is providin’ free drink. Speakin’ o’ tha’, soon as I thought tha’ Fuzzy said to me, “Now, why don’t we get you a drink.”
 
Now, tha’ was right up me alley. Fuzzy guided me through tha chaos tha’ was the main floor an’ got me ta tha bar. Damned thing was too high, so I grabbed a stool an’ sat me arse on it. Tha Barkeep looked up an’ nodded a’ Fuzzy. “Afternoon, Fuzzy. What’ll it be today?”
 
“I’ll have the usual.”
 
“Aye, one Fuzzy, comin’ right up. And for the little one?”
 
“Who are ye callin’ little, short stuff?” I growled at the man. It was true. ‘e was small fer a human, even shorter than Fuzzy. ‘e did ‘ave a respectable gut, though, the mark o’ all good Barkeeps.
 
“Hmm, he’s a feisty one,” said the Barkeep. “Perhaps he needs a Ted, make him feel like a grown up.”
 
Fuzzy chuckled a’ tha’. “Adult Kool-Aid ain’t ever made anyone feel grown up.”
 
“I AIN’T NO DAMNED ADULT KOOL-AID!” shouted a young lookin’ human man a’ tha end o’ tha bar.
 
“Sure you aren’t, Ted, sure you aren’t,” responded the Barkeep. ‘e turned back to us. “Them young whippersnappers don’t know anything.”
 
“Who was tha’?” I asked Fuzzy.
 
“Ah, that’s just some guy named Ted. He’s not much to worry about.”
 
‘e did na look like much. I decided ta skip the “Adult Kool-Aid”. “What else ye got?”
 
The Barkeep pointed ta tha back o’ tha bar. [A long list ‘ung there, filled wit’ a great amount o’ drinks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2y4y05/hfy_irish_pub/) I pondered fer a moment.
 
“What, exactly, would a Vulva be?”
 
Fuzzy choked on ‘is drink. “Well, that would be a- You mean a Vulza.”
 
“Is tha not what I said?”
 
He gave me a strange look an’ said no more.
 
“One Vulza,” said tha Barkeep, slidin’ a drink across tha counter. I recoiled. It was on FIRE.
 
“What tha ‘ell!” I shouted. Those with earshot all looked o’er a’ me, but I did na care. They was burnin’ the damned drink!
 
“A Vulza’s a dragon, there, Leath. So we set the drink on fire, for symbolic purposes.”
 
“Yer all mad,” I muttered.
 
“Of course we are, mate. HFY is a madhouse, full of crazies!” An arm reached around me and snagged tha burnin’ drink. “If you aren’t gonna…” the owner o’ tha arm said, tossing back the drink in one smooth motion. This time it was a big man, though not as big as Max. This one ‘ad a right crazy look ‘bout ‘im. It was somethin’ in tha eyes.
 
“Adrian, what did I tell you about taking others’ drinks?” asked tha Barkeep.
 
“Sorry, Kepping. But he wasn’t gonna finish it, was he?” The man wandered off before anything else could be said.
 
“Right,” said Fuzzy, “just get Leath here a Pancake.”
 
“Aren’t you married, Fuzzy? Wouldn’t want the wife to get jealous, now would we.”
 
I glanced behind me, tryin’ ta find the source o’ tha’ comment. Nobody left a man ta drink in peace around ‘ere. Tha kind o’ place I liked.
 
“Damn it, CT, that wasn’t funny the first ten times you said it.”
 
A large bearded man laughed, deep from tha belly, which ‘e ‘ad in ample supply. “You bet your Fuzzy ass it was.”
 
Tha newcomer looked a’ me an’ smiled. “This one looks like he could do with a C12, Barkeep.”
 
“We want to get him drunk, not kill him, CT.”
 
Tha man looked thoughtful. “I guess you’re right.”
 
“Why is it so damned ‘ard ta get me a drink!” I ‘alf-shouted. I glanced up a’ tha list an’ said, “Gimme a Wolfie.”
 
Beer sounded good an’ I wanted somethin’ in me stomach. Not two seconds later an’ a mug topped off wit’ glorious golden beer slid in front o’ me. Tha Barkeep was damn good a’ ‘is job.
 
I took a long swallow ‘fore comin’ up for air. Now, let me tell ye. Ye think ye’ve ‘ad good beer. Tha’ may be true. Ye may ‘ave ‘ad great beer. Perhaps. But what I ‘eld in me ‘and tha’ night was true, honest ta gold, godly beer. It ‘it all tha right notes, tha flavor was perfect, and best o’ all, it got me buzzed from me ‘ead to me toes.
 
“Whoa!” I said. “Tha’s damned good stuff. Where ‘bouts it from?”
 
“Brewed right in the back,” said tha Barkeep, jabbing ‘is thumb over ‘is shoulder.
 
“Reminder: the Goat Dance will start in five minutes in the back room.” A loud voice called out over tha sound system. A lone man cheered in tha corner. ‘E ‘ad a very patchy beard an’ looked very shifty.
 
Fuzzy musta noticed me lookin’ an’ ‘e said, “That’s Patchy. He has an unhealthy obsession with goats. Best to stay away from him.”
 
I nodded. Sounded like good advice. “Right,” said Fuzzy, clapping me on tha back. “It’s no fun here at the bar. Time to join the crowd.”
 
“Hold on,” said tha Barkeep. “You’ll need these.”
 
‘e set a line o’ four shots down in front o’ me an’ another in front o’ Fuzzy. “A Stone. Just what the doctor ordered.”
 
Fuzzy grinned. “You’re right. What’s a party without head trauma?”
 
‘Fore I could ask what ‘e meant by ‘ead trauma, Fuzzy downed all o’ ‘is shots an’ smashed ‘is ‘ead on tha counter. It was a respectable ‘it, I felt tha counter vibrate under me fingers. Fuzzy looked up a’ me, slightly cross-eyed an’ smilin’ wider than tha’ Max character. “Your turn, Leprechaun.”
 
I decided I liked this strange Fuzzy man who I had just randomly met in an alley. ‘E knew how ta ‘ave a fun time. I grinned back an’ downed me own shot line. It stung something good goin’ down. Rearing me ‘ead back, I swung down wit’ all me strength a’ tha counter. We Leath Bhrogan ‘ave very ‘ard ‘eads an’ I gave it all I ‘ad.
 
Tha sound tha’ came from tha counter turned all o’ tha ‘eads in tha place. I slipped of me stool an’ on ta tha ground. Me vision flickered an’ a spike o’ pain drove in ta me skull. After a moment, tha shots drove tha’ away an’ I stood on me feet.
 
“Jesus, Leath,” said Fuzzy, “I haven’t seen anyone hit the counter that hard since Olaf. He damn near cracked the thing in two, though. You just dented the thing.”
 
“Don’t worry about it though,” CT said. ‘E waved ‘is ‘and over tha counter an’ tha dent vanished.
 
I could na believe me eyes. ‘E just did magic! “How-how’d-”
 
“Ah, ain’t nothing but a little Handwavium™ combined with ModPowers+3.”
 
I musta looked very confused, an’ do na get me wrong, I *was* very confused, ‘cause Fuzzy just looked at me an’ said, “Just let it go. It’ll be easier that way.”
 
I shrugged. “Get me another drink an’ you got a deal!”
 
After getting’ a drink o’ unidentified alcohol, somethin’ tha Mountain called a Triple Max, I was ready ta join the madhouse tha’ was tha main floor. I wandered in, Fuzzy by me side. These humans sure knew how ta throw a party! Never a dull moment in there, an’ tha whole place was full o’ excitement an’ raw energy. At one point, everyone stopped an’ cleared tha center o’ tha floor.
 
Tha Pub grew silent ‘cept for a single speaker, from which came strange noises.
 
♫It’s close to miiiidnight.♫
 
I felt my feet tappin’ ta tha beat, even though I didn’t know why. A man stepped out in ta the center o’ the floor an’ started ta dance ta the music, movin’ in ways I never thought a man could move.
 
♫You know it’s thriiiiller. ♫
 
Tha man danced ta tha song, perfectly in motion wit’ tha beat. It was a rare spectacle, one I am not sure I shall see again in this life. Tha song trailed off in ta raspy laughter an’ tha man took a bow. Applause erupted all around an’ I joined in. Such strange beings, these humans.
 
Fuzzy grabbed me an’ we wove through tha rejoined crowd ta get ta the dancing man.
 
“Hey there, Billy-Bob.”
 
The man looked up. A grin split ‘is face. These humans an’ their grinnin’. It’s enough ta drive ye mad. “Fuzzy! It’s been too long. And who’s this?”
 
“He’s a Leprechaun! Just in time for St. Patty’s too!”
 
“Did you kidnap him like you kidnapped that baby Loardphuzi?”
 
Fuzzy looked ashamed ‘bout something. I do na know what. “No! Anyway, I put the Loardphuzi back. It’s not like I was going to keep it.”
 
“You were gonna keep it until Hex made you put it back.”
 
“That’s beside the point.”
 
Suddenly, I was grabbed from behind an’ lifted high in ta tha air! “OI! What tha ‘ell are ye doin’!?!”
 
I looked down ta see tha’ it was Max holdin’ me in ‘is massive tree trunk arms. “What are ye doin’, ye big brute?”
 
“Clint bet me I couldn’t throw you like a football.”
 
Oh, if tha’ was it, there was no prob- Me heart nearly touched me brain as I was violently an’ quickly launched across tha room. I spun through tha air, people an’ furnishings flashin’ past my eyes in a blur. I was stopped suddenly by Clint snaggin’ me out o’ tha air, just ‘fore I’d a hit tha wall.
 
“Nice throw, Max!”
 
I struggled to force me thoughts in ta an organized form in me brain, after havin’ them mushed ta bits. “Now wait a-”
 
“Catch!” I found myself flyin’ back ‘cross tha room, ‘fore getting caught by Max. I felt ‘im pull back fer another throw but I was mercifully rescued by another large human. ‘E set me on me feet, an’ I promptly fell over, due ta tha fact I ‘ad just been thrown across a Pub by two giant humans an’ I ‘ad copious amounts o’ drink in me.
 
“Olaf! I thought you couldn’t make it tonight?” shouted Fuzzy from across the floor.
 
“Aye! As did I! But it seems I managed to deal with those damned Xenobots quickly.” I looked up ta see tha wildest lookin’ man I ‘ave ever seen. Long, unkempt hair covered ‘is ‘ead an’ a wild look filled ‘is eyes. I did na think fer a second tha’ ‘e was not capable of makin’ my insides, my outsides.
 
I picked meself up an’ made me way ta tha bar. Pullin’ meself on ta a stool, I slumped over the counter. I ‘ad ‘ad a great amount ta drink, an’ I was very drunk. I felt a ‘and on me shoulder an’ I forced me ‘ead up. I was greeted by the sight o’ a young human holding two mugs o’ tha’ godly beer.
 
“An’ who might ye be?” I asked. Fuzzy ‘ad na introduced me ta this one.
 
“I’m KineticNerd,” ‘e said, “but you can call me KNerd if you like.”
 
“Or intern!” shouted a human from the floor. I took a double look. Was tha’ a cyborg? ‘e was gone too fast fer me ta tell.
 
“Knerd’s good fer me,” I told ‘im. “Why might ye be here, rather than out there, wit’ the rest o’ ye mad bunch?”
 
“Ah, I’m just taking a break. You know-”
 
“WATCH OUT! THEY’RE LOOSE!”
 
“Wait, what? What’s loose?” Knerd twisted in ‘is seat, scanning tha area in a panic. I say movement along the floor an’ pointed it out.
 
“There! It’s tha…little rodent thin’?” I could see what appeared ta be a small ball of fur an’ fluff. It kinda bounced across tha floor, an’ did na do anythin’.
 
“Oh, it’s just a Dizi rat,” Knerd sighed. “I thought it’d be something a bit more terrifying and murder-happy.”
 
A low rumble filled tha air. “Oh no,” he said, eyes widenin’. “I didn’t mean it, I DIDN’T MEAN IT.”
 
From around tha end o’ tha bar came a veritable flood of Dizi rats, thousands o’ tha little buggers. They got closer an’ I got ta see a glimpse o’ evil. Ye might say tha’ there ain’t no such thing, tha’ good an’ evil is a construct o’ our moral minds, but I swear upon all tha gold in tha Universe, tha’ I saw pure, undistilled, evil incarnate in those tiny creatures.
 
They swept closer, an’ reached me stool. I was prepared ta fight ta tha death against ‘em but they ignored me. They passed me an’ launched themselves a’ Knerd. A brief scream, a spurt o’ red, an’ tha deed was done. Tha mass o’ ravenous Dizi rats disappeared, leavin’ behind naught but a pile o’ bones, picked clean.
 
“Uh, yeah, that was my bad, guys.”
 
I turned ta see another human emergin’ from tha back o’ the bar, wearing a lab coat an’ wringin’ ‘is ‘ands together. “Who might you be?”
 
“I’m Dude.”
 
“Dude! Vhat ze hell man?” asked a lanky human I ‘ad na seen ‘fore.
 
“Sorry, Wolfie, they just got away from me.”
 
“Vhat vere you doing vith them, anyvay? You know zis ist a pet free zone.”
 
“I was just trying to make carnivorous Dizi rats. I thought they might taste better.”
 
Wolfie sighed. “Vell, now I must clean all of zis and I must make a new intern. Zhat ist *hours* of verk, Dude. Hours!”
 
“Wolfie, Wolfie, you must learn to relax!” A human dressed in a large slab o’ meat stepped up ta tha other human an’ said ta tha Barkeep, “A round of C12’s for everyone to lighten the mood!”
 
Things got really hazy after tha’. I do na actually remember anything after that. I do na know what they put in a C12, but it made all o’ us crazy. Turns out we decided tha’ 1) we should set fire ta the pool tables an’ dance on ‘em, 2) it was a great idea ta play cards wit’ an exploding deck an’ 3) we should overthrow tha government o’ this planet an’ instill me as King.
 
Seems ta ‘ave worked well, do na ye think? Tha’s what ‘appens when tha HFY Irish Pub comes ta tha system."

She told me to rate them on a scale of 1-10 based on experience level.

I spent two semesters learning C#/.NET through Visual Studios.  I also had a summer internship where I developed a software that was previously written in VB where I translated it to C#, wrote backend and frontend code, and designed the GUI. I wrote SQL tables, stored procedures, and triggers. I've also spent another semester designing a Dorm Packaging System and then another semester making through ASP.NET/Visual studios.  

Should my ratings be an 8 for Visual Studios and C#, a 6 for Visual Basic, and a 7 for P-SQL? What are they looking for when they ask this question?

I have experience in Oracle SQL server, SQL Workbench and the SQL server through Visual Studios.  Does this count for MS SQL?  

The average salary for a .NET dev in my area is $53k. I told the company where I did my internship that I wanted between $55k-$60k and they said that was feasible. Can I ask this of every company?

First time poster here, I did a quick read of the FAQ and found a similar question to the one I have, but not entirely the same.

My issue is, I'm currently in college, I applied for a summer internship position with Bank of America, as a credit analyst. First round interviews were conducted at my schools campus, and though I was fairly nervous (2 senior vps conducting interview), I felt the interview went very well. Last Thursday (March 12th), I received an email from a hiring manager regarding another interview to be conducted by phone with a higher level employee. The email asked for my contact number and availability, and I responded the next day, (Friday March 13th), with a quick thank you, my contact number and my availability for the week of March 16th. As of now it's currently been 5 days and I have not yet received a response to my email, and I am simply wondering the best way to approach the situation. The hiring manager provided her contact information, should I call her or perhaps send another email? Should I wait another day or so and see if I am contacted? I am not sure how soon they are looking to fill this position, as the internship does not begin until May, however, she did specify my availability for this week. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!"
2zepvg,1,2015-03-17,Just a quick thanks!,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zepvg/just_a_quick_thanks/,"Just would like to thank everyone on this reddit for all the advice that has been given and also all the great questions! Never posted anything over the past 6 months while looking for an internship this summer because there is already so many posts in here with the information that I needed. That said, I'm excited to say that this subreddit is one of the biggest reasons why I now have an internship this summer.

For those wondering, I'm a junior at a college in Washington that received offers at both Amazon and Concur. Ended up going with Concur because of the people that I would be working with as well as a comparable pay.

Just thought I would get this out to anyone still searching, don't give up. When you don't get an offer, try learning from the interview experience about what you did wrong and how you can improve your skills. 

Thanks everyone!"
2zertl,13,2015-03-17,Nervous about full time Software Engineering job,toPumpAbitterfly,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zertl/nervous_about_full_time_software_engineering_job/,"I am graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science this may and have just gotten a job offer from a large government defense contractor (Lockheed) in a Software Engineering role in their MST business unite. 

In all honesty I pursued CS mainly because I didn't want to spend so much money on college and end up jobless, I had no inherent interest in CS. Outside of class, I never program or code and I hadn't really put much thought into becoming a software engineer as I only consider myself an average programmer. I planned on going into IT (help desk type stuff) but was having a hard time finding a job and finally decided to interview with Lockheed. I did well in the interview because they asked only basic questions about data structures (array vs. linked list), difference between high level  language and low level and asked about my class assignments  and coursework dealing with Java. (I had no internship experience). They pretty much told me that day I will be getting an offer and sure enough I got my offer letter the next day. I am only considering it for the relatively high salary (64k) and the good experience for my resume (lockheed is a large and reputable company) and then after a year or two finish up an MBA and go into consulting or something. The company also seems like a really really cool place to work; the location I am working at has a younger more diverse employee base than what I saw at other places and the hours are pretty flexible. the benefits are also above average. 

However, like I said, I don't really code. I neither like nor dislike it. I only coded when I had to for assignments. I don't have a github. I only know Java and some C/C++. Overall I am a good problem solver and resourceful esp. w/ asking questions and others for help and looking up problems online. 

Does anyone have any experience with Lockheed? How is a typical work day like? Will I be overwhelmed in a software engineering role given my weak programming background? thanks"

I'd rather not leave my math skills at that level, so my question is this: should I major in math alongside computer science or just minor in math?

I really like both projects, and honestly feel so lucky to have the opportunity to work at either company. I know this is ultimately a question that only I can answer but I want to know if there is anything that I'm missing. Since the work is the same there are really only a couple of considerations that I would like to get clarified. 

NOTE: I am not really concerned with my internship as much as I am looking forward to possibly taking a full time offer after the internship.

1. How do these two companies compete in compensation for software engineers full time?

2. How do work life cultures compare?

3. Is there a significant difference in the name of Google on my resume vs Apple? (I assume Google will hold more weight but is it significant?)

4. Apple is in California and Google is in Kirkland. I feel like this plays a huge factor since the costs of living are pretty different. I would prefer the sunny state but honestly if my financial situation is significantly better I could really get used to the Washington area. I love to ski and I love to play tennis.

5. Intern conversion rates. It is my understanding that as a Google intern I am filling a position that will become a full time position when the internship is over so I think there would be a high conversion rate. I'm not sure what Apple is like. This is important to me as I would like to hold a steady job going into my senior of college.

6. Any other sentiments that you might have about either company. I am really lost in this decision and any guidance would be greatly appreciated. I am just trying to make a decision that will prevent me from kicking myself later down the road. 

Compensation is important to me since I will have some hefty loans to pay off upon graduation so I am factoring that heavily into my decision. I understand that I shouldn't base my decision on this however I really have no preference on the projects. The location is also a big factor as one is clearly less expensive than the other but then again California has pretty awesome weather.

Thoughts? Even minor comments would be really appreciated. I won't take any of the advice on this thread to seriously. 

TL;DR 

Picking Google internship vs Apple internship what would you do any why?"

I graduated in 2012 with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering.  Was unemployed until May 2014 and have been a helper / paint disposal guy / trash collector at a warehouse.  I've been working there since while applying for jobs and working on engineering projects in the interim, but nothing has come up.

Recently, I made a decision not to apply for a 1 year Masters program at the college I went to.  Reasoning is that it was heavily coursework based (a lot of it can be learned through online articles or youtube lectures) and I'd rather pursue research programs and possibly write a thesis in a lab working on a subject I'm excited about.  Furthermore, I needed 2 references, and I didn't want to ask them to support me behind a decision I wasn't 100% committed to.

However, for practical reasons, I don't want to work at this warehouse anymore: it's 26 miles from home, my wrists / knees are often covered with paint when I'm done (which gets all over my car), paint and thinner ruin clothes under my uniform, some negativity from coworkers, a lot of the time there isn't much to do (which is time I could be spending looking for engineering work or working on projects), physical exhaustion when I get home, and that I just don't like driving forklifts (everyone needs those lifts so they're hard to find, random shut-offs, etc.).  I've stuck with it because I need the money and that I've heard from multiple sources that it's easier to find a job while employed.

Right now though, I'm hitting a breaking point and looking for other things.  Of course, I've been looking for intern / entry level engineering work this entire time, but right now, I'm thinking I could do something closer to home and part-time so that I can dedicate more time to engineering projects and studies while I wait for that engineering opportunity.  

The question I've got is that is this a bad strategic job hunting maneuver from a recruiter's / HR's perspective: changing a full-time job where I've only got 10 months in to a part-time job?  I'll have more time to work on stuff (i.e. apps, the wind tunnel model I've got a BOM for, turbulence modeling, design a GB emulator, figure out how to 3D print titanium or whatever I want to build.), but I don't want to shoot myself in the foot from getting internships or entry level engineering positions.  Is it more important to have a more stable work history, or having more personal engineering projects on my resume?

Thank you for any help you can provide."

I am a sophomore ECE student and I recently got offered EE internships from 2 different companies. One is a large defense contractor(think Lockheed Martin,Northrop Grumman ...) and the other is a smaller defense contractor that is more focused on R&amp;D involving GPS-denied positioning technology.

The first internship at the large company would be in Southern California. I would work in a Space systems division possibly designing small circuits or maybe just documenting things. I would have to relocate as I come from Virginia and finding housing/transportation might be an issue. However, I really like the location and I do want to be in California in the future  The pay is around 22/hr + 2k for relocation. 

The second contractor is very close to where I live in Virginia and the work that I would do would be guaranteed to be technical, I might be doing DSP or FPGA related development and testing. The pay is similar to the other company however there is no relocation obviously. The team I would be on is very small just 10 people so I would get plenty of interaction with the engineers and managers. The work here seems pretty cool but i'm not sure if I want to go in that area or into circuit design.   

Overall, my future goals are to work for a company like SpaceX or Jet Propulsion Lab or at least intern there next summer. I feel like either internship would give me a technical background and make for a good internship. The big company may give some name recognition but I am not sure how important that is.

What do you guys think I should pick?

tl/dr: Deciding between two companies, one is large in California with name recognition possibly doing less technical or challenging work, other is small and not well known doing some interesting DSP/RF/Hardware work very near where I live."

I had a 10 week internship the summer between my freshman and sophomore year (which I obtained through family connections) dealing with nuclear security technology. While it gave me the opportunity to interact with engineering professionals, I gained zero engineering experience. I was in way over my head the entire time and learned very little. After my freshmen year I had only just tipped my toes in engineering, with my only applicable classes being calculus and physics. Overall, the only valuable aspect of the internship is I'm able to say I had an internship; I can't even say my experience was relevant.

The next two summers I failed to get any internships (or even interviews for them). This was entirely due to laziness and a dropping GPA. However, despite this, I have received a job offer doing exactly what I want to do, with a competitive salary. I'm graduating in May with a BSME; my current GPA is 3.1. More importantly (perhaps?), no connections helped me get this job. I literally just submitted a resume and cover letter to an opening listed on their website. About three weeks later I received a call to come interview. While I listed my internship on my resume (only three lines of text), it did not even come up during the phone or in-person interview. I can't say for sure if it had any impact at all, but considering they never asked about it, I don't think it did.

Do not lose hope! Keep at it! Internships are valuable experience, but they are not end-all-be-all. What's important is perseverance."

I'm graduating in May with two degrees in a Bachelor of Science and a Bachelor of Art. Recently, I've received news that I landed an internship (8-10 weeks) at one of my dream companies. While I may not be necessarily performing the job I desire, it's still an amazing opportunity that interests me. Well, I brought it up to my girlfriend tonight and she was upset to say the least.

First, the internship is on the West Coast and we both go to school on the East Coast. Even though I'm stoked for the internship, this part somewhat scares me--being alone across country and all. Next, it happens to conflict with one of her relatives because they are highly interested in the same subject and will view this as a showboating move. Likewise, her entire family will most likely have some sort of anger towards the entire situation. To be honest, this wouldn't be the first time either--there's a history of said relative taking everything competitively and it's kind of put a small, but noticeable wedge between me and her entire family. Third, she isn't thrilled that the summer will not be spent physically near each other. Honestly, I feel her pain on this. We're best friends, and the thought of being away for this amount of time sickens me too.

I've explained to her that it's temporary being an internship and all. She's more than compable to understand that it's a dream spot of mine. However, despite every method of trying to align, she's set on yielding our 5+ year relationship if I leave.

I'm baffled and unsure. I can't sleep. I need help. I love her, but I so badly want this internship.

EDIT: I should add that we spend nearly every day together. In a way, it's taken us away from our social life. We have friends that we see often, but we definitely spend more time together alone than we do with other people. 

UPDATE: Going to try and get some sleep. Will update in the morning when I tell her that I'm definitely going to take it. I can't see it going well at all... Thanks for the advice to those that sent it, I'll answer any other ones tomorrow morning.

UPDATE 2: Morning everyone. Just want to say that I appreciate all the feedback. Also, wanted to clarify a few more things. 1) I wouldn't leave for the internship until June. 2) My girlfriend and I had plans to go away right before the internship on a getaway, but of course with this coming up she no longer sees that as a viable option. 3) We definitely love each other. It might sound skewed in the posting, but I think what attracts her most to me (other than her personality and beauty) is her consistent loyal to me and the relationship. As for her relatives, I love them too and basically grew up with them caring for me because I'm always at their house.

With all this in mind, I'm most likely to tell her that I'm taking the internship. She made it clear yesterday that she'll need space until I can give her an answer, so I'm sure it's over if I tell her today. Though, I have to work all day, and I might only be able to tell her via text while she's at work. Should I do that or is that a bad idea?"

I don't exactly know how to start this. It's been almost a year since my younger brother committed suicide which accidentally lead to the death of my father. I always knew he was often sad, maybe depressed but since going to college, I didn't contact him much so the event was a shot in the gut.

I am currently a junior in college at a ""top tier"" university. Throughout high school, I struggled with depression inwardly. I never had any close friends/still don't. I have friends who are generally all very positive, intelligent and for the most part happy with life. 

Regardless of the university, I'm currently struggling to get an internship for the summer (which contributes significantly to this I believe?). The friends I've mentioned have all secured their internships with some extremely prestigious companies. (I honestly don't know if/why they associate with me.)

I mentioned that I've struggled with depression for a long time. I always attributed to my lack of a significant other/lack of career opportunities. In high school, the former led me to thoughts of suicide but I managed to overcome it by almost suppressing the urge. In college, the urge remained dormant until this year, the trigger being my friends getting SO's and internships. 

After hearing what happened, I honestly just suppressed the emotions because I knew I couldn't handle facing it mentally. (I still don't think I've truly opened up that Pandora's Box.) 

I'm sad that I don't have anyone to talk to. I'm sad that I can't hug anyone when I feel like dying. I'm sad that I'm an idiot who can't get an internship. I'm sad that I've wasted these years of college being depressed and antisocial. I'm sad every time I see a couple. I'm sad every time I get a rejection letter. 

In front of others, I always maintain some semblance of  happiness. Though I think some of my friends know of the tragedies, I have not talked to anyone about it. 

I don't know what to do anymore. If I don't get an internship for the summer, I'm fucked. I already wasted my college years so I'm fucked socially. As a person, I'm probably extremely generic and mundane to talk to. I just don't know why I exist as a person anymore. "

* Got a CS degree out of interest on making videogames/programming.
* Started working on personal projects with some friends as soon as I got the degree. Loved to code.
* Every single games company in my country asked for previous experience (i.e. two games already in google play).
* Accepted an internship on a multinational, on an IT position, most for the name that for the chances of interesting job.
* Did not really liked the job. Managed to pull some development, left after the internship ended as no development positions were open.
* Ended the internship, landed a job for a contractor developing in Java.
* Job turns out to be progressively more and more ""ops"" and less and less ""dev"".
* Got laid off after talking to my boss about me being more interested in development that the current direction our team was heading.
* Looking for job in Java, everywhere asks for experience with Spring, Struts and Hibernate.
* Went back to the writing table at home while unemployed, making a game in Unity.

So, I like to code. I like to make games, I know that the industry right now is terrible (specially in my country) and that going indie is the best way to not get enough money to pay the rent. Thus, I'm using the time between jobs to finish the game and ""see what happens"", but reality keeps knocking on my door.

I've done several interviews. Most are asking for someone junior who knows java, mysql, html, javascript, css and a list of derived technologies so long is laughable, and I'm talking about the interviewer asking me for knowledge on several technologies I've used few times over the last years. I've used the card of ""I'm interested in learning this stuff"" so many times that it seems an automated answer, and I've ended up angry after interviews in which the interviewer was asking me how did I accessed through Java to a mysql database 2 and half years ago.

On the other side, devops positions, the closest I got to an actual offer (Even ended up rejecting one). You got to ""touch metal"", got to travel (yeah, work travel! /s) a lot, earn few money and spend the majority of your time messing with configuration files. Then, from time to time, you get to code a bit.

The last one is a QA position that has some development thrown around as it seems some of the tools used are internal. Is the first interview in which I've heard ""yeah, you can learn hibernate here, as the tool uses it"", but I'm worried about ending up running jUnit tests, filling reports and not getting code written. Both the contractor (here in my country is everything about contractors) and the client had told me that the position will become more development-centered in a while and a lot of good stuff about the position that to me sounded like corporate bullshit.

So... now I'm wondering, on one side, if there is any chance on getting a simple, java, C# or even C++ development position without having to get to the operative/implantation level, and on the other side, if a mostly QA position with some (undefined) coding tasks and with a (closed source) framework using an interesting technology could be good for my career towards learning and getting better in Java or in coding in general.

I know that I can keep making my small game and publish it. Even if no one gives a dime for it, I have something done to show, and something to learn from (and that's what I've been doing since I got laid off, recovering the illusion for coding), and I don't really want to get (again) into a position that will leave me in a year without anything cool to say in my cv about technologies I used or stuff I coded.

Right now money ""is not a problem"", given I have savings and enough to sustain me for a decent amount of time, but I know that each day that I don't get to work in a ""real"" company, damage is being done. So... I'm basically puzzled on what to do. Any suggestions?"

I know I have no real chance of breaking into finance with my current resume, and I'm hoping you all can shed some light as to the best path to take to correct my past mistakes that are dragging me down. The only offers iv recieved are from shady looking firms where I would probably be manning phones all day and pushing shitty products down everyone's  throat.. 

 First off I'm most likely going to intern with a large insurance company, who would sponsor me for my series exams to broker various mutual funds and ETFs in the fall if I make it through the summer(selling life insurance to family, friends, and anything with a pulse). ALTERNATIVELY I could maybe intern at a family friends boutique firm that focuses on quant trading, as they trust my intelligence is above that which my GPA indicates. Also I have a first round interview as a corporate actions analyst at Franklin, but I dont trust my resume to survive HR. Which would you suggest I pursue?

Second, I have been looking into going straight into grad school, as there are several programs that base admissions on your last 60 hours gpa, which is the only way I could get in to an even semi respectable program. What iv read is that going for an MSF is basically hitting the reset button, but I believe my case is bad enough that it's neccesary. Thoughts on that?

Lastly: the CFA. Do I go for it? Or will it not help with a GPA as low as mine.. I plan on doing it right now, as I feel I need all the help I can get, but any thoughts in that would be appreciated.

I'm very driven and focused on breaking into finance, I am willing to do whatever it takes but have become concerned that I may do the wrong things and waste my time and money while getting no closer to employment. I am currently most interested in emerging markets, but my exposure to the way all the various departments work is minimal and based on what I read i can't truly make an educated decision about where exactly I'd like to end up.

What would you suggest I do from here!"

In both places where I might intern, they extend full offers some of the interns, so I'd like to choose a place where I'd want to work full time soon.

I have currently two internships offers and I would like other's opinions on which one I should pick. I have family I need to take care of, so I plan on staying local, around the Central Valley (Sacramento-Modesto area) or Bay Area in California.

1) Accenture - The location is in Sacramento and I'd be doing consulting work. I'm not too excited about this, but I feel like I'd have a lot of opportunity to advance in my career. But being a consultant, I'd have to travel a lot, something which I'd prefer not to do, but I would if I can advance my career further. I'd might want to be a manager some day.

2) Lawerence Livermore National Labs - They have a really good intern program with lots of learning opportunities and the pay (both as an intern and full time) is better. I'm leaning heavily on this one. My only concern is that I won't be able to advance my career that much as a worker here. I fear that after working here for 4-5 years, I'll be at a disadvantage over others and be forced to stay here. I'd eventually want to go to the Bay Area.

Thanks again."
2zi0l3,1,2015-03-18,I'm taking a very different path than most people in my class and I'm not sure whether I'm excited or nervous,[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/2zi0l3/im_taking_a_very_different_path_than_most_people/,"I graduated recently from a program out of high school that is kind of a fixed career pathway (most students have the same knowledge/end up working in the same jobs). I actually never was truly sure if this is what I wanted to do all my life. I've been interested in so many random things since I was a young kid: crafting, creating an, instead of reading story books, I'd pick up the kid's almanac or an atlas and learn about the world or the science behind things like the weather lol. I actually loved geography so much, I knew almost every world capital, language spoken, currency in every country at age 7. I just loved learning about science and about people. When I was older, I'd take extra biology classes because I could seriously learn anatomy and physiology all day. At the same time, I started writing about about my experiences with people, so I became involved with editing school newspapers. As you can probably tell, I'm probably a person who has too many interests than one specific interest area. Currently, my hobbies are in: art, comedy, writing, music/poetry alongside health and medical sciences. Like a lot of 17 year olds, I wanted to do pre-med because I thought this would be the best way to couple my interests with life science and people, but seeing how many of my family members started as pre-meds and went on to do something else, I was flexible to the idea of letting my college courses help me figure out my true interests, perhaps in a completely different field. However, I got into this program shortly afterward, which was a professional career pathway, financially sound as it was offered at my local in-state school and a STEM field with a good pay that seemed to have many job openings at any geographical area. My parents were far more excited than I was and I felt guilty and naive for having these crazy ideals about my future career, knowing that in reality there's no such job that doesn't get boring or mundane after a while and that I would have to raise a family eventually. At the same time, I wasn't way too excited about what I was going to learn in my major. Nonetheless, I thought that as I have an indecisive and flexible personality, I might find something I enjoy in it or at the least have a good job to back me up in case I'm still trying to figure out what I truly want to do. 

Unfortunately, while I was in school, a lot of changes happened and the job market has become terrible as there are just far too many new schools opening than there are jobs. I had trouble in school finding an internship position that was supposed to give me the experience as a student to be competent in my field when I would become a professional. Being a healthcare professional means more to me than prestige or status, but it seemed like most of my friends were just interested in the title they'd get than the actual work we'd do. Nobody seemed to have wanted to do anything more than just what our professional scope offered, except I knew some kids who were interested in finance, business and real estate. Overall, I think a lot of peers in my class were very money oriented (which I completely understand and am cool with people doing their thing), but since my focus was more on some very nuanced areas of the healthcare aspect and was the only person I knew in my class thinking in these terms, I felt sort of stupid for looking at specialty areas that were potentially lower paying but offered greater options to do research with population health or something. I became really depressed while in school due to uncertainty with my major and other problems, had my grades fall, started seeing a therapist. But eventually I pulled through and did okay (could have done way better tho).

After graduating, I've tried to look for jobs in every area of my field but it is incredibly tough, especially since it's a very specific role and I never found intern experience that made my peers who had jobs during school not only confident in their knowledge base, but also got them the experience they needed to find a job. At the same time, things are becoming crazy and kids are leaving their jobs or doing something else after 2-3 years. My intention was to find a job specific to my major and do the same, but since it's becoming bad, I'm even started to look for jobs outside of specific title and maybe eventually go back to school.  I've had some interviews for these alternative positions which seemed to have gone well, but people tend to wonder why I'm choosing a very alternative route, if I'm planning to do a career switch, or look at my resume and see how much I've been involved in outside of my major and sound surprised that my interest areas are in so many different areas. I can't tell if that's necessarily seen as a good thing or bad thing. I'm the only person from my class considering the alternative route I'm choosing &amp; just doing something different than most and not having anybody to relate to is making me nervous. But at the same time, in the back of my mind, I'm excited as I think it goes in line with my personality. However, I'd love to hear feedback from people who have done the unusual compared to your peers, some tips and insights you can offer. My preference is to talk over PM as I'd elaborate better, but comments are cool too."

I'm in the final term of my bachelor's degree in software development and I landed my first internship a few months ago. The working environment is enjoyable and the pay is quite good for what I was expecting, but I've become increasingly frustrated by the situation lately. 

I was hoping for an internship where I would be working under people that know a lot more than me and could teach me new concepts and critique my methods as we work on a project. Instead I've been working exclusively on one project with another intern where our progress relies on communication from a far off site group of sales staff. They've been quite disrespectful and slow to get back to us which delays our work.

Not trying to sound like an ass but the other intern has produced terrible code and has no regard for best practices. I usually spend a lot of my days refactoring what he writes and making it fit in to some semblance of logical structure. 

I don't feel as though I'm growing as a developer anymore and I feel like I will be under prepared to find a full time position once I graduate this spring. I was hoping to get a job offer from this company once I have my degree but with the nonexistent oversight and lack of performance reviews I just feel like we're being thrown at a project that no one else wanted to take on.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What was your course of action and how did it turn out? I'm feeling a lot of pressure from my last couple classes and my capstone project has me very stressed out with tight deadlines. I feel like I'm stagnating in the internship already and it's not going to be much more than a bullet point on my resume when all is said and done."
2zi9td,12,2015-03-18,I recently attended a technical interview for IBM and feel a bit defeated. Am I incompetent as a programmer or was the interview hard?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zi9td/i_recently_attended_a_technical_interview_for_ibm/,"Disclaimer: Long read but the TLDR is asking if I'm prepared to work as a developer for a big company. 

I am 19 years old and a second year CS  student. The position was a Java/DB2 Internship at a IBM R&amp;D center. It was my first interview for a large technological giant and I'm asking this question to see if I'm not ready or 'good enough' to work for big companies as a developer. I'm also going to list the questions they gave me and my answers so if anyone can give some feedback on how poor/well I did. 

It was an hour long interview composed of technical questions. The personality part was done separately. 


________________________________________
Here were the questions:


&gt; * What is Garbage Collection? 

I said it restored the memory space of objects after a java program executed.

&gt; * What is the difference between an abstract class and interface in Java?

No answer. I skipped this.

&gt; * On this whiteboard give in any SQL language you know a command to make a user table and fill it with a users name and phone number. 

I put MySQL syntax but forgot putting the data type infront of each variable.

&gt; * Write a function that determines if a string is a palindrome

I got the logic fully wrong but I explained how I would run a stack trace and monitor each step during the execution to solve the logic. (Tried to cover)

&gt; * Write the regex of finding a phone number. 

I wrote: [0-9]*9 which was wrong

&gt; * Here is a Java program. Find the problem that will occur during runtime. 

I found the problem but couldn't rewrite the program to solve it.

&gt; * How can you fix a deadlock?

I responded by using sephamores and proper mutual exclusion as well as signaling techniques. 


________________________________________

Before the interview ended I asked ""Who is your ideal candidate and what important traits would he/she have? Is technical knowledge, communication skills or desire to learn more important?""

As figured since it was the technical portion of the interview technical knowledge was high. However I was upset for an internship desire to learn was low.

Interesting experience but are these questions expected for most programming jobs and am I incompetent as a programmer?"
2zier3,1,2015-03-18,"Am I crazy for wanting to completely change my major to something more ""normal""?",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2zier3/am_i_crazy_for_wanting_to_completely_change_my/,"TL;DR: I want to give up studying fashion design and move somewhere else in pursuit of a degree in finance/economics/entrepreneurship. 

Hello everyone.  I'll try to sum up my situation as quickly and concisely as possible.

I'm a 20 year old guy from the US.  I'm currently working on an undergraduate degree in Fashion Design in Italy.  I've been here for a year and a half and while it has been a fantastic learning experience and I've had a lot of fun, this just isn't what I want to study anymore.  

**I don't want to go down this current path anymore because of a few reasons.  They are listen in the next few points:**

* I'm really interested in fashion design and I took the advice and tried to ""follow my dream"", but the truth is that I can't see myself doing this for a living.  The school is very independent and we work 7 days a week drawing, sketching, sewing, and producing a collection.  The pressure is very intense because the deadlines are insane and the school is very competitive.  If you don't perform, you get shamed by all of the teachers during revision and the critiques are very subjective.  Basically, I'm not an artist.  I slumped into a depression through this winter because of the pressure and how absolutely suffocated I felt.  I've since pulled out of it, however.

* I have friends that are working fashion ""dream"" internships in some of the most expensive cities in the world for free or maximum 1,000 Euros per month.  The career path is to do this for a couple of years until you get hired by a design studio, and even at that point, wages are still poor.  I don't want my father to pay for me to go intern for two years after having helped me along the way through four years of school. I just don't feel that entitled.

* I came to Italy because the tuition was cheaper than studying fashion in New York, which was my original plan.  My school costs about $10,000 per year, and since I've gotten here to Italy, I've realized that while this is inexpensive compared to current American tuition rates, I could study something for much cheaper in other European countries.  

* I'm tired of living in Italy.  I have a great girlfriend here (we've been together for almost a year), the wine and food are great, and the culture is very rich, but I can't see myself living here long-term.  This country can be headache-inducing due to the amount of inefficiency and functionality with certain systems.  Also, the job market is very poor, salaries are low, and taxes are very high compared to the standard of living.  It's a great place to stay for a while, but not a good place to set up a life and career.

**What I'm considering next:**

I've realized through my time here that I'm motivated by money and it's an important factor to me (which makes me a bad fit for fashion).  Over the last six months or so, I've found myself quite interested in aspects of business and economics which I was never interested in before.  I enjoy the real world effect that can be seen in these, and I'm also attracted to the idea of learning something that can make me employable to a wider range of jobs.  I've never been a ""numbers person"", but I have always wanted to own my own business at some point down the line.

So my plan right now is to move home (which I really miss) this summer and go to community college for a few semesters to see if I really enjoy the course work and new structure.  Then from there I want to transfer into a 4 year college and get my Undergrad in something along the lines of business/finance/entrepreneurship.

Am I crazy for wanting to turn my back on my passion to have a career or some sort?  Should I approach this situation differently?

Also, anyone who is currently studying or in the finance world- what are some downsides that I should be aware of?

Thanks."

2ziqav,7,2015-03-18,You never really know people,GDliveon,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2ziqav/you_never_really_know_people/,"
Hello,
Im about to tell you all about an event that happened to me that forever changed the way I live and interact with people. Hopefully it will help teach at least one person out there to always be careful and to keep your guard up at all times.

It all started, so I thought, when I accepted an internship with a law firm in New York City. I was studying for my BAR exam and was hopeful that this position would give me a leg up in my studies, thus convincing me to move from my spacious Atlanta town home to my small, one bedroom apartment in East Side of Manhattan. 
I worked hard and played hard while studying in New York. Some of my girl friends would fly up to visit and I would become their tourist-tour guide of all the best bars and clubs in Manhattan. I also became regular drinking buddies with many of my colleagues and fellow interns at the office. My life basically became busting my ass to barley afford my shoe box apartment and a few drinks after work and studying. 
One night, upon completing almost a 12 hour straight study session with two of my closer colleagues, Kirstin and Heather, the three of us decided to head out for some drinks at a place none of us had tried yet. 

The night continued in typical fashion, talking about cute guys in our firm and our hopes and dreams of one day being able to afford to stay in this beloved city of ours. Everything felt completely normal, except for one thing. I started to feel much too buzzed for only having my first glass of wine. I started to feel very hot in the face and woozy and drowsy. I then began to feel very nauseous so I excused myself and went to the restroom. Over the last several months I had developed a good tolerance to wine and pretty much knew the exact amount it took before I had too much. “It must be from stress and lack of sleep”, I thought to myself, “also I have barley eaten anything all day”. 

I told my friends I was going to call it an early night and call a cab to take me home as I wasn't feeling well. They insisted on coming with me but I refused, not wanting to embarrass myself If I vomited off one glass of wine. “You don’t look good” Kristin stated. I called a cab from my cell phone and he was there in about five minutes, but in that short amount of time I had become extremely dizzy and objects around me where flowing with motion. I walked to the cab and noticed the city was quite and less busy than usual. A faint mist blended with the neon lights creating an eerie aura surrounding even the tallest of sky scrapers.I rattled off my address to the driver and then promptly blacked out.

I awoke to the driver poking me with his index finger. “Excuse me. Excuse me! We’re here that will be $12.35”. Confused and embarrassed, I paid the man and got out of the car. An immense light headiness filled my conscious. I struggled to pull the large double doors open to my complex. Confused, even though this was a place I finished and began every day at. The last thing I remember about that night was walking up my stair case, almost reaching my door before blacking out again. 

“Ping,Ping,Ping”. My eye lids felt like they weighed a pound each. I tried my hardest to lift them open. “Ping,Ping,Ping”. Water droplets falling from the ceiling to the ground around me, a few hitting my face. I managed to fully open my eyes and take a look around. At first I wasn’t even startled, In a daze in which nothing phased me. But then my mind began to collect the facts that I wasn't in my home. “Where am I?” I finally realized I was in a place which was foreign to me. I found myself tied by my hands, to a small twin sized bed on an old rusty metal frame. 
 
Very confused and alarmed at this moment, I mustered up what little I had in me to use my teeth to take the knot out of the rope which constrained my hands. I quickly sat up. The room which contained me looked like someone had very scarcely tried to make an old, dilapidated room look a little more inviting. Paintings of the beach and old houses were used to cover up the old blue wallpaper that had begun to peel away in the corners. The smell of mold and garbage filled the air. There were no windows and the question of what time it must be plagued my dull mind. I began to recollect the events that lead up to me calling a cab after being out with friends but everything after that, my mind drew blanks. There was a small night stand next to me which I immediately ransacked for any information about the strange place I found myself in. The only contents I found where a bible and a photograph of an old barn. 

I slammed the drawers shut and stood and walked towards the door. Still very much under the effects of whatever I was under (at this point I was certain it wasn’t the wine), I took a step forward but fell backwards into the bed. “C’mon! You've got to get up!” I said to myself. Then a thought, a notion, slammed into my hazy mind like a speeding bullet. I reached for the drawers of the night stand again and ripped them open. I found the photograph and took a second look. Just as I thought the barn in the picture became recognizable to me as one I spent a lot of time at as a teenager in Georgia. I turned the photo around and someone had scrawled “ROSE CREEK PLANTATION  1701 Watson Springs road, Oconee Ga”, the exact name and address of the land the barn was located on. I was horrified and baffled at the same time. “This cant be coincidence, and If I happen to know these people, or person, why would they keep me contained and tied like that?”, I thought. Everything in my instinct told me to bolt for the door and run out of the place as fast as possible. But I didn't know who, or what I was up against. So I crept, as slowly and silently as my body would allow to the door and pressed my ear against it. The only thing I could hear was an exterior fan running, assumably in hopes to cool off the extremely hot and humid building. I placed my hand on the door knob and slowly twisted it with the delicacy and precision of a surgeon making his first cut. I peered out the door and saw a kitchen and a living area, another door and a half opened window which led to a fire escape. I noticed a digital clock that read “6:20am”. My heart skipped a beat. I thought I remembered it being 11:30 pm around the time I started feeling ill. I fully exited my room of captivity and began to creep slowly towards what I assumed was the front door. 


The place, wherever I was, was an absolute disgusting mess. Old plates of food, trash, beer and wine bottles and random files of paper littered the floors and counter tops of the place like a fresh blanket of snow. The smell was putrid. I noticed that in one particular corner, Red Bull energy drink cans were amassed in a sloppy pile. As I continued to tip toe towards the front of the place, a blue glow coming from the living area caught my eye It was a lap top  that was left open with a Facebook profile loaded. My Facebook profile.Next to it laid my cell phone. My heart pounded like  drum. I took a closer look and noticed there were open messages with several of my friends. Someone, who pretended to be me, was having full conversations with Kristin and Heather who messaged me in concern for leaving them in such a hurry. The fake me, assured them I was fine and I had just needed some rest and a meal. There was even a status update that read: “I think I may have over done it, tonight! Oh well; Nothing worth having comes easy!”. A quote I had used before. Fear shocked me like electric ice. I wanted to scream and run but couldn't move a muscle. 


I grabbed my phone and looked to my left and noticed something which sky rocketed my fear into unknown heights. There was notes and paper work and pictures organized like an FBI crime trail board. Pictures of places I had known all my life, every house I had ever lived in, people that used to be my best friends 5 years ago, my family, my dog where I spent my spring break my senior year of high school, my car and license plate, all the places Ive worked at, all the places my family and friends worked at. The most shocking of pictures were the ones taken of me from a distance in hundreds of different locations. Driving down the road, at my friends birthday, shopping at the mall, taking my dog for a walk. One picture was taken from a very eerily short distance from me at my high school when I was about 17. There were photos as old as ten years and as new as 24 hours. Someone was stalking me, but this wasn't stalking, this was an insane obsession. It seemed as if this person dedicated their entire life to me, watching and noting my every move. There were hundreds of pictures chronicling my life events. The photographs were like a story of my life from about the age of 14 to my current age of 25. I briefly scanned some of the paperwork but what I found only heightened my growing terror. Names of almost everyone I ever said two words to, their address and places of business, all of my family and their locations, the place where I go to get my nails done at home in Georgia even the name of one of my college professors. 

Everything I had ever done. There wasn’t a single sign of anyones else's personal life in this place except for my own. There had to have been thousands of more notes that I didn't even bother looking at.  A feeling I had never experienced started at my spine and crept up my neck, extreme paranoia and dismay gripping me. I whipped my head around fully expecting someone to be behind me. There was only the piles of trash. I stood up and took a few steps towards the door, noticing the waste that plagued the small apartment was in fact, my own. A this point, my newest discovery did not even phase me or keep me hesitating to fully bolt for the door. 

Just as I reached the door, I heard the faint jingle of keys coming from outside. The sound of one key being inserted into the lock was all it took for me to sprint to the window on instinct and jump out onto the fire escape. Just as I began climbing down the ladder, I heard the door to the apartment fling open and foot steps start pounding behind me. I let out the first scream I could muster of this very bizarre night. When I got a safe distance down, I let go of the ladder and landed in an old alley way. I didn’t look up or back as I sprinted out onto the street. I half noticed I was in a part of town I was only fairly familiar with. This didn't stop my full on sprint towards any direction away from where I had just come from. As I was running, I used my phone to call the police and explain to them what I had been through in between breaths and heart poundings. 

I was picked up and brought to the police station. In my frantic escape from the place I was held captive, I didn't manage to recall any details of where I might have been. I gave a general description of the place and the area of town I thought it was in. The security tapes from the restaurant I was at and outside my apartment building were reviewed but nothing strange was found. This person had been planning what they did for a very long time and knew exactly what they were doing. DNA samples and finger prints were examined, I was tested for rape, which fortunately came up negative. The police told me they would keep in touch and had me stay with a friend in the mean time. In my mind I knew that wouldn't help, because this person seemed to know exactly where I was and who I was with at ALL times, always. I mean they've been tracking me since I was a child and followed me all the way from Georgia to New York… I stayed with Kristin but the next day quit my internship, put my place up for sale and got on the next flight back home. 

The next several months turned up no new leads with the police but instead very deep psychological trauma with me. For one, I developed one of the most severe cases of insomnia my therapist had ever seen. Since the event, which happened 4 months ago at this time, I had only gotten 6 hours of drug induced sleep. And when I did sleep, nightmares even worse than my reality haunted my mind. This began to take a severe toll on my health, both mental and physical. I also gained a permanent sense of fear and paranoia. The feeling that this creep was always just one step behind me led me to have to be accompanied by someone at all times when I left my room. That was the scariest part about it. Not knowing. Not knowing who it was that did this to me, not knowing where they could be, what they had planned on doing If I hadn't escaped, if they will return to try again some day. Judging by the evidence I had found, I concluded that it could literally be anyone, known or unknown to me. That took a deep toll on my mentality. I started to question everyone and lose trust in people most dear to me. I remember just a few weeks ago, a man approached me at the grocery store and simply asked me what time it was. This sent me into a panicked rage that took everything my mom had to calm me down. 

People think I’m crazy, and I probably am, but who wouldn't be? It is mental torture, day in and day out. I wouldn't even feel safe in a padded room in a maximum security facility because by all means, the nurse or warden could be this mystery person. Part of me wishes who ever it is would just do something so I can stop living in fear and wondering if today will be the day. I know they're still out there, now angered that their plan was foiled. Until their next move, I am just waiting. Waiting for someone to walk in my room as I type this. Waiting for the chef at the next restaurant I eat at to drug my meal and kidnap me. Waiting for a police officer to abuse their power and detain me in order to posses me. Waiting on the clerk at the store to ask me for my information in order to join their rewards club and use that information to stalk me. Waiting for my own family or friends to turn on me and admit it was them this whole time.  
I guess you really never know people."
2zir22,2,2015-03-18,Masters: UVA v. Georgia Tech,kevinichi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zir22/masters_uva_v_georgia_tech/,"Well, just like the title implies I'm trying to decide between UVA or Georgia Tech for a Master's Degree. 

I'm currently a Computer Science and Cognitive Science Major at UVA about to graduate. I've returning to an internship this Summer that I had last summer, in which they have already offered me a job when I graduate. 

UVA would cost about half as much as Georgia Tech, and I'd already have a place lined up to live next year.

Georgia Tech on the other hand is ranked much better in Computer Science than UVA.

Lack connections and networking after going to a small college. I'm lost and I need help, please.",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2zisdk/200_job_applications_in_a_scientific_field_2/,"Hi everyone. I am a 2014 college grad that is still struggling to find a position within my scientific field.  Since last May, I have applied to over 200 positions. Every position came with a tailored resume and cover letter and hours of research about the company. I've interviewed for two positions, and have been turned down for both. My last interview was in November, and I'm honestly lost.  

I'm currently interning in my field with a top company in the field. Even with this experience, I'm still not getting calls for anything. Experience and education wise, there is nothing else I can do to prove that I can do great work in this field.

I think that my main issue is that this field requires connections and major networking. I came from a small school where professors, as great as they were at teaching, lacked the connections that one would expect for help in finding a job. Even with this internship, no one knows of anyone that has an opening, or that may be looking for someone within the next year. The only solution that I can think of is to email experienced people within my field that I have no connections with, and ask them if they know of anyone that is looking to hire, or ask them for guidance. Is this the right thing to do?

I guess I'm just trying to get this off of my chest. I've worked so hard for so many years, I've sacrificed nearly all of my free time in college, and I still can't manage to gain employment. I'm more than lost, I don't know where to go from here anymore. I've applied to jobs outside of my field, and I've been unable to land interviews for those as well. I just don't know anymore."

Both are similarly ranked and recruited. The big difference is Cornell's program is done in 1 academic year (no time for internship), whereas Illinois is done in 3 semesters (with an internship opportunity that summer).

I will have worked as a software developer for 3 years when I attend this fall, and have internships in undergrad too so I have some professional work experience. I would love to graduate as fast as possible and get back to the real world, but I'm considering the benefits of doing an internship. It's probably far easier to get an internship at a Google or Microsoft and then land a full time job there then to try to apply full time right away.

I don't particularly want to work at a big famous company like Google or Microsoft, but I also wouldn't want to miss out on some opportunities because I didn't take the time in grad school to have an internship.

After not getting that return offer, I've pretty much bombed every interview I've had, except for a few that I still got the ""thanks but no thanks"" spiel from. Now I can't find anymore established companies that I don't think I would absolutely hate working for.

I was talking to a friend who has contacts all over, and she introduced me to a startup founder who's not hiring, but has suggested a few new startups that he thinks would hire someone like me. The only thing is they're all very small and new (less than two years old with less than 50 people, and one only has 5 people) and I feel like that would be a lot of pressure on me and I wouldn't be very successful. I'm also nervous about joining a really new startup with how risky those can be. Am I just worrying too much? "
2zj7d3,2,2015-03-18,"No degree but many years experience, how do I market myself more effectively?",cs-job,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zj7d3/no_degree_but_many_years_experience_how_do_i/,"I'm currently looking for a job in web development but feel like I'm not being taken seriously by a lot of the people I've spoken to.

A brief history of how I got into this mess:
&gt; I left highschool at 17 to stay at home full time and take care of my parent, I have been programming seriously since I was 14 (I am now 22). As a person I am very tech focused and programming comes naturally to me. At 19 my parent passed away but because I had not finished highschool, university was not an option. I've been living independently since I was 19. From 19 to 22 I attended community college studying Computer Science at a level way way below mine and got the maximum grade on every assignment for the duration, far far too easy but I persevere because I assume it will get better.

&gt;At year 3 we finally begin Java OOP and extremely basic CSS - I was doing Java OOP at 14 and CSS at 15. I struggled paycheck to paycheck for 3 years attending this college meanwhile at home I am completing hobby projects magnitudes more sophisticated because I just love to program. With 4 more years until I can even apply for an entry level job I did not see the value at all - I am wasting my time and not developing new skills. In December I chose to leave and look for something more challenging.

The bottom line here is that I am a very talented programmer, proven, but I am finding it very hard to market myself effectively with no paid roles even though I am absolutely capable of filling one right now.

On my resume I begin referencing my experience from age 16 (my age is not mentioned), I only reference positions where I worked with other people and it goes along the lines of this:

&gt; 2009-2012(16-19 years old): ~3 years working full time at home on a couple of different large emulator projects; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, C, Java, Lua, SQL
&gt; 
&gt; Early 2013(@college): 1 month internship at large IT firm; HTML, CSS, Javascript, XML, JSON, Twitter API - Because of my questionable experience my tasks are small in scope but still good review, they are very impressed
&gt; 
&gt; Mid 2013 - 2014(@college): 6 months unpaid on game development project, I work in the evenings; Lua (and other non-IT skills)
&gt; 
&gt; 2014(@college): 1 month internship at large IT firm, assigned as programming leader on a big client project and knock it out of the park; HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Bootstrap, Wordpress, GIT - Stellar review, they are blown away and I complete an entire project for them for free in 3 weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; mid 2014(@college): 3 month temporary unpaid position at marketing start-up as javascript developer, I work at night(a friend asked for help, why not it's experience and fun); went well, I got a lot of valuable javascript experience, will provide me with a good reference; HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS, huge list of JS graphing libraries
&gt; 
&gt; 2015: 1 week completing an online course re: Angular.
&gt; 
&gt; 2015: 4 weeks developing personal website to demonstrate skills and help market myself, add something to my portfolio; HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS

I have constantly improved and at 22 I'm building websites equivalent in terms of quality and complexity to any popular website you visit. I have tried to gather experience with popular frameworks and libraries to make myself more attractive in addition to building on my programming language skills, but I feel like I'm getting a vibe from people that it's no good because I wasn't paid for it. I just want an entry level job!

How do I market myself as a professional without paid experience? Truthfully I am new to this whole process of applying to companies and dealing with recruitment agencies but I am skilled and capable.

No love for skilled hobbyists?

probably will for the summer too as I take classes.

My problem is I honestly can't help but feeling bit behind. First semester in UIUC 

and I'm taking intro level classes like ECE 110,120 MTH 173, 

two gen-eds. After this semester credit wise I'll be a junior.

I really want a good internship next summer so I really want to start working on it.

I've self-taught myself little bit of Python\PHP\MySQL, only self ""project"" I've done was to create a simple storage website using PHP/MySQL/AWS and a sudoku game on C++. I've only used C and C++ in intro level classes. 

I have a decent programming background my biggest regret is taking the counselor's advice straight forward and not taking CS 225 this semester. 

Just for those curious I went to CC because of a visa issue. International tuition was too much. I honestly regret it tho, I could've worked something out seeing that I'm able to work out the out of state loan... sigh past is past.

So what are you guys' thought on this matter?

""We're sorry to interrupt your normal broadcast to bring you urgent news.""
     
`
`

Meet Mxtfx, Perfection's most famous news anchor. He's a young adult Vzk'tk who's appearance, though professional, looked a little off from your standard Vzk'tk.  

`
`

""We here at Dominion News just learned of an all-bands broadcast coming from an unknown building asking the famed Human Disaster, Adrian Saunders, to rescue an unknown person(s) from imprisonment. This news caster is currently enroute to the scene to bring our viewers a live feed of the event as they unfold."" Mxtfx is on an automated company transport vessel, complete with audio and visual communications and broadcasting equipment.

`
`

 Mxtfx landed a ways from the scene, affixed his mobile camera to his harness, just as he started broadcasting he paused to listening to his ear piece, ""Oh my! Ladies and gentleman, it has come to my attention that the person broadcasting the signal is none other than Gaoian pirate Chir and a human crewmate. Chir was last seen in the company of human Adrian Saunders as they..."" 

`
`
  
Just then a sudden loud noise ripped through the air like a shockwave, followed shortly by explosions and crunching noise in the distance. Mxtfx was shaken to the ground, the camera along with him. Mxtfx looked up and around with the camera still facing him, ""What in the void was that!?"" he stood up, camera now with a live feed of his feet. 

`
`

He picked up the camera, panning it around as he stared walking forward. As he panned the camera around, he could see hundreds of citizens staggering to their feet trying to make since of what just transpired as light debris fell from the surrounding buildings. The pristine facade of the Perfection town's business district was now less than magnificent, as cracked exteriors, broken windows and displays were now the focus.

`
`
  
Then suddenly, the view from the epicenter came into focus as hovering ships positioned outside the building were seen falling from the sky in a crumbled mess. Mxtfx raced into a nearby high rise, nearly tripping over his own feet, taking the elevator to the roof where he had a clear shot of the building

`
`
 
""What in the void is going on? Folks, i don't exactly know how to describe what I'm seeing, but it appears that the entrance to the building has been blown wide open, as if hit by an orbital bombardment. No evidence as to who or what has caused this devastation but we can assure the citizens that the security forces are on the way to secure the situation."" 
 
`
`

The camera zoomed in as best it could from the (1 mile) distance from the scene, taking focus on the entrance, shrouded in dust and debris, where two figures could barely be seen just outside. 
 
`
`

""We have what looks to be two people just outside the building. It very well may be human Adrian Saunders but, if true, he is not alone. We'll try to get in closer for a better..THAT'S A HUNTER SHIP!"" Mxtfx bellowed out, just in time for another blast from a shockwave to hit. This one, being much smaller than the first, he nearly toppled over but kept his footing. The camera jostled and nearly fell out of his hands before he caught it, placing back in his harness, he re-focused on the entrance.
  
`
`

""Something has happened. I'm not sure what exactly but there appears to be light smoke and dust billowing out of the front of the prison. The two figures are going inside!  Is this a Hunter attack on Perfection? Is that the Human Disaster living up to his name? Stay with our frequency viewers. Since things seemed to have settled down for a moment, we are going to take a very short break as we make our way closer for an investigation.""

`
`

Mxtfx turned off the camera and packed it into his backpack. He made is way back down the elevator to the main lobby, as he stepped out he took pause. He could see hoards of panicked citizens running every which way through the partially broken glass of the main entrance. As he got through the doors to the outside, people started taking notice of who he was. 

`
`

""Is that Mxtfx?"" 

`
`

""Mxtfx?"" 

`
`

""The news is here? It's about time!"" 

`
`

""Hey what's going on?""

`
`

""Who are those people?"" 

`
`

""Is this a Hunter invasion?"" 

`
`

""Do we need to evacuate the planet?"" 

`
`
  
Mxtfx was bombarded with questions from every which way from a multitude of species. ""Friends listen to me! I do not yet have the answers you seek. Go home, get off the street."" The crowd stopped to listen to a calm voice amidst the chaos. ""The Perfection Guard should be here soon. I do not yet know who is behind this terrorist act but we at Dominion News will bring you all the information you deserve from the comfort and safety of your homes. Go. Spread the word to go home have trust in the Guard."" 
 
`
`

The words seemed to have calmed down much of the crowd in the immediate area. Mxtfx turned and headed toward ground zero. As he approached on foot, he looked up just as the Perfection Guard flew in overhead. When he finally made it to the scene, guards were posted around keeping the few curious onlookers at bay. He pulled out his camera and started broadcasting again.
 
`
`

""Welcome back viewers. Dominion News is up close to the devastation to hopefully answer questions on everyone's mind."" Mxtfx approached a control line, ""Stop! You can not cross here."" a guard said. ""Don't you know who I am?! I am Mxtfx of the Dominion News and I demand to be let across the line!"" 

`
`

The unflinching guard just stared at him, perfectly and professionally composed, replied, ""I know who you are sir and I respect you, but orders are orders and you can not cross the line."" 
 
`
`

 Mxtfx remembering the camera is still broadcasting, calmed down and tried a softer, more professional approach. ""My apologies guard, please tell me who the Public Information officer is, the public has questions, and Dominion News will give them answers."" ""You're looking for Officer Chewl'le. Walk around the outside of the line, you will find him in front of the mobile command center.""
""Ah yes, of course. Thank you guard."" Mxtfx turned and walked away following the outside of the perimeter line. ""Soon viewers, we will get to the bottom of this travesty."" just a few moments later, ""Officer Chewl'le! Officer Chewl'le!""

`
`


Officer Chewl'le, an esteemed Gaoin, retired from the Clan-of-Whitetips. The ""white tips"" refer to Chewl'le ears, lined on the outside in white, the nickname was given to him from his childhood. Chewl'le founded the Whitetips with the speciality of information gathering and intelligence. ""Ah Mr. Mxtfx, we meet again. Here to interrogate me about the current situation no doubt.""

`
`

""Hello again Officer Chewl'le,"" replied Mxtfx, ""yes, we last met when I interviewed you on the 'Rich Plains'. Lucky for the passengers on that ship that you happened to be relatively close to receive that distress signal. No thanks to the human's causing the problems.""

`
`

""You do understand, Mxtfx, that it was the human that saved that ship from the Hunter attack yes?"" Mxtfx frowned at that response from Officer Chewl'le. ""Yes yes, but if not for the Human Disaster himself, the Hunters would not have declared the 'Great Hunt', unleashing the 'Swarm of Swarms' upon the citizens of the universe."" Mxtfx said quite smugly.

`
`

""Speaking of Hunters, what do you know of the Hunter ship that suddenly appeared in front of the prison? Who were the two figures just outside?"" Mxtfx asked, as a news caster seeking answers should be.

`
`

Officer Chewl'le paused, arms crossed and eyes closed, breathing deep to take in the questions and search his mind for an appropriate retort. ""We do not know of any Hunter ship here on Perfection. The craft in question was gone, along with any person(s) outside before we arrived on scene. The Gaoin Chir and the human are currently unaccounted for. The investigation is still on going, so I have no further comment. Thank you.""

`
`

Mxtfx took this all in stride and thought that these answers were not quite satisfactory. ""Thank you Officer Chewl'le."" Mxtfx turned is camera back toward him as he walked off, heading back to his transport vessel.

`
`


""Viewers, you heard first hand of the devastation the Human Disaster, Adrian Saunders, caused here on Perfection, to rescue his pirate friends with a brazen attack on the city. Not only that, he appeared to be in a Hunter ship! Is Adrian Saunders now working with the Hunters to overthrow the balance of power? Is he so dangerous as to have actually stolen the ship from the Hunters? This attack further proves just how dangerous the Humans are! We at Dominion News will keep all of our viewers up to date with any new developments. But until then, this is Mxtfx, signing out.""

`
`

With that, Mxtfx terminated the broadcast so that the regularly scheduled programming could continue. He made is way back to his transport ship, and sat inside with the door open. Exhausted, he was happy that the streets were nearly clear of citizens, heeding his word, and that no one bothered him on the long walk back. He took a few slow deep breaths and closed the door, tapped on the data pad and the transport ship rose of the ground, heading for his office.

________________________________________________

`
`

Jeng, the new, young female intern was the last one in the office. Trying to impress the would be employer, she was cleaning up and organizing for the next days' activities. As she was moving down the hall, she heard noises coming from an office, Mxtfx's office. She heard him talking to someone, but it was so late at night, she wondered if it was against the rules to have anyone outside the company to be in the building after hours. She opened the door as slowly and quietly as she could, and peeked in.

`
`

She saw Mxtfx, standing, facing a corner of his dark office. The lights were off and the room was only illuminated by the soft glow of the city lights coming through the bay window at the back wall of the room. She took a quick look around and noted that Mxtfx was indeed alone.

`
`

""The Humans are incredibly dangerous. They can kill the Hunters."" 

""That's what the universe needs! Someone to stand up to the Hunters!""

""Don't you think they'll turn on us once they're done with the Hunters?""

""I don't know! I don't know!""

""They're meat eaters for crying out loud!""

`
`

Jeng knew she had to intervene, ""Umm,"" she spoke softly out loud, ""Umm Mr. Mxftx, are... are you ok?"" Mxftx turned around suddenly at the sound of another person, nearly foaming at the mouth and twitching eyes, ""GET OUT!"" he screamed. She slammed the door shut and ran for it.

`
`

A few [10's of minutes] passed with Mxtfx still in his trance in his office, when the door opened again. He turned at the sudden change in illumination and took sight of a small figure he couldn't make out, shadowed by the light coming from the hallway. ""Who are you? What do you want?"" Mxtfx growled out. The figure stepped into the office leaving the door wide open.

`
`

""I'm a doctor Mr Mxtfx. I'm here to help you."" The figured stepped forward and produced a syringe, and gently stabbed Mxtfx in the thigh, and then took a few steps back.

`
`

*A doctor? Why do I need a doctor?* Mxtfx thought, but before he could supply himself an answer he felt a small pain in his hind quarters. He rubbed the injection site, still thinking nothing of it, as the drowsiness hit him.

 ""What's going on? Why do I'f eel fun ny, my my my my boooody gos leep...."" His body was growing weaker and weaker, as he tried to keep standing, his eyes heavy, he sat down on the floor, now resting his head on the floor, his last sight was that of two large shadowy figures entering the room, towering over the ""doctor"" as they stood next to him. The drugs finally took full effect just as the two large figures leaned in to pick him up...

I've also heard that Purdue cs has a High drop out rate. I have lots of experience coding in the past, even had an internship at Facebook as a high school student, but those numbers still tend to scare me.

2zjp7p,3,2015-03-18,Finding Internships in Toronto: Feeling Discouraged,jj2parkie,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zjp7p/finding_internships_in_toronto_feeling_discouraged/,"I live near Toronto in Canada, and since December 2014, I have been looking for an internship through various means such as career fairs, meetups, and cold-calling. I almost had luck when someone I met at a meetup tried to refer me, yet I received no response. Meanwhile, I did get contacted from people abroad for opportunities yet due to personal reasons, I could not leave the GTA. Generally, for all the companies I applied to, I received no responses; thus, I am feeling very discouraged, and I would like any advice.

The following explains a bit about me. I am currently eighteen years old. I recently graduated from high school last June 2014. However, during the summer, I got very sick due to a sudden appearance of adult onset Still's disease. It plagued me with fevers and an inability to walk until treatment became effective by October-November. As a result, I had to defer my enrollment to the Mechatronics Engineering program at the University of Waterloo until September 2015. I recovered greatly and finished my physiotherapy and treatment by January, and I was told by my doctors I was healthy to work or to study.

Even before I recovered while I was stuck in bed, I spent a lot of time studying computer science and software engineering through MOOCs and e-books because I didn't want to waste that time. After, I started working on developing Android applications and server-sided applications. I published one moderately successful Android application which reached approximately 50,000 installs and ranked 25th in Top Free Comics and 3rd in its search category before it was removed. Furthermore, I had a moderate GitHub of three projects which total together to have over 150 stars and multiple contributors. I started getting a small presence on /r/androiddev where I often discuss about or show my own open-sourced projects utilizing architectural and design patterns revolving around MVP or MVC, dependency injection frameworks like Dagger, functional reactive programming with RxJava, relational database management with SQLite, networking with HTTP, automated testing with Espresso and JUnit 4, build variants with Gradle, and debugging with Android Device Manager and Eclipse Memory Analyzer.

Nonetheless, no matter how I try to get an internship, I receive no response. Meanwhile, I know a lot of people without any prior experiences or projects attending the University of Waterloo who are easily getting multiple interviews and co-op placements involving development or quality assurance. I've also read Effective Java and Cracking the Code Interview to try to prepare if a company responds, but I never got to use them. **This year has been very rough on me being sick and my friends moving away for university, I am feeling very discouraged and depressed that I can't find an internship to try to make this year worthwhile. What should I do to try to get an internship or if I don't get one?**

2zjze9,1,2015-03-19,Intern conversion rates,reversecs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zjze9/intern_conversion_rates/,"I have to choose between Apple and Google for my last internship before I have to hunt for a FTO my senior year of college.

It is my understanding that Google requires additional interviews in order to convert into the FTO where most companies just base solely on intern performance. 

I will begin by saying that I would rather work for Google, but not by much. So I know that my mentor for Apple is very enthusiastic about me and my experience and is already talking about training me for a full time position and how they could really use me there. This is very encouraging and makes me feel more secure about going with Apple for a long term experience. But as I said earlier, I have a stronger interest in Google and would rather work there all things being equal.

Can anybody shed some light on the conversion rates from Google interns to FT? How much should this factor into my decision? All opinions are welcome.

I am not impressed by my ability to get the opportunities I did because as far as I'm concerned I'm not in the clear until I can get a full time offer. I'm worried about the conversion and would like some advice."

I have recently graduate from high school in December(not from the US) waiting to study CS at college on fall in the US, and have around 8-9 months doing pretty much nothing. So, I know this person who is the executive director of a company,I later proceed on asking him if he could grant me a internship at their Tech Department. Eventually he accepted my offer, and I have already begun 3 days ago. 



This is not exactly a ""formal"" internship, as they don't really train interns very often. The agreement was based on, ""I try to improve/help out their social media department, and they teach me how does the IT department works, overall"". So basically it's a win-win situation.




After being there for 3 days, I felt like I didn't learned anything. I was basically working on social media, taking pictures and what not, all my time there. I felt kind of hopeless, and unsure whether or not I was going to gain something at the end of this. After thinking for a while, I decided to talk to the boss and tell him that I was expecting to learn, and unfortunately was not. He took it pretty well, and told me to send him an e-mail of what I wanted to learn. And now I'm here writing to you guys, hoping you can help me. 



I want to know what would be cool to learn from a big and modern IT department. I'm still pretty much an amateur at CS, but I really like computers since I was a little kid. So I was hoping you guys could give me any suggestions regarding what you think its very important/interesting/essential/helpful to learn as I slowly emerge myself in the world of CS.


Any suggestion would be appreciated! Thank You in advance! And sorry for my poor writing skills as english is not my native language and I'm very tired."

The issue is that I've realised I don't enjoy working in the finance and accounting industry as much as I thought I would. Instead, I like programming and being surrounded by tech. I've been programming for roughly 3 years now, although it's been more of a hobby than anything else. I'm rather decent at python, C++, php, CSS, SQL and using *nix systems, but still learning a lot. I'm focussing more on doing some actual projects to upload on github instead of just dicking around and experimenting.

I've done an internship in a tech startup last summer as a data analyst assistant and it's been one of the most enjoyable experiences I had. And now's the time for me to get my 2nd year internship, and I'd rather work in tech than finance, especially since I've already been rejected by all the big banks. 

Right now, I'm considering finishing my degree but trying to work in tech anyway afterwards. I was planning on working on my own projects as well as open source projects this summer as I have no chances of getting an internship in tech with my current background. Perhaps even my own startup as I have some ideas sitting around.

What should I do? Am I just being delusional or can I actually follow this path? I can't really afford starting a new degree, and I feel that a lot of the material would be redundant anyway. I'm currently located in London, UK, and will be here till I finish my degree at least.

2zlhke,11,2015-03-19,TIFU; 5 months to go.,[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2zlhke/tifu_5_months_to_go/,"Immigrating to Canada is difficult.

I wish I was better informed from the start, but I'm at a point where with 5 months left on my current work permit, I might not be able to file for residency in time.

Here's my story. 

I'm from a country where crime and corruption is close to the norm, daily murders are common to hear about and generally anything's for sale if you have the money. Early on it's something I knew I'd try to escape until such a time I'd have the tools to protect myself. By 'tools' I mean the ability to have a decent career from the skills I've gained, regardless of where I worked. So 7 years ago, to considerable cost to my family, I was able to move to Canada to get a degree. We were never well off, but we lived very cheaply and saved enough to afford it. For a while, it was good. I'd excel in my classes, I'd make friends, I'd enjoy meeting people that thought about things in completely different ways than I did. The concept of recreation outside of TV was new to me, but I hid it well and assimilated.

Soon enough the beginnings of my fall would be put into place, only to be realized nearly a decade later. I wasn't able to get a job through my university's internship program. Simply no foreigner was allowed - even if you're an excellent candidate. I didn't pay much attention, I focused on my school work, and worrying about graduating on time (I simply couldn't afford more time at that school.) Years pass, and my classes grow tedious, but by the grace of the department I graduate! With Honours!

I begin looking for work. Nothing comes my way, the market is too competitive, I've no experience, I can't get a job. Eventually something opens up and I jump on it. Taking the first offer I had I toil away mercilessly at a job I hated. Nothing else mattered I just needed to get enough work experience to file for residency, and maybe I'd be able to progress in my career if people didn't need to worry about hiring me.

At the time, to file to become a resident you needed only 12 months of full-time work experience in a skilled job. That was really all it took for someone in my situation. But the company gets bought 11 months in for me, I'm fired for following my bosses orders, and I plunge head first into an 8 month long depression fueled job hunt. I despair for months. I'll have to move home, I won't get a job with a degree this specialized, I won't get a job. I wasted all that hard work my family sacrificed for me, I can't live with myself for doing that.
But one day a miracle happens; my phone buzzes and someone want's me to stop by just to chat. I didn't realize it but this was an interview. This guy's small business was growing and he needed someone that would fit in, someone that would be able to help. He offers me a job and I give it everything I have - I rack up billables of inhumane quantities for him and I'm happy doing it, finally I'm working in a job I'm supposed to be doing. My future is my own to make, and I get to do it helping people.

I start to file for residency, it's a year from my visa expiring and I want to get a head start. Now, never before was I asked for proof of my proficiency in English. Never. I was always exempt, why would you question it when my country's official language is English, my degree was taught in English, and I can keep a job that uses English. I'm by now accustomed to placing N/A in those parts of applications. 2 months pass and my application is returned. I need to take a language test. I'm furious, but I scramble, I take one not even knowing what the test was going to be like. Another month passes before the results are given to me. I return my application to the immigration processing facility. Another 2 months pass. After a long day, I'm greeted to a large envelope in my mailbox. That's never a good sign.. ""You qualify, but your application is over the 8000 per year allotment, even though you're a skilled worker, you must use another process to apply.""
Immigration law has changed, the processing is now more streamlined, and quite an achievement for a complicated problem. But I'm again broken. I pull myself together and apply. It's simple and I think I've a high score of 800 at the end of it! Surely that's good enough. I pay no attention to being asked to register for a job bank. It must just be one of those strange things that they'd like us to do.

It festers in my brain. Every day I take the bus to work, I get to think while someone else drives, and well I just can't afford a car. But it occurs to me, I added numbers to get that score, what if I added incorrectly?! I get to the office that day and it's busy but I take a peak at my online application, I fucked up. I've a score of 440, I need a score of 750 at least to meet the average score needed to THEN be even allowed to apply for residency.

I try to use the heartbreak I've grown accustomed to over my past years here, surely I've been through so much this won't hurt, but it does. It breaks me again. I go home and sit on my couch, and think back to the time when I first got a job. I couldn't afford furniture then, and I slept on the floor next to the radiator. Pro tip; you want to stay warm in winter when you've a ground floor apartment.

I reapply, it must be a mistake, I'm qualified! Rules don't change to screw us over. Surely there's a mistake. I make it clear that I have a job offer, I don't need to look for work! But no, it's the same thing that happened with my language proficiency, something I was previously exempt from is no longer something I can be exempt from. Side note: I graduated with a math-heavy degree, things not being internally consistent upset me.

So here I am, 5 months to go before I get kicked out of the country. I've studied up on what I need to do to get a qualified job offer, but it's an expensive and lengthy process. Takes a month at least, some lawyers say 3 to 5 months, costs 1000 dollars, and has the risk of me losing my job. I'm screwed, my employer might not want to help. If they do it could risk me losing my job or it could take too long for me to be able to benefit from it. I'm here waiting for my boss to get back from his vacation to see if he'll help..

Yours, 
r_ck.

TLDR: I assumed past experience with immigration was a good predictor for the current state of things, I was wrong, and I'm going to get kicked out of the country."

I'm a second year CS student and want some advice choosing the best summer internship. I have software engineering internship offers from Lockheed Martin in their Missiles and Fire Control area and from a not so known energy company that has a start-up culture.  

I feel like I'd learn more modern, relevant software engineering practices at the energy company (e.g: they do agile development) vs Lockheed Martin who has been around forever and probably doesn't do things the most modern way since they are such a large company.

My goal is to try to snag an internship and full time job after graduation at one of the software giants like Amazon, Facebook, Dropbox, Microsoft etc. I have heard some mixed things about Lockheed from other students who have interned there from my school and they said it depends what group/project you get put on. But, that they largely emphasis on testing and teach awesome testing practices which I know is a great skill to have. 

Also, would having a big name like Lockheed on my resume actually make a difference to these software companies?

Basically I wanna know your guys' opinion on where you think I should intern at, which would best prepare my resume and myself for the companies in the software industry.

(x-post from /r/depression)",gsodgh,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2zmxvc/girlfriend_dumped_me_last_night_because_she_didnt/,"Backstory: I'm attending grad school in a city far from home. I met my (now ex-)girlfriend through tinder over the holidays when I was back home. We hit it off amazingly and we both said we would like to attempt a relationship. We knew it would be long-distance through Skype. She is a teacher and made plans for her vacation time to be spent with me in the city where i'm going to school (that vacation time is now). From January until March we talked over text every single day and skyped each other almost every night. We both couldn't do without seeing each other. She is the type to ask what I'm thinking and what is bothering me, and I developed so much trust with her that I let her in, and revealed so much about my true self.

I told her that I believe I suffer from depression, although i haven't been formally diagnosed since I haven't been to any mental health doctors to discuss it. I am 26 and still a virgin and never had a relationship of any substance before her. Being a virgin at this age makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit and believe that something is severely wrong with me. She said there is nothing wrong with me but so many people have told me that (mostly online) and I just don't believe it. Earlier on she talked about how she could help me with that, but later said she had stopped all conversation on that topic because she didn't want to build up an ""expectation"".

I am also 26 and still have yet to enter the workforce. I have been going to college since 2006 and this is also contributing to my depression. I majored in something I don't feel is too practical and did not find an internship for it while I was still an undergrad. I was banking on grad school. I graduated senior year in 2010 and entered grad school for my pure-track major from 2011-2012. During this year I began to realize I could do nothing with my field other than become a professor in that field, and have no real-world impact on society outside the field. I want to have an impact, so once I got my first Masters, I took steps to apply across the country to another more technically-oriented professional masters program. I got accepted to that and have been attending since September 2013. I am set to graduate at the end of this summer if I can get all the requirements completed. All through this time I have been trying to apply for internships related to this field and have gotten interviews but they all either never respond back or respond with ""we have decided to pursue other applicants"". I think it has something to do with the fact that I'm 26 and have no real-world experience in the working world. This bothers me just as much as the virginity and I am feeling extremely depressed.

Back to my ex-girlfriend. We were both so excited to finally be seeing each other after nearly 3 months and, naturally, I was excited to have an opportunity to finally lose my virginity. She came and I was cuddling and putting my head against her and being extremely emotional because that's just the way I am. The next morning she told me she was uncomfortable about the entire situation, and was not the touchy-feely type, and didn't like that I had an ""expectation"". She said straight up we're not going to have sex, we're not going to do anything sexual at all, and I'm not even going to get to see her naked. Yet she still said she didn't want to give up on being with me, she just said she needed a lot more time to develop the same level of attachment I had, and it wasn't going to happen during the week-long trip. She made arrangements to stay at a hotel instead of with me. I did my best to accept this but I just could not shake the feeling of not being wanted.

Yesterday we went exploring in town and went to see some attractions. She knows me very well and I don't hide emotions well and could tell something was really bothering me. When we got back to her room I finally told her, she wasn't being receptive to my affections (refusing hugs and kisses even for 2 straight days) and I could not shake the feeling of not being wanted and it hurt. She knew I was a virgin and I brought this up again with her. I'm 26 and my desirability has not been validated for so damn long and now she comes here and continues to not validate that and that is damaging to me. I felt that I don't mean as much to her as she means to me and that hurts me so deeply. Finally I understand I'm being completely selfish and want to consider her feelings but my depression and apparent self-loathing gets in the way of it all. I asked why she even wanted to be with me in the first place, she said because she didn't realize the extent of my negativity and depression and self-hate. She said I wasn't fit to be in a relationship right now and ended it last night. She's still in the city, apparently doing stuff on her own now. I'm completely heartbroken and I know she is too.

Lastly she told me to get help because I can't love other people until I learn to love myself. This morning I made an appointment with my college counseling center and I'm going on Monday afternoon. I don't really know what to say when I'm there.

Thank you for reading.

2zmy1u,2,2015-03-19,Take undergrad research opportunity or keep working in the industry?,lumalav666,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zmy1u/take_undergrad_research_opportunity_or_keep/,"Favorite subreddit of all time, period. Thanks to all the lurkering, I landed an awesome internship almost a year ago. However now, I have a new opportunity that I have to think about, and I would like to hear your opinions:

Intro:

a) F1 international student

b) 1 year left in undergrad program (B.S. C.S. Spring 16')

c) Currently working in an awesome mid-size company with awesome people that is only 25 minutes from home that promised tramit my h1 visa after graduation and it has a lot of little perks like remote work, free local nba/concerts tickets, free food on Fridays, etc.

Actual question:

As you may see from my intro, I have immigration priorities to deal with and I am pretty sure that I don't want a life in academia. Also, I am more willing to do an MBA In the future that a Grad degree in CS.

However,

I REALLY REALLY like the idea of pimping out my resume with research work. Basically, the professor who's manipulating/selling the idea want me to invest a lot of my time to prepare myself and complete an undergrad thesis in computer vision. He is promising that I'll be done for the time of my expected graduation. He doesn't like the other option that I have that is to complete an independent study. (I don't know maybe he needs a lot of workforce to complete his research papers or he really likes the idea of selling the whole academia life)

I have a very good relationship with my superiors and if I am complete honest, I don't think they won't say no. Of course, at the end it is a business and they still need to make money, so replacing me should not be that hard. I think. But of course, I would have to stop working with them. As a little fact, another intern went back to school to finish her degree and they liked her so much that they promised her to have a spot after her graduation. So, that is what is really motivating me. 
What would you do?

a) stay in work and graduate without research

b) convince professor to train me for an independent study instead of the whole crazy thesis.

c) thesis

As you can see, I really like option B. Will he accept? Maybe, but will be a good independent work? Thesis is going to be stronger/more interesting and will have obviously more weight on the resume.

Thanks so much for your opinions"

As it stands right now, I don't think I'll have an internship in the summer and if so I was thinking of getting training/certification in one of these fields. 

* Web development
* Database administration
* Mobile app development
* Security
* Networks

My question is, which of these fields or any other fields would you suggest I should get training and possibly certification in, and if so what certification would you suggest?

I am from California and in the end I would like to find a job here in my home state after I'm done. What is it like landing internships/jobs especially from out-of-state, like an internship in CA while going to Auburn? Is it easy or hard to get one?

I am also interested in being involved at either schools with groups outside of my major, like maybe join a Fraternity, etc. Is it manageable with the rigor of engineering?

Also in the case of Auburn, if I chose them I would have to go to orientation before June 1 (the decision deadline for CSUs), should I secure my spot and go to orientation even if I'm not sure if I'll go to Auburn?

I don't know how to start this except to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry because I have almost no memory of the things I wrote, or even of writing them at all.

Three days ago I woke up in the hospital looking like I'd taken a brisk jog through one of the circles of Hell. I had no idea how I'd gotten here or what happened to me, but from the looks of it, it seemed like I'd been attacked by an animal of some kind. There were cuts and bruises all over my body and a pretty bad hematoma had colored my right eye red. I knew who I was and all that, but my last solid memory was of job searching after leaving my old job. After that it gets blurry. It's a bit like trying to remember what your third grade teacher looked like. 

The nurses have been nice to me, and extremely patient with what I can only describe as my overall confusion with life, but whenever I ask them what happened they have no real answers. The only information I got out of them was that I'd been found wandering around near the shore, bloody and disoriented, and when someone tried to approach me to ask if I needed help, I nearly clawed the poor guy's eyes out. From there your guess is as good as mine, but I'm pretty sure it involved some cops and a handcuffed ambulance ride. Apparently they tested me for drugs and found a bouquet of narcotics in my system. A bouquet. Their words, not mine.

Two days ago one of my neighbors was nice enough to pick up a few things from my apartment, one of which was my laptop. As far as my phone goes, who knows what happened to that thing, it's at the bottom of the ocean as far as I know. Having my laptop is nice, though. I use it to kill time while I wait to get out of the hospital, and also to send my mother an email telling her I was okay. She didn't respond, of course, but at least I did my part. My conscience is clean.

You can imagine my surprise when I opened the page titled “The Body Farm” and found all these things I'd written just days ago about an island full of corpses. I've never experienced anything like this, but my head was flooded with pictures- small moments, bits of faces, both alive and dead, snippets of conversations like sound bites on the news. Each piece was cut too short to make any sense. It felt, honestly, like a dream, something I'd made up to entertain myself, except that some of the pictures felt too real, too grounded to be a dream. I read every word of it. If I blinked more than twice in that time, I'd be impressed.

It's a strange feeling having that kind of distance from something that happened to you. I felt like one of those people who yells at horror movies, except the actor on the screen looked exactly like me. I wondered why on Earth I would go back to that island, not just once but twice, and how I could be so naïve about the doctor. I formed opinions and took guesses as to what the truth was- I'm pretty sure all that missing body and handprint stuff was Terri running around the island being generally insane- and became frustrated with how it ended. That confession bit? I really wish I knew what I was about to say there. Just ten seconds more and the truth would have come out. Maybe it's better that I don't know, now that I survived and all, but as they say- the truth always comes out in the end.

Yesterday was a bad day. The pain was stronger than normal, so the morning nurse gave me an extra dose of morphine along with all the other antibiotics and various meds they have me on. It helped to dull the pain, but with it the rest of me was dulled, too. The whole day I felt like I was being held under warm water, watching the bodies float past, never quite close enough to touch them. It took me a minute to understand what the nurse was saying when she said someone was there to see me, if it was okay with me. All I could say was, “Can't everyone see me?” I mean, had I died and become a ghost? Did they need to ask my permission for me to appear? I said yes, of course, they could see me, and a minute later I was looking at a hand holding a badge, and someone was telling me his name was Detective Andrews and he wanted to ask some questions.

I took a minute to sit up, drink some water and shake off the fog. I apologized to the young detective and told him he looked familiar. He was surprised and said he'd actually tried to speak to me a few days earlier but I'd been too out of it to hold a conversation. “You were beat up pretty badly,” he said, “can you remember anything from the attack?”

So it's true I was attacked.

“That's what it appears. That's why I'm here. Do you have any reason to think otherwise?” I told him I was pretty sure I was attacked, but I was having a hard time sorting out exactly what it was that had attacked me. He could tell I was holding out on him. “I don't want to force you to relive a traumatic event,” he said, “but if you know something you're not telling me, I have to insist for the sake of the investigation.” After a few moments I got my laptop from the side table, opened the bookmark and  spun it to face him.

“You have to read the whole thing,” I told him. He looked confused, but he agreed. A little while later he closed the laptop and handed it back to me.

“You can't actually believe this.”

I'm not sure what I believed, I told him, but a few facts remained: one, I had been attacked by someone or something incredibly violent, and two, some of my memories coincided with the events in the story. He was skeptical, but he said he would look into it on the off chance that parts of the story were based on real events I had distorted. “The brain has a funny way of taking creative licenses,” he said.
 
Before he left I gave him all the details I could drum up and told him his best bet was tracking down some of those interns who had worked on the island. He told me I was better off not sharing the story with anyone else, including strangers on the internet, for the sake of the investigation. I assured him I had no interest in having people look at me like I was sick in the head, especially when I told them a murderous doctor and a girl with a ghost brother were trying to kill me. I told him that included strangers on the internet. Obviously I was lying about that part.

This morning the phone by the side of my bed rang. It was Detective Andrews saying he'd found Doctor Christianson's name attached to the island, but that the university had cut ties with the doctor a number of months ago. He went on to say that records of the interns who had worked on the body farm were sloppy at best. As of yet he'd had no luck tracking any of them down. 

But it got better. He also informed me that the police had found no evidence of foul play on the island other than signs it had served as a body farm very recently, a fact on common record, and that any clue to the doctor's whereabouts led invariably to a dead end. 

A dead end. His words.

Here's the final kicker: he asked me if I would go with him to the island. He wants me to show him around the place, take him through the story and maybe even point out where they should be digging for clues. After saying no about nine or ten different ways, and him saying it was the best chance at finding who had hurt me, I agreed on two conditions. One, we would arrive on the island during the day and leave before it got dark. And two, we would have a full police escort the entire time we were there. The actual words I used were “a butt-load of cops,” but  the meaning was all the same.

He accepted my conditions. We go in three days, the day I get out of this hospital."

2zpm8p,16,2015-03-20,TIFU by ordering coffee like a douchebag,AbortRetryImplode,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2zpm8p/tifu_by_ordering_coffee_like_a_douchebag/,"I had a late night doing server upgrades and so I decided to reward myself this morning with the free coffee that's been sitting unused on my Starbucks card.  I'm normally a black coffee or earl grey tea kind of girl.  I'll buy coffee for my employees and people I'm meeting with, so I'm used to the ridiculous orders.  But I like to keep it simple.    
I stood looking at the menu board and trying to decide on what I wanted.  Apart from the rare pumpkin spice latte I didn't really know what was good that was non-seasonal.  I got up to the counter and as soon as the barista asked what she could get started for me I blurted out my favorite intern's usual order:  ""I'll have a venti half caf skinny caramel macchiato...with an extra pump!"" Never in my life have I felt like such a raging stereotypical white girl.  iPhone in pocket, Prius in parking lot, ordering coffee that's obnoxious enough to make up for the fact I'm not wearing leggings.  I took my free shame coffee and headed in to the office.    
My morning routine slogged on as usual: the scuffle for a parking space, the walk to the office.  I put my coffee on my desk and went to retrieve some papers my boss had left on the printer that I had passed by as I came in.  That's when I heard the unmistakable sound of liquid hitting the floor.  It's been raining lately so I expected another roof leak as the obvious culprit because I have NEVER in my 18 years of having a job managed to spill my coffee (my boss does it at least once a month, which I'm kind of in awe of).    
Nevertheless, there was my extra large and douchey coffee laying on its side completely empty, tipped over by the back of my chair which had apparently kept turning after I stood up without my notice.  The first thing I saw was my phone seemed to have taken the brunt of the butterscotch typhoon, so I quickly turned it off until I could take it home to put in a bag of rice.  The bluetooth keyboard and mouse were the next biggest victims and I watched as it fed some incomprehensible garbled text into an iMessage to my mother while I fumbled to turn both off without letting the puddle progress further.     
As I started to clean up I realized how much worse of a situation it was than I had originally thought.  My external hard drive with my backups and important files was soaked, as was my DVD drive.  It had dripped off the front of the desk and into the drawer that I keep all my USB thumb drives in and had gone under the enormous sheet of glass on the desk.  The carpet was completely drenched.  And absolutely everything was **sticky**.  
That's when there was a knock on the front door to our offices.  I ignored it.  They could come back later when my office wasn't an explosion of coffee.  Then came a much louder more insistent knock followed almost immediately by the sound of our door being flung open.  It turns out my mom had gotten the incomprehensible string of text from my dying keyboard.  So she texted back ""Are you ok?""  No answer (because by then I'd turned my phone off and unplugged my computer).  So she tried calling my cell phone and it immediately went to voicemail.  I had never given her my office number so she couldn't try reaching me there (it's a shared line so we try to not take personal calls on it).  But she basically inferred I was being murdered by an intruder so she called campus security.  I appreciate that my mom worries about my safety, don't get me wrong but I felt incredibly stupid explaining to the slightly disgruntled guard that I was fine and that my mom had been sent the dire message by a cup of coffee.   
With the distraction gone, I went through two rolls of paper towels and almost an entire tub of Lysol wipes mopping up the mess.  Then I spent half an hour rummaging in our storage room trying to find a new keyboard and mouse.  It's now four hours later.  My office reeks of coffee and fake caramel.  I cleaned the carpet as best I could but it's still soaked.  And I'm pretty sure that halfway through next week it's going to start smelling like coffee, fake caramel, and spoiled milk.  In spite of all my cleaning everything is still covered in a disgusting patina of stickiness and no amount of scrubbing seems to be resolving that.  I also still haven't had a cup of coffee. I think this is the universe telling me I should stick to drinking it black.   
**TL;DR: Destroy lots of office equipment and data, mom assumes I'm being murdered.**

2zq1w3,0,2015-03-20,CpE Tech Elective Override,aussiemcgr,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/2zq1w3/cpe_tech_elective_override/,"So I am in the last couple semesters of the CpE program, and I am looking for two final tech electives. I've located a tech elective which interests me significantly and I can fit into my final semester: CNT 4714 Enterprise Computing. Apart from it interesting me, the topics of the class could not be more directly related to exactly what I plan on doing after I graduate, as well as what I have been doing in internships for the past couple years.
A semester or two ago, I tried to add this class to my schedule, but was rejected for prereq issues. I later came to find that the prereq in question was Intro to Discrete Structures, which I took in my Freshman year and received a C-. Despite not being listed as a prereq for in the class catalog or tech elective list, it prevented me from getting into CNT 4714 (I needed a C or better, not a C-).
I managed to get an override approved from my adviser, but CECS rejected it. I visited the professor who teaches the class to discuss the prereq requirement, and he told me he has no idea why it is even a prereq since they don't use any of the topics from Discrete, and told me he sees no reason that I shouldn't be allowed in the course. I then went to CECS to discuss it, where I got quickly shot on the justification that they had a 100% unwavering policy when it comes to prereqs, which was instructed to them by the dean (in a conversation where the person I talked to was extremely rude to me, and flat out insulted my adviser to my face). My final attempt was to email the dean of the engineering department, but I never heard a reply back.
So where I currently stand with this is: I have the support of my adviser and the professor who teaches the course. I have no less than a B in all of the listed prereq classes in the class catalog. Based on class availability, I may not be able to find an alternative tech elective before I finish Senior Design 2. I have several years of real-world business experience in the class topics, and they are topics I intend on pursuing after graduation. And CECS is still telling me I am not qualified enough to take the course, and I have not been able to even contact the dean via email.
Do I have any moves left here? Any ideas as to how to get around this asinine roadblock?"

In mine and some others' opinions, taking a vacation during the probationary period doesn't look good for anyone. 

I haven't had the formal interview with the manager yet. I thought I would bring it up during the interview to ask what some of my options are. Realistically, what should do or plan on doing besides to look for another job just in case this one doesn't work out?

**Some Background**

* I am currently an intern at this company which ends on April 30th (I started in January)

* I may take a leave up to two weeks at beginning of May to prepare for my internship report and presentation to my professor (which the manager said they are willing to give me 20 days max before I can officially start)

* To be honest, I did not expect to get a job offer. I applied for the internship position mainly to finish the remaining credits for graduation. That's why I had planned a trip a year in advance thinking I might be still looking for a job while I'm taking my trip. 

Edit: To clear any confusion, I am an intern that was offered a permanent position by the manager. I'm just going through a formal hiring process that a new applicant would go through. Since the position has been offered, the interview is most likely about my base salary and any additional questions the manager may want to ask me.

Please reddit help me out.,DownandoutMI,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2zq6q6/almost_a_year_unemployed_and_its_seriously_taking/,"And if nothing else, I will serve a warning and wake up call to people. This is a throwaway because several of my friends know my plight and will probably find this post.

I am 26 years old, and this coming May I would have been unemployed for a year. The last job I had was actually an internship right before I graduated law school. Well that summer I graduated and studied for the bar exam. While I studied, I applied to all types of places. That fall, I found out I failed. I took it again, and resumed the job search and after coming across 5 interviews, two from the same company, I am coming up empty.

The feedback I am getting is totally baffling me. Stuff like, they didnt think I can multitask (even though in that same interview I painstaking described that in two of my previous jobs I did nothing BUT multitask) or that I wasnt enthusiastic when I was job shadowing after an interview (I was talking that dude UP about what its like to work there and asking TONS of questions about the job). 

I just dont get it. It seems that was my final chance to get an office job before I get bar results, which mind you doesnt come out until May. My savings are dwindling, and I even resorted to staying with a family member. I am going absolutely crazy not having anything to do, and I know I can be an asset. Every type of internship I had was met with glowing reviews.

And its not like the second I get my results ill bolt, I know companies are giving me a chance so I will reward them with loyalty. I know they dont know that, but lawyer jobs are hard to come by on its own, it might be awhile. 

I just dont know what to do. I prepare for every interview I receive, and I am getting met with baffling feedback at best, and the cold shoulder at worse. I just want a job, ANY job at this point, to bring back meaning in my life. I think I did ok on the Bar Exam, but I do not know for certain if I pass, and I dont think I can take another 5 months period of being unemployed, especially since I dont think I can last much more on my savings.

I'm a CS student, finishing up my sophomore year. I've literally applied to nearly 150 different internships for this upcoming summer, and so far I've only had 1 offer. My GPA is around a 2.7, because of some health issues I had my second semester of college. If it weren't for that one semester, I'd be around a 3.3 or so. Outside classes, I'm very involved in STEM outreach and leadership.

Last summer as a freshman I interned at a well-known, fairly difficult-to-get-into software company. All the other interns were Master's/PhD students, or seniors from top-tier schools. I go to a somewhat small state school, nothing special. I got through a lot of rounds of interviews, and somehow got the offer. I did well with my internship, but when I got called back for an interview for this summer, I screwed up (technical interview), and they rejected me for this summer. I feel like absolute shit about it, because I'm sure the other interns are all returning. I really want to go back this summer, but that's not happening. :/

The only offer I have so far is from PG&amp;E out in San Francisco, CA. Given where I interned last summer, I feel like I'm slipping, because they hired me only after 1 interview, but I had so many rounds to go through last summer before I was hired. It was so much easier to get into. It's also not as ""prestigious"" so I feel like shit about that, because I see so many people getting internships at companies like Microsoft, Google, IBM, etc. and I'm just not good enough.

I've had interviews with 3 or 4 other companies I was really interested in, but they all found better candidates, or just never responded.

What's wrong with me, how do I make myself more competent?"

I am in my second year of Computer Science at a University that used to be a polytechnic school (hence not very recognized). 

For reasons unknown I made a very big mistake;  I **omitted my education as well as any hint of my age on my resume**. On my resume I just included a technological summary of my skills, my past internship/work experience and that's it. Right now I am slightly freaking out that I have lost  many *potential* opportunities because of this stupid mistake. 

I apply mostly on Indeed, Monster and Career Builder and since I'm not part of any Co-op program there aren't many paid internship positions in my area abit the ones I applied to. (Maybe I'm not searching hard enough but I applied to 40+ places with one or two that open daily)

I want to get back in touch with these companies or reapply with an updated resume but am unsure of how to do it.

________________________________________

I have a few questions

1. How should I handle my mistake? Should I reapply to positions still open? 

2.  If a job ad was posted +15 days ago but isn't taken down should I assume the job is still vacent? 

3.  I planned to ask this as a separate question so *don't feel obliged to answer* Or ask me to post this separately. Will applying for developer jobs that pay stipends/below minimum hurt my future career prospects?

2zqowo,1,2015-03-20,"Temp positions vs post office job with ""various hours"".",PeterMus,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2zqowo/temp_positions_vs_post_office_job_with_various/,"I've posted here several times recently trying to work on finding a job. It's been several months since I began looking. I'm a recent grad with 2 internships and working on a third at the moment. 

I recently rejoined a temp agency 

After two weeks they've found a job doing clerical work at a car financing company. It's guaranteed to be 1 week, possibly stretching into 2-3 weeks full time and they do all their permanent hiring through the agency. So the possibility of being hired permanently is there. I've been told they're looking to hire FT people from the pool of temps (which could be a lie...). 

I've also been asked to interview with the Post master for an assistant carrier position at the post office. I scored well on the in person exam they require every applicant take. I've been asked to interview for two different areas in the same capacity...meaning two different post offices want to interview me. I'm very confident I'd be taken on as they've continued to pursue me. 

But I'll keep the scenario hypothetical at this point. 


The temp job pays 12.00/h

The assistant carrier position pays 15.60/h


My career goal at this point is to gain office experience. I just finished an internship with a U.S senator about 3 months ago and for the last month I've been interning with a start up non profit. Regardless of which position I'd take I'll continue working with the non profit. 


My question is should I 

1) Take the temp position, hope it last a few weeks and potentially go for permanent. I'm thinking even if it doesn't last more than 2 weeks I'll still build some history with the temp agency and hopefully continue to get placements in offices where I'm trying to build experience. 

or

2) Take the post office position which has various hours... the glassdoor reviews I've read have ranged from 60 hours a week (6 days a week) to 10 hours or less a week. It depends on the area and the time of year as well as the current full time staff (sick leave, etc). 

You essentially cover routes when needed and assist when there is demand. 



Ultimately I'm thinking the temp agency is the best bet. If I prove I'm reliable then I could continue getting placements at full time. The post office could pay off if I'm getting significant hours but it's no guarantee either. 

I know I still need more information, but what would you guys suggest?

anything I haven't thought about?

I recently got turned-down from the only internship I had in mind(which wasn't profession-related) and I am absolutely clueless as to where to start looking; most internships seem to require knowledge of multiple languages -with a large amount of them requiring a lengthy experience with those languages- so I am left really confused and frustrated and wondering if it is possible to find internships that would even consider me?

I am curious what you guys think about my situation or advice you may have for me. 
 
Background:

I am a 25 year old female and next spring I will finish my BA in IT with a focus in programming and my 4 year Air Force enlistment. After long debate about an MS in Software Engineering or MS in IT, I think I have decided to go the IT route.  I think with my leadership/organization skills from the military, my programming and tech skills from previous jobs, and my personality, this would be a good fit for me. Prior to the military I had 4 years at an IT company repairing computers and then eventually database admin and programming. Still a ""military on leave"" employee there, so on paper 8 years with that company.  

I plan on interning with a few companies while going to grad school to get my foot back in the door and help me decide for sure what I want. 

Now for my questions...
1) For internships, what type of positions should I look at? I know this may sound silly, but I'm not sure how many project management internships there would be. I love programming, so should I go in that direction to obtain more experience to become more qualified?

2) Once grad school and my internships are complete, do you think this would be an adequate amount of experience to start in project management right off the bat or would I need more experience?  

I guess my concerns are:
+ I don't want my 4 years of military (and not in the IT world) hurt my chances in the experience department, hence interning.
+ I don't want to come into an entry level position (again) with an MS and previous exp, or for the MS to hold me back on jobs 

Thanks for taking the time to read this :) I appreciate your guys thoughts and advice!


EDIT - The reason I am jumping straight into grad school is A) I'll be getting it paid for and living expenses. B) I want to experience being a full time student for once. :) "

I can't really mentally lay my finger on what I want out of a job, so I am posting here to see if there's some advice on trying to find the ""right fit"" in a helpful way.

Im 36 years old, started working when I was 14-15 in the summers for a my family's business which was asphalt paving.  Did that pretty much anytime I wasn't working somewhere else if school scheduling permitted and work was available.

Did a summer of quickly taught translation from Dibol to C in high school at a summer job, it was OK.  Nothing spectacular, being by far and away the youngest person there aside from other summer employees doing the same jobs was off-putting.  And it ended up being kind of  a competition at speed of translation instead of how useful it was when it was finally implemented, which I also didn't care for.  Wasn't around when their system went live, so never saw it really used or heard anything about it.

For fun after this, I did some programming on a MUD (multi-user dungeon), sort of a text based MMO for those not familiar with them.  I really enjoyed adding new things and being able to fix problems as they occurred and just generally making it a better experience for the players.  Plus it was something I enjoyed playing myself, monitoring, and interacting with the players.  Eventually someone else who hosted it started taking a lot of credit for my work and I was getting busy with college work, so I left.  

Had a co-op/paid intern position at a place working on medical imaging for 2-3 years while in college.  It was interesting at first, seeing how everything was laid out and how things were handled by different groups.  But I felt that the coops/interns at the company weren't really being ""trained"" or handled like a real junior employee would have been, or at least I wasn't.  And I really started to care less and less about the job.  I was not offered a full time position, which really bugged me more than I would have admitted at the time but it made sense as I had been put on a lot of non-critical ""future project"" type work that really never turned into anything.  I definitely would not have liked continuing with that with how open ended they left it for me to decide what to do, but I had absolutely no framework to work within to come up with something that would at least look like it met the planet Earth's expectation of &lt;xyz&gt;.  AFAIK this company has been bought out at least once, maybe twice now.  And I dont know of anyone still working there...so it kind of seems like a pretty useless work history point on my resume TBH.

After getting out of college and not being offered a job there, I applied some places but it was during the dotcom bust and I was competing with 10-15 years experience people going for the same positions and it was looking bleak so I went back to the family business and slowly tapered off looking because those summer back breaking jobs left me lucky if I could get out of the bed the next day.

Had another 6 month programming job I kind of landed from a friend doing some part-time contract work for a guy, who wanted to bring it in house.   He recommended me, it was going great for 4 months.  I felt like I was doing a pretty good job for being alone on it.  Was making some medical billing software, it was sort of a bridge between some medical charting software to make it entirely paperless for offices looking to go that way.  But around the 4 month mark, the owner of the company started getting it in his head that he was going to roll this out to hospitals and I was going to be able to account for every nuance of their systems so it wouldn't crash and burn.  I started asking for him to hire at least one more person so I had someone to bounce ideas off of at the very least, and someone would always been in the office since sometimes I had to go on-site to do upgrades or fix issues.  He gave me a raise, which I was paid hourly and working like 55 hours a week just to keep up with the current production, phone calls, support, etc.  Then when I brought it up again 5-6 months into the job, he said no.  And I gave my two weeks, because it just wasn't going to happen with me alone there and it was starting to affect my health being that stressed out and his expectations were only growing.  I loved my immediate boss on it, but the owner had final word and it really didn't matter what I said eventually.

After that I gave up on looking for programming work, lost total interest in the software development aspect.  I still enjoy messing around with the hardware and configuring systems when they have a bit of a challenge to them or are new.  I don't really like doing mundane stuff that could be easily automated if they just invested the money to do so, I'll do it some if it's a small number of computers.  But I can't see myself supporting anything over 10 computers without having software to automate a lot of it.

I have a bachelors in Computer Science, I believe my overall GPA was 3.3-3.4, with the CS aspect of it being higher but never officially calculated.

So, I've basically been part-time employed for 6-8 years now.  For the most part I'd consider myself unemployed just because it's very little work keeping up with a couple family owned business things and helping my parents with paperwork on some properties they own.  The asphalt company they had went under when the economy fell out in 2007-2008.....work just dwindled off and was no point bringing it back after the season ended.

I looked for work for years, still submit some applications on jobs that look like I might enjoy them by their descriptions.  Such as Network Engineer, etc.    But I just don't have the work experience for them IMO.  And I really hate fluffing resumes or BSing in job interviews.  I mean it REALLY bothers me how much bullshit these people are expecting from applicants because it makes the reasonable/accurate resumes look like you've been eating paint chips in comparison.  Plus I live near a Air Force Base and the majority of the jobs and bigger businesses are related to work for or on the base, so security clearances help there.  That's not to say there isn't work, I'm just not getting any bites on it...and quite frankly Im not sure I even want to be in the computer science aspect of it anymore because I don't like how little many places value their IT staff and anything they associate with ""tech"".


I've done some career assessments at the University I went to, but I felt like the people giving these assessments had absolutely no idea what the job prospects in the tech field looked like or your options.  So I guess Im here to see if the people here in the subreddit can take this post and give me some ways to evaluate things that I can turn into a goal and some sort of ""path"" to reach said goal before Im 40.  Hopefully with the least debt possible, but at this point if it will get me somewhere I really don't care anymore.  Because where I am right now is not sustainable, not fulfilling, and honestly not worth living to continue on with.  I am in such a bad emotional place right now I can't even imagine being here months from now.  It just is what it is, so try to be constructive because I realize it's fucked...Ive spent PLENTY of time thinking about how fucked it is.

I really dont' want to limit you, but the job has to have some availability obviously so mere mortals can achieve it.  

And I guess we'll see where the questions and comments take this.

A little background, I am an international student in a Master program in the US. I am switching career from EE in undergrad to data analytic, because after my last internship I felt like EE is not for me. Summer is coming, and I am looking for an internship. However, probably due to my prior professional work experiences don't match the job very well and international status, I have been applying since late Feb till now with no call. Pretty pressured because I know if I don't get more experience on my resume I will get fucked when I get out of school.

I applied for a job on Tuesday. The job is perfect, good pay and will run from May till Dec, so I can get 7 months of relevant exp on my resume. On Wednesday, after laying at the house all day long applying for jobs, I went to the gym and decided I would do cardio because I haven't done it like forever. At 6:00PM , as I entered the peak of my HIIT, my phone rang, on the other side was the recruiter for the firm saying he want to discuss the internship with me. I couldn't hear him clearly due to me breathing hard, and all the music in the gym. Hell, I was barely able to hold my breath, let alone hold a proper conversation. So I told him it's not an appropriate time to have a serious conversation because I am at the gym, it is very noisy and I am exhausted. He told me he could call back again at a later time. I ask him to call back on Thursday morning, and I said I would send him an email to remind him.

I waited the whole day on Thursday, no call. I called his office and it went to his voice mail. Email, no reply. I think he was probably pissed off at my attitude. My roommate is trying to console me saying it's not my fault, because it's 6PM I should be able to do something with my life beside applying for jobs, and I still have time. But I am just going from stressing out to freaking out. My family were against me going to grad school to switch major, so I am going to grad school with almost no support just because I want to do what I want. Without summer job financial matter will be tight also, but it's another matter. And I had to blow the only chance to an interview I had. 


My roommate bought me some vodka to cheer me up, so I am tipsy. Sorry for any grammar mistake I would make.  


TL;DR: Recruiter called while doing HIIT, couldn't hold the conversation. Recruiter told me he would call back the next day, never did. All this while effort to find internship is in vain.

A bit of background on me: I spent a couple of years working on a CS undergrad degree. I somehow became enamored with the idea of becoming a history professor so I switched out of CS and got a BA and MA in history (dropped out of a PhD in history to get a job at a software company). I took an internship at said company and made my way up the ladder in the last two years working in marketing, then as an IT guy, then as a QA guy, and now I've been promoted to a full-time software developer. Hurray! 

Now my question to you guys. Given the fact that I don't have a BS in CS, is it worth my time to even consider getting more degrees to qualify myself as a developer? I would like to work my way up to dev manager, then keep moving up. I know experience as a dev is the most important qualification, but I'm wondering if I should:
a) get an MS in CS to qualify my CS background. I've already done the prerequisite course work when I was an undergrad.
b) an MBA in IT is a bit more versatile, yet vague, degree. This will definitely help in going down a management route, but I fear I might need something a bit more rigid to qualify my technical knowledge such as an MS

By the way, I wouldn't pursue a degree any time soon. It would be about 5 years out in the future assuming my career stays on track and I stay gainfully employed and get good experience. 

What do you guys think? "

1. Will companies even give me an internship if I have only been at Davis 1 year?  Plenty friends I know there have gotten internships at great companies but they were not transfers.

2. Should I delay my graduation so I can have 2 summers for internships?

Thanks"

Basically, I have one workbook on my laptop with a very basic table format with columns of First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Address. I will need to then try and match the items in this workbook to items in a second workbook. I'd be fine with doing an initial match on the last name, and then possibly the first name to consider it a duplicate record. 

The main problem is that this whole process is part of lawsuit my company is a part of, and as such, I:

1. Can't copy the file or remove it from the lawyer's office
2. Don't know how the data is structured in the second workbook
3. Am unsure as to how I might be allowed to manipulate the second file

Normally I'd probably just dump both Excel files into a Sql Server database and do some string matching to try to find matches, however I am not sure if I will be allowed to do this. I will most likely be monitored/watched by a legal representative and IT person and I'm not looking to fool anyone or try to pull any shenanigans.

I do have experience writing software that parses and manipulates Excel files so I could possibly create something to write the files into data sets to do comparisons, but again, I'm not sure if this will be allowed.

I know this sounds like kind of a vague request, but unfortunately I was given pretty vague instructions as to how I can proceed with this task. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!


**[UPDATE]**

I wasn't allowed access to their Excel file at all. In the end, I was only able to give them MY Excel file and now they'll probably bill us $350/hr to have an intern manually compare the two. I do appreciate all the suggestions though. If nothing else, at least I learned a few new tricks."

I'll keep it short and sweet I promise... In a nutshell I enjoy working with people and technology, and everything that falls in between. The only problem is I can't decide what major would be best to prepare me for both sides. So far I have internship experience in Sales and in Business Operations and right now I can pick between a B.S. in Economics or Business Administration at Penn State. On top of that I have been starting to learn Computer Science and am very convinced it would be smart to major in as well. The only problem here is time, I don't want to be in undergrad forever and I have to decide soon.

With that being said if anyone has some experience or advice with these questions below I would greatly appreciate your help, thanks for taking the time to read my post!

Q1. Econ or Bus. Admin?

Q2. Should I go after a second degree? If so, Computer Science or something else? (Engineering maybe?)

Q3. What should I study in grad school? (Having the Bus. Admin undergrad already might not teach me much if I were to get an MBA) Is a Computer Science undergrad and then Masters in Engineering (Mechanical ideally) possible?

Q4. Any jobs that would allow me to travel and see the world?"

2zwk6b,59,2015-03-22,"Without Adderall, I can't do anything but lie in bed and watch TV. Help?",Certamente24,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/2zwk6b/without_adderall_i_cant_do_anything_but_lie_in/,"I've always had a history of tardiness, lack of interest in schoolwork, and waiting until (and sometimes still missing) deadlines. But until recently, I had never really thought of myself as ADD.

I first decided to see a medical professional about it shortly after graduating from college and my tardiness cost me my summer internship. So since Aug 2014, I've been on Adderall. I'm prescribed 20mgXR (once in the morning) and 10mgIR (once in the morning and once in the afternoon timed to coincide with XR's second half). I'm supposed to take that every day, 30 times a month.

But even in the beginning, I was worried about dependence and tolerance. So I take off-days when I can. For the first few months, I probably had more off-days than on. But as the semester of my next phase of schooling (professional school--think law or medicine) progressed, I would take it on the very day an assignment is due and crank out the assignment in 5 hours or so. Then came final exams and I took it yet more frequently about 12 hours before each exam. So I'd study, take the exam, and crash and sleep right afterward only to repeat this 12-cycle for the next exam.

My final exam grades were underwhelming. They were my first taste of academic failure in a while, and it's not like college was a walk in the park (this isn't a source of pride but just to give you a rough idea, I went to an Ivy League school for college and graduated near the top of my class).
After finals ended, I took a break from Adderall for a month. That month was my most unproductive ever. I would just lie in bed and watch TV, read easy-to-read nonsense online, play video games, and do other cognitively easy tasks.

I'm always supposed to be busy (networking, applying to summer jobs, studying some things I had assigned to myself). But I can never get started on any of those things unless a hard deadline is approaching. Recently I was evaluated by another psych who administered an ADD battery of tests, including a fool-proof computer game. The psych concluded that my ADD is in the 96-99 percentile of adults, where 93% is the threshold for a diagnosis.

I also see a psychologist (i.e., someone other than my -psychiatrist- who prescribes me medications) twice a week but there's so much to cover that, after a dozen sessions, we haven't practiced actual strategies. Rather, we just talk about my life and things on my mind (a lot) that week.

This psych really made it a point that ADD--my condition--is ""neurological."" That is, there's something wrong with how my brain works, and I can't overcome it by just ""working harder"" or ""putting more effort in."" At first I thought ""what's the big deal? OK I believe you it's 'neurological,' can we move onto solutions now?"" But as it sank in, I was for the first time unsettled by my ADD diagnosis, because to say that it has to do with how my brain is configured is to say that it's fate, that it'll be like this for the rest of my life.

This semester is going down the same road as last semester. Only worse, because at least last semester I can leisurely read and do schoolwork without Adderall. This semester, on the days I'm not on Adderall, I can't bring myself to do schoolwork or pretty much anything.

My days off Adderall is much like the month right after finals--all I do is lie in bed, let my room get messy, play video games, browse nonsense internet, and watch TV.

A year ago, when I was about to graduate college and move on to professional college, when I hadn't gotten on any medication yet, I felt very content with myself.

Nowadays, I'm very disappointed in myself. I don't know how I can look in the eyes of people who've supported me but who I've lost touch with. If only they could see me now--a year after accomplishing quite a bit on just coffee or the occasional Red Bull, now I need Adderall just to get out of bed and take out my trash.

I've spoken to friends who also say that they're diagnosed with ADD, and when I describe my typical day of lying in bed just watching TV and browsing the internet, they say ""lol, are you me?"" But they've also said that they went on Adderall as children and have gradually relied on Adderall less as they've grown. I can't imagine how any of them can be as lazy and unmotivated as I am.

The irony is that on my off-days, I can't do anything but lie in bed. But on my on-days, even though I can get stuff done, the Adderall makes me too anxious to hang out around other people. Sometimes I need to take the Klonopin I'm prescribed just to make a public appearance in class because I worry that my gum-chewing and other behaviors make it totally obvious I'm on Adderall and all kinds of other judgments unrelated to Adderall. Since I've more frequently avoided classmates, peers, and friends because of either wanting to lie in bed or being too anxious, I've become something of a recluse and lost touch with a lot of the friends I made earlier this academic year, when things weren't as bad.

That social isolation and my academic disappointment has resulted in an additional diagnosis of depression. I had always thought of myself as socially anxious (hence the Klonopin) but never depressed. Now I guess I am and have a daily dose of 40mg of Prozac to remind me.

This is all a really long way of asking ""how can I stop being a lazy bum nailed to my bed when off Adderall?"" It's one thing to take Adderall to concentrate on schoolwork and studying for exams, but it's ridiculous that without Adderall, all I do is lie in bed and waste time."

&amp;nbsp;

I was looking at a possible career change and was wondering what you think about this, especially you with defense industry XP. **TL;DR @ END**

&amp;nbsp;

**Info about me**: 

* Ohioan, BSEE recent grad of 14' here, No debt, interested in Space / Defense Systems Simulators, Testing Hardware, Drones or Systems work long-term (Think hush hush NASA, SpaceX, Lockmart, Booz, 3 letter agency, Boeing, or other places that do cunning edge things that help the good guys) 
 
* Previous experience: Solid State Lighting, Cyber security, Lab Background work with GPS, Accelerometers and Gyroscopes, made an autonomous robot to navigate a maze. Active ""L"" Clearance for nuke work 

* Never got into any trouble or done anything stupid / regrettable in my life. (for clearance purposes) -- Really wanted to join the military after HS to serve, but instead went to college to become an EE (enjoyed it too!). My family has a lot of Vets in it, we take pride in those who serve. Very ""Murka!"" mentality.

&amp;nbsp;

I am currently a new **Nuclear Engineer** tasked with learning turbine systems and eventually seeing a new Digital control system upgrade. The work here is very regulated and everything is by-the-book. As an engineer, I am not allowed to touch any of the systems physically, so I have to have the maintenance department do all the hands-on work due to union agreements, this kind of bothers me as it is my system and I would like to help too. The work is like a sine wave, some days its a hectic mess, other days it is smooth sailing. 

&amp;nbsp;

**About the current job**

&amp;nbsp;

**Older engineers have recently warned me** that the company uses and abuses engineers at our plant. The engineers even tried to unionize a few years back because of this. *(calling them in during days off, not paying them during forced outages, making you give 5 hours over-time for free, and not paying you overtime rates 1.5x ~ 2x your rates that maintenance and electrical techs (unionized) get paid when coming in for overtime)* Basically, because they are unionized I can easily state that Electrical Techs make more than engineers, have better hours, and are treated better here than the engineers that are incharge of them (and they let you know when they are pulling $90/hour days and your not) Odd to have an older engineer say that he lost a ton of family time and personal time without getting paid in order to keep his job.. I like the job, my co-workers are funny, its cool to put on my hard hat and go out in the field and actually see things working, and the cost of living in the area is pretty decent. I just wish I wasn't working with ancient legacy systems *(cunning edge 70s tech)*, a company that doesn't want to properly fund repairs or fix things the way the engineers suggest, they would rather do cheap and easy, or bury under papers and forget.

&amp;nbsp;

**Nuke Engineer**

&amp;nbsp;

**Pluses**: 

* Steady Work

* 60k Sal

* New DCS system sometime in the future

* Power Company = Job Stability / Security?

* Co-workers are funny and enjoyable

* Boss is from the interwebs, older but gets funny references

* Closeish to city I grew up in / went to college in.

* Cheap cost of living in the area

* Around a rural, lake area, I love paintball, hiking and want to do SCUBA

* Nuclear jokes and stories to tell friends

* Every day is different, from water gushing out of a boiler to filling out paper work to OMG!!! FREE LUNCH TODAY!!!!! :D

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons**: 

* Very Regulated by the book work.

* Older engineers warning me about the company.

* Cant touch my systems! :(

* Have to give 5 free hours of overtime

* Never can get OT unless approved

* Techs make more than engineers (Sometimes $1k Days and have better hours)

* Outages - 6 days a week , 12 hour days for usually 2 months, you give them 5 free hours OT, rest is paid normal rate, not OT like the techs / maintenance / ops / electricians,

* Ancient tech, like microfilms, tape reels, DOS, and punch cards.. AND WE KEEP USING THEM =...(

* Toilets are abysmal here - I believe Low flow toilets from the 80s waste more man hours each year than World of Warcraft.

* Friends wont stop talking about Homer Simpson / Radioactive song -_-

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Experiences Trying to get in the Space / Defense Industry**

&amp;nbsp;

The other opportunities I have been pursuing are in the Defense and Space industry. I recently interviewed with Lockmart about 4 weeks ago and was impressed with the things they described. Unfortunately they have not contacted me back, despite my emails. Before working at the nuke plant I talked / interviewed w/ Boeing, but they called and said they took a candidate who had a TS/SCI poly - clearance over me (probably saves them money).

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Other thoughts on it**

&amp;nbsp;

Now, hear me out, I have been shot-gunning some job apps blindly to some of the big firms and recently have been talking to one that starts with ""Booz"". They said they cant hire on a full-timer who doesn't have a active TS SCI clearance / isn't already clearable, so a recruiter is asking if I would be interested in a summer-fall internship so that I can get a TS SCI. It talks about software development, analysis, some programming with problem solving and application. I can program, but I am by no means a CE or CS. I can do Scripting and Batch files pretty easily, but I am sure a CE/S would cry if they saw my technique.. (My code = if,else,if,else...) But I am interested in the work, depending on what it is and also the TS, because I see that as a stepping stone to get in the industry I am interested in going into. But my thing is that it is an internship.. and well, I just don't know. Aside from joining the military, this maybe one of the better ways to get a clearance and some experience.

&amp;nbsp;

**Booz Internship - Engineering Prototype unknown opportunity**

&amp;nbsp;

**Pros**:

* Industry I am interested in!

* Clearance for more opportunities in that industry!

* Title sounds interesting with ""prototype"" in it? = new tech?

* Maybe better hours?

* Better bathrooms?

* Working with the industry that helps defend our country! 

* Develop cool things you wont see publically in years maybe?

* I think its nice for them to offer me this / think about me to get cleared!

* Better pay in the future?

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons**:

* Its an internship, after college

* Unknown - But probably going to have to move to an urban area that I cant paintball in or SCUBA in.

* Unknown - Probably less pay at first, until cleared to a real position - Intern

* Unknown - Coding? - Not the best at it, but I can do it! :)

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR**: Work at a nuke plant now, its steady work, we are upgrading to a new system some year or another.. But I like the idea of working as an engineer in the Space / Defense industry. - I was Previously rejected for other candidates with active clearances in the Space / Def Industry - In my head its a way of serving and also working with the technology I am interested in. I am in the initial stages of getting offered an internship to get cleared, but I question risking and giving up what I have now to become an intern. Follow a dream of eventually working with Defense / Space? Or is the dream already right in front of me / is a lie / there is no spoon?

&amp;nbsp;

**Long Term goals**:

&amp;nbsp;

Long term I want to first be an engineer who either works with new hush hush tech or Simulators for Defense / Space applications (think plane / helo / war game sims) and/or stuff you'll see in years after it declassifies (think lithium battery), and help bring about new ideas to the table! :) Later I would like to be in charge of a group of new engineers and help them do their tasks / lead some people

&amp;nbsp;

**EDITED: FORMATTING**

2zx6qt,2,2015-03-22,"I feel my custody agreement needs to change, but I don’t know what to do. (Orange County, CA)",throwaway454540,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2zx6qt/i_feel_my_custody_agreement_needs_to_change_but_i/,"Backstory: My son’s mother and I split when he was 3, he is now 5 and in school. We lived close to each other in Orange County, California and we had an order put in place where I had him roughly 30%. After a few months, we stopped following the order due to constant college schedules changing and we both didn’t want to go back and forth to court to change it. It worked out for me since the time spend with him got a lot closer to 50%. However, I wound up paying her the same amount ($46) which I didn’t mind. 

Fast forward a year and some change, I graduate from college and landed an internship on the east coast over the Summer of 2014. This was a huge opportunity for me career wise, so I went. Unfortunately, I had to leave my son behind with his mother for the time being. Upon completion of the internship, I was not offered a job which was a devastating blow. Luckily, I was originally from the East Coast so I was able to move back in with my parents to help until I got on my feet. 

During my internship I paid my son’s mother her support ($46) plus an additional $250 to compensate for me not being around and I paid half of his day care ($300). However, after my internship was over I was out of money and in desperate needs financially. I could not afford to pay her the additional $250. I used family loans to pay the support ordered by the court and half of the day care costs, but not the additional $250 we agreed upon. 

A few months of this go by, then she goes to the courts in January 2015 and wants more money (rightfully so, since I wasn't there to care for him). At this point, I find a job in Southern California, but it is 90 miles from my son. I started in February, but before I started I go to court for a temporary child support order. Considering his school schedule, my distance from him and the “status quo” of me not around for the past few months, they had to set the algorithm for child support at every other weekend (I think it wound up being 18%). My son’s mother is also not allowing me every weekend since then she wouldn’t have any weekends with him at all. At this point I’m not technically, hired yet so I had no income and they said “they had to set me at minimum wage.” So after the algorithm was set, I had to pay $230, half the day care cost and only see him every other weekend without an income at all. 

Now, March 2015, I’ve worked enough to establish myself and I want to spend more time with my son. However, my son’s mother isn’t going to let me have him more than every other weekend. Also, the distance/traffic and his school/my work makes it impossible to see him during the week. I was considering asking the courts for Summers. So my questions are:

Is it reasonable to ask the courts for 8 or 10 weeks of my son’s 12 week Summer?

I’m also afraid of my child support evaluation next month which will take into account that I actually have a job now. However, during the most recent temporary child support hearing they would not hear anything about visitation changes. Which doesn’t make sense since if I spend more time with him, the amount I have to pay will be different. How do I go about making changes if I can't make it to court during the times available due to my new job?

I know the amount factors in how much she makes, but how can I factor how much I will be paying? Will I still have to pay half of his day care ON TOP OF more child support? I fear I will be paying through the nose if I was paying $230 without a job at all. Should I even be paying for half his daycare? They did not put that into consideration for the temporary child support order even though it is a significant amount of money.

This post may just get a bunch of “get a lawyer comments”, but last time I got a lawyer it cost me over $4,000. After being unemployed for 6 months and traveling to and from the west coast for interviews trying to be closer to my son, I’m already in thousands of dollars of debt. 

Any suggestions on how to fix this mess is much appreciated. 

TLDR - I want to adjust my child custody agreement, but I work everyday and I’m 2 hours from the court I originally got my order done. What can I do? And is my recommended change for summer time with my son even possible? Is there anything I can do to make this situation suck any less?!

I am trying to land a summer internship and I worry both that it may be too late and that I'm not qualified enough. I have a 3.2 GPA and have generally done alright in my classes but have constantly felt inferior to my classmates who seem much more dedicated and knowledgeable and have jobs in the field already. I switched majors my freshman year while going through community college to CS with a minor in Mathematics. I took an intro to programming class and I loved it. However, I had to reduce my full time courseload my junior year due to a bout of severe depression and the last few years have been marked with self-doubt as I started hitting the heavier CS courses (enjoyed the math, surprisingly). It's only this year that my school has taught actual hands-on software engineering from scratch. I enjoy coding in Java and it's very satisfying when I complete assignments after being stuck on a problem for so long, but I haven't done much of it in my spare time and I'm worried it will be a big red flag. As I lurk this sub the common refrain I hear is ""work on some personal projects"", although the only projects I have are a group database design project using PostgreSQL and a web application with Flask (I knew next to nothing about Python and web development, but my contributions involved writing python scripts to import the instructor-given JSON data into the database), and a group Android development project I am currently working in this semester.

I am a 4th year computer engineering major at UC Irvine with a 2.75 GPA, steadily decreasing, used to have 3.4. The Upsides are that I have had 2 programming related internships and have 2 good references. I have been to a career fair recently but I felt it was very low probability, several companies had gpa cuttoffs or were top companies probably too competitive until I get actual job experience or just wanted to give me a link to their careers website. Only one company there seemed like it mattered and I had a chance but i messed up a technical question for that one. My online internship searches of past years through online lists and companies in areas I was interested in were also entirely useless as i got both internships through connections. 

A couple things I want to know are:

 How much do internships and references matter compared to gpa?

 Where do I search for companies to apply too considering my situation ? I have seen lists  such as [this](https://info.wealthfront.com/rs/wealthfront/images/107careerlaunchingcompanies_final.pdf), are these good places to look? are career fairs? or do I have to rely on networking ?

2zya80,9,2015-03-22,Are all engineering jobs like this?,themister32,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2zya80/are_all_engineering_jobs_like_this/,"Hello everybody!

I am in the middle of an internship right now and am seriously doubting whether or not being an engineer is right for me. To begin, I'm a mechanical engineer major. When I got this internship, I knew that I didn't particularly care about the product that we are making at our plant, but I figured that there would be a lot to learn in the process. 

While I have learned a lot, I have found myself disenchanted with the process of engineering. With it being a manufacturing plant, it is required that any change on the floor is documented. (which makes sense)

Unfortunately, the effect is that I dont feel like I am actually doing anything.  There are many times when a simple, common sense change should be made on the floor, but you can't do it without a grundle of paperwork and oversight from several engineers. The process ins't helped when the overseeing engineers think the intern is completely incompetent. (which I don't blame them for, it is an inevitability of being inexperienced) Many times the problem isn't the paperwork, but the fact that the companies internal software allows zero flexibility, which leads to IT problems. 

Mix that with the fact that my office works with really low efficiency, and I dont feel like I am being as productive as I could be. (Many days my coworkers spend more time making small talk than talking about company projects or doing real work.) I definitely don't feel like I am adding value to the company at a rate proportional to my pay. There are days when I have plenty to do. There are also days when I have to go asking around for work to keep busy. Some of the time, there isn't, which puts me in a tricky spot since I have a minimum hour quota. If this is a level of inefficieny happening in the private sector,I can only imagine the horror of doing government work (or at least from what I have heard).

I don't hate my job. It is far superior than the minimum wage retail jobs I have worked in the past. I'm just not sure that this is right for me. It seems many times like the company is paying you to be responsible for any fuck ups, as opposed to actually doing any engineering. 

Are all engineering jobs like this? What have your experiences been like? 

TLDR: Engineering internship not what I expected. I'm learning a lot, but not sure if this is right for me. I feel much more productive in school, and am thinking that maybe acedemia may be my thing? "

1. Will companies even give me an internship if I have only been at Davis 1 year? Plenty friends I know there have gotten internships at great companies but they were not transfers.

2. Should I delay my graduation so I can have 2 summers for internships?

2zycgd,1,2015-03-22,Does having work experience matter for a CS internship?,Captain_Forge,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2zycgd/does_having_work_experience_matter_for_a_cs/,"So I'm a freshman majoring in CS at a respectable institution, and it doesn't look like I'm going to be able to get an internship this summer. I also have no prior work experience. So, right now I'm wavering between two options:

(1) Take summer classes at my university to get ahead, allowing me to take more CS classes later on (or graduate early)
(2) Get a summer job in some unrelated field, purely for the work experience.

Is work experience necessary (or beneficial in any way) when I am being considered for a computer science internship or job? Or is my summer better spent taking classes? Either way, I will of course continue working on my side projects."

My first IT position started out as an internship at a very small MSP that focused on small businesses. It all started when I got an internship at this small MSP during college they hired me shortly afterwards and just worked around my college schedule as most of my classes were at night anyway. Initially when I started there was only one other tech. I guess there were many more at one point but they left to go start their own company.

Anyway I worked at this small MSP for about 6 years. For the first two years I worked along side the one other tech mentioned earlier before he left for a better job. At this point I was left as the lead tech managing a bunch of small business networks. The work consisted of everything from AD, Exchange, Cisco VPNs, to new PC installs and virus removal. It was a jack of all trades position basically. The owner of the business really didn't have an IT background and there wasn't much structure in place. Needless to say I was very busy and stressed but I learned a lot during this time.

Now I do IT for a local High School. I get paid about the same amount in terms of my annual salary but I have way more time off and not nearly as overworked. I work with two other members of the IT department. It is a pretty laid back job that gives me a lot of freedom. With all the free time I still try to look for something proactive to work on most of the time. The other two members of my team don't share this attitude.

I have been there two years and I feel like I am running out of projects. I made a lot of improvements/upgrades to the network including AD, Firewalls, CMS, Web Filter, improved documentation accuracy, Setup MS DPM instead of random backups that they used to use, Setup a VPN server instead of how they were just using straight RDP, automated different tasks for other departments as well as many other improvements (excel macros, VBA, etc..). You get the picture. Anyway, all of these projects were primarily done by me. I feel like I am always being self taught and have never had a mentor. 

Right now I am torn between if I should leave to look for a job that can challenge me more or just stick where I am at and use the freedom I have to learn on my own. I do really like my job right now but I'm afraid that I am not growing."

Should I quit?,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/2zyij1/shaping_up_to_be_rejected_a_lot_beginning_to/,"I went in with very high hopes for this application season. I had a 161V : 169Q : 4.0W on the GRE. I had a 3.85 for both major and cumulative GPA (with A LOT of graduate classes taken). I had multiple teaching assistantships (in one of them I actually was chosen to be the head TA in charge of three masters students) and multiple internships at large companies. I had 1.5 years of research experience (which near resulted in 2 papers but didn't for unrelated reasons). I had 3 letters from professors, with (at least, I hope) 2 strong letters asserting research capability and 1 asserting teaching capability and ingenuity. I did not have any publications. I applied to a STEM field, with 2 programs ranked in the top 5 and 10 programs ranked in the 11-35 range. I have been rejected from 11 out of the 12 programs. I LOVE the school I've been accepted to. There's no question about it. I wish I believed I was good enough to go. But, what does it say about me if I am rejected from 11 schools. These schools didn't just have a resume, they had everything about me and what 3 other people could say about me. They looked at everything and wrote me off as not good enough. I am analyzing every facet of my application and I see where I could have done better (I had 3 B+'s in classes for my major in my first couple semesters, no publications, etc.). The worst part is, when I tell people about this they are surprised. I am embarrassed and I feel like somehow I let my mentors down. So many people told me to go big, that I had done well enough to go wherever I wanted, and I avoid those people now. If I had a nickel for every time people tried to tell me, ""Oh, it's just random!"" I'd have like 78 cents or something. It isn't random. If it were, I would've thrown in a couple applications to nuclear physics programs despite not having taken a single physics class (because WHY THE FUCK NOT, RIGHT). How do I convince myself that I can do this, that when 1 person tells me I'm good enough and 11 people tell me I'm not, that I am, in fact, good enough?

2zz0af,19,2015-03-22,Burning out of Computer Science,[deleted],AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/2zz0af/burning_out_of_computer_science/,"I am currently a Junior and a student studying Computer Science at a reasonably reputable US university (top 25 ish).

I had a kind of unconventional switch into computer science. I switched from a liberal arts major freshman year. I felt like it enabled me to bullshit and get away with it, and I saw that there were a lot of kids truly passionate about the major, not just taking advantage of, say, the ability to skip all the reading which made me feel like I was in the wrong place. 

I took AP CS in highschool and decided to take another intro class in college and loved it. I went on to excel in Data Structures, having one of the highest grades in the course and coming back as a undergraduate teaching assistant. It was, for me, the first time I really had to put in 15+ hours into a single assignment but I felt such a rush when I accomplished something or was at the top of the class.

After a rough semester spring of my sophomore year (where I put too much on my plate academically, extracurricularly, and socially) my grades took a dive and I dropped class. I felt like I experienced burn out. That summer, I had an internship at a fortune 500 company with a technical product (but not particularly prestigious) and I felt useless the whole summer. I was given a huge project feature that they told me to just research, and make a prototype if I could. I don't blame the company or my team for the experience, but they were simply too strapped to provide much mentorship and I never had any guidance minus an hour or so of peer programming where they really taught me how to debug using a robust IDE and to get through a huge codebose (which was very useful, but the tip of a big iceberg). My feature was far away from anything anyone else was doing (which makes sense, because I was the intern) but I never got a feel for the platform nor was asked to fix a single bug. I had a killer commute and really didn't manage to have much of a life that summer, so much of my time outside of work was spent being upset at my performance in work.

Into my junior year, I'm grappling with a lot of imposter anxiety - or maybe it's all valid, who knows. I am onto the super tough low level classes that everyone struggles with but I lack the grit to put in the 15, or 20, or 40 hours required for each assignment. I'm getting each assignment done by the skin of my teeth and I dread the neverending list of programming-intensive assignments I have. My GPA is still ok (around 3.65. All of my low grades were in pure math/science, but I did well in CS/programming courses) and I have an internship at a ""Big 4"" company this summer.

Few of my friends are computer science majors. I am part of several extremely time consuming activities that are not related to my major in the slightest. I watch a lot of Netflix. I don't think this makes me special or unique, but I don't program in my spare time at all. I also in general have very little spare time, but don't we all.

I think what I need above all is a break. I'm on scholarship (which expires after 8 consecutive semesters) and so close to graduating that taking a semester off seems silly. I have committed to the Big4 for the summer and it would be foolish to back out of that to play video games all summer in attempts to ""refresh"". I think about taking time off after college like a year for travelling but I think this will only fuel my anxiety about not being equipped with the skills to succeed in a software engineering career (because I would want it to be a break where I WASN'T working on personal projects or trying to ""stay sharp"").

I don't know what to do. I don't think programming is right for me - I found it a fun intellectual challenge when it was one hard class instead of all hard, and I crave validation (excelling in a ""hard"" major like computer science) but I think I lack the passion and maybe even the work ethic to do it for 40+ hours a week. Computer Science is the subject I am *most* passionate about compared to the other college majors available - but I am still not very passionate about it. Work is work, play is play, and my hobbies/social life are not transferable into things that pay the bills. I think my classes and major are just really taking a toll on my morale (and mental health?). Right now, I HATE programming - but I know I liked it before and I don't want to do anything else but sleep and play video games at this point because I'm so mentally done.

I guess my question is -
a) given all this information, does it seem like I'm cut out for it?
b) if so, are there types of programming jobs where I wouldn't feel like I'm swimming upstream constantly (the example that jumps to mind is webdev, which requires CONSTANT relearning of the latest trending tools) and will I ever feel a sense of competency or is that in direct conflict with the idea that many programmers love the ""constant challenge""?
c) if not, what can I look into to do instead? I think about Project Management a lot - I am a great facilitator and am very good at dealing with interpersonal stress (just not academic...). Are there other jobs where a computer science degree would be useful, but would not put me in the position of programming 40 hours a week?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[With the average weight of Americans increasing year after year, do you find yourself having to administer more anesthesia drugs to these patients to knock them out?  If so, does this increase the overall risk to their surgery?  Also, I once dislocated my elbow.  To put my elbow back into place, they told me that they had to sedate me.  I've never used any recreational narcotics in my life so I thought it would be an interesting experience.  At first they gave me morphine.  It really didn't do anything to me so they gave me a bunch more.  The increased dosage didn't do anything to me either, so they decided to switch drugs.  Once they gave me the new drug I was out in about ten seconds.  What do you think happened that made it so that the morphine didn't work the way that they intended it to work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpndry2?context=5)|Ok, so a few answers:  Obesity in anesthesia, hell in medicine in general, is dangerous.  Most of the drugs given are based upon ideal body weight, so the dosage isn't necessarily the problem.  The anesthetic gases can sit in the fat compartment of the body, potentially keeping the obese person asleep/sedated for a longer period of time, but that can be compensated for as well.  The danger lies mostly in the airway.  Everything is bigger, not just the waistline, so not only is it a lot harder to breathe for patients, when they stop breathing, or if I can't breathe for them, they lose oxygen saturation MUCH quicker.  I remember a few years back a really big lady came in for surgery, the anesthesiologist and CRNA couldn't intubate after administration of anesthesia.  Then couldn't mask ventilate (basically meaning the patient was asleep, but we couldn't breath for them, no breathing = no life).  I come in, basically lift her head off the bed, we could administer a few breaths, then blood starts pouring out of their mouth.  The CRNA, through no fault of her own, had inadvertently torn part of the airway trying to intubate, and now we had a bleeder on top of can't ventilate.  To the previous question on stress, yeah that stressed me out a bit.  Blood pouring out of a mouth we need to administer oxygen isn't fun.  I get an extra set of hands, we shove her onto her side so that the fat is off her chest, stick in an LMA, and suddenly/luckily we can breathe for her.  On her side she goes straight to the ICU, get a fiberoptic, and after multiple tries we secure and intubate her, kept intubated and sedated overnight.  Thank god she came to with no neurologic injury, because that O2 Sat came down and stayed down below 40% for a good 10-15 minutes.  Which felt like 10 hours.  She is still losing weight to try to get her abdominal surgery (can't remember what it was exactly).  Part 2:  Not sure exactly what was given in your situation, or who gave the medications, and at what exact dosages.  But if you said morphine, it typically doesn't cause much sedation, but more pain relief.  you most definitely would be wide awake if only morphine was given, unless in a massive dose that would put you dangerously out (could be done, but you'd have to administer a LOT of morphine).  Additional possibility:  People of italian descent can metabolize morphine at a faster than normal rate, and can require more.  Opposite end of the spectrum are people of asian descent who can have a morphine metabolite which continues to act on the Mu receptor, giving additional analgesia.  
[I'm curious about that metabolism related to ethnicity that you mentioned at the end of this comment. Do you know what it is due to? I mean, genetics, obviously, but is there a theory or explanation on why it is so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpnnkrr?context=5)|Unknown to me why certain ethnic groups have this.  
[What's the craziest thing you've seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpn5w0r?context=5)|One of the bloodiest:  got called to a code in the afternoon on a weekend, an older lady with end stage lung carcinoma, started coughing blood uncontrollably.  When I got in there, it looked like a scene out of a horror movie, literally blood on the walls and all over the bed.  She had been coughing up blood the entire time, and I think no one had noticed as it must have been in between nursing checks.  By the time someone came in she was already unconscious.
 |Most ridiculous (there are a lot):  A lady who needed an ""object"" removed from her rectum, which was stuck in there pretty deep, causing complete obstruction, and I explained that she needed to be knocked out completely for surgery, she promptly left the hospital.  We all knew she needed an open laparotomy, its not coming out, but she left anyway.  I would have liked to know what happened to her.  -Weird but true:  A guy with a gunshot wound to the head.  I was in training at the time, and remember reading a lot on how you aren't necessarily unconscious when you get that, but never saw it first hand.  This guy had a bullet in his frontal cortex, and somehow was able to sign consent for surgery from the surgeon who basically told him to sign it and he'd take the bullet out.  I got the anesthesia consent from a family member as well as him, because honestly I didn't think he'd remember signing my consent form. 
[Who the fuck consents a patient with a bullet in their frontal cortex? That's so beyond meaningless. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpnphqn?context=5)|I agree.  Which is why it was a formality to consent him, and the actual consent I got from a family member.
[From the first one: Did she end up being okay? That sounds terrifying!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpnls8g?context=5)|Not a good outcome unfortunately.  I think ACLS/BLS is only really successful something like 15% of the time.  Most of the hospital TV shows aren't very truthful.  
[Pain control: Morphine vs. Fentanyl? Which do you prefer? When and why? Are there any instances when one is particularly better or worse than the other?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpn9nyp?context=5)|Fentanyl.  My preference stems from the idea that fentanyl is in and out of your system quicker.  Faster onset, and shorter duration.  This is handy in your situation being a paramedic, where you don't have a lot of drugs hanging out in the system for a long time. true, narcan could be used, but its hard to take away a drug once it has been given. 
[Benzodiazepines: We carry Midazolam, Lorazepam, and Diazepam for seizures and sedation. Any preferences for either? Which tend to work or not work in certain scenarios?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpn9nyp?context=5)|Midazolam for amnesia/anxiolysis, the other 2 for siezures.  Midazolam tends to be quicker onset as well, and shorter duration of action.  Loraz/Diaz are good for seizure breaking and keeping them out of seizures for a bit longer than midazolam would.  
[Ketamine: There's been a lot of talk around here about trying to get Ketamine into protocol for sedation, pain management, and induction for RSI. I've heard and read great things about it. What are your thoughts on Ketamine, particularly pre-hospitally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpn9nyp?context=5)|If you've got all the other drugs available, you could skip ketamine if you're looking at things to trim down.  However, if you were on an island and could only keep one drug, ketamine would be it.  The problem with it is that its a sister drug to angel dust, and people can totally freak out while on it.  If thats something you're willing to handle on the back of an ambulance truck, ok.  
[Any other drugs you think should be added to our formulary for any of the above indications? We carry Nitronox as well, but I rarely use it and prefer to take the more liberal side when administering narcotics.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpn9nyp?context=5)|I think in terms of intubating and you wanted to be slim and trim, etomidate and sux are the way to go.  Offhand I can't think of anything to add.  
[Thanks, that was really informative!  *The problem with it is that its a sister drug to angel dust, and people can totally freak out while on it. If thats something you're willing to handle on the back of an ambulance truck, ok.*  I've often heard that it's good to mix Ketamine with a bit of Midazolam for it's amnensic effects to help prevent any sort of long-term dissociation-induced psychosis.  The reason Ketamine is being up is for trauma patients who often can't handle the hemodynamic effects of benzos and Etomidate, with Ketamine being much more hemodynamically stable. Some also suggested that the dissociation can produce a more effective analgesia.  Thoughts on both? Thanks again!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpnb351?context=5)|Well it might mitigate some of the effects, but i've seen people break through it and still freak out in the recovery room.  And I'd say that etomidate is the more HD stable of the 2 drugs by far.  Ketamine can cause intracranial pressure issues, and in smokers can increase secreations making it difficult to intubate or ventilate through an LMA if you used one.  Additionally, once you've depleted catacholamine stores, Ketamine becomes a depressant.  So a young guy it'll work, but an old guy in a trauma, and you risk some degree of cardiac depression on induction.  Again, falling back, if you could only choose 1 drug, ketamine would be great, its cheap, gives you analgesia as well as amnesia.  
[Opinion/rant on the healthcare industry as a whole in the us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/2zxe30/iama_anesthesiologist_and_ive_seen_some_s_ama/cpn98g8?context=5)|Not really a rant, but my opinion is as follows:  I completely believe that everyone should have fair access to healthcare, whether it be universal or otherwise.  There are people in this country (USA) who legitimately cannot afford it, and need it.  How the hell is a hospital supposed to on the one hand act like they're doing the public a service, but on the other hand hand each person a bill which is the equivalent to the cost of a Ferrari?  On the flip side, the HUGE factor against Universal healthcare from a physician's point of view: it pays WAY less.  To the point that if I do xyz procedure, the cost of doing the procedure (equipment, etc) is more than what I'll get reimbursed for it.  Operating at a loss is not financially feasible in the long run.  I'm not smart enough to know what the right answer is, but I know what I believe in, everyone deserves an equal fair shot at getting healthcare.

Apply to medical school, get in.  4 years med school.  Apply to anesthesia, get in (last I checked, some insane number of applicants per anesthesia residency spot amongst the top 4-5 hardest specialties to get into).  4 years of anesthesia residency including your intern year.

2zzqqf,92,2015-03-23,TIFU by not telling someone I loved them twenty years ago...,Sharknose1,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2zzqqf/tifu_by_not_telling_someone_i_loved_them_twenty/,"This happened yesterday although it was something that happened that made me realise I fucked up twenty years ago.

Yesterday I saw my female best friend who I’ve known since 1995. We first met when we worked together as interns and I instantly fell in love with her. Sadly for me, she didn’t feel the same way and I accepted that and put my feelings aside. We did become best friends however and spent pretty much all of our time hanging out together.  In truth, until I was married I was always in love with her but never came out and said it because we had developed such an amazing friendship and I didn’t want to ruin that. Girlfriends and boyfriends came and went for both of us but we were always constant friends and have been for twenty years now. 

Eventually I found an amazing girl and we got married and have been for ten years now. It’s not exactly the marriage I’d envisioned but we’re pretty happy and have two wonderful sons. But I freely admit there have been many times where I wondered what life would have been like had things been different with my best friend been different and it was her I married. While she’s had relationships here and there, she’s never settled. I often tease her about being a ‘perpetual spinster’ and she has happily admitted that’s what she fully intends to be. Knowing how much she valued her independence, I never regretted my decision.

Yesterday we got together (which in the last two years we can only do two or three times a year now as she’s moved quite a distance) and I went through my usual teasing her and asking when was she was finally going to find a man, get married and have some kids. But this time instead of professing how much she loved her freedom as she usually did, she just looked at me and started welling up. I went over to her and gave her a hug and asked what was wrong and that’s when it all came out.

She admitted that all those years ago while she didn’t originally have feelings for me because she felt I was too young (she’s five years older), she did after we’d been friends for about a year. She also said that she was still very much in love with me and has been for all this time but didn’t want to ruin our wonderful friendship. Through tears she kept apologising and said that she couldn’t go on with the charade any longer and that she’s been in pain for all these years and the reason she never had any long term relationships was because no one had ever come as remotely close to understanding her like I did.

I was pretty much in shock and still am. I’m a bit of an emotional wreck at the moment and all I can think of right now is how incredibly massively crazily stupid I was to not just come out and tell her all those years ago. I’m almost looking at the life I’ve had as an alternate reality that shouldn’t have happened. I also feel so much guilt that she’s never had a long term relationship or got married because of me. Stupid dumb fuck me. And what do I do now? There’s no way I can console her. And while its completely wrong of me to wish my present life away, in truth I think if I could build a time machine I would go right back in time right now and make sure I ended up with her. I need to call her later to make sure she’s ok. But what the hell do I say?

EDIT: Well thanks for all the advice everyone. I was never going to just up and leave my wife and kids in a million years but my head was spinning for a while at the thought that something I did or didn't do twenty years ago which decided the path of my life, for better or worse, came back to haunt me. I've not spoken to her yet as many advised but I've also not told my wife which many of you advised against. In both cases I'm going on the principal of 'let sleeping dogs lie' (no reflection on either of them!)."

My girlfriend and I get along really well and have been for almost 3 years now. We are both getting ready to graduate college and are looking forward to turning a new page in life, marriage, kids, house, etc, etc. Personally, I began job searching long before my graduation date and found a wonderful decent paying job in the virtual reality industry as a sales representative. My girlfriend however is in the 11th hour and still has nothing lined up (even though i looked for jobs with her she is hell bent on either starting her own boutique or becoming a sales representative for a clothing company, she also refuses to work in a corporation..). I asked what her plans are for this summer if she isn't going to get a job. I was thinking if she did an internship, she could possibly push her loan payments back and buy some more time. Surprisingly She told me that she wants to volunteer at a kids camp for the entire summer... I disagreed with her at first, but eventually stopped caring about it because there is simply nothing I can do to stop her. Its incredibly risky for her because she is going to be receiving a huge loan payment in the next upcoming months and she'll have no money to pay it off. On top of that I don't want to be responsible for all of her debt if I decide to marry her.  I have agreed to help her pay her loans, but only if she has a job.. Regardless, She is not thinking realistically about a career, is not doing anything to get a career, and is not seeing the reality of the situation. What do I do? "

300ysi,8,2015-03-23,She never saw it coming,bereavedd,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/300ysi/she_never_saw_it_coming/,"Exam week, a stressful time indeed. Here I sat, toiling away at the university library, desperately trying to lift my grade point average before the wrath of the finals bears down upon us all. It was awfully quiet tonight, a total of seven people here with me, I prop my head up and shift in my chair every few minutes, making sure my fellow library goers are still with me. Satisfied, I lean back in my chair, and blankly stare at the powerpoint presentation on my screen. Fluid mechanics, my favorite.

A few hours later, my stomach begins to rumble, longing for a taste of anything I have to offer. I check my backpack, alas, nothing to be found, the vending machine it is. Heading out towards the machine, checking my phone on the way out, 22:18PM. Making my way towards the mechanical food contraption, I feel a tingling sensation crawl up my spine. Let me elucidate. The vending machine lies at the end of a dark corridor, picture the same long corridor from “The Shining”, without the twins (thankfully). There I stood, contemplating making the trek towards the machine, The Rolling Stones’ “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” blaring through my earphones. Am I really that hungry? I asked myself.

After pausing the music, I took my earphones out, placed them in my pocket, so as to heighten my hearing sense, and began walking down the corridor. Excessively wary of every sound around me, I trudged onwards. Soon, I arrived at my destination, with no complications whatsoever, I knew I was overreacting, now to select my item to devour. As I stood there, deep in thought, I heard a loud thud, followed by a metallic click. I stood motionless, wide eyed, waiting for an encore, nothing. Dead silence, I swear at that moment, I could hear my own heartbeat.

Typically, any sane person would bolt at that moment. However, I felt the need to investigate, and therein lies the reason I sit here, typing this. The noise had arisen from one of the many rooms that scattered the corridor, but how? I thought they were all locked at this time, surely I can’t attempt to open each one. My analytical thoughts were abruptly interrupted by the sound of a table being dragged across the floor, this, I was sure of. I cautiously approached the room through which the dragging had emanated from. The numbers “204” strewn across the door in a white plaque.

Do I knock? Or forcefully enter like some Hollywood police officer. Perhaps I could just wait for whoevers in there to come out. I opted for the third. I stood by the vending machine, about thirty feet from the room, and I waited, sweat dripping down my forehead, lost in anticipation, I let it slide down my face. Approximately four minutes later, I hear the door creak open, a man walks out of the room and immediately does a quick double take, scanning both sides of the hall. He was wearing a black hoodie, blue jeans, looked like your average college kid, it was way too dark to tell, he was about 5’9”, average build. 

Before I had the chance to blink, he was casually strolling down the hall towards me, in haste, I feigned immense interest in my choice of candy bar, as if this vending machine held the answers to life. The man walked by me, tapped me on the shoulder, and in a calm demeanor, said “Psst, she never saw it coming”, and just like that, he was gone, engulfed by the darkness of the seemingly never-ending passage. I tried to see where he went afterwards, to no avail, he simply vanished, wafted through the halls, blended with the walls.

Curiosity got the best of me, I had to know what he meant, sprinting towards the room, I pushed the door open and switched the lights on. What I saw next, I know I’ll never forget. Encircled in a pool of red, there lay my closest friend Amanda, a sharp dent on her left temple was the only visible marking on her, an obvious exit wound. She was untouched elsewhere. A hammer tinged red at its tip was thrown in the corner. I backed out of the room, fell to my knees, gasping, I called for help. 

The police and other appropriate authorities arrived within fifteen minutes, they asked me all sorts of questions, took a statement, sealed the body in a bag, and left like it was all nothing, routine. I was in shock for a few days, I didn’t speak or see anyone, shutting myself in, sleeping through several days. Weeks of investigation and nothing turned up, it was ruled a homicide, open case, no leads. During the coming weeks, I missed a few exams, almost dropped out altogether in fact. Amanda was one of my closest friends here in college. Andrew, myself, and Amanda, we called ourselves the three musketeers, close as ever, hung out practically all the time. Andrew was out of town, at an internship, and wouldn’t be back till next week. We rarely spoke after that.

Months went by, and time slowly heals all. I came to the conclusion that no amount of alcohol will help, I have to face this, and get back into society, and so that is what I did. I enrolled in summer classes, worked hard, aced all my courses, and learned to move past it. These events took place a few months ago, I write this due to the strange incident that took place on Sunday. At a local coffee shop, I sat, studying, browsing the web. An average looking man walks in, late twenties I’d say, he orders a coffee, nothing odd about that. But wait, the voice was so familiar, I cannot forget it, I knew I had heard it somewhere. “Thanks hun”, he says to the barista as he grabs his coffee to go. As he left the café, I followed in pursuit. He got into the passenger seat of a white Mazda, and it drove off. I went to the police with this information, they kept asking if I was sure of what I saw, and that I might be suffering from PTSD. No help whatsoever. 

I don’t know what to do with this information or how I am going to react, but something needs to be done. They may not believe me, although I am sure of it, that’s the son of a bit** who murdered my friend, and walked off like it was nothing. Who he is, or why he committed that odious act, are questions I repeatedly asked myself the past few months, I could never come up with an answer. Hopefully I’ll have an update in the coming days.

I had three internships at two top companies, but I ended up not being particularly interested in what I did there, nor motivated to go above and beyond. I really love writing software, but I love writing software to solve big problems, not to develop yet another useless mobile app or social network feature that no one really needs. I went to a top CS school, but I pretty much just skated through my time there because it was pretty much all CS theory and no actual software eng. I ended up doing almost no coding in my spare time because I get bored with what I try to start and just give up since there's no real purpose to what I'm trying to do.

SpaceX is pretty much exactly the kind of company I want to work for, doing something I know I will never get bored with (I originally wanted to do aerospace eng before I discovered programming in high school).

Which path should I take? Obviously payment wise, the CC sounds a lot better as I get around 3 to 4K a year back in my ""refund"" which basically means I'm getting paid to get a degree but won't be as upheld as a 4 year degree.

The 4 year degree is also a little/lot more in depth, I'm REQUIRED to take up an internship and minor in a specialization of IT (Supervision/management, business administration, accounting, etc). The Uni also has the IT students run the IT lab in the university to gain more experience. 

The 2 year doesn't require an internship, or specialized classes. You get all your hands on time within the 2 year schedule. You do get to run the IT lab at the CC but again, smaller college = less problems and technology to work with.

I have a lot of responsibility on that side as nothing is automated, and most documentation is messy or missing and i am currently implementing better procedures around this (autoscaling, puppet, continuous deployment and integration system, and development environments).

The company dumped internal IT on me within the past year. Currently we only support about 35 employees, however managing them is becoming increasingly difficult. Everyone is on macs, everyone has local admin, and there's no central management for the macs at all (no munki, jasper, etc). I'm also having to deal with it requests as well, this is very ad hoc and anyone can just come interrupt me any time they want. They recently announced a plan to go up to 55 employees within the next 3 years and there's no additional IT person planned.

Management doesn't seem to realize that I'm having difficulty doing both sysadmin and IT. I've requested help either by hiring another person or an intern but haven't seen any development on that front. I just got written up for not having a weekly meeting setup and ready to go because I was deep in a bad git code merge for a beta release of code were doing.

303fyw,12,2015-03-23,Interviewing Advice,csinterviewhelp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/303fyw/interviewing_advice/,"I'm a graduating senior looking for advice on how to prepare for interviews in a year. I've recently interviewed at a few top companies and did pretty poorly, even after going through two programming interview books and doing dozens of practice problems total. I didn't try to just memorize the solutions but I seriously attempted the questions and solved them on a whiteboard. Currently, I've accepted an offer from a company in south Bay Area and will probably work there after I graduate. I'm grateful that I have this job and it pays quite a bit above average but I'm not really interested in their product and feel like I won't be happy there. I'm very upset that I didn't get a job I want after putting in so much time studying during my 4 years at a tough university (and doing above average) as well as the time I spent recently doing interview prep...so I'm seeking advice on what I should change for next time.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's more information about me so you know where I am in terms of skill level: 
My resume isn't the problem because I've gotten interviews with selective companies, so I just need help with the actual interview part.
I have the basics (data structures, sorting, hash tables, graphs, tree traversals, concurrency, etc.) down pretty well, and my communication skills are fine for the most part (I fumble for a bit sometimes, but not for entire interviews). I've had 2 internships at mid-size companies and done very well in both, and both companies have given me return offers. During my group projects at college (a top 5 university for CS) I've been one of the better coders and receive at least average but usually higher on projects and midterms.    

&amp;nbsp;

I honestly feel like interviews involve a lot of luck as questions seem to vary in difficultly wildly from one interviewer to another. Some questions I've received seemed bad in that you couldn't arrive at the solution logically, or at least not using any method discussed in the books I've read. The outcome depends mostly on if you've seen the question before or if you get lucky and get the key insight needed during the 45 minutes you have, and I don't know if I just lack the problem solving skills needed for these questions or just have bad luck.  But I don't want to make any excuses as other students at my university are getting offers from these companies so obviously I'm doing something wrong. I just want to improve and I'm willing to put in a lot of work...I have about 1 year (I want to stay at current company for at least 1 year) before I try my hand at interviewing at selective companies again and have some questions. I want to guarantee that if I fail interviews next time it won't be because of my technical ability. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here are the actual questions: &amp;nbsp;

* How long before I schedule my first interviews should I start studying? Are there any good timelines anywhere?
* How much time per day/week should I put in studying once I start?
* How should I study? I can review the basics again quickly but should I just do practice problems after that? I've done questions from CtCI, EPI, leetcode, careercup this round of interviews but is there something I'm missing? Any other study tips?
* What's a good indicator that I should stop studying and start interviewing?

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks to anybody who replies. Your help is appreciated."

I asked for details regarding the interview and the kind lady told me the interview will have a few questions on OOD and C++, and more general questions (regarding my resume I suppose).

The qualifications listed for the internship were Java and C++/C#. However, I did *not* include C++ because I just don't know it (I included C and Java for instance). I know C very well and a decent amount of Java, but I've never experienced classes in C++. I have a huge week ahead of me with 3 assignments due by Thursday and I really don't have time to prepare myself for the C++ part.

Five days is a really short notice for me and I don't really know what they are expecting from me given they are *fully* aware I don't know the required programming skill. Yet they offered me an interview and the lady looked thrilled to speak with me on the phone. On one hand I don't want to ask the lady to delay the interview, but on the other hand I can't see myself performing well given such a short notice.

Have you ever been in a similar situation? What is the best way to prepare for this interview?"

I want to work at a Big 4 after graduating, so I'm not too concerned about the return offer. 

**Company A**:

* Located near SF, ~200 employees, owned by IBM

* Based around a good core technical product, customers are IT/devs

* I would be working in R&amp;D directly under lead data scientist, who seemed to have an interest in my projects

* Interviews consisted of talking about my projects, or technical questions (only one relatively simple coding question)

* Lower pay, no housing/relocation

**Company B**

* HQ in Seattle, larger, older company (I can choose to work in SF or Seattle)

* Based around popular web/mobile consumer-facing products

* Can choose department/project after starting (opportunities in web, mobile, back-end, etc.)

* Standard ""Big 4"" style data structures/algorithms coding interviews

* Higher pay, subsidized housing

Based solely on the interviewers and quick tours of the offices, company B seemed to be a better culture fit for me. But really what I'm most concerned about is what will give me more useful skills and look better on my resume for that entry position (or possibly another internship) at a Big 4."

Comms Master J'koab felt a stirring uncertainty as he surveyed the grey octagonal room reptilian eyes searching for any hostiles or exits. Affirming that their were two probable exits in the form of shaded indentations He presumed to be doors, J'koab took command of the situation quickly.

""Avast Lads, Dump the wasted junk inta t' cocoon and light it up, for we dare not let these backwaters gain a'hold o' our tech.""

As J'koab's subordinates piled the ruined scanners and jammers into the drop cocoon, The communication master moved cautiously towards one of the  indents he took for a door.

As He came closer to a presumed door way and static erupted in his embedded earpiece before clarifying into strange yet understandable Thfagen.

""Ahem can you hear me? Ah yes I see you can, good. Then I would like to formally welcome to the first Annual Xeno-Challenge Games! Since you and your entire species seems so intent on kidnapping and ransoming citizens of the United Human Alliance and the Interstellar Neo-Human Collective we here at Nova-Australia Global Entertainment (N-AGE) have decided to return the favour by luring you into a maze trapped up to the wazoo and filled with creatures native to our beautiful home world."" 

J'koab tried to switch comm channels to reconnect to the other squads, but found that the blasted human was broadcasting on every frequency with sufficient strength to drown out any other signal.

"" But Let me assure you we have chosen to give you an incentive for competing in this game... A chance to both serve your empire and gain great personal wealth and glory, for should you win this competition you shall receive not only a ridiculous amount of standard galactic credits, but a brand new luxury star-ship built by Higgs-Starchmen the largest shipyard in the system."" 



""However you are not alone in this endeavor since a group of select other Xenos have elected to ""volunteer"" themselves into the competition alongside not the least of which include some competing Military forces and a dozen lucky civilian contestants.""

""If you would like to withdraw form this contest and return to your Empire in shame and defeat feel free to exit through the door now flashing a red Cross""

The door near J'koab started doing exactly that A bright red cross flashing once every second.

""Should you decide to rise to the challenge for the glory of your empire and not inconsiderable wealth Step through the door marked with a green circle"" 

As the disembodied voice finished saying this a floating green ""O"" began flashing in the remaining  aperture.

With only a brief hesitation J'koab quickly mustered his troops and led them away from the burning cocoon and through the Green door into the unknown and whatever these cowardly backwaters had prepared.

Lucien Vicoson disabled the communication device for the Thfagen troopers as they entered into the maze proper. From then on in prerecorded messages and intern would deal with the brunt of the commentary. he had a stricter duty of editing which shots and scenes went onto the highlight reels, and which were to graphic or viloent to make unrestricted broadcast. Couldn't have the children see dismemberment or sex on their hyperweb viewers now could we? He was just glad he didn't have to manipulate the maze anymore. It was going to be a pain for whoever had to make sure all the passages went to the best rooms and that the right groups of ""contestants"" would meet each at appropriately dramatic times.

I'm currently doing an internship project this semester which is about the design augmentation of a cadaveric knee simulation system.

Our university is in possession of an Oxford rig. Currently, only quadriceps forces are being simulated dynamically (closed loop control system with a fixed force of the ankle on the ground, under a constant hip load and decreasing knee flexion angles, thus simulating a squat). The hamstrings are being actuated by constant load springs.

It is our task to incorporate dynamic hamstring actuation (open loop). We have to estimate a physiologically accurate force profile and implement the controls that are needed.

My question is now this: How do we choose the best actuator for the job? It goes without saying that we have to thoroughly explain why we choose a certain actuator. I've had all the classic engineering courses but no course on actuators. We cannot possible write a review of all available actuators can we?

What is a good starting point? How do you do this? All information is welcome! Be it just advice, or a guide/tutorial, a pdf of a helpful handbook...


Thanks in advance!

A bit of background on myself - I'm a sophomore in the middle of my second internship. In this internship and the previous one, I've done full stack web development.

Front-end, backend with server side javascript, Spring, some database work, and in my spare time I've done some Android programming.

Basically, I've touched a lot of different areas in the programming world. Now, for my next internships I want to get a nice job in the Valley with a good company.

My question is, should I specialize and go really deep in one area, or just try and do everything like I am right now? 

Based on what I've done so far, I've liked web development more than mobile, but web development by itself is such a wide field that I don't know what to try and work on in my spare time to increase my employability.

I am a senior in high school, going off to college in the fall. My parents are divorced. Every summer, I go to visit my Mom and friends across the country. This will be the last summer before I go off to college, so I want to see my friends as much as possible. This summer, I would only be able to go during July and early August before I move into the dorms at my college. My Mom will be busy throughout June and I wouldn't be able to go.  

Here is the issue, I found an internship that is in my career field. Not just in my career field, but **EXACTLY** what I want to do. This internship is a month long, and occurs through the whole month of July. It would cut out a month of my potential time with my Mom and my friends if I get it.  

I would love to go, but it would give me a week and a half at best to see everyone. The chances I would get to see them all are low, and I won't be able to go see them for another year at the earliest, probably not until I get my Bachelors done.

Now I'm wondering if the current situation I'm in is good, or if I need to dodge bullet #2. 

I interviewed with officeteam yesterday for the position of Recruiter/HR Coordinator for a ""tech company"" (that's all they would say, said for confidentiality reasons I couldn't know the name.) They told me the pay is $31,000-$35,000 and its a 90 day temp position that goes to permanent afterwards. I know the pay isn't out of this world but I talked to my parents and I can live with them rent free as long as I want; I just have to pay my bills/food myself. 

So you know about me I have a 3.84 GPA for my Bachelors of Science: Psychology - I have worked two summer human resources internships at a company with 2,000 employees. The first summer I learned all the various aspects of HR and the second I mainly focused on full life cycle recruiting for the company. 

Does this all sound like something I should be excited for or keep looking, and does anyone know anything about officeteam? I did my research on them and their parent company Robert Half - I've seen two extremes. People either love them or hate them. I told them during the interview that I wasn't interested in contract work or temp only positions and they seemed fine with it.

The only thing fishy to me was they talked about the company in vague terms and made me fill out my I-9 and W4 when I walked in, is that normal? 

Thanks!

Now it's tax season, and I'm about to go to H&amp;R Block to file them, but I want to know what I'm in for. In the US about 30% of every pay check went to taxes, and a similar amount for the Canadian company. I'm also a student.

Am I likely to get a tax refund? I'm 22 and still a student at university, and these were internships as part of my program, and I paid quite a lot in taxes every pay check.

I also fell in love with the startup company environment during my in-person interview. Also I am a contracted employee right now so on my offer letter I have the option to leave anytime and the company has the option to drop me anytime as well.

Here are some pros and cons. I guess I'll start with the startup. 
Pros: company culture, great team, appeals to my interests. 
Cons: pays a little bit less, the commute is significantly longer than my commute now. 

And now for the tech giant company. 
Pros: Closer to home, will look great on resume, pays more
Cons: It doesn't appeal to my interests as much, company culture is meh

I've recently been extended an offer from a startup that I've been working at during my final semester of college. I'm a computer science student and have had 3 previous internships + a few projects. I already accepted an offer last fall from a known company in Mountain View, California (not Google) that has great salary and benefits so i'm really torn with this decision. Everyone in this subreddit seems to have a lot of experience with startups, and I was looking to get some advice on my situation.

This startup is currently a part of an accelerator in the city I go to school in, and is doing really well. The business is in the e-commerce space with a subscription based model (think birchbox, dollar shave club, etc.). It just started about a year ago and has seen consistent 20% growth in subscribers each month. The two co-founders have previous experience as early employees at startups and are extremely knowledgeable about what they do (both went to top ivy league schools and are really smart + personable and outgoing). They use best practices as far as I can tell and everything is going smoothly. They've recently closed a seed round around 600k and already have over a million going towards series A which is on track to happen this year. I've already learned a lot from the CTO and would look at him sort of as a close mentor already. I would be employee #2 other than the co-founders and would be the 1st developer other than the CTO. They've offered me 75k salary along with 1.75% equity.

Basically I'm just not totally sure how to evaluate the offer since I'm not super familiar with the startup space. I'm also worried about taking a job at a startup as my first job right out of college. Another thing i'm worried about is that I wouldn't be going to California right away (i'm from the Midwest) which is somewhere I've always wanted to go. On the other hand though, California isn't going anywhere and I could always go there in the future. There are just so many factors to consider that it's difficult for me to evaluate things. Most relavent to this sub though is the startup's offer. Does the salary + equity look reasonable? Should I counteroffer? What would you do as someone about to graduate with these different possible paths? I know ultimately this is my personal decision, but I thought I would start a discussion and get some others' thoughts."

As young as 3, he would be on the computer trying to fiddle with things. Never was too much into video games (at least we didn't give him the opportunity).

 I want to make sure that I give him the right opportunities to develop his talent and lack of which shouldn't be the reason he doesn't fulfill his potential.

**Background:**
 For his 7th bday he wanted an android phone (which was about the time Android was taking off). I got him a phone (no SIM,) and he meddled with it, figured out a lot of system level stuff. Last year he got a raspberry pi for xmas and has been tinkering with it. He got books from library, taught himself Python and generated some good programs. He also took an online course, downloaded the iOS SDK and followed a tutorial and created an app. Last summer his project was to build a PC (of course with my help). He did the research, online search for the best price and he built it and worked flawlessly the first time! Last week, he decided to learn Java, got a Java for Dummies book from the library, downloaded the development suite and is teaching himself Java. His favorite website is CNET. Watches all the videos and reads all reviews.


What I am trying to portray is that he has a lot of interest and is tenacious enough to figure out issues and follow up. I help him as much as I can. I am an electrical engineer with just enough software experience to help him. However, he is now getting to the level where it is not very easy for me to figure out the complicated issues. I don't want him to get discouraged and give up.


I live in the silicon valley (bay area CA) so there isn't a better place to be for this kind of stuff. However I am not quite sure how to nurture his talent. We enrolled him in a couple of software classes last summer but that just turned out to be video game programming. Not really anything really useful in the long run.


**Actual Question:**
Do you have any specific suggestions? Do companies give internship to 12 year olds? Are there specific software classes that are structured that he can take as he goes along?

**Disclaimer:**  :) 
BTW he is not a just a geeky kid. He is very social, plays basketball really well (in the YMCA league), does well in school and has a lot of friends. He reads and lot and also does other outdoor activity.


thanks..

I accepted an internship offer a few weeks ago. I kept applying to a couple of places as the company was not ideal in terms of area I'd like to work in/pay+lack of housing/location. It didn't go anywhere until I got an e-mail a few days ago regarding a position I had applied back in early December. This opportunity aligns much more closely to my interests, pay, and location.

I have a phone interview tomorrow, and I was wondering how to best approach letting them know I have an offer. Obviously I'm not gonna let em know I already accepted an offer, but I figured I could say: I have an offer on the table and need to accept by x, can you give an answer by then? 

What should x be? Should it be short to pressure them into giving me a quicker answer? Should it be long? Or will saying I have an offer drive them away and not want to bother continuing with my application?

I ask these questions because in the past, interviewers have asked me if I had any offers and deadlines they had to consider. I figured it's normal protocol to ask but I think my situation is a little different. Secondly if I were to secure this position, I'd like to let the first company know as soon as possible to not waste any more of their time, fees on background check, drug-test, etc. 

Sorry for the wall of text for what may be just a simple answer. Thanks in advance. "
306tst,1,2015-03-24,Removing myself out of my families life,abishop,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/306tst/removing_myself_out_of_my_families_life/,"This is going to probably be a bit of a long post. 

I am 21 years old. I was born in Korea and adopted when I was 3 months old. Ive grown up my whole life here in the States. I have been the only Korean let alone the only Asian person in my city. I was very depressed during high school from growing up in a very predominate white area. I was confused about myself, my culture, and who I was. If you arn't adopted then you wouldn't know what it feels like to be exiled and questioned relentlessly on why you're Asian, why you have white parents, why you have a white name, why dont you speak ""Chinese"". 
Getting berated with these questions while growing up adds up. Not only from children, but from adults as well. I tried killing myself when I was in 10th grade, but resulted in just injurying myself greatly. My parents have been supportive of me but I always felt like they regretted adopting me. It wasnt until Senior year of high school that I started to want to learn more about where I came from. What was Korea like, and why am I still here in the States. I started to become more and more interested in the Korean culture than the American culture that I was taught growing up. 

After Freshman year of college, I deiced I wanted to go back to Korea. I went with my best friend from high school and we stayed 2 weeks in Seoul. I was an amazing experience and for once in my life. I felt like I fit it. I wasn't questioned or stared at in public. I was with people of my own race. And it felt as if I should have never been adopted. 

Fast forward a year, and I wanted to go back. I applied for study abroad in Korea at Yonsei University and was accepted for the fall of 2014. During my time. I can confidently say that this was the best 5 months of my life. Not only did it boost my confidence, I didnt feel depressed, I didnt feel like I was an outsider. I was also seen as an attractive person in Korea, where in Western culture, I am seen as unattractive because of the social stigma that Asian men are weak and frail. 

Im currently on an internship working as an assistant admin and living at home since I found a place where I can commute a 10 minute drive to work everyday.

&lt;-------Skip to here if you dont want the background story---&gt;

I planned a trip back to Korea using the money from working at this internship to spend the summer in Korea. I would return a week before classes start up again. A few hours ago my parents sat me down, and told me that I was a drain on them financially and that what I am doing with my money isnt wise and that I should use it to pay off my student loans and use it towards tuition. My parents have paid for about $22,000 worth of my schooling, and I have 3 semesters left. They told me that they see me wasting money and that they're cutting me off. Now I have been self dependent since high school. I pay for my own car, gas, clothes, food, and travel expenses. I know where they are coming from on using my money for education. 

Personally at this point in my life I am already very distant from my family since they wernt there for me during high school, and approaching them with my issues always brought up more problems. Im on the fence of whether I totally leave them for the better. Stop being a financial drain on them, and let them live their lives without me. 

Ive always considered myself a loner and already being abandoned by one family makes it easier for me mentally to leave this one by my own choice. Im also on the fence about apply for Korean schools, finishing my education there, and not coming back. 

Its a lot of difficult choices for both ends but as of now, I dont want to even be in this house hold anymore.

TL;DR Do I leave my family to return to Korea/away from them, and carry on my life without a family?"

My name is Michael and I am a student at Cal Poly Pomona studying Computer Information Systems in my last year of study. I am looking to further my experience with respect to Information Technology. While my end goal is to work in the Cyber Security sector, I am open to taking any job within the domain of IT. 

University and computers are my life as I am always learning new skills and doing whatever I can to become more valuable. In fact, I am currently enrolled in a Digital Forensics competition so that I may gain some ground in an area that I have yet to experience! 

Should you have an opportunity, paid or non-paid, please don't hesitate to contact me. I will go far above and beyond the expectations. Generally, I move between the Bay Area and Los Angeles area but will not object to relocating should an opportunity present itself. Specifically, I am looking for a Summer internship and will return to school for one final quarter in Fall, however, I am highly interested in Full-Time should this be a consideration.

If you are interested, please send me a message or comment here so that we may exchange emails and information. Thank you!"

I apologize ahead of time for this long post-any advice you can give would be appreciated! I'm a college freshman choosing between two very opposing career options: a singing career or a career as a fashion designer. Some background on me in both fields: 
      For singing,I've always enjoyed it. I was in choir from elementary school through my first semester in college(unfortunately,I don't have room for it in my schedule this second semester),and show choir for three years in high school. I've performed in middle school musicals, and sang when I was in pageants for two years. I simply love performing. It makes me happy in my very core. I sing in the shower, I sing..everywhere,I guess. I don't think I'm the most amazing,but I am at least fairly good.I love singing. However, I am unsure if I have enough talent to make a career. I love performing,but of course the money sucks in it,and it's a very tough path to go into. Success is very slim,and it takes a long time to get to a point where you can make a decent living off of it. It's tough raising a family as well,of course,and on your spouse. Of course I can't guarantee we're together, but it's a pretty good bet I'll marry my long term boyfriend who's going into software engineering, it's not like he could travel with me.

Fashion Design:
I just got very into fashion a couple years ago- I truly love it. I run a fashion and lifestyle blog, and I'm currently studying fashion design at a state university. My classes are hard,but interesting,and designing clothes is fun.The actual career part is the only thing that I don't like. I hate the idea of sitting in an office all day, making money for someone else. I dislike the idea of sitting in meetings, just the daily life. I want a fascinating life. I don't want my own business,though. My university has an amazing placement rate for internships and jobs in this field with big companies, it's almost guaranteed I'll get a decent job with fairly good pay. I could make a living off of this.

 I want a career where I'm known- I want to inspire millions, be on magazine covers. I want to travel,and go to fun events. I want to meet up with fans and have a job which doesn't feel like a job(which is my main concern with fashion). I love singing,and the thought of a career of that is amazing. Also-many singers have their own clothing lines, so I could do both,which makes me even happier.

But- I'm faced with the practicality of it. Is it even practical? The most practical option would be to see if I could do both- I'll have an internship in NYC hopefully in the next couple years for my fashion degree,and I could audition and take voice classes in my spare time. But if I did get chosen for something after I have a career in the fashion field, it's not like I could just come back to my job. Singing in the early stages isn't a steady flow of constant work, you take what you could get. It's not like I could do it on the side and keep doing fashion work until I hit the big time.

 I'm just completely unsure of what to do-do I simply forget about my singing dreams to go somewhere where I'm guaranteed money? Is there some sort of balance? If I wanted to go for singing, and I wasting my time in college for fashion the next three years?How would I go about starting in the singing business-move to somewhere and start auditioning?Should I study voice instead? So many questions, and I have so many worries. What should I do?

307cyu,5,2015-03-24,Set to graduate in the Spring. Only offer received is low.,ihaveacsquestion,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/307cyu/set_to_graduate_in_the_spring_only_offer_received/,"So I'm set to graduate in the Spring admittedly with an 2.0 overall GPA. I've applied to anywhere between 30 - 40 places for entry-level positions, most not mentioning anything about GPA requirements. Out of those, I've gotten a few calls by recruits that represent the companies but only taken place in 4 in-person interviews. I've received one offer, from a place who's min requirements do not include having a CS degree, for slightly less than 40k.

My question to you is, should I roll with this place for 6-12 months and use it to boost my resume since my overall GPA is so low? I still have about a month before I graduate so I could hold out and continue searching in hopes of getting picked up somewhere else, but I'm starting to feel like the amount I was offered is probably about how much I'm worth.

For a little more information, I did do one internship three years ago, but it was in a stack not related to what I would be working with at the place offering me (low level stuff with C). If I go with the offer, I would work primarily with Java, Python, and a little bit of Javascript. Interestingly enough, I would be making one dollar more per hour than I made doing my internship. I'm also in a bit of a bind for money. I feel like it might be a good idea to use this as a foot-in-the-door situation position, pay off bills, take part in open source projects, and save up for 6-12 months.

What do you guys think? Is it a good idea to roll with this, given my low GPA and financial situation, or try to hold out for something better?

308eih,13,2015-03-25,Unemployed - feeling stuck,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/308eih/unemployed_feeling_stuck/,"I finished university with a media degree in june last year. I didn't enjoy it much at all but kind of just felt pressured into finishing it. I also started studying a graphic design diploma online at the same time because this was originally what I wanted to do but couldn't get into that course at my university. Since I graduated from media I have been looking for work with basically no leads at all. My applications are ignored completely and I get no response to internship applications either. 

It's even worse to come on here and see that people have been unemployed for so long - 2 years, 5 years, whatever

But I have not even been able to get casual work. I don't have much experience - I spent some time working at McDonalds - and get no response for retail, obviously not for hospitality or admin because I have no experience in these areas. I also think that my issues with casual work are partly because I'm 22 and most businesses only want to pay for juniors (I live in Australia) but at least now I'm 22 I can apply for job seeker benefits and get some money from the govt so I'm not completely stressed about that. My parents had to support me up until then. I still have my old job at McDonalds but that would mean moving back to my home town and they barely roster me anyway (casual, pay rate is really high).

Basically this whole thing has steadily killed all my confidence and motivation to do anything at all, really. I have to see all my friends earning money, shopping, going on holidays overseas, living on their own, owning cars etc. while I get to do nothing. I'm really unhappy with my online course for various reasons. I feel extremely isolated working online and they changed the structure of the course. I'm supposed to be finishing in august but I haven't done any work since like november last year. Every day I hate design more and more which I don't understand. I've always been creative and I love to make stuff but I just have lost all interest in it. My parents aren't much help. They just keep telling me to just finish it because I'm almost done but they don't understand any of my problems with it.

I have been submitting lots of applications for both casual and career jobs. I have had one group retail interview which I didn't get (not a surprise) and have talked to one agency but they aren't looking for a junior until later in the year.

I was thinking about having a change of careers entirely and going back to uni but all the ideas I come up with for things I actually like either have shit money or no jobs. I went to see someone to help me with my resume and stuff and while that was kind of useful it hasn't resulted in an actual job.

I'm really not sure what to do and I'm not really sure what sort of advice I'm looking for but people don't understand. My friends who have jobs think it is really easy to just sit down and churn out applications because they've never actually had to go through this process. One girl I know applied for a HR job on a whim and got it immediately. It's so fucking frustrating. 

i'm fucking 22. Why do I have to feel like this?? i know i'm at least kind of smart. i'm shy but i'm friendly, I'm not arrogant, i  dont expect to walk into a high paying senior position, I know i have to start at the bottom. i'm willing to work but i just cannot get a foot in the door. I loved university; I learnt a lot and had such a great time socially but I feel like it was such a huge waste of three years. I'd love to just fuck off away from everything and go and work overseas but I have no money, no passport, no experience doing any kind of useful work.

308rgk,0,2015-03-25,I broke all the interview rules as an experiment,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/308rgk/i_broke_all_the_interview_rules_as_an_experiment/,"Hi, I'm currently comfortably employed, but my resume is still all over the recruiter's databases, and once in a while I get calls from recruiters who want to talk to me. Last week, I had another one of those. Since I'm not really looking for a job, I decided to pull an experiment and break every rule possible for the interview. Here is my story: 

1) I post-poned the appointment several times. After 3rd re-scheduling, I outright didn't show up. They called me back and scheduled me again for try #4

2) I didn't shower the day before, didn't wear a tie, and put on a casual shirt from last week. I mismatched my belt and shoes (brown and black respectively) on purpose as well. 

3) I made sure I pulled a half-nighter so I'm feeling bad and sleep-deprived by playing Dark Souls 2 till ~2 am the day before the interview.

4) I had coffee right before entering their building (I showed up 5 mins late obviously), so I have that distinctive coffee breath. 

5) I made sure they are serving me more coffee and biscuits before I even started talking business. 

6) I gave them my business card from my current job. 

7) They started by asking me to tell them about myself. I started with describing my exchange program during high school, and how I was cocky enough to take 4x SAT's in one week (and scored high on all of them). Then they moved on to my internship, and I made sure to let them know how I didn't like the bank at all, and how I was made to do meaningless tasks that looked like a ""who are you? fuck off, intern"" assignment to me. 

8) They then started asking about my current position. I made sure that I reply in the most condescending manner that I'm managing a portfolio of projects and that I'm super qualified to a point that it's boring, so I'm looking for a more entertaining company. 

9) When asked about my current income, I outright replied ""and why do you care?"". I also threw in some curse words somewhere there. 

10) Then they started asking those classic ""where do you see yourself in 5 years"", I said ""the CFO of some large company. Preferably yours"". 

11) They asked if i'm married. I said no, and added that I hate children (I really don't, but hey, it was an experiment!). 

12) They asked why do I want to work for their company, I said ""because you will pay more than my current employer"". 

We talked for 10-15 more minutes about the tasks I perform, and I got very technical. I started throwing in examples from complicated structured deals I've had, like how a group of 70 companies was trying to get financing from us, and how I was calling them on their bullshit about their financials after cross-checking the consolidation. About 50% of it was bullshit I made up on the spot based on real projects I've had in the past. 

This afternoon they called me in for interview #2. 

I think my by far biggest take from this is - if you actually have marketable skills, companies will try to hire you, regardless of the ""company culture"" and other bullshit that is now all over the media. 

Good luck in your job search!"

Anyway, I currently have a GIS internship, and am working on a project of joining the data from an old feature class, to a spatially updated feature class.  So with help from you guys I did a spatial join and it seemed to do what I thought I needed to do.

Wasnt that simple however.  The spatial join worked, but some of the segments dont match up correctly?  Like I think the problem is that the spatial join may have joined 2 segments to one in certain locations and they should be seperate and one to one. 

My supervisor said I should use the Feature vertices to points tool?  Or maybe write a script that does something like this?  But honestly Im a little lost.  The GIS technician works in a different office so most of the time I talk to him on the phone, and he comes in every now and then to check my progress, Id like to have something to show him so I was hoping you guys would be able to help me out here.

3096q6,0,2015-03-25,Feeling stuck in a dead end software consulting job. What career move will bring me closer to landing a software engineering position?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3096q6/feeling_stuck_in_a_dead_end_software_consulting/,"**tl;dr: Current job pays well, but stunts my growth as a software developer. My exit strategy is either to go back to school or patiently look for another job while working on personal coding projects. Which makes more sense?**

A little bit about myself. I graduated from an engineering school about 10 months ago with a BS degree in mathematics. I'm probably not your typical aspiring CS dev, but I have been coding in some capacity for the last 4-5 years. I am by no means great at it, but goddamn it, I work hard at expanding my knowledge of software development.

In my junior year of undergrad I got lucky, and landed an internship with a physics lab on campus. This was an awesome software experience for me. For one, I got to work with an amazing software engineer that had phenomenal work ethic, a solid academic background, and experience with his own start-ups.  He helped me grow a lot as a software developer, and in the year that I had him as a mentor, I learned more than I have during most of my undergrad. 

The internship came to an end, and I started to look for a full time job elsewhere (the physics lab was not going to offer a full time gig to some snot-nosed undergrad). After a couple of months of searching, and attending various career related events I got two offers, both from software consulting companies. Without knowing much about software consulting jobs, I accepted an offer from the company that offered to pay me more. In hindsight, this was a dumbass move on my part, but I couldn't have known any better at the time. From what I could gather during the interviewing process, it seemed like a job where I would be writing code all day long.

Fast forward to today. I have been with the company for about 8 months, and let's just say that it took me way too long to figure out that this job is not centered around writing code. To make matters worse, the code that I have written is typically a variation of pre-existing code. My biggest issue with this is that I am not learning the ins and outs of the API at my disposal. This is particularly frustrating because I have gotten a slap on the wrist for trying to use the framework of the language. 

So...in the last couple of months I have started looking for a new job. My current goal is to find a software engineering position with a scientific computing group. Needless to say, I have thus far come up dry. I am still remaining patient, and calmly waiting to make my next move. In my mind there are two career paths that I can take from here:

1. I quit my job and go to grad school to do CS research. 
2. I tough it out with my current company while working on personal projects until I find a job where I get to write more code.

Which path makes more sense if my end goal is to land a code-heavy software engineering position?

I've lived in the same state (Ohio) my entire life, other than an internship last summer in Louisiana. I have until tomorrow to decide whether to accept a job in Houston and pick up my life and move to Texas, or to accept a job offer in the Columbus, OH area.

I guess I'm asking how other people who have been in this position (stay home or leave) have dealt with the decision, what they ultimately decided, and why.

To compare the two situations for me:

- Job-wise the job in Houston is better and has higher pay (and lower taxes) and better benefits, but the job in Columbus is still good and the pay and benefits are still great

- Socially, I have a few friends that have recently moved to Houston and are excited to do things together. For Columbus, I've been dating a girl there (it's not serious) and I have a few friends still there, but most of my college friends have either moved away or are planning to do so very soon.

- Family-wise, my parents, sister, and both sets of grandparents all live within a few hours' drive of Columbus. At the Houston job, I would make enough money/have enough vacation to visit maybe 2-3 times per year.

- Finally, I've lived in Ohio all my life, so I'm pretty comfortable with the culture and climate. I spent a summer in Louisiana so the heat and humidity don't bother me much, but adjusting to the Texas culture might take some time. I'll admit it, I'm a yankee.

Obviously, I have to make this decision myself, but does anybody  who's been in this situation (or who lives in Houston) have any advice?

I don't really know the man that offered the internship well(Don't even know his name), he just goes to the church that my family goes to(I don't live with my family currently, live on campus, and I'm not a churchgoer), and during an event while he was leaving he asked me what my major was. I said Computer Science and he offered an internship if I need one. That was almost a year ago.

So I was wondering, how exactly do I bring it back up that I'm interested in doing that this summer? Like.. find out his name.. call.. then what? How would that conversation go? Or maybe try and meet him at church? It just seems kind of rude to just go up to him and say ""Hey a while back you offered me an internship opportunity, is that offer still available for this summer?""

So, any advice? Thanks.

Edit: I'm also not entirely sure if this falls under ""Work,"" seems like it could fall under many different flairs."

About a year ago, I was working as a business analyst at a software company and just starting to teach myself development. I didn't have a CS degree and made my way into the business side of things, but I decided I wanted to be a developer after about 1 year of doing business analyst work. 

An employee at my company (at that time) and I had an idea for a startup. We went to some meet up events. We gained interest out of pure luck, but in reality we didn't have anything other than an idea.

A startup incubator brought us in for an interview and gave us a tour of their space. They told us we were a great fit, interviewed us separately, and then left us with ""we just have to draw up the paperwork"".

I was so excited. I was going to work for myself, I was going to have an opportunity to work on development all day every day, on my *own* thing! But in the end, the deal fell through at the last moment. It was crushing. 

***Anyway***, my partner came to the conclusion ""Fuck them!"" and made them into his enemy. He never spoke to them again, and when he'd see them at events in town he would give very dirty looks. 

I on the other hand remained professional and tried not to take it personally (even though it did feel personal at the time). I met again with the guy who rejected us and asked him for feedback. I then continued to grab a cup of coffee with him once every few months to catch up and stay in touch. 

***Last week I got an internship offer*** from that *same guy*. It was out of the blue, and I didn't even apply. Just ""hey, I know you're trying to be a dev, want an internship?""

I chose NOT to burn bridges even when I really wanted to, because at the end of the day ""business is business"" and you can't take things personally. I remained professional, kept in touch and continued to show interest and drive, and in the end a good thing came my way.

I liked the place very much, professional culture, good hours, good pay, and at the end, they told me that I'd be welcome to come back next summer. So during fall semester, thanks to Linkedin, I saw that my old manager, who had originally interviewed me last summer, had become the Software Engineering Manager at a much larger well known company. He also, about 2 months ago, emailed me, explaining that he had moved companies, and asked if I'd be interested in a summer internship at the big company. I said yes, and he told me to apply and he would try to get my resume through for an interview. Because this obviously wasn't guaranteed, I also made contact with the small company I worked for in the summer. They remembered me and were very nice, but said that I would have to fill out another application. I did, and received an email from the new manager, who I knew and had worked with last summer as well, saying:

Good Morning -----,

Received your application and am happy you're thinking of rejoining us this summer. As I need to plan activities, I'll need to know what day your semester ends and when you'll be available.

I emailed him back when semester ends and what day I'd be able to start.

So about a month later, I followed up telling him I was still interested and would like to know what the interview/hiring process is for returning employees. He emailed back

Good morning -----,

I have already started the process with HR. I expect to see you on May 4th (the date I gave him). If you have any questions please contact HR or myself.

What I was hoping to find out was whether or not I should be expecting an interview or if I would just get back to work. I didn't want to keep emailing him and sound overbearing so I decided to just let it ride until closer to the date. However, a few days ago I got a call from the large companies headquarters, saying they would like to interview me. The interview is with my old boss who was very easy to interview with before so I'm decently confident I'll do fine and may even get the gig. However, my question now is, have I committed myself to the first company already? If I don't take the big internship, what if I get there on May 4th and it's just an interview and I may not get the job. To be clear, I don't have a written offer with pay and schedule details. If I did, I would know that they're expecting me to work on May 4th. My question now is, where should I go from here. Obviously try to do well in the big interview, but if I get a real offer (pay and schedule) do I take that and risk burning bridges with the first company who might think that I'm committed to working for them?

I came here for advice, and suggestions on which build path to take. I really (sorry) don't want suggestions on better windows pc's for the price, etc.

I have 3 Routes I can take for the MacBook. Assume money is not a problem, but is being considered.

Option A)

My best friend bought a laptop for his new internship in Ohio. He bought and customized a MacBook with a 3.1Ghz processor, 16GB RAM, and 256GB memory, and it has Retina Display. He bought it around Christmas time, with no applecare warranty and it is in like new shape. Turns out he quit the internship for the company, and will be working for a new company in New Jersey that is supplying him with a custom windows PC and he doesn't need the MacBook Pro anymore and wants to sell it for moving and traveling expenses. He is giving me a price of $1,400. 

Option B)
MacBook Pro, New, through a company perks program.
My uncle works at a business which as a perks program, which offers discounts for buying Apple Products.

This option is 13inch Screen(as are all options, sorry if I forgot to mention) with 2.7GHZ processor, 8GB ram, and a 3 year apple care warranty for 1650. It has 256gb Storage.

Option C)
This MacBook Pro is customized, fully loaded.
13 inch screen, 3.1GHZ i7, 16gb Ram, 516gb storage, Retina Display, with 3 year apple care warranty for 2300 bucks.

My dilemma is I want a powerful workhorse Mac, but unsure which option makes the most sense for me. Do I NEED the applecare warranty? Are the upgrades worth the price or can I get by with 2.7Ghz and 8gb RAM? Storage really isnt an issue because I have multiple external hard drives. 

Is the price worth the upgrades? (I.e. 2.7 -&gt; 2.9 - &gt; 3.1Ghz processors?) (8gb-16gb RAM??)


Thank you for any help or input you have. I have no problem buying the one from my friend because I have seen it and it is in great shape, but there is something satisfying about opening and buying a NEW product that feels more correct because of warranties etc. If I am going to be dumping this much money into something I want to make sure I am getting the best and most for what I am paying.

I am a sophomore (going on junior) international student studying in the US majoring in Computer Engineering. Recently I applied for internships in my home country, where I'm returning during the summer, and got two offers. Company A manufactures electronics, and their HQ is situated in the state I currently study in, so I could possibly try to intern with them again next year (will be staying here then). The branch in my country, however, is very far from my home. Initially, I asked about accommodation and they told me that they would not provide any, so after a week of consideration I declined the offer. 

Company B is a pretty big consulting firm and is located very near my home, and they offered me an internship in software engineering. However, their US branch does not hire international students for their internships if I wanted to in the future, but I accepted their offer (nothing signed yet, supposed to be receiving an offer letter soon) because I thought I could not work anything out with Company A due to logistics. Suddenly, Company A replied offering me free accommodation at a hotel for the duration of the internship.

As a CompE major, will interning in manufacturing be a lot more beneficial compared to consulting? Also, since I have already accepted Company B's offer, will it look very bad to rescind it now? My family is not supportive of Company A because I am going all the way back home and then leaving them again (though I can manage a few trips back to my city once in a while), and they do not like the idea of me living alone in an unfamiliar state (plus crime rate in my country is... uncomfortably high). However, Company A expressed an interest in potentially hiring me after graduation.

**SH #3:** Why not take it a step further and region lock the game so just from the news PC folks will start pulling their hairs out and we might cause Xbone purchases even before the game starts development.

I help run activities for families and kids in the galleries, conduct tours of exhibitions, and sometimes work directly with big-name artists. As part of my program I have had experiences with four artists, but the experiences are so different that I'm not sure how to phrase them:

Artist A is well-known in the art world. I was selected from a class I was taking at the museum to work with interns to design a maze in the museum as part of a performance piece she did. (I was not actual intern of the museum at this time. I was taking a class there and my instructor recommended me.)

Artist B is probably the most famous living artist, extremely well-known in and out of the art world. As part of the program, me and the other interns got a tour of his studio by him. During the tour, we got to ask him questions, etc. I really want to name-drop Artist B on my resume because of how renowned he is, but I really didn't do any work stuff during the visit, except be professional and respectful to him.

Artist C is up-and-coming in the art world, but not well known. This was another group studio visit where we spoke with the artist. Afterwards, I was asked to write a blog post about the visit that was then published on the museum's education blog.

Artist D is very well-known in the art world. I worked with four other interns in the program to conduct a video interview with him at his studio. Together we did research about his work, prepared questions, and went to the studio with the head of museum interpretations to conduct the interview. The interview will be on the museum's website within the next few months.


So all of these are very different experiences. I feel like my work with Artists A and D are the most impressive because I worked with other people and had a big role, but Artist B would be an eye-catcher and my experience writing the blog post for Artist C shows that I'm a good writer.

I took the job because I thought it was business-related and I was offered a good starting salary (~53k).

The problem is this is not what I want to do at all. I am finding as I research more and more that if you do not do internships while in school you are pretty much screwed in your career. I had a job that paid pretty well during school and was almost FT, and I didn't want to quit because I was stupid and wanted money. I didn't save anything from that job (other than my 401k plan) so it was basically a waste.

Are there any websites or services that assist in finding post-bacc recent graduate internships? I mean real internships, not commission only ""financial advisor"" internships. Doesn't have to be huge firms, but I'm talking for reputable firms where we actually are able to be hired on for a FT salaried role afterwards (similar to lots of internships for juniors and seniors)

 Literally everything I find wants you to be enrolled, and not only enrolled, but in the EXACT major relative to the field you're in. I wish an advisor had actually advised me of this phenomena. I would have majored in finance and not international business (I love traveling and other cultures and wanted to work internationally for a while)
If anyone can help, I would really appreciate it and I hope this post gets replies. Hopefully someone can help us recent grads with similar issues.

**I am willing to quit my current job in an instant and take an internship if it meant that I was able to work full time after the internship in finance. I think many people would quit if it meant they were able to get relevant skills and not be pigeon holed**"

I didn't realize I had to look for my own job and this part freaked me out a little because I couldn't find any IT related jobs in my area. I submitted my resume to a few places and closed off my search...

The next day I get a phone call from someone from an IT recruiting firm, Modis, saying that they might have a few help desk jobs that I meet the requirements for and that they would like to meet with me to discuss them.  I agree, because what do I have to lose?

I get there and we discuss the jobs, and find out that I am pretty well qualified for a few jobs (I have some previous experience in IT prior to starting college), and the pay is WAY higher than what I thought I would even come close to. But they are full-time ""contract-to-hire"" jobs, so an internship with them most likely wouldn't happen.  I don't think I would be able to go to school full time and maintain a job full-time, so really it is just one or the other. They offer to ""represent"" me for these jobs and will send them my resume and set up an interview if I agree to let them.

Now, I'm a little confused as to what would be my best option here.  I mean, I go to college so I can start a career, but a career may have just fallen into my lap.  Should I take one of these jobs and forget about college for now? I figure I can always go back if things don't work out, but I guess I just can't get over how easy this was to find a job that pays a lot.

So I guess I'll leave a tl;dr here heh, because this is longer than I intended:

1. Have any of you had experience with Modis, or a similar IT recruitment firm?  If so, how was your experience?
2. Should I drop school and take a well paying IT job?

Should I be seeking junior/associate levels of positions?",narett,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30hdrr/as_of_april_ill_have_a_year_of_professional/,"I'm noticing a lot of college/intern related posts this morning, so perhaps mine will be out of place. I guess I'm in a weird position considering I'm 25, didn't graduate with a strict CS major, and have worked for a year as a software developer in a shitty financial institution (you can dig through my history to see my workplace concerns) on top of having intern experience as a software engineer at a Fortune 500 place that I didn't want to work for.

My question is: with a year of experience, what should I be looking for? Sure, I'm seeking out positions that either list 1-2 years of experience needed or not list any years at all. I'm applying to Big 4 companies as well since I would like to have a name on my resume everyone can recognize, which would help out in any future employment endeavors. That and I feel working at one of these huge companies will help me become a better developer.

That said, my final goal is to become a professional developer that makes cool stuff people use. I've more or less touched on some of this goal in my life after college minus the cool part, and I don't think developers should be treated like chattel (see my history again lol).

I'm also looking for relocation to fulfill another goal of mine - to live outside my home state for at least a year. Thankfully, as a developer, there are numerous opportunities that offer relocation. The issue here is they normally want people who have years of experience or are fresh out of school - two things I'm not. I mean, yes, I have a leg up on college grads on paper but they'd still be a better investment since they can be molded easier. I consider myself young since I graduated back in 2012, but I'm no spring chicken I guess.

I recently had a phone interview with Amazon, which surprised me despite all that I've described. I dunno if anything will come out of it though since I didn't complete the problem in the interview despite, as my interview put it, I was on the right path in thinking recursively as well as name dropping the proper data structures needed while noting key design choices.

Side note: In regards to the Amazon interview...chances are I won't get it. However, that interview made me extremely happy since it sort of put into perspective things to work on in my spare time. However, I was able to understand the interviewer completely when he asked me CS related things, which I was so excited about because I've come to understand them. A year ago, I wouldn't have been able to confidently code anything on Collabedit or straight up determine a problem could be solved recursively, much less realizing a hash table would be a good solution to a given problem.

As someone who studies outside work and during downtime, that sort of gave me hope I can land a gig somewhere that has me solving problems instead of being a code cruncher who's told to copy and paste nonsense.

I got the jobs because of family that works there.

I don't enjoy doing large programming projects like i've done in most of my classes. I've liked my database class and my networks class more than the others. I'm moderately proficient at UNIX. I can do most of the programs on CodingBat.com for Java and some C++, but they're generally intro level programs anyways that are solved in 10 lines or less.

What are some good fields i'd be good for in the CS world that aren't essentially Software Engineer's and high-level coding jobs, and how do I apply to them? I've been both fortunate and unfortunate in that i've had 4 internships ad a good company, but they were all heavily influenced by the fact that I have (high ranking) family at the company.

I'm also interested in a career track that will pay really well. 

The things I'm interested in are the more logic and theory based topics like machine learning, distributed systems, math, and CS.  I could focus on things like front end and other web and back-end dev but I find that just to be a never ending rat race of learning new frameworks all the time. In the end that stuff doesn't feel challenging enough. 

I'm 32yo, going back to school full time to finish my ugrad degree later this year. What are my options, would it be feasible at all to get work related to machine learning or analytics/prediction/AI with just an undergrad degree (from a top 5 ugrad CS program)? I have seen people on this sub mention that you need a PhD to get that kind of work. Is that true? Would a masters work? 

What other kinds of jobs are there for someone who is focused on logic/math/stats/cs? Number crunching heavy stuff. Would I find a job in the quant or algo-trading world interesting? What kinds of candidates do those jobs look for(bachelors, MS, PhD?)? 


**My backstory**

I was an excellent student when I entered one of the Top 5 cs programs in undergrad fresh out of HS, but I flunked out due to just not doing any work. I'm going back later this year, but I have to do one year of community college courses (which i'm starting Fall 2015) before they let me back in. When I re-enter my original Uni i will have all the general education requirements satisfied so I will only need to fulfill major requirements (mainly math and CS classes). It should take me roughly two years from that point to finish at the Uni. I'm worried that having only two years there will limit the amount of time and # of summers I'll have to do things like research and internships. So of my main questions is, ***what could I be doing starting now to give myself the best chance to set myself up for getting the types of work I'm interested in?***

I might have to major in math and minor in CS due to my previous grades (you have to apply and be accepted into the CS major at my school, and so many people apply that it is very competitive). I've mapped out a few possible plans, in order of my preference:

1. Double Math/CS (with Statistics electives)
1. CS major / Math minor
1. Math major / CS minor / Stats electives and/or minor
1. Math major only 

I've been/am a team lead / architect, and am very strong in .NET, ASP.NET MVC, git, SQL, and javascript. But aside from Git, i don't think most of those skills will be useful for what I want to do.

-Drive the technical processes of the sales cycle by helping to identify and alleviate customer pain points
-Interface directly with support, development, and post sales teams to better understand how customers use (insert company product) and influence product direction

When they ask me if 13-14 dollars an hour is ok I don't know how to answer that because I feel like being entry level I have no right to ask for more, but that sounds extremely low for an IT position, even entry level.

One thing I have struggled with, however, is being able to retain all of the lessons/skills I have learned in my experiences. For example, I have gone through some of my tutorial/reference workbooks several times but a little while later I will forget a basic concept and/or skill that was discussed. Has anyone on here had this problem and what have you done about it?"

The company is the vanity project of an elderly professor I'll refer to as the Doctor from here on out, with several patents in an obscure corner of medical testing and research. (Hopefully that's generic enough.) 

&amp;nbsp;

As long as I've worked here, the company has had two floors. The ground floor is staffed by friendly old ladies who do customer service for our many industrial clients; the second floor is where research and development for new products happens. (Production is largely outsourced, although we do have a small fabber-shop on premises - mostly for prototyping and repairs/small orders.) 

&amp;nbsp;

I joined the company just as my old boss (let's call him Dan) was getting aspirations of leaving; he groomed me to take over his position, then bailed out, leaving the Doctor a glowing letter of recommendation for me to take over the vacancy. Considering I went from ""glorified intern"" to ""salaried lower management with benefits package"" in the span of a fortnight, I was certainly not going to complain - though honestly that should have been more of a red flag than I took it for at the time. More on that later.

&amp;nbsp;

When Dan left, it triggered a sort of upheaval. A ""Great Purging"" if you will. It was like the building itself was shaking off the dust. The entire R&amp;D department, no longer shielded from the lower floors by Dan, began getting surprise visits by people we'd never met before in our lives - all of them big names from the ground floor, who had been with the company forever but had been using Dan as their liaison to ""The Upstairs Folk"" as we were (apparently) known.

&amp;nbsp;

It was through them that I learned that our building has a third floor - a B1F. The Chasm. The Place Tech Goes To Die. I discovered it was full of ancient technology - old PowerPC Macs, stacks of printers, cables galore, Dell Optiplexes, a good half dozen Eee PCs from before Asus marketed as Asus - all of which had just been sitting down there, rotting. Apparently it was all ""broken tech"" from back before the company hired IT contractors. 

&amp;nbsp;

The reason I mention The Chasm is because part of the shakeup involved it. The Doctor discovered the basement and its trove of archaeotech; believing it all junk, he ordered it all disposed of. It all had to be out by the end of the week.

&amp;nbsp;

As one or two of the younger schlubs started sorting everything down there to be dumpster'd, I had the bright idea to make sure what we were throwing out was, y'know, *actually broken.* So on a whim I grabbed an ancient printer, plugged it into the wall, and powered it on. 

&amp;nbsp;

The damn thing booted up fine. 

&amp;nbsp;

""Alright,"" sez I, ""it could still be broken. Let's see if it prints."" I hook it up to my trusty Surface Pro 2 and let Windows Update install the damn thing. It installs perfectly. Put some paper in the tray, hit ""Print test page,"" and... it prints. Perfectly. Despite having been sitting in this basement for ""at least five years"" according to the nearest friendly old lady. The ink wasn't even low.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, what especially stuck in my craw over this whole thing? There were people on both floors *desperately in need of tech* that was simply languishing in The Chasm. Friendly old ladies on the first floor who had been asking for a printer for months. Former fellow interns who needed a computer (any computer, even an ancient one) to write reports and access online journals on, so they weren't doing *NDA-compliant work* on personal laptops that left the building to walk around a state college on a regular basis. 

&amp;nbsp;

So I decided, in the face of the Great Purging, to do a Great Reclamation. And as I worked, I began to piece together the ""problems"" that had consigned these poor artefacts of archeotech to The Chasm in the first place.

&amp;nbsp;

* An HP LaserJet 2300. Someone had switched a setting so instead of pulling paper from Tray 2 (the actual tray), it would always try to pull from Tray 1 (a single-job manual loading tray that had to be unfolded in order to use). Net effect was a printer that ""always thought it was out of paper, even when the tray was full to bursting."" Changing the setting back took all of two minutes.  
* A Ricoh Aficio 3500N color laser printer that ""nobody knew what was wrong with."" Including me, because as soon as I plugged it in and powered it up, it printed more than happily.  
* A Brother HL-4070CDW color laser printer that ""complained about being used as a network printer."" I was never able to fix that part, but it worked perfectly fine as some friendly old lady's desk printer via USB.
* A Konica Minolta PagePro 1350W that had been hooked up via Parallel cable to a Dell Optiplex tower. It had gotten jostled, which had damaged the Parallel port on both the printer and the tower - which had consigned both to The Chasm. The printer's USB port was completely fine, so it also got a new lease on life at a friendly old lady's desk.  
* The aforementioned Dell Optiplex. Everything else on the damn machine worked fine, so it got its HDD wiped and a clean install of Debian put in. It became one of my interns' research desktop with a $10 monitor from Goodwill.
* The six Eee All-In-One PCs. They were apparently spares that had ""gotten lost in the shuffle."" They were completely functional, completely untouched. Five of them were still wrapped in the factory clingwrap and had never even been powered on.

&amp;nbsp;

You may be wondering at the startlingly specific manner to which I've referred to much of this tech. There's a reason for this. After the Great Reclaiming? *All of it is still in service.* I just took a brief walk around the building and checked the model numbers on the units I know are my rescues. The OptiPlex I don't have a model number for because it finally kicked the bucket last month, but everything else on that list is still in service. The HP LaserJet 2300 I saved first now lives on my desk; its machine-spirit is clicking happily at me a foot and a half to my left as I send it another batch of reports.

&amp;nbsp;

The kicker? Every one of those broken printers had at one point been one of the Doctor's personal printers. Rather than have them fixed, he decided they were ""junk"" and had an intern ""get rid of them."" Three generations of interns had just been putting them down in The Chasm to languish, forgotten.

&amp;nbsp;

I think I'm beginning to understand why Dan quit.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR** Permit ye not the Ecclesiarchy into this hallowed Mechanicus bunker, for the line between archeotech and heretek is blurry in their eyes."

_________________________________

Vincent followed Mach down the halls of his mansion, still talking as they left the trophy room. “So, you think the Builders are peaceful but they made those massive sharks that attack people? That sounds a bit strange don’t you think?”

“They only attack if they’re provoked like I said.”

“But you also said you figured hu… my people would all get eaten by the first one they met.” Vincent looked to the dragon who didn’t reply and just kept walking until Vincent continued. “Because you assume we’d provoke it.”

“I have no doubt.”

“Mmh…” Vincent nodded, that sounded rather accurate he had to admit. But what if they were designed that way? He really didn’t give much credence to the old conspiracies about aliens landing on the pyramids, or abducting certain people through history but… well how did he explain his own situation? “Can we talk to the academics again?”

“Certainly, we need to meet with them to get you that new black box after all. I wanted to have a private conversation with you about my own memories and give them time to look over the data.” Mach said while leading Vincent back downstairs into the more streamlined basement.

“It’s strange knowing someone else is watching your memories isn’t it?” Vincent said, all too familiar with the caution it causes.

“More so when they’re in your head with you adding their own perspective to it.” Mach agreed with a nod. That was actually a new thought for Vincent. When he’d tried to view that woman’s memories it had been entirely strange to try and figure out what were his thoughts and what were her thoughts. It had to be especially strange for Mach who’d never gone through the process at all.

Soon they were back in the same room as before but the Academics were all focused on Zurni and Fizern instead of their terminals. Fizern was ticking points off of his fingers, two already out. “And you always seem to make this a competition between our imprints! I’m the foremost scholar on brains within the entire Union! I’m not just a neuroscientist I’m the best there is! But you don’t hear me bringing that up unless you start to question my expertise! Creature 88 might be a new species and his brain is more complicated but it still functions as one expects a brain to function! Being an expert on a species does not make you an expert on every aspect of that species!”

Zurni was huffing, four of her arms crossed as she balanced on the back two. “You don’t bring it up directly because it’s always there in your tone! Your inflection! You always think you’re better than me and won’t concede a single point to me without checking it yourself! If you just trusted me to be doing my job then you wouldn’t second guess every decision I make or idea I present!”

“My *tone*? My *inflection*? Have you changed imprints and become a language and communication expert since we last spoke?!” He couldn’t growl but he seemed close.

“I don’t need to be an expert on all communication to be an expert on your communication! Growing up with someone has a habit of allowing you to understand that they mean but aren’t saying *father*!” 

When Vincent heard her say that he burst out laughing causing everyone in the room to look his way and stopping the two xenos from fighting. Zurni looked confused, Fizern looked shocked, and Mach looked curious. Of the other three academics whose names Vincent couldn’t remember right now the stone face and praying mantis looked horrified. But the mouse? He was quite actually pulling some sort of food out of his coat and eating it with a big grin on his face. He was just loving the whole thing. “What’s so funny?” Zurni finally demanded.

“I saw this shit all the time in movies and vids, and all that. The father daughter argument crap. ‘I’m not convinced you’re ready for this!’ And then she goes all like ‘Screw you dad! I’m totally ready!’” Vincent took on a more high pitched voice to try and make it clear who was who in his mind. “And then all the other shit goes on in the movie and he’s dying but she saved the day and he says some crap like. ‘Oh honey why did I ever doubt you? I’m so proud of you. Blllleeeggghh I’m dead.’ And she cries and then shacks up with the protagonist and the credits roll.” He shook his head as the Academics and Mach went through a variety of faces as they tried to comprehend what he’d said. Except the mouse who was still grinning and eating.

“I’m sorry… what does this have to do with anything?” Fizern finally asked as he shook his head in mild disbelief it seemed.

“You guys have it fucking lucky. You’re both alive to yell at each other. She’s an adult and clearly passionate about her job, you get to be there for her. Do you have any fucking clue what I’d give? What I’d do. To have had another conversation with my dad when I was in my teens? Just one! Or what I’d do now to talk to my mom again? I don’t know if I’ll ever see her again!”

“Where was your father?” Zurni asked, always ready to find out more about Vincent.

“Dead. He died when I was young.” Vincent noted her eyes get wider as she had a new piece for her puzzle so to speak.

“He did! How did it happen? Were there any major male figures in your life after that?”

“I’m not getting into any of that.” He waved his hands in front of him to make it clear. “Not a chance. Not right now. Maybe later but not right now Zurni.” He could see her disappointment but she obviously wasn’t going to push it. Fizern however spoke up.

“Your people had movies about topics like this? Our… disagreements I mean.”

“Oh all the time. It’s something people connect to. The struggle between parent and adult. Everyone has a different relationship with the people who brought them into the world after all. It’s complicated. But almost everyone has some struggle with it. How do you make yourself different from the ones who raised you? Or how do you stay true to their upbringing?” 

Vincent shrugged and kept talking. “I always looked up to my father but I probably couldn’t be more different. I’m violent, and aggressive and a whole host of other things while he was very compassionate and kind.” Vincent smirked a little as he thought it over and then laughed for a moment. “Hell he could even sing. When he took my mom out on a date they couldn’t get into the club they were trying to get into so instead he took her to an empty parking lot and sang to her while they danced under the street lights.” Vincent trailed off as he thought back on hearing his mom and dad tell the story when he was a kid. He could just feel the love radiating off of them…

“Vincent?” Mach’s voice was distant. Oh what he’d give to see either one of his parents again. It wasn’t like he could meet them in the afterlife if he kept being cloned… “Vincent!” He finally jerked back into reality, aware that they’d been trying to get his attention for a while.

“What?” They were all staring at him and the mouse seemed to have run out of snacks in his lab coat.

“You had expressed an interest in talking with my specialists? I figured now might be a decent time before you lose your thoughts by experiencing those of another.” Mach watched Vincent carefully, seeming unsure if Vincent had already lost his thoughts.

“Oh… yes it was something you mentioned earlier. Now that I know about the Builders and what not there’s a chance that I’m related to all that, I speak your common language, I fit within the range of most species even if I’m extreme. But the worms experimented on me. They made it so I could be cloned for some reason. They obviously had plans for my use and they hate the Union.” He looked out at the various experts and of course Mach. “What if this was their plan?”

Mach frowned. “Being captured?” 

“No think about it. My people’s blood is being used as a drug. I’ve upset the natural balance of the Union. I don’t fit into the normal categories like the other species. Just like Mach said if we came into contact with that Builder shark thing we’d likely just provoke it.” He shrugged. “What if the worms knew I’d bring the Union down from the inside?”

“*No*.” Mach said with the same force he’d denied any chance Minva could be a Warden. “You fight crime. You can’t be responsible for things outside of your control. There are other forces working against you here.”

“Right but black blood started showing up not long after I did! What if the Wardens were working with the Worms? What if my species is something the worms knew about and manipulated, or shit what if they created us?” He could see the academics puzzling through what he’d mentioned but Mach plowed ahead.

“You think the worms somehow manipulated dragons into doing their work for them? We’re supposed to be the very bedrock of the Union! While some might be led astray they’d have to know the rest of us would fight claw and tooth to preserve it! You’ve delayed their plans, and strike against them at every turn! How is that part of their plan?”

Vincent had heard how confident Mach was about keeping him going before. When his past had become clear once more Mach was there to ensure he never stopped. That he got right back to work. Of course the dragon wanted to use him as a pawn but… it was the way he sounded back then and now. 

Maybe… Maybe Mach really thought of Vincent as his friend and refused to believe he was some evil pawn. “The worms can obviously get to my home planet. They know more about my species than anyone else. I’m not the only h…” He barely caught it. “There are others like me here. Forget what the Wardens are trying now, what did they want with us back then?”

“The worms are always seeking new species to reach before the Union. They’re terrible fighters on their own so they look for hosts. You’ve proven to be a very capable and hard to kill creature so maybe they were grooming you for their own army.” Zurni said which made Vincent wince a little at the thought.

“But if that’s true it means you being here is not some grand and terrible plan of theirs.” Mach was quick to add on.

“But is it possible the worms have been manipulating my people to be the force you mention? The kind to fight and quarrel constantly? To be lazy, and yet industrious? Can this Union survive the introduction of an entire race like me? An entire race that won’t fit into these easy classifications the AI relies on? The kind of species that kills over gods and will suddenly be introduced to ancient races that left behind incredibly destructive devices?”

The room was silent. Not even Mach spoke for a while as Vincent looked at them. After a moment Vincent sighed and shrugged. “Since we’re talking about crazy things here have you ever heard of a system with a small volcanic planet right next to the star, a greenhouse world, a garden world, a small rocky and red planet, some asteroids, two gas giants, and then…” He paused. “An ice planet and a dwarf?”

Mach shook his head. “Nothing comes to mind. It’s not too far off from this system in those terms however.”

Vincent arched a brow. “How close are we talking?”

“No small volcanic one like you said, but the first planet is covered in acid swamps. It might have been a greenhouse in the past. Then there’s the Farm, and then this planet. No asteroids though.”

“None?” Vincent tried to think back on everything he knew about astronomy. Which wasn’t much.

“I mean a stray one here or there perhaps but certainly not a belt of them. Two gas giants though, but nothing further out than them.” Vincent rubbed his chin. That… was that close enough?

“The Farm, does it have an unusually large moon?” Vincent asked before Mach shook his head.

“It has rings, and a trapped asteroid.”

“What about this planet? It’s hard for me to tell what’s up there when I rarely get to see the sky.”

“There are two small moons, rocky, devoid of life.”

“More trapped asteroids?”

“No, they’re spheroids.”

“Well… huh...” The dirt on the surface of this planet was dirty blackish purple. But was it always that way? He shrugged and rubbed his head. “All this is starting to hurt my head. But you said the Farm has rings? Like you look up in the sky and tons of little things hanging up there?”

Mach chuckled and nodded. “More or less.”

“I’d like to see something like that someday. Alright I’ve wasted enough time, let’s see the memory.” He climbed up on the table he’d used before, not needing any help to get the needle jammed into place.

“Are you trying to avoid thinking about all of this?” Mach asked.

“No time to talk! Let’s find out what’s on that black box! Zurni get this rolling or I’ll fire you as my assistant!” The xeno quickly scrambled over to a terminal. Vincent closed his eyes trying to end his current train of thoughts with someone else’s memories. As he closed his eyes he could feel things begin.

Alright this was a man. Unconscious. Pain in the back of his head. Some sort of old scar? Pretty bad pain. Slowly his eyes blinked open as he returned to the land of the living. Looking down he could see that his oranje, blauwe, and wit armor was all still in place. However his comm wasn’t picking up the De Vliegende Hollander. Wait. Huh? What the fuck? The what? His clothes were what color?

As he looked up he could see a Sater. They were dangerous, usually worked for the Draken, but this one had black armor and no heraldry. Perhaps it belonged to the wormen… The language was fucking with Vincent’s mind and in reality he groaned out as his brain tried to process non-English thoughts with his English ones. The Sater… Satyr wasn’t alone. There was another with him sitting at a table. “So, we’ve finally caught you. It took quite some effort. It seems the Shade isn’t the only capable member of your species.”

Vincent could sense some confusion about the term the Shade so this human wasn’t aware of Vincent. But instead of addressing it he spoke up. “Natuurlijk, de nieuwe koper die te goed is om waar te zijn, is echt te goed om waar te zijn. En ik maar denken dat alle aliens idioten zijn! Nou vertel op, voor wie werk je Sater? De wormen?”

Whaaaaat the fuuuuck? Something… something… aliens? Worms? He could tell the person understood the English being spoken but wasn’t replying in the language. The Saters… Satyrs looked to each other, for a moment before looking back at Vincent. Or… whoever he was. “Lets try this again. I know you can speak common. And I suspect you’re willing to work with us once you just tell us what your price is. That’s all you want right? Credits?”

”Je hebt echt geen idee wie ik ben, of wel? Of wat ik ben? Vast en zeker ook nog nooit Nederlands gehoord? Nee natuurlijk niet, jullie spreken allemaal Engels. Het is ook altijd zo oneerlijk. Hollywood zet Amsterdam nooit goed neer, en gaat er altijd van uit dat jullie zullen landen in wat eerst Amerika was!” 

Oh fuck this hurt Vincent’s head. Something… Netherlands… English? Hollywood… America? He could tell the person was pissed off at the Satyrs over something. Saters. FUCK. Satyrs! “Maybe it’s his head injury.” The sitting… creature in black said.

The other stepped up, slamming his fist into Vincent’s gut, making him gasp out in reality and the memory before the Satyr backhanded him. Normally that would just sting but the armored plated fist cut open Vincent’s lip. Er… the man’s lip. In reality Vincent would be fine.

He spit up at the Sater who’d been hitting him. “Is dat alles? Mijn moeder deed me nog meer pijn toen ik vroeger billekoek kreeg! Vuile klootzak, blijf godverdomme is met je poten van me af, ik word er schijtziek van jij smerige tyfuslijer! Je stinkt nog erger dan een dixie op een festival!”

That was all cursing. Just… it had to be. Vincent could sense the anger and frustration welling up within the other man and didn’t know the details but was well aware he’d been cursing them out. The Satyr at the table slammed his hands on the table. “We know you speak common! You’re just being stubborn! You’re a criminal! You have no honor so why pretend like we’re that different?! You heard our offer before but we want to make it extra clear now. You put your skills to work getting what we want in and out of the city and we’ll make you filthy rich.”

“Just your base! Work with us. Give us something to make it clear you’re willing to work! Otherwise we’ve got all the time there is and you’ve only got one life. You don’t come back like the Shade.” The close Satyr leaned in closer still to Vincent. The other human that is. Not Vincent.

“Als je echt denkt dat ik je de locatie van mijn hoofdkwartier zo makkelijk vertel,  heb je duidelijk geen idee wie ik ben. Zodra ik dood ben, ben ik weg, en is dit gewoon een leegte in mijn geheugen. Veel succes met het zoeken naar de echte ik.” Vincent could tell he wasn’t worried about dying in the least, especially as the man took the chance to spit blood up into the Sater’s visor.

The Satyr growled and pulled back his fist, only to stop as blaster fire was heard in the distance. He could see the Satyrs looking towards the door and the sounds of fighting were quickly getting closer. The man laughed up at them. “Ëindelijk! Iemand hier om je te vermoorden! Dit is m’n kans…”

There was an explosion that knocked Vincent around from the chair he was bound too. He could feel it break as he hit the ground, and likely his right wrist, but it also meant his hands were free. The man scrambled to his feet just as there was another explosion. He could feel burning, there was a hole in the wall of the room. As he jumped through it the jagged metal cut strips out of his arms and legs. Much of this was easier for Vincent to comprehend as the man acted without thinking too much.

There was some sort of ocean he could see through a window in the next room and… whoa… rings! He could see the rings stretching out away from the planet! That looked amazing! But the man wasn’t interested. He turned and began to run down some sort of hallway before he felt something slam into him from the side. There was the crunch of breaking ribs before he was slammed into the window, and then through it. The shattering glass cutting up much of his other side and back before he hit the ground.

Things became fuzzy then as if he was watching through Static. But he could feel burning and looked down, seeing some sort of oil spreading across the top of a boat, lapping at his feet. He was pinned under the bulk of a dead Rovik. The fire was getting closer. He would die slowly. Painfully. Instead the man grabbed the Rovik’s blaster and began to pull it up to his head. There was some sort of final thought…

“Hopelijk heb ik door dat de deal fout ging, en zal ik voorzichtiger zijn met mijn nieuwe kopers!” And then the man pulled the trigger and the memory became nothing but darkness.

As soon as Vincent was back in reality he sat up and patted down the crotch of his pants. The academics were staring at him in surprise but he sighed in relief. “I was just making sure I didn’t piss myself.” 

He could see the revulsion on their faces except Zurni who looked curious. “From dying in the memory you mean? Sometimes your body undergoes sympathetic muscle relaxation and you lose control of some of your body functions?” 

“I…” Vincent paused and thought it over. Was it just a physical reaction that made him do it? He always thought that the fear of ending was what made him do it sometimes. He’d died in all sorts of awful and terrifying ways. Now he suddenly wasn’t as sure. “I don’t know if it’s physical or emotional.” Might as well be honest.

“What did you learn?” Mach asked to change the subject.

“Satyr’s were trying to interrogate him… about something. He wasn’t playing along. Then… explosions and running, and fire, and death.” Vincent hated burning alive. Those two days trapped in the rubble of the factory… if the Yurvesh had tried to make him relive those he likely would have killed… someone. He would 
have fought it to the end that’s for sure.

“We were able to view it as you uploaded since this system is more efficient than the normal one you use. But we had no idea what he was saying. A few words sound familiar but that’s about it.” Mach informed him.

“You think I know? I only know one language! And that guy was speaking  Duuuugghh!” He’d tried to say Dutch but instead twisted and threw up blood onto the floor of their nice clean room. He could hear the academics gasp and squeal, the mouse fainted, the stone face rushed to the nearest trashcan to puke as well. Zurni was actually stepping forward though.

“Mind if I take a sample?”

“Dr. Zurni I feel that might be in poor taste…” Mach admonished her lightly. 

“But I want to see if this is chemically different from the normal samples.” She had a point. Vincent held up a hand and she quickly grabbed a small beaker to hand to him. He spat up a bit more blood into the beaker and then handed it back before leaning back onto the table and laying down once more.

“I… fucking… *hate* that.”

He could hear Mach speak into a comm unit. “Yes. Another clean up. More water and burnt toast.” But Vincent waved him off and stood up. “Hold off on the toast I think he wants to go upstairs now.

“Mach I need to find something. This really tears it. There are more of my kind here! At least two! Or… well that one is dead so there was two but now at least one! And if I don’t go find him and help him I might be the only one left! I know I was just talking about how perhaps me being here is a terrible thing but I have to find someone else. I just have to!”

“You won’t hear any arguments from me. I’ll do anything I can to help.” Mach promised with a solemn nod. Vincent knew that the other human, Brian was somewhere at the bottom of the City. He’d heard the reports from Frey.

“I need some gear, and I need a communication device that can patch into Satyr channels. Oh and some transportation to get me down to the Patrol HQ.”

“You’ll have more than that if you need. I’ll tell my Chief of Security to assemble a team to-“

“No! No team.” Vincent stressed. The Satyr were hunting the other human. While Mach’s were likely good guys Vincent had come across far too many bad ones already. He wasn’t ready to trust them as a species just yet. Blind loyalty didn’t sit well with him. “I have to do this alone.”

“Very well. Can you tell me why not?”

“I think the Satyr working for the Wardens are hunting another of my kind near the bottom of the city. If I take yours it can get very confusing. And since they bombed the checkpoint and we have no idea when the lifts will be open again-“ 

It was Mach’s turn to cut Vincent off. “They’re already open. That’s the only public access between Sector 1 and 2, the explosive didn’t damage the lifts. It’s been several hours. Of course it’s open again.”

“Oh.” That was actually very efficient of them but it made sense. “Alright well then I need to do some hunting.” He got up off the side of the table that wasn’t covered in blood puke. Then he paused and looked at the academics as he remembered something he wanted to ask. “Can you guys see my dreams?”

The stone face was recovered now but a lighter stone color than before. “Oh… please don’t talk about your dreams right now…”

He looked confused as Zurni spoke up. “Even I think they’re disturbing. You only catch glimpses at times. A blurry image or far away sound. In general I would agree that they distress those who watch. So we skip them. Or dare interns and grad students to watch one of your full night’s rest. Few make it.”

“Don’t even joke about that.” The stone faced said. “I hope you don’t make them watch when the figure appears.”

“The figure?” Vincent asked.

“There’s what looks to be your skeleton in a black robe with some sort of bladed weapon. It stares directly at the screen. Or… the black where the eyes should be does.” Zurni said and shrugged but Vincent could see the stone face shudder.

“No. You might think that’s black but it’s beyond that. Those are voids of darkness that can’t be fully described by the words of mortals. Within them lies something deeper… the knowledge that no matter how hard you try nothing will spare you from just ever watchful judgment. That he will be there in the end. Your end.” Her final words a whisper. “To weigh your soul on the scales.” 

Everyone on the room was staring at the stone faced academic now as she looked off at nothing. Finally Vincent broke the silence. “Someone find a way to get me a picture of that figure. I might want it soon. But for now I need to go hunting.”

I was contacted by a startup in San Jose sometime in late Feb/early March and they said they would be able to offer me a position as an intern there during this summer. I accepted the offer and stopped looking and interviewing for other companies. Their head engineer told me they needed time to design an internship program since they're fairly new to this whole intern thing and told me he would get back to me within a week let me know specifically what I'd be doing and the specific dates of the internship and compensation for me. 

It's been almost a month and I didn't hear back from them so I emailed the head software engineer to see what's up so I can start looking for housing. Today he called me to ""discuss some potential projects I could work on"" and basically went through the 2 options they had to offer and then told me that it probably won't suit me and said to contact them in a month or two for new intern positions that could open up.

Now I have nothing to do during the summer and I don't know where to even apply for internships because everything is pretty much filled. I know how important having an internship this summer is and I'm scared because all my friends already have internships. What do I do? "

Any tips for a high school senior?,MEGAPONY,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/30kxln/what_do_you_know_now_that_you_wish_you_knew_when/,"Hi everyone, I'm a current high school senior who's planning on going to UCSC. 

I don't know the exact path I want to go down yet but I want to find a start up company in the future.

I don't want to be the ""technical"" guy who does all the coding and developing but rather more of a ""hustler"" who has the idea and manages sales, marketing, company management.

However, I still want a technical background because I feel like tech skills are valuable no matter your position.

Therefore, I'm deciding between

Computer Science: http://registrar.ucsc.edu/catalog/programs-courses/program-statements/cmps.html

Technology &amp; Information Management: http://registrar.ucsc.edu/catalog/programs-courses/program-statements/tim.html

Which major do you guys think will better suit my career goals?

As for planning ahead, what I'm thinking is to do well in my classes, network network network, get internships, then work at a  VC company upon graduation to gain experience. What do you guys think? Any advice?

Sorry if I seem naive, I currently have zero background in technology so I might be using the wrong terms and whatnot.

Thank you!

For clarity, the first job listed is a small LLC of 5 people, and we don't have an office or anything. I'm the sole developer right now, working on an iPhone app. The second job listed is just me taking care of the web presence of a family business. Should I change any of that to offer more clarity? Or be more brief?

One other question I have is, should I emphasize personal projects more? My personal website and github account contain a few more projects not mentioned in the resume, though I don't have anything super interesting. The best thing I could mention is a small app I have currently on the App Store.

I applied for lots of different internship programs over the last few months, but only got one phone interview, which didn't pan out.

I understand this isn't uncommon as a freshman, but it's still quite discouraging, as I attend a well-known university for CS and I know of many other freshmen who were able to get internships at well-known companies for the summer, with very similar levels of experience as I have. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I just don't want to be put at a disadvantage for further internships in the next few years and for full-time jobs down the line by not having an internship after my freshman year.

I applied to a few local companies recently to see if they're interested in summer interns, but assuming that doesn't pan out, what are your recommendations for productive ways to spend my summer at home? I'll likely try to work on a longer-form personal project, as that's something I feel my resume is lacking, but I wonder if there's a particular skill-set or type of project that would prove useful in my career down the line.

I have a high GPA, leadership experience, co-op &amp; internship, but want to stand apart from the competition with an actual PLC related side project. 

I am just finishing up a side project that is basically balancing a metal ball on a plane. The plane is a resistive touch screen which measures the position of the ball, feeds the position error to an Arduino which does the PID calcultions, and sends signals to motors which manipulate the angle of the touch screen to keep the ball centered. 

This has been a great project and I've learned a lot, but I also want some experience with PLCs since that is what is used in industry. Any tips on how/where I can get a cheap PLC + software combo would be great. Also any ideas for a good beginner PLC project would be awesome as well. I was thinking about trying to replace the Arduino in my current project with a PLC to do the controls logic. Does this seem doable?

So a little background: my parents are FOB immigrants who knew nothing about American culture. Because of this, they sheltered me for my entire life. This has negatively effected me. They would never let me hang out with friends because they said I can see them at school. Eventually, I got used to not going out. That was grade-middle school. Now we fast forward to high school and my classmates really started drinking and partying with girls. Once again, my parents would never let me go out. I was never comfortable with talking to girls or with drinking alcohol. I didn't go to my prom because I was so indoctrinated with not going out. I became comfortable being with myself to a fault. Add this to my parents not letting me play sports because they felt education was the most important thing so I never gained confidence in myself.

Now let's talk about college. I did not even want to go. The only school I got accepted to was a notorious party school. I really did not want to go but my parents basically forced me. I was content with working construction but my naive FOB parents didn't understand that school isn't a guarantee to anything. So I'm embarrassed to say this but I cried before packing. I was not comfortable with alcohol, girls, and I was also made fun of because of how I looked and I was tremendously insecure about it. I wasn't bullied, but I got clowned on a lot because people said I looked like a certain celebrity and they didn't mean it as a compliment. 

First day of school I already feel incredibly sad. Most freshman go through this but it was such a bad feeling in my stomach. My roomate asked me to go out and watch some sort of bonfire thing but I didn't want to. I wanted to cry when I went to bed. I know you guys are probably gonna think I'm whiny, maybe. But I am not a cryer, not at all. It takes A LOT for me to cry. I'm just trying to let you get a sense of the distress I was feeling. 

I thought maybe I could reinvent myself in college. For the first couple of days I felt alright because I hung out with some friends from high school. However, I noticed that they would never text me with plans. I thought maybe they weren't doing anything until I saw them on facebook taking pictures together having fun hanging with girls. Maybe I just oozed lameness even though I tried to mask it. I wanted my best friend to come to school with me. I'm sure things would have been different because he was my right hand man. While walking to class I heard a girl make fun of me the same way I used to get made fun of in high school. That was it. Nothing has changed. First I was lonely, now I'd have to withstand ridicule and accept the fact that girls wouldn't want to be with ""that guy who looks like ______"". Since then I went to class then went back to my room. My roomate would ask me if I wanted to go out and drank, but I always said no...pathetic.

My grades suffered and I almost failed out my first semester. Eventually I turned things around academically. My grades are the only good thing I accomplished in college. These 4 years I've probably gone out to party 4 times. Every time something negative has happened that further crushed my confidence. My computer was the only safe haven I had. I never got out of my comfort zone and I'm dying for it.

Graduation is coming up and I cannot stop thinking about how I've done absolutely nothing these 4 years. I've made maybe 10 friends in total and I only talk to 2 of them regularly. I have no real memories. I didn't have any confidence in myself to join any clubs, frats, sports teams, nothing. Even when once in a blue moon a girl *gasp* WAS attracted to me, I didn't pursue because I had no experience and was a scared punk. I didn't even get any internships which will make my degree useless because all jobs require experience now. No such thing as entry level. I'm 21 now and I've wasted my youth basically. You're gonna say ""you're still young!"" blah blah blah but I really wasted everything. I have nothing to look forward to. I'm sure my family will be better off without me. My brother and sister will be successful while I'm stuck being the black sheep. I'm not having that. I'd rather die.

Thanks for reading.

I began by being self-taught, but I have since taken a number of courses that have taught me the finer points of programming. My focus in college is Computer Engineering right now, and I'm about a year from graduating, since I spent a year on co-op with a large software/hardware company. I am currently located in the south, but I'm willing to move almost anywhere in the United States for a summer internship, if the right offer presents itself. I'm particularly interested in Seattle, Phoenix, or somewhere near or on the Rocky Mountains, but I'm flexible on location.

When I say that I am a self-taught programmer, I don't just mean that I learned how to write ""Hello, world!"" in a few different languages. Once I began teaching myself programming, it consumed almost all of my free time for years afterwards, as I quickly discovered that I had a natural aptitude for it. I wrote a small IDE for JASS (the Warcraft III scripting language) over the course of about a week, a few months after I began programming. That IDE had syntax highlighting, a properties box like Visual Studio uses when you click on a GUI element which allowed you to modify properties of the code you were editing (like setting a function private or public), which involved the IDE having to understand the code it was seeing (to populate the box) and the IDE being able to edit the code on its own when items in the box changed. Even more interesting, it had a transpiler that took JASS and converted it into compliant C# and ran it through the C# compiler. That was nearly 10 years ago now; it feels so long ago.

Last night, I wrote a WS2812 smart RGB LED driver for an STM32 Nucleo that I had laying around over the course of about 3 hours, since all of the existing drivers I could find weren't very attractive options and I wanted to learn more about it. (Being able to succeed in so little time relied heavily on the Saleae digital logic analyzer that I have laying around; WS2812 has an almost annoyingly timing specific protocol.)

I have written apps for iOS and Android, desktop applications for Windows, Mac, and Linux, lots of command line tools for Linux, and I've even written and debugged Linux kernel modules before. I've made websites with PHP and Node.js backends, while hand-crafting the HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. I've written embedded code for several different microcontrollers, ported existing code from Arduino to NXP's LPC812 MCU, used peripherals, but most importantly for embedded development, I've learned to skim 1000+ page reference manuals for microcontrollers and other pieces of hardware, and to be able to execute on that knowledge. I've even done ladder logic on Allen-Bradley PLCs. I've used dozens of programming languages for these tasks and I'm constantly on the look out for new stuff. I can't wait until Rust hits 1.0 final, which shouldn't be long at all now.

I know it's perhaps a bit late to be looking for an internship, but please PM me if you have something. As long as I can stream Pandora to my headphones in an isolated place to write code, I believe I can write quality code to meet your needs, although I did spend a couple months of my co-op largely doing pair programming, and that was both pleasant and productive.

If you might have an internship available and you think I might be a potential candidate, PM me and we can discuss the finer details then."
30odr1,5,2015-03-29,I'm not doing so great right now. Can I still manage to eventually find a job or internship? Or have a part-time internship during the semester?,floatingplasticbag,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30odr1/im_not_doing_so_great_right_now_can_i_still/,"I mean, if I go by all of the other posts with low GPA job seekers it doesn't look like I'll *never* find a programming job, but I'm still worried if I'm capable. Part of my issue is lack of perspective and too high of a standard for myself.

Sometime last year I finally came to terms with the fact that, yes, I have clinical depression, and, yes, I need to get it treated and manageable asap so I can be a productive member of society. My denial and irresponsible choices lead me here today with a 2.47 GPA and a horrible transcript. I'm basically a senior, but I really don't think I should focus on doing 12-15 hours of classes every semester while trying to treat the issues that get exasperated just by being in school, so I'm planning on going part-time until I graduate. That'll probably take me another a year and a half. What sucks is the fact that I basically started school about 6 years ago (during which I briefly changed majors, medically withdrew twice, and took a semester off to work at a fast food place), so that's a little demoralizing. It'll give me much more time to manage my depression, though.

ANYWAY, I was wondering how likely it is to get a part-time internship during the semester? I don't have any personal projects right now, but I've been going through coding exercises in java as a referesher since lately I've been using C in my classes. I was thinking about making a website to use it as a portfolio for my artwork (my number one hobby and spending money creator, so it'll actually be useful), but is that a decent personal project? I don't really want to go into web dev though. I'm just kind of neutral. I was going to use this summer to solely work on my coding skills, but after seeing somewhere that it isn't too late to apply to internships I'm just going to throw my resume everywhere and hope for the best. Might as well? Unsurprisingly, I'm really unconfident right now. I was going to apply to retail positions, and then I thought that might be a waste of time when I could do tech-related stuff.

For more info, I'm at a top 10 school and live in a tech city. I'm bound to get hired if I keep trying, right? Maybe?

tl;dr: I have a crappy GPA and I'm going to school part-time until I graduate in order to wrangle in my health issues. Is it feasable find a part-time internship, or should I use the extra time for other things? Or both?"
30og8r,72,2015-03-29,TIFU by increasing factory tension between workers and management.,A_Cave_Man,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/30og8r/tifu_by_increasing_factory_tension_between/,"I am working as an engineering intern for a large skid-steer company.  The factory I work in is actually split into 2 section, the main factory contains all welding, painting and assembly.  The other half of our factory is called 'The Farm' and it is legitimetly a farm.  The farmer originally designed a new skid-steer attachment and started producing them in his barn, this kept growing and growing until he had a sizeable company going on.  Anywho, the farm is a very haphazardly assembled area, where the operators have very little contact with the engineering/management department.

They also carry a strong resentment for engineers.  When our company purchased the attachment company, the first thing they did was to automate nearly all of the cutting steps, removing a lot of the farms positions.  They also updated a good portion of the SOP's to improve throughput, with little if any buy in from the operators.

Fast forward to inventory day, everyone from the plant manager down to the paint operator helps out with inventory.  I check the list to see what section I'm in, and to my terror, I spot my name on the farm list.  My stomache drops as I realize I'm going to be overseeing the back-country, dip chewing, 5-tooth having, farm boys.  This is going to go over just dandy, with my short stature, pearly white teeth, and clean-shaven baby face.

I arrive at the farm piloting one of the companies ridiculous F-250's with the extra extra long box on it.  I hop out semi-gracefully falling/landing in the deep mud that serves as the substrate for 'The Farm'.  I can feel every eye around my glaring at me, I look up and verify this feeling with the exception of the very friendly ex-meth addict gal who has previously decided we are great friends.

Things are actually going quite well as I do my best to be relateable to the farm employees. I'm busting my ass to identify parts that were lying around, entering part counts, and clambering around the extensive racking of parts.  Finally, I can hold in my piss no more, Methy (who hasn't stopped talking or left my side) kindly points me to the gentleman's facilities.

I walk in expecting the typical restroom, but instead I find a room befitting the next SAW movie.  I stumble across the bumpy dirt floor as my eyes slowly adjust to the poorly lit room.  I first make out a large round trough in the center of the room.  Surely there has to be more in here. My eyes follow the grizzled and graffiti'd wall until they spot a few dilapitated sinks accompanied by the hand dryers where the cloth just spins around in circles.  The cloth on these is nearly as dirty and dark as the muddy floor beneath them.  I guess I'll just skip the hand washing.  There is also a few stalls in this room, but they're about on par with the rest of the room.  The type of stall you'd expect to find at a rundown Tijuanan biker's bar after a week-long chilli cook off.  

Luckily the room is empty barring myself.  I whip out my little smokey, and begin making my deposit.  Pushing with every muscle near my bladder in hopes of finishing this process before some grizzled shop worker joins me, making eye contact would be nearly impossible due to the circular configuration of the urinal.  Door #2 opens, and in walks heavily bearded, beer bellied Farmer Brown.  He looks at me, shakes his head, and mumbles something under his breath.  

""Fucking Engineers"" yup, Farmer Brown is a fan of me.  I quickly finish and decide to exit through the 2nd door mostly out of curiuosity as to where in this maze this door leads to.  I swing open the massive door as it groans like a blue whale in heat.  To my puzzlement, I am not back in the factory, instead I'm in another bathroom, this one has a cement floors and a wall lined with urinals.  This is when the realization slaps me like a 16"" dildo to the face.... I just urinated in the factory guy's hand washing sink.

**TL;DR:** 
* **1) Senior Undergrad (me) at University of Y experiences violent death of close friend that was planning to attend the same grad schools if accepted.** 
* **2) I have to make a hasty decision about where to go for grad school, traumatized and depressed, turned down University of Y offer, goes with University of X (unfunded) because I didn't want to be at the same university where my friend died or where we were planning to go together.**
* **3)Rough transition to University of X. Forced to drop a class, had to TA a class I never took (but tuition paid for semester), no time in lab to practice/observe. PI is not the greatest with communication. Onset of deeper levels of depression. Living is comfortable/secure, but really expensive.**
* **4)2nd semester: Seeing counselor for mental health, more depression. Feel like I'm getting nowhere with research. PI informs me that I won't graduate within 2 years (didn't get objectives until now). Research seems borderline PhD (I'm an MS student).**
* **5) I want to transfer/apply for grad school at my Alma Mater because I have a support system there. Parents not that supportive of this idea. **
* **6) Opinions needed; how does a transfer look to industry? Are these circumstances reasonable for considering transfer? Not planning on PhD, just MS. **

Looking for opinions to see if the norm of grad school mental misery is unique in my case....

* As a senior undergrad last year at University of Y (2014), I was in the process of applying to different grad schools. My intention was to follow a close friend of mine to whichever school we were both accepted to. However, my close friend was killed in a senseless act of violence, and this completely fucked up (excuse my french) my decision-making process. I had to make my decision about grad school within 2 - 3 months after the tragedy, and I simply wanted to get away from the universities that my friend and I both applied to that reminded me of the tragedy. I was left with University of X, with no funding for research, but outlets to release stress, my sibling attends there for undergrad, and it's an easier drive home. I made a hasty decision, clouded by depression and trauma.

* 1st semester at University of X: Even with the stress outlet that I enjoy so much, I had a very rough transition. I was forced to drop a course due to irrelevancy and difficulty, I had to TA an undergrad course that I had never taken (equivalent at Alma Mater, but still had to do the labs each week before teaching them), and I couldn't find alot of time to get into the lab. I live in a nice place, but it is super expensive for quality and secure living in this area. Also during this first semester, another traumatic event occurs related to the tragedy experienced during my senior year, and I'm plunged into another level of depression. One upside: obtained a summer internship in industry with a very well known company.

* 2nd semester: Able to get into the lab, excited about potential areas of research, but have a full load of time-consuming courses. Memorial of my close friend's death occurs starting the 2nd semester, another level of depression again. I learn that my PI doesn't have a good sense of time, and have no idea what my research will be. Shame on me for going in unfunded - there's no grant to push me/PI along on a timeline. I did professionally address the trauma I've been through, and my PI is very understanding of it. They are nice, but they are also going on sabbatical for a year starting next year. I get to meet with them on Fridays during sabbatical, and I'm not super dependent on them anyway, but I am still hesitant about how things will work.

* Self-help: Seeing a counselor for depression, but limited on visits (this is different than my Alma Mater, where I could have weekly appointments). I have tried to reach out to those in my stress relief involvement, but it's hard when I don't have much time to get to know them. The people in my lab are nice, I'm starting to get to know them better, but I don't do anything outside of the lab for fun because I don't have time (and neither do they). I refuse to go on psychological medication, since this influenced/led to the death of my close friend. 

*Re-occurring thought: I want to go back to my Alma Mater for graduate school. 
My support system is there, not only friends, but also my religious life support system. Campus is smaller, living is less expensive, and I know the faculty well in the department. Research/funding would be guaranteed, since students are not accepted unless funding is available (assuming I would be accepted). Some credits may transfer, obviously would have to start over on research.

* Opinions wanted: Are these signs that I should transfer for the sake of my mental health as well as my piggy bank? How does transferring look on paper? I plan to go into industry right after my MS. and I don't know how a transfer would look to professionals in industry. I try to keep personal and professional life separate, but they are collapsing on each other with negative effects. Honest opinions, please! No sugar-coating. Thank you!

I am a second year Computer Science student currently looked for an internship for my third year of study. 

I received an email a few days ago stating that I had been shortlisted for a paid position interview in my own university's IT sector, none of my friends on my course that applied for the position have had a response yet so I'm feeling optimistic.

However,  the email noted that I should prepare at least one question to ask the interviewer at the end of the interview, the question should be about how I can benefit the university instead of how they can help me. 

I feel like I meet all their essential factors and a good few of their desirable factors listed on the job description -- but I'm really racking my brain over what to ask them, I can't think of anything! Any suggestions?

This year I already tried applying to four schools: Georgia tech, Cornell, Brown and UCSD, all for subjects of this type. However I got turned down from Brown and haven't heard anything from the others, and it's been over 2 months since I applied.

I believe it's unlikely I'll get offers from any of them. Whilst my grades are OK, (average 68, so GPA of ~3.6) I have very little knowledge of computer science and little programming experience because of my physics background. I have used python and am familiar with object oriented programming but that's about it. The only internship I've done was in physics research with little technical exposure. The academics I go to for references are physicists and only know about my ability concerned with physics.

I'd like to try applying again, this time to more schools. But how can I make my application more convincing with so little experience in computer science? (Honestly I'm really more interested in computational methods within science and engineering, but find it hard to find courses like this). I want to get a 6 month or year long internship in this field to make me more convincing, but again landing an internship like this is hard for a physics student.

Sorry this is so long. I'd really appreciate any advice, no professor I know is really familiar with this and I feel like there isn't much guidance out there. I think I made a mistake applying to courses I clearly didn't have a chance with and I really don't want to make that mistake again. Please help!"

So far I got into University of Illinois @ Urbana-Champaign (Mathematics and Computer Science joint major) with no financial aid/scholarships and I'd have to pay about 49k to attend it per year. I also got into the Computer Science program at NYU Polytechnic school of engineering (I might want to transfer to the one in the college of arts and sciences because of the location) with a 22k scholarship so it comes down from 63k to about 41k per year.

So the dilemma is that UIUC is a better school for computer science at least than NYU. UIUC also has a huge greek scene and it's a pretty good party school, something that I look forward to. The college town is good, and the campus looks pretty good (I haven't visited, can't really visit). It's also kind of far from NY, which is great, I wasn't really planning on staying in-state. I originally planned to go out of state and away from home.  I'm going to go based on assumptions here since I don't really know that much about the location but as far as I know there isn't that much of an exciting start-up culture near UIUC and it'd be hard to find internships and I'd get bored during the summer.

The thing about NYU is that it's in NYC. There's SO MUCH TO DO in NYC. I'll never be bored and because of the start-up culture, I'm sure they'll be ample opportunities for me to do something during the summer, possibly find an internship too. NYU is also 8K cheaper, for me at least, than UIUC. The cost difference isn't that much of an issue, but I'm just worried that since I'll be in NYC, everything will be expensive. There'll also be more opportunities for networking and I'll be at the heart of everything. Also I plan to minor in finance or economics (I'm thinking of pursing comp sci in the financial sector, so being in NYC helps even more) and since NYU has a good business school, I feel like I'll be getting more bang for my buck. I'm also concerned if there's a big social/party scene in NYU, haven't really heard much about it. Another concern is that I kinda like nature-y stuff. Going on hikes/exploring. I'm wondering if I'll find opportunities to do that in NYC or nearby areas?
 
I'm going to visit NYU sometime this weekend. Unfortunately I probably won't get the opportunity to check out UIUC's campus, but I've heard nothing but good things about it.

I'd appreciate it if any of you could shed some light on any of my concerns or misconceptions or just offer some advice in general to make this decision easier on me.

I attended an event last month, and met the CEO of a local startup. He seemed to like me, gave me his email, and encouraged me to email him about an internship position for the summer. So I did, and he cc'd a recruiter who set up an on-site interview. I did well on the technical questions, was personable, and got alone well with the interviewer. He concluded the interview with 'You did very well. I like you, the 'CEO name' really likes you, we'll be in touch.'

4 days later I got an email saying it wouldn't work out. I asked for feedback and received no reply. (Originally everyone was answering me immediately) I did a bit more investigation and found out the son of one of my professors works at this company in an upper-ish role. I'm confident my professor told his son about my performance. I didn't do that well in his class, and I really don't think this professor liked me. 

Is it common for professors to advice on hiring decisions in this way? Is it ethical? Is it even allowed? This professor is also in charge of the CS curriculum, and as graduation is looming (next year) I will surely need to speak with him at some point, but I really, really, don't want anything to do with this guy anymore. I don't think it was fair of him to speak ill of me, as his class was the only one I under performed. Does anyone have any thoughts on this ?

tldr; met CEO of company, got along great. he set up an interview, went great. Found out son of professor whose class I did really bad in works at this company. I'm sure the professor advised against hiring me. Now they won't even follow up with feedback."

I wish to ask about the flexibility of focuses, specifically which would leave one most prepared to pursue employment upon graduation. Additionally, while known for being a tech filled area, are the available internship opportunities in Irvine open to student's who have yet to graduate, allowing for such opportunities in the summer, or is there a tendency to require until the end of senior year?

Furthermore, a significant issue brought up is the shift from a Java based program to a curriculum centered around Python for core classes in recent years. Has this shift improved the preparation of students entering the work force? And are there any upcoming changes in the curriculum that will aid in filling in previously empty gaps in necessary knowledge (multi-threading / database management ) ?

Having a chance to hear responses from current students and their experiences in recent years attending and studying CS would be invaluable in making my decision to attend next year. "

""An Ever-Growing Galaxy needs an Ever-Growing Workforce!"" was the motto of the Solartarian Mining Corporation. They were given exclusive contracts by the Council to do mine in the Western Spiral Arm... if, in exchange they provided ""equal opportunities"" for every Council species that applied for a job.  Why the SMC  had forced Prawn to work with weakskins like the intern who summoned him TO HIS OWN BRIDGE was beyond his comprehension. Always whining about the gravity, the heat, the lack of oxygen, or nitrogen... so... meek, it made him physically sick. 
As the little Cenalite began to open its mouth, Prawn suddenly shifted two of his compound eye stalks to the sector number on the holoboard- Sector 047. 
Prawn suddenly tensed, as a distant memory stirred in his spinal brain, and a thought snaked his way to his mandibles. Something about that sector... was it a biological weapons dumping ground? A sanctuary? He couldn't recall. 
""Is that a notification from... Sector 047?"" Prawn asked, in a tone similar to the coldness of deep space. 

The intern swallowed its fear, and raised a head to glare at Prawn and his six different compound eyes. 
""Why... yes... sir. One of our mining ships went down in the area after making... erm... well... contact."" 
Prawn showed no emotion. 
""S-s-sir...?"" 
""Continue... Intern."" Prawn growled, his mandibles clicking slowly together. ""What exactly... Happened, to our ship?"" 

The Intern collected itself, and continued. 
""Well, our mining ship arrived in the area, and followed standard galactic procedure by stationing itself in high orbit for 2 Galactic Standard Rotations, as per my calculations and orders. Like you asked me to carry out. I... well...may have miscalculated, because that's when they hit the satellite."" 

Prawn's antennae twitched. 
""A... satellite? The planet's abandoned- we use it as a chemical waste depository! IT's just reaching the point where we can harvest the bacteria for energy, isn't it?  Did it his a small meteorite, or their moon, or..?"" 

The Intern suddenly grew very, very worried, and started to exhume its fear pheromones. Since Solartarians have no sense of smell, this did nothing but anger the rest of the decks crewmen.

""N...no, sir. IT was a satellite, containing manufactured metals, high traces of silicon computers and... living... things. From an exceedingly bountiful planet below.""
Getting no response but the same emotionless glare from Prawn, the Intern continued. 
""Our last probe's data is extremely outdated, according to the mining crew's report. It turns out that our probe recorded data in the interior of only ONE of the planets continents- and an entire civilization has sprung up in less than... well, 5,000 years, sir!"" 
The Intern stopped, and anticipated a response from his superior. 
Still, Prawn gave no response. 
The Intern cleared his throat, growing ever more nervous. 
""This... new civilization is advancing far faster than any of our neighbors, or any species, for that matter! After scanning some of their global communications network, they've actually gone from powered flight to space travel in... in less than 100 of their years!"" 
Prawn suddenly interjected, but only moved his mandibles in response to the Intern's fact. 
""What... kind of space travel?"" He rasped. 
""Rudimentary, of course. Nothing outside of their own solar system, save for a small probe. The crew thought it belonged to sentient creatures in the system's Gas Giant, but... they found nothing."" 
Prawn gave the closest Solartarian equivalent of a smile to the Intern, and said, ""Then it's settled. Order the crew to initiate orbital strike protocols, and bury the civilization. They obviously can't shoot down our craft, and even a few hundred of our soldiers armed with our bioweapons should be enough to take their largest cit-"" 
""Actually, sir, the signal sent from the mining ship was a distress call."" The intern interrupted... nervously. 
Prawn suddenly shifted his whole body, arching to his full height to eclipse the small creature. 
""Excuse. Me?"" He nearly whispered, with a tone that could frighten an entire army into committing mass suicide (Which Prawn had actually accomplished twice before) 
""Well... Sir... it turns out that... that... the creatures, called ""Humans"" are actually resistant to all of our biological weapons. Because... we used the planet as a biological weapons dumping ground. Their plagues called 'Black Death,' 'Influenza,' and 'SARS'  have all come close to destroying them but... But  they failed. Miserably, actually. It strengthened their immune systems, and... well... they killed any of our ground crews who tried to land."" 
""KILLED? With WHAT, exactly? Our personal shields are impenetrable! How did they...?"" 
The Intern continued, answering Prawn's question with a shaking-so-furiously-that-he-could-barely-pronounce-his-words-sort-of-tone ""With... kinetic weapons, sir. Pieces of lead fired by expanding gas from metal and plastic barrels. They tore our ground crews to shreds. What's more, they're... poisonous. Some of our grounds crews died from just TOUCHING them, since most of them are COVERED with our own biological weapons residuce! And... they brought down the scout ship."" 
Prawn nearly feinted. ""They... what?""
The Intern continued. ""They brought down the scout ship with... nuclear weaponry. The weapons only brought down the shields, of course, but they've been perfecting these systems for almost a hundred years for passing into high orbit... and... they brought it down.... mostly... intact. That's how we were able to receive the  the message in the first place.""
Prawn started to rub his eyes with two of his legs. ""This can't be happening... this can't be happening... this can't be happening..."" Prawn gave the Intern one last desperate glance, and uttered in near hysteria, ""Was the message at least on a private frequency?"" 
The Intern sighed, and with dismay and regret, replied, ""No, sir. It was a public broadcast.""
Prawn collapsed to the floor, almost in the Solartarian-equivalent  tears, and bawled, 
""You're telling me that these... these overly-violent 'humans', have managed to not only massacre an entire scouting ship of miners and some of our finest mercenaries, but are also resistant to almost all of our weapons and diseases, are poisonous upon contact by any of our personnel, and to top it off, they now have a WARP DRIVE!?"" 
The Intern quickly interjected, stating, ""And now the Galactic Council knows we've been praying on pre-warp civilizations and weapon deposal sites for easy mining operations. Would you... like a drink, si-""
The Intern was cut short as Prawn quickly and effortlessly separated his torso and legs from each other, spilling blood all over his bridge. 
""You. Other intern."" 
A small Zephron stepped forward, just out of reach of Prawn. 
""Y-y-yes, sir?"" He asked, nervously. 
""Draft my letter of resignation. Send it to my chamber terminal. I'll be busy preparing my last Will and Testament.""  
As Prawn stormed out off of his bridge, he muttered to himself, 
""I do despise interns."" 


On another note, the last intern, (who rose the rank of Captain of a mining vessel shortly afterwards) Thraldin of Zephron had often wished he had taken Prawn's lead after the first reports of Humanity's bold steps onto the Galactic Stage started to filter in through the galactic networks several months later. 
As he sat in his office, listening to one of his interns read off the last stock reports of that day while the Human Standard Starship ""Washington"" bombarded his home planet, he couldn't help but mutter to himself, 
""I do despise interns.""

30ri6c,1,2015-03-29,Job advice,JimbeanMan77,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/30ri6c/job_advice/,"Hey everyone I need some advice concerning a job decision.  Some background, I am currently a Junior majoring in electrical engineering with a GPA around 2.60 at a pretty good engineering school. I was somehow able to get a good internship that started this semester until the end of the summer.  They offered me a job in the future, but I would need to accept now.  The pay is good, but it is not where I would like to live or work.  

My question is, with such a crappy GPA is it wise to just take the first job offered to me, or tell them no and risk it at job fare next year?  Thank you for any advice.

I'm currently on the search for a room for the summer in U-District as I'll be doing an internship in your lovely city.

The problem is that I'd like my lease to start on June 1, whereas everything on padmapper is usually mid-June when the quarter ends. What should I do/where should I look? Is this the right time to start looking?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

30sd2e,6,2015-03-30,Someone To Watch Over Me,QuothTheRaven_,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/30sd2e/someone_to_watch_over_me/,"**Here's the deal, I found this laptop and a small statue of a dog in a box in the elevator of my apartment complex. The other night the power was out for the whole building, and a few days ago once the power was restored and the elevators were back up and running I called it up and low and behold as I walked in to the elevator this box with a laptop and this dog statue was sitting in the far right corner. The box was labeled, """"junk, do not return to owner"""". I took the laptop and box with me to my car and later when I got home I opened the laptop and running was a notepad software already open and with the following written in it**
                   
- Hello me, I’m just going to be writing this little journal here on the laptop so I don’t get bored, I like to write and I figure if I type down my thoughts and stuff it’ll help me feel less lonely and give me something to do.
    
- I’m awake now yet somehow the sky outside is dark again. For the past few days I have been exhausted due to finals week at school, but now it is summer and I look forward to resting. I have no classes and did not get an internship like I had hoped so I am stuck home for most of this summer. This past semester left me exhausted and on the last day of finals I came straight to my apartment and collapsed on my bed only to wake up at 11 at night, I’m up now browsing the web reading articles and playing little games, the night sky looks quite peaceful from my window but I feel a bit lonely now that the semester is over. I have a very small amount of friends because I like to keep my circle small. I have 2 good friends and that’s it, the only problem is that they are out of town back home to their home towns up north while I am stuck here alone.
    
- I am writing this because I am lonely, I just need to type to myself to get out all these thoughts swirling in my head, I woke up around 11 P.M. so I stayed up until now, it just turned 3 A.M. I made some ramen noodles and now I’m just staring out my window into the dark sky. I wish I had cable but I cut back on things like cable and eating out to save money. My apartment has a Wi-Fi hotspot for its residents to use so that’s cool. I’m going to just watch a movie online or something, I don’t even know if I should sleep again or wait until it is night time. The dark sky still makes it seem like night but it’s just very early in the morning.

- Well, I stayed up until almost 5:00 in the morning and fell asleep, I woke up today at 2:00 in the afternoon to a rainy day. I’m staying in today, it’s pouring out and the lightning is bright and frequent. As I ‘m sitting here at my computer the lightning flashing from outside made something in my peripheral noticeable. To my left as I type this there sits a statue of a brown dog with big round black eyes, I forgot I even had this statue until the lightning lit up its eyes making it very noticeable. This statue is a small little piggy bank, shaped like a dog. Oh yes I remember now, it was given to me by my mother and once belonged to my grandfather. The dog sat with its head tilted giving off the creepiest sad puppy dog look I have ever seen, and its eyes were indeed lifeless and a bit disturbing. I’m trying to ignore that it is even here but those big black lifeless eyes are hard to ignore, I feel a bit bad that those eyes were the only pair of eyes besides my own that I have seen since classes ended.
    
- I feel kind of strange, my body aches and I have the chills, I believe I am about to become sick with the flu or something, I really hate being sick, I wanted to get out tomorrow but I feel terrible. I’m also starting to feel even lonelier, I might call my friends later to see what their up to, but for now I’m just going to lay down. I’m up again and again staring at me from my left is this dog statue. I still feel sick and it’s now 12: 26 midnight. I hate waking up to the dark sky, it feels…wrong. I keep looking up over at this statue and hoping it won’t be staring at me anymore, it is watching me intently as if saying to me “I am here if no one else is.” The more I think about it, I have spent more time with this statue, fixed in its gaze more than I have with my own friends throughout the year because of how much I stay home rather than go out. I still feel sick and I could really use some company, this dog statue isn’t really doing it for me.
    
- I fell asleep in my chair and woke up with this throbbing headache and the power being out, it is 2 a.m. and I feel tired and sick, but most of all I feel lonely. The power is out but my laptop still has a good amount of battery power. I hear faint music from the other side of my wall. There is a really old lady who lives in the apartment next to mine who loves to play these old records on her record player. She is playing a weird old song, I have no idea what the song is called but the dark room and the gleaming eyes of this statue are not a good mix, I need to get out but I feel very sick and have no energy. The song playing through my wall is quite a somber song, I decided to go ask what the name of the song was, mostly because I needed some sort of human attention, ANY human attention, I walked out of my apartment into the dark hallway, it was the first time I have seen the hallway not lit up by lights, it was strange to say the least, it was only lit by the emergency lights above the door leading to the staircase. Anyways, I went and knocked on her door and she answered it seeming both surprised but strangely happy to see someone, I just told her I was checking to see if her power was out to even though I was well aware the whole building or at least this whole floor was without power. After a bit of chit chat I asked her the name of the song playing, she told me it was a song called “Someone to Watch over Me” by- Gertrude Lawrence, and told me it was her mother’s favorite song. She invited me in but I declined citing that I didn’t feel too well and I wanted to go back to my place and lay down. So now I’m sitting here in the dark again with this damn statue staring a hole through me, I’m not going to move it because once I move it, I will have given in to the fact that an inanimate object has spooked me to the point where I think its eyes are actually “watching” me rather than just being a set of fake eyes with no real function. The moment I move that statue is the moment my fears of it become real and it no longer is just a statue, instead it’s something that can cause me to be uneasy, something that can cause me to become frightened.
    
- I fell asleep again but this time in my computer chair, I awoke to the same set of lifeless black eyes staring at me and the sound of a record skipping repeatedly, I’m going to wait about 5 more minutes and if it’s still skipping I’m going to go over and check on the old lady next door to see if everything is ok.
    
- I’m freaked out right now, its 4 A.M. now, last I typed here I said I would wait 5 minutes then go check on the old lady next door. Well 5 minutes went by and I went to go check on her, I went to her door and knocked but there was no answer just a skipping record echoing through the door, feeling as though something were wrong, I decided to try the door and it was unlocked. I looked into the apartment, it was dark with one single candle flickering in the hall way and a skipping record steadily sounding off in the darkness, I walked in and over to the living room area and saw another candle and the silhouette of the old woman sitting in an armchair next to the skipping record. She was sitting straight up in a recliner chair with her arms both resting on the armrests, I could only see her outline and could not make out any other details besides her silhouette in the very dimly lit room. I called out to her and she was unresponsive, I walked up to her and tapped her on the shoulder and realized she was not responding at all no matter how much I tried to get her attention, I rushed over here to my apartment and got my cell phone and called 911, after I called 911 I waited with her in the dark living room. I took the needle off the record to stop it from skipping and sat there alone with her, in the very dimly lit room, I sat for a few minutes then something happened that creeped me out more than I have ever been crept out in my life, the old lady turned her head to her left and said in a voice that I didn’t recognize to be hers and said “Don’t you remember the lonely nights Mortimer?”, after that statement from the calm and deep voice not matching the old ladies voice from when we spoke earlier, the lady’s head turned ever so slowly back straight forward almost mechanically. Miss are you okay I asked, but no response, Miss are you okay I asked again this time placing my hand on hers. Once my hand touched her skin I snapped my hand back because of how ice cold her hand was, I was about to inform her that I called the ambulance to make certain she was okay when I spotted something very unnerving. There sitting on the table next to the record player. Ever so faintly I could now make out the figure to her left, I guess my eyes had adjusted to the dim light of the room enough for me to see it now. This “It” that I could now see was a statue of a brown dog with big black eyes staring at her as she sat in her chair, it was facing her much like the one I owned faced towards me. I thought that this is merely a coincidence that she had the same statue piggy bank of a dog like I have, I even got up and walked over here to my apartment to make sure my statue was still here and sure enough it was and still is. I couldn’t even sit in that living room anymore I stood at the edge of the dim candle lit hallway and waited for the paramedics to arrive, they arrived and after a few cycles of CPR she was pronounced dead at the scene.
    
- As I sit here and type this my own “watchdog” or rather “watching dog” sits to my left burning its lifeless gaze right through me, it is 5 A.M. and still dark out and the power is still down. I can’t believe the old lady is gone, I can’t believe she might have died while I was still in the room with her, I feel strange. Maybe, I could have helped her I don’t know…everything is getting to be a bit too much for me right now. I have so many questions that no one will be able to answer, why did she speak to the statue?? Why did her voice sound so strange? Oh lord, did she really die that moment while I was in there with her??? WHY did she have the same eerie dog statue as I do? This is definitely going to keep me guessing for a long time to come. I still refuse to move my statue, I will not give in to silly irrational fears. If I move it, it wins…However, Just the statement “If I move it, it wins” is a sign I have given in to fear already.
    
- Ok I’m back at it again, I laid down to try to sleep at around 5:15 but was woken up by a strange faint noise from the other side of my wall. The noise turns out to be music, not just any music but the same song from before, the same song the old woman had been listening to before she died. I heard it loud and clear now, it was “Someone to Watch over Me” by- Gertrude Lawrence. I sat up and rolled my eyes at this situation, I’m weird like that, when frightening things happen I kind of get upset that it is happening in the first place, almost like it is an inconvenience to me for something frightening to be happening to me. Then as I turned my head I was frozen stiff, I didn’t want to move because from my bed I could see that dog statue and those big black eyes staring at my computer chair as if it was waiting for me to sit so it could peer straight into my soul like it always does. I finally mustered up the courage to grab my laptop from my desk and bring it to my bed, I’m typing this with that damn dog sitting in its spot while that record plays, well its skipping now and I wish it would stop…Wait it did stop…and now the song is playing again. I’m finished with this journal and I’m getting out of this apartment. I’m done typing and I’m done feeling trapped.
    
- Ok so my getaway plan was foiled, I was walking and something pulled me back, not something physically pulling me back, just something inside me engrained deep into my psyche that told me I just couldn’t go another second without solving this mystery, I had to go into the apartment, I had to try to get some closure and also I had to stop that music from playing, I just had to! I walked over to the old lady’s door, it was surprisingly still unlocked even after the paramedics left. I walked in there and fumbled in the dark and turned off the music. As I was leaving I felt my hand brush the top of something. I adjusted my hands to the object and felt the coarse and hard object between my fingers, I knew it was her dog statue. I don’t know why but I grabbed it and left the old lady’s apartment and came back here to my own apartment. Now I am here with two of those statues. Her statue however was heavier, like it had something in it. I turned the statue upside down and noticed a round metal cap, I guess a place where any money stored in the statue can be retrieved. I popped open the cap and took out an assortment of old coins and a single picture, a picture of a little girl and a woman, and inside was a note that was scribbled frantically on the back of the picture. The note reads, “I need no friends because you watch over me, now and forever I am in your gaze because now and forever your eyes are the only friends for me.” This was strange, I didn’t understand it, I was now compelled to investigate my own statue, now I must admit what I found in that statue was indeed strange to me but not as strange as what I found inside my own statue. Inside my statue was a picture of me when I was about 5 years old, there I sat smiling and happy, and behind me sat the dog statue staring as it always does. I am confused and frightened, I do not know what any of this means and I don’t ever remember this picture being mentioned to me by my mom, this statue that belonged to my grandfather before he passed on has always been in my possession since as long as I could remember. This will be my last post, I’m going to head out, I have to get out of here and away from all the
    
- lo Hello,
    
dabit deus his quoque finem
    
- I am back dear journal and I must say I feel silly for being afraid this entire time. I have no need to be afraid, you see Mortimer is my friend. Mortimer watches over me, his eyes are all the friends I need. I’m going to turn off my computer so I can be alone with Mortimer, he enjoys the dark and I will enjoy it with him. He tells me to find a friend for him, I think I know how to pass on his friendship to the next lucky person...


        
    **Below is a link to a picture of the dog statue I now have, I don't know what to do with this stuff. Is it a joke?, I do remember the ambulance coming to the building and looking out my window to see someone being carted away in a body bag up on a stretcher, I was kinda freaked that someone had died but didn't worry about it too much, I don't know anyone in this building really so the owner of this stuff is unknown to me, This dog statue does give off a strange vibe though...**

30t25t,3,2015-03-30,Late. First Day of Work.,fights4love,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/30t25t/late_first_day_of_work/,"My first day of work as a cable guy and I'm fucking late. Let me explain why.

I live in nyc and usually take the bus/train to work. I recently was hired as a cable guy and the location is sweet. It is only a small bus ride to work. Only 1 hour. Hell, I even have a bike that I can ride to go to work.

It sounds great right? Here I am with a new job and easy commute.  It should be smooth sailing but just one small thing. The bus I take is usually packed and I have to carry my work tools to my locker at the job. Once I bring in my tools however the bus ride/commute should be no problem. 

Instead of fighting on the bus for space with my tool bags I decided to ask my old man for a ride. Just this once I asked him to drop me off at work. I ask him 3 days in advance and remind him the night before.

Morning of my first day on the job I'm excited and eager to go. Wake up early, had breakfeast and all that. But wait a second, it seems my dad has another appointment.  He promised to take my sister to school. My sis is in college and currently doing an unpaid internship at some public school. 

My sister is such a pathetic annoying piece of shit. She is 24 and never had a job. She is fat and lazy and depressed.  Do not get me wrong I'm not hating on depressed people (hell, we all been there) but she feels the need to let everyone know every 5 seconds that  she is depressed. If you offer to help her loose wait she doesn't want your help. She is the type of person who only drinks soda/juice and is constantly eating junk food, yet complains about her weight problem

When I found out that there was a small problem I was still calm and collected. It's no biggie I said. I suggest to my dad the he drops me off first and then drop her off, as I am actually getting paid and want to start off on the right foot. She protest. No biggie, we can drop you off by a bus and you might only be late a few minutes if at all. Apparently this was a problem because the bus did not take her right in front of her school and she did not want to walk.

Now I'm getting pissed. She has a fucking unlimited bus pass and is begging my dad to take her to her internship which is a smaller commute when compared to mine. At this point I know I was going to be late.

Long story short I end up reaching work 40 mind late due to a bunch of bullshit.

This job has a 6 month review for a pay raise. Now I'm here wondering if I will make the cut because of being late 40 minutes on my first fucking day. I was only late 1 time while I was in training by 2 minutes. I figured I can talk my way out of being late for 2 mins but how the hell can I explain being late for the better part of an hour on my first fucking day?

Now I feel like I have to bust my ass even more so to pass the 6 month review. Now I feel depressed.....Fuck."

I graduated back in December as a Finance major with a 3.7+ GPA at a lesser known university in Illinois. I haven't really gained any experience yet. I've only had a couple of interviews for some Financial Analyst intern positions but no offers. I'm currently in grad school to make up for the lost time, but even then it feels like a waste.

The only extracurricular activities that are sort of relevant were that I've been in the university's investment club, and a research project for the CFA Institute. I also was a student tutor for a year.

I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever find anything at this point. I'm up for looking into other options (as long as it's not sales), but could anyone give me some sort of ideas of where to look or how I could build up my experience in the meantime?

Any advice would be appreciated.

30ugy7,1,2015-03-30,Should I do the 5 Year BS/MS in CS at my university?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30ugy7/should_i_do_the_5_year_bsms_in_cs_at_my_university/,"Hi everyone,

I currently attend a 2nd tier UC in California (think UC Davis/Irvine/Santa Barbara), majoring in Computer Engineering. We have a program here where a CE/CS major can do a 5 year BS/MS in Computer Science. I'm currently a 2nd year and to get into the 5 year program, I have to apply next Spring (of my junior year) where I'm evaluated based on my GPA, GRE, letters of recommendation, and essay. 


The average stats to get into our 5 year CS program is a ~3.5 GPA, 162/170 on quantitative (167/170 for those doing the 2 year MS in CS). My GPA is around a 3.1-3.2 currently, and I'm planning on studying for the GRE this quarter (working 40hrs/week at eBay this summer). I'll also need to start to push myself more to increase my GPA as close as possible to 3.5 by next Spring. 

Do you guys think a 5 year BS/MS in CS program would be worth it for me, or should I go into the industry? I've heard an MS will help me get a leg-up in jobs, starting salary, and lateral moves within the company I work at. Also, I've heard having only a BS can bottleneck your salary, particularly in the higher ranges?

 I'm eventually looking to get into management. In fact, I want to try to get a PM internship position next summer. Regardless of the MS in CS, I plan on getting an MBA after working in the industry for 4-6 years. I was thinking of maybe doing the 5 yr program in CS, and then MBA. If I don't get in, just go to industry and do MBA later. Thoughts? "
30uhff,3,2015-03-30,Getting into CS with Econ.,dj_ee3,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/30uhff/getting_into_cs_with_econ/,"Hi guys, 
Here is my story: I am playing with computers since elementary school. Building websites, trying to program, setting up servers and different kinds of hardware/software. When I went to High School I choose it specially to have a signature program with computers. 9-10 grade I did web design/development and loved it! 12 grade I was full time web intern at my HS.  I also did computer science 1 and AP Computer Science 11 &amp; 12 grade. I liked the CS but in the AP class my scores were low. Still I didn't give up went to community college and eventually transfered to CS major in my university, University of Maryland. Then something horrible happend. I attempted to take the exemption exam for intro to CS since I took it at HS, and I read a intro to Java book over the summer, I did poorly and didn't get the exemption. I also struggled a lot in my Calculus 2 class. I eventually got scared that maybe I am not smart enough to finish the CS program so after 2/3 weeks doing CS at UMD I switched my major to econ. I choose econ because I like it. Its easy &amp; fun for me so it seemed like the correct choice. 1 year I did econ not really thinking about CS, but then a friend from my home country told me that his university is uploading all of its CS lectures in youtube. I started watching and got hooked up to CS again. I did their intro to Javascript intro to php and intro to Java clases. I also started going to hackatons with people from my university, they said that they don't care about my major and I can join them so I decided to do it. Now I feel like I made a big mistake switching majors. I like econ, but my passion for computers and programming is bigger. The questions that I have are: If I stick to doing the university lectures online and build several projects do I have chances at securing a CS job with my econ degree? Also if I do well with econ, will schools consider me for masters programs in computer science. If you also have any other advice regarding what should I do, I would appreciate it. Thank you in advance!"
30uj7c,2,2015-03-30,Would it be inappropriate to contact a potential employer that has not responded to me in over a month?,fizzygalacticus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30uj7c/would_it_be_inappropriate_to_contact_a_potential/,"Greetings, /r/cscareerquestions!

I hope this is the proper place to ask this type of question. I just need some quick guidance from someone who is experienced in dealing with employers/potential employers.

So about a month and a half ago I was contacted by a company that was interested in having me on board as an intern this coming summer. We chatted via email at first, they sent me some problems to solve (or rather see how I would approach them), and said that they were pleased with my responses. 

Afterward, we scheduled a phone interview and I think it went quite well. My contact there and I seemed to get along, and he seemed to be interested in what I had to say. At the end of the call, he asked if I could send himself and his boss a formal email outlining what I am interested in getting from an internship, which I completed promptly.

...That was about four weeks ago, and I still have not yet heard anything back from them. My contact there did tell me that they have been extremely busy, as they are a startup.

Since then I have been trying to be patient and await a formal email or phone call from someone at the company, however as it nears summertime, I'm growing increasingly worried that if I do not get accepted into their internship position, I will have nothing to go on for this summer (although I have been applying to other internships... though nobody out of the ~50 other places I've applied to have responded, or immediately rejected me). I'm also worried that if I get accepted, I will have minimal time to get all of my summer arrangements in order as I would have to re-locate (for the summer) to the city that the job is hosted in.

I emailed my contact last Monday, just politely asking what an acceptable time-frame would be for me to expect a response by. I have not yet heard back from him.

So, my question is -- would it be inappropriate of me to call him (since I do still have his number) to make sure that he received my email? How should I word the question as to not come off as an ass? 

Please and thank you!"
30uo9s,1,2015-03-30,Pulling product keys from a hard drive with a corrupted OS,wingedferret,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/30uo9s/pulling_product_keys_from_a_hard_drive_with_a/,"I'm completely stumped here and I'm really hoping that someone might know something about this. As a preface, everything I'm doing here is legitimate and I'm an intern for an IT firm.

So, I recently had to work with a user's Dell Latitude E6520 (running Win7 Professional) that had acquired the ""Verification of a KnownDLL failed"" BSOD. It was impossible to run the startup repair utility successfully, there was no system restore point available, all other bootup options failed, and I was ulitimately tasked with giving it a whack. My colleagues and I determined after much work that the OS was corrupt, so I copied all of the files over to an external HD and we did a clean install of Windows using a multi-OEM-compatible disc that we had on hand. Turned out beautifully. Transferred all of the files over to a just-in-case folder on the laptop and copied everything necessary to the desktop and documents. We packed it up and re-deployed it to the user (who is a state away).

Well, I made a bit of an oversight. I didn't grab the product keys for all of the software that was on there (which was really just Office and Adobe, but still important obv) when we did all of this and deployed the laptop. We did Jellybean the OS product key previously, at least, but it was the keys for everything else that I didn't get. Panic ensued. Luckily, I happened to have those files on the external HD still, so not all was lost yet. Literally. Thank god. I tried a few product key programs, though, and they turned up dry; no hives, no matter what targets I chose. After poring over many more articles, I came across an article talking about the ""tokens.dat"" file, and how it's a file that holds software product keys that Windows encrypts. And I even managed to find it. Hallelujah.

While the article that pointed out that file did get me one step closer, however, it did not actually specify the kind of program that could actually grab those keys, which brings me to my ultimate question: Does anyone know how I can convert that file into something usable? Or are there any suggestions to refine what's probably poor Jellybean/Keyfinder/ProduKey-usage on my part? Any help at all is extremely appreciated!

TL;DR: I need to pull product keys from files that I grabbed off of a broken hard drive and I don't know if it's time to give up or not."

Basically there is a little asshole named Dalton who is going to do something bad, and he wants me to know he's going to do something bad. I'm not a cop anymore so my options are limited but I am getting more and more sure that this is serious. 

I finished up an early shift at Wal Mart today and since I knew it would be a couple of hours before I could brace Dalton himself I spent some time at the gym. Did some low rep/high weight sets (for example 3-4 reps at 240 on the bench press) hit the shower, composed myself.

I got in my truck, an Escalade I might lose in a couple months, and drove around until I saw Dalton walking down the sidewalk probably headed home from school. I rolled up on him and hopped out. 

Little motherfucker was grinning at me. He's always really made my spidey senses tingle ever since I busted him the first time years ago. Realized as I walked up I was saying The Lord's Prayer in my head over and over. 

""Hey there, officer,"" he said with a smile.

""Well hey there, Dalton,"" I said, although I'm worried my voice broke a little. Fucker was standing there wearing khakis and a pink polo shirt with a little whale on the pocket. Expensive back pack. Putty colored boat shoes. Crisp haircut. ""Gee, you sure look a lot different than last time I talked to you.""

""Yeah, well, everybody goes through a rebellious phase. When they're young. That's when you want to do it, right? Get in trouble when you're young, get it out of your system so your adulthood isn't full of failure and disgrace."" He chuckled. ""You look different too...last time I saw you weren't you wearing a cop costume?""

""A uniform, yeah."" Motherfucker.

""Riiight."" Bastard sighed sympathetically. ""Well, what can I help you with? I'm afraid my dad isn't hiring any new security guards, as far as I know.""

""Had a little chat with your little butt buddy Justin.""

Dalton grinned at me. He took out his iPhone and started playing with it absentmindedly. ""Yeah, he told me. Kid has a big mouth, tells some whoppers. Unlike me, I'm afraid he might spend his whole life in this sinkhole of a town. Can't imagine what *that* would be like.""

""Cut the crap, asshole"" I wanted to grab him around the neck but I didn't. I'd end up in jail. The state's attorney is one of his dad's golfing buddies. I stood there and clenched my fists. ""I know you're planning to do something bad and I'm not gonna let it happen.""

He shrugged. Kept playing with his phone. ""Justin is a dumb fag who tells dumb stories. That's all I'm saying.""

""How is Justin? You two still buddies? I thought snitches got stitches?""

He put the phone to his ear. I could hear ringing. ""Yes, hello police? This is Dalton Peabody...no no, Dalt Jr...yeah, Skip...yeah listen one of your ex officers is here right now bothering me. He's a big guy and I think he might be on some kind of drug like roid raging or something? Anyway he's starting to make me feel really weird....oh you will? Thanks!""

Little shitbird winked at me. ""Snitches get stitches,"" he said as an afterthought, ""but pawns get a pass. Sometimes pawns get promoted. That's a chess reference, you don't get it now but it might make sense in the fullness of time. Well, get along lil piggy, the real cops are on their way.""

I'd had enough. My hand instinctively went to where my pepper spray would have been. To be honest I'm lucky I *didn't* have any weapons on me or I'd be in jail right now. Little cocksucker was right though, I did have to get the fuck out of there. I walked back to my truck with all the dignity I could manage.

""Oh and officer?""

I shot him a look. 

""Don't you think all that 'our Father' bullshit is a little passe' in 2015, and a little desperate coming from someone so disgraced? Oh and don't bother getting in touch with me again, as my father says to interns he interviews 'I'll be the one getting back to you, real soon.' ""

I could hear sirens, they were in the distance but close enough it was definitely time to mosey. "

He told us that this was in violation of the lease, and threatened to call our parents (we're college students). 

I have smoked in the past, but have not smoked in the past 30 days due to upcoming drug tests for internships. My paraphernalia is at a friends place, and I have no weed in the room. Before moving in, all 4 of us decided that if someone wanted to smoke, they should be doing it on the balcony. 

My roommate in room B smokes as well, and leaves his bong/grinder/weed out in plain view. We have told him multiple times to hide it, but he continues to do this. This is what my landlord found. In addition to this, he continually smokes weed in the bathroom, even though we have told him to smoke on the balcony. My other roommate in room B is an athlete, and has never smoked weed in his life. 

Our landlord hasn't mentioned eviction, but what can I expect? Can me and my roommate be held responsible? Thanks in advance.

Advice much appreciated",potprogrammer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30vjuv/looking_to_cut_and_run_after_8_months_on_the_job/,"I feel like this is a pretty common story in this industry, but it's a bit unique, since I have a certain location in mind that I'd like to find a job at. 

Basically, I switched majors to CS in college, worked my tail off to catch up and become reasonably competent by the time internship season began, and landed an internship at this company. Great! After the internship, they extended me a hard offer with a 30 day deadline to accept. I really wanted to shop around after gaining that valuable internship experience, but it would have been foolish to turn down my only offer, so I accept. 

Fast forward to now: I've been working about 8 months and just want to leave. The pay is decent for the Midwest, but I hear horror stories about how terrible raises are at this company, and it's clear that it isn't in my best interest to become a ""lifer"" or stay more than 1-2 years at this company. Management is not that great- they don't value their employees and let new engineers languish working on borderline pointless grunt work. It's one of those ""churn and burn"" companies that rely on getting a ton of people fresh out of college and don't value experienced employees whatsoever. 

But mainly, I want to get out of the Midwest. I have my heart set on Colorado- I've visited several times, my fiance loves it, and luckily there is a very dynamic software job market in the Boulder/Broomfield/Denver area. I accepted my current job simply because I needed a job after college- I really don't like the city that this company is based in.

My main questions:

1. What should I keep in mind about being discreet during this job hunt? I certainly don't want a recruiter contacting my current company and tipping someone off
2. Any tips for hunting for jobs in a different city? Denver is a pretty long drive from where I am, so I would probably need to fly there
3. Any job hunt suggestions in general for that 2nd job after college? It's been less than a year since I graduated
4. Any feedback on Boulder and Denver specifically?

I'm looking for a laptop suitable to college. I had a MacbookPro Retina for three years and it crashed last semester, I now use a chromebook (becasue it was cheap and easy) and love it.

I'm now looking at summer internships and possibly needing a more substantial laptop. I don't need it immediately, and after the dissapointing ROI of my Retina ($2000+ for 3 years), I want something with a little durability. I also have a chromebook for day to day use in class, so it wont be quite so actively used.

The ideal game I want to play is Dark Souls II close to full settings.. That level is about right, and hopefully a comp that can play DSII will be good for a decently specked game for a few years.

My budget is around $700. I could go for more for higher quality, by nothing above $900. At the same time, I would like something cheaper, obviously.

I was born in South Korea but moved to the US when I was 10. Yes, I did spend the first 10 years of my life in Korea, but I mostly identify myself as American because I did most of my growing up in this country.

This story starts when I was merely 16. I got my first boyfriend then, and my mom disapproved so much that she threatened to disown me/not support me in any way (mostly financially) if I didn't break up with him. The boyfriend eventually got fed up with it and broke it off. Although I was only 16, that was my first love, and I just couldn't help but think that I got my heart broken for the first time not because of something I did, but because of something my mom did.

Flash forward, and now I'm 22. I go to a decent state university, my GPA is 3.9 with a double major, have a paid internship, and volunteer at a local hospital. I used to live on campus the first 2 years of university, but my mom missed me too much that she decided to move to where I was to live with me. Although I wanted to enjoy the uni life, I'm not much of a drinker or anything, and I thought it wouldn't be so bad to have her there and have home cooked meals every day. My mom admitted that I never made her worry about anything and that she was so grateful. We were like best friends; I told her everything about my life, and she told me everything.

Trouble started 8 months ago when I met this great guy that I absolutely loved from the very first moment. Fortunately he felt the same, and we started dating shortly after. However, I could not quite tell my mom, fearing that the same thing that happened with my first boyfriend would happen again. I kept it a secret and inevitably lied to her several times about hanging out with him.

2 months ago, I decided to finally tell her, and she did not take it well. Her main reasons were that he was too short (5'5'') and that his family was not rich. From then on, I got really defensive when the subject came up, because it seemed like she only had negative things to say about him. For example, she would say that the way his eyebrows were shaped meant that he wasn't a good listener, and that I would be frustrated for the rest of my life. Another was involving some drama with a third person, who had talked behind my back; my current boyfriend had told me about the rumors the third person was spreading, and I was able to confront him and resolve the situation. However, from this story my mom believes that my boyfriend has a big mouth, and that that is not something a guy should do. It did not matter if I mentioned any good things about him; she brushed it off saying I do not have much experience in life and therefore do not know what I'm talking about.

This tension has been there for the past 2 months, and it kinda blew up 2 days ago when she found out that I have been lying about hanging out with him. She told me to stop seeing him or she would not support me financially anymore. She confiscated my phone so I would not be able to communicate with him anymore, and my wallet so I could not spend any money buying food with him or taking the bus to school. She almost confiscated my laptop too, but I told her that I needed it for school, and she let me keep it.

Just now, she found out that I was talking to him through Facebook and told me to deactivate it. I thought it was ridiculous how much she was trying to control my life. When I refused to do so, she said she would confiscate my laptop as well, though I need it desperately for school work. When I told her so, she said she would not allow me to go to school either; if I leave for school tomorrow, I would not be allowed to come back home. I was planning on living on campus next year since she finally decided to go back to Korea, but now she is saying that I would not be allowed to go back to school next semester either if I do not break up with him, and to cancel the housing application that I already paid for. When I refused to do so, she threatened me that she would go to school herself and embarrass me publicly so I would not be able to go to school anymore.

I know she can be so ridiculous sometimes, but I'm just not sure what to do in this case. I really love him so much, and I cannot imagine my life without him. At the same time, family always comes first, and I do need my parents' help financially (Dad is taking mom's side). However, if I were to give in and break up with him, I feel that she might think she could control my life, so I am trying to stand up for myself. She is giving me a series of ultimatums, and it's driving me crazy. I just do not know how this could be solved except by me breaking up with him; it seems like I will never get her approval. What do I do?

tl;dr Asian mom not allowing me to go back to school or support me financially if I don't break up with my boyfriend. What do I do?

EDIT/UPDATE: Thank you so much for all your encouraging words and kind advice. I did not realize this many people would actually take the time to read this long post and care about me. I did not back down; I stood my ground, just like a lot of you have told me to. I told my mom that I did not want to lie to her any longer, and that I am going to keep seeing him. Although she told me that she still did not approve of the relationship, she said she would let me choose what to do with my life. Maybe someday I'll regret not listening to her, but for now she has accepted my choice and that is all I can ask for. I'm glad I could end this post with a happy note! Again, thank you so much for your words! I could not have gotten through this without all of you."

Company B is a mid-sized startup that's currently growing really quickly, and already has a decent amount of VC money backing them. I don't know exactly how much they'll be offering me, other than the fact that it'll probably be considerably lower than that.

Neither company covers housing, but they both have the requisite Silicon Valley startup benefits, like catered lunch, ping-pong tables, etc.

1) People have told me having a good GPA is essential to get internships, jobs, etc. but right now I have a 2.4 GPA and am currently working my 3rd internship while many of my peers with high GPAs (3.5+) have 0 so far. Do you think this will continue to be true in the job market, in the sense that with my mediocre GPA with my 3-4 business internships I should have a solid chance at finding a high paying job in the financial industry?

2) What do you think of my resume so far? Given my GPA, and the fact that I don't go to a target school, I'm fairly certain BB Investment banking is not feasible. However, what about investment banking at a middle market bank or boutique bank? Then after a couple years, if I perform exceptionally well, I could transfer to a higher paying position? 

3) What career path do you think I should take, given my resume, to have the highest income? Corporate finance, hedge fund, private equity firm, investment banking, wealth management, financial consulting... you name it? Any ideas?

4) Should I take some of the stuff that's not very relevant to business off of my resume? Or does it help paint a picture of who I am to the employer?


Thanks for your help, this sub has been amazing resource for me!

30wzem,2,2015-03-31,Moving to the US from the UK - J1 Visa,csquestionman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30wzem/moving_to_the_us_from_the_uk_j1_visa/,"I'll be graduating in May 2016 with a BSc Computer Science from a good UK university (currently on a 4.0 GPA) and would love to move to the US for a year or two to work as a developer. I will try to go the H1-B route first but with it being a lottery there's a considerable chance that I may miss out.

I can, however, quite easily obtain a J-1 graduate visa to live and work in the US for 12 months (extendable up to 18 months AFAIK) following the completion of my degree. The J-1 allows me to enter the country before finding work so there is the added bonus of being able to apply for positions while residing in the country and the employer would not need to sort out/pay for a visa for me.

Anyway, my questions are:

* Would it be difficult to obtain work as a graduate on a visa like this?

* Would potential employers be put off by the fact that I can only stay for a finite period of time or is demand for developers high enough that it wouldn't matter?

* Is there such a thing as a graduate ""internship""?"

I'm a fourth year Education student - I'll be finishing up by degree before the end of April.

This was due to numerous factors - too many difficult assignments for my students, as well as complex topics that I needed to reteach. Looking back, I'm trying to figure out how I could have taught all the material my students needed to know, while using less class time and not weighing them down with homework.

This is also the question I'm posing for my Inquiry into Assessment class. If any of you have some spare time and would like to offer your teacher-ly wisdom, please take a glance at my survey!

On one hand I've got GMU Honors Program which has a fairly close proximity to DC, good area for internships for political science, a nice diverse student body, seemed to have more opportunities for research and grants and all that good stuff and is closer to home (NJ). GMU also has a better political science ranking than Tulane I think - however the overall academic quality seems to be lesser. Then there's other stuff like the small dorms/common rooms and rumored complete lack of things to do on weekends which is worrying. I'm not a huge party guy but it would nice to at least be out and about doing fun stuff.

On the other hand, there's Tulane which has much nicer weather and I assume (haven't visited yet) a much nicer campus, a better academic standing, a more dynamic area and more. However the distance is also pretty bad, the student body doesn't seem to be my type (i.e. wayyyyy too fratty/party-driven and snobby) and I'm not sure if I'd be getting a better experience or education by going.

Can anyone chime in?"
30xqa8,31,2015-03-31,Wife is about to earn her teaching degree and is intimidated by the job hunt. Can she get a little love?,ConnorSuttree,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/30xqa8/wife_is_about_to_earn_her_teaching_degree_and_is/,"Last night my wife was venting her anxiety with regards to finding a teaching job for the fall session. She is wrapping up her student teaching semester and just went to a job fair where she came away with a handful of good contacts, but also with a good bit of ""How am I ever going to get a job when I'm up against all of these seemingly competent/confident professionals looking for jobs too?"" in her brain.

Also, as she is applying for jobs online she has to submit her score from a Gallup poll along with the usual resume, cover letter, and letters of recommendation. The poll has her freaked out because she too often finds that in answering a particular question she is being forced to choose a relatively 2 dimensional response from the list. I tried to make her feel better by talking about the fact that 1) everyone else is similarly constrained 2) you've got to trust that the poll is designed well enough that it captures a decent representation of you, and 3) all of the districts to which she's applying require this same poll, so there's no reason to go crazy over-thinking the responses or limitations.

Now, I know that I'm a bit biased, but I also know that she is genuinely outstanding as a person, a student, and thus far as a teacher. Here's why:

* For her final semester, she has been one of a small handful of students who interviewed for and obtained a paid internship position.
* In this position, she has covered for her co-op's all day absence and led the class multiple times with no issues. She has great rapport with her kids.
* She suggested and has been granted permission to provide focused lessons for 3-6 kids every day to bring them up to par in their math skills. (She's a math/social studies teacher, btw)
* She has always received high praise from her instructors, peers, and observers. And I'm talkin' no bullshit high praise. At 27 and as the mother of our 3 year old daughter, she's a few years older than most of her fellow students, so she easily stands out as being more mature and competent than they, but she's always been that way.
* She'll be graduating with honors, which to me seems pretty obvious given the above. :)

We're in the Milwaukee area, if that helps anyone with some insight. I'm hoping that a few folks can give her some encouragement as she's looking to land that first job. What'dya say?

**Edit for shameless promotion** If you vote this up to the top I'll be she'll see the topic and be all like, ""Whaaaat?! You guys are great and I feel soooo much better! Thanks!""

UCLA - top 15 CE program, high overall university ranking, high brand value, great weather, urban campus.

30xwpw,2,2015-03-31,"Need Advice: Can't get my foot in the door at an advertising agency. (Incredibly long, sorry)",[deleted],GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/30xwpw/need_advice_cant_get_my_foot_in_the_door_at_an/,"I'm sure you answer a bunch of these, but I just can't get my head around what I'm doing wrong here. 

After graduating college with a Communications/Media degree a year and a half ago, I knew exactly what I wanted to do for a career. I had, during my studies, found a love for creating strategy and copy for advertising campaigns. But I had a problem that I knew was going to keep me from getting work easily: while my fellow students were out taking internships and making connections, I was working so I could afford to live, eat, etc.

After graduating, I sent hundreds of resumes, I made follow up calls/sent follow up emails, worked with the veterans services offered to me because of the time I spent in the Marines... I did everything that I could think of. But no matter what happened I couldn't even get a call back for a phone interview. 

After 6 months, I saw a job opening for an executive assistant at an advertising agency. Hoping this could help me get my foot in the door, I applied. Finally, I got a phone call. Finally an interview, and finally a job. It was a small role at a tiny agency, but it was a start. I saw it as a way to finally start getting writing samples together, as well as learn about the industry.

In the 8 months that I worked there, I took a small sales outreach email writing role and transitioned it multiple times until the things I was previously ""sure about"" with no proof were the things I did every day. I volunteered to write blogs, I asked for a shot to write copy, I pitched our business and got us a new client. The partners were so excited about the work that we started hiring new people to expand. Having multiple designers and an assistant, I was all of a sudden running all the creative meetings and leading the team on concepts and execution for multiple campaigns. I was doing exactly what I KNEW I was capable of... but I didn't know that was what would get me fired.

As I mentioned, this was a small agency... like very small. So when I started taking over responsibilities, the partners (one in particular) had much less to do. This spiraled downward to the point where an email I sent on a day off asking for guidance on the amount of tasks they (separately) had assigned the creative team for the next week became an argument about how disrespectful I was and how it was holding back production. 

Long story shot, I'm back on the job market.

Oh well, I was unceremoniously canned through an email on a Saturday from a job I was great at and truly loved. Now that I have some experience doing low through high level stuff for an agency... albeit a small one, I should at least be able to get my foot in the door somewhere else, right? WRONG.

I feel like I'm back where I was when I graduated, except now I have an online portfolio with examples of the work I did in my old role. So now... instead of wondering if the hundreds of resumes I send out are even seen... google analytics tells me that nobody is even bothering to take a look at my work before either outright rejecting me or taking the job posting down. 

I know it has to be a problem with my approach... but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. It seems that I'm in the same boat I was in the first time around. I know I'm a capable and talented candidate who wants nothing more than to grow in this industry... I just can't even get an employer to let me in to the point where I can say that. 

How do I change my approach when they just can't get to that step of the process? How do I break the cycle of disinterest?

TL;DR: Looking for advice on how to get in the room with an employer. I don't even care about the rest. I just need an interview.

So basically I know I want to study computer engineering.  I also know that my B.S. degree is not enough to get me into hardware work, which is what I really want to do.  My school basically made me a glorified CS and Physics major.  I want to get hands on.  

I'm trying to search for graduate programs, I just don't know what to do with all of these results.  Also, some schools don't even list the research that students would be working on, so how on earth do I get this information?  I've tried e-mailing some of the contacts, but most of them just send me a link to the SAME WEBPAGE I GOT THEIR INFO FROM!  

Sorry, I'm just overwhelmed.  I can go anywhere in the country.  I'm not limited to anywhere in particular. 

Have any of you found a way to make the search easier?  It just seems so scattered right now that I have no idea how I'm going to make a decision I can be confident in.

All I have ever done is what other people expected or wanted me to do. And now I have nearly accomplished that, and don't know what to do next. There is nothing I want to do for a career. There is nothing I want to do for a hobby. There is just nothing I want to do.

I graduate from university soon, and I have no idea what to do next. I tried to apply for internships, but I had no idea what sort of thing I wanted, and none of the places I applied to even bothered to respond. I tried to speak with a careers advisor at my uni, but all they told me to do was 'research it'. What good is that?? I have spent hours and hours looking at potential jobs, and nothing seems even remotely interesting. 

I hate my family. They are boring, and I have nothing to talk to them about, as everything revolves around my disabled brother. It always has. My parents would rather send me to countless band rehearsals or swimming sessions than spend any time bonding with me, or finding out what I wanted to do. I spent so much time at those I never had time to work out what I wanted to do, or even how to befriend people I wanted to know. I always just did as I was told, even though I hated the bands, and I hated swimming. I hate everything.

The only thing that makes me happy is my boyfriend, but it isn't fair to put that much pressure on him. I can't expect him to be there for me every time I feel like this.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to carry on living like this, but I don't want to hurt him either, and I know it would destroy him if I killed myself. That is about the only thing stopping me. I need help."

I work in marketing at a small start-up, and this is my first job out of college. It’s actually way more responsibility than is typical, which is great but means I’m all over the place in terms of things to do. It’s partly just the sheer amount of work to do and it’s partly the fact that there are a ton of 5 minute tasks and partly that I’m juggling about separate 12 projects at a time. 

I want them to hire an intern or something to do a specific portion of my job, but my boss was pretty unwilling. They might hire someone else for our team in a few months. I’m going to continue pushing that point, but I’m trying to figure out how to handle things in the mean time.

So I’ve decided the best course of action is to just prioritize as best I can and try to juggle things. 

If I do drop a ball and it’s something my boss asks about, I’m going to be honest and say “I haven’t had a chance yet, I’ve been working on x and x.” If anyone thinks I should use a variation of that, happy to hear suggestions. 

My boss is the kind of person who uses hours worked in his presence as a proxy for how hard the person is actually working, so I know that if I’m the first to show up and one of the last to leave, he will assume I’m trying my best and won’t accuse me of slacking off.

I will sometimes flat out tell him that I don’t have time for a continuous task (for example, he asked me to set up social media accounts for a new product and I said no problem but don’t expect me to have time to post). 

And to be clear, I’m going to continue trying to see if we can get another person, but this is what I need to do for now.

It’s really getting difficult for me to keep everything straight in my head.

I need to get better at 

* Prioritizing a long list of tasks, each of which are associated with a different project

* Remember to do little 5-minute tasks (including regular ones)

* Come up with a stock response for my boss when I do drop a ball

* Be more efficient when I’m working on a task

If anyone has any strategies or tool suggestions, I would appreciate them."
30ymju,4,2015-03-31,9 months programmer syndrome,rogueman999,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/30ymju/9_months_programmer_syndrome/,"Help me reddit, because I'm stumped and in need. Sorry for the wall of text, I may be ranting a bit. There is a tl;dr.

The problem I'm noticing here (and if I'm not crazy then I'm probably not the first one noticing it either) is a tendency of young programmers to quit their first job in unpleasant circumstances a little less then a year after starting it. 

The first case I can report is myself - I was working as a student over a decade ago, and when finals came I agreed with my boss I'd continue working part time. At the end of the finals both of us were dissatisfied with the amount of work I had put in, albeit in different directions. Hindsight is subjective, so I may well have been more bratty then I remember. 

The last incident (and fourth by my count, out of not so many I've watched over the years, which makes it a worrying high percentage) just ended this morning. A young programmed I imagined I had been mentoring and grooming since last spring quit messily barely a month after our startup got its first big client, and consequently just after his take-home paycheck almost doubled. The messy part was an email he sent to said client, which painted me as Satan incarnated. I'm not, and since I can't really trust Satan with the evaluation I checked with other people involved - the absolute consensus is that I'm really not, and he's... well, young and inexperienced was the nice way of putting it.

What all those cases have in common is a sudden rise in self-esteem coming from finally being able to ""get"" things and build real, production software. This leads to unreasonable demands - last summer one intern went to a series of 4-5 negociating rounds with the head of his company, asking to quit, then to work less, then to make more money, then to quit again. He asked to be rehired after a month (and was refused). Another of the guys I'm aware of quit / I fired him just after finals, like myself, and this after I had almost begged him to take the month off. Even being aware of the potential for trouble I wasn't able to avoid it.

**tl;dr:** Programmer gets hired, is hard working and eager to learn for 6 months. Becomes able to do real work, gets into conflict with management, quits or gets fired. This looks like a pattern, and I need to break it because my latest  startup is based on training young programmers. Help?

I've gotten kind of close! I've got to final stage of interviews with a large consulting firm a few months after graduating, but they ultimately didn't hire me. I got interviews with a local startup, but they aren't able to hire me at the moment because they don't have the budget. And finally, I had an interview with a small government contractor who was going to hire me, contingent on securing their next contract which still hasn't happened. And just last week, I had a company that was excited to interview me, but I had to stop when they didn't offer relocation assistance. I'm just not in a financial state to be relocating by myself.

I don't think I'm doing anything wrong on the applying end. I send out about 5-7 applications out a week, but I might get a email/phone screen once or twice a month (and plenty of rejections letters, if I even get those!). I've had my resume reviewed multiple times, even by professionals, and none of them suggested any radical changes. I always target my cover letters, and I've had some of them checked out too.

I took a couple of extra years in school due to depression, and my grades weren't so hot. I only had one internship which is supposed to be pretty bad for a computer science major. So, I understand I'm not the greatest candidate and accept that. I'd post this in /r/cscareerquestions, but I'm not a fan of the subreddit. It's not for people like me. They seem a bit harsh to anyone that isn't an ace student with internships under their belt. They all are ever talking about getting into Google or Amazon, and I know I'm just not of that caliber.

Reading /r/cscareerquestions, I have seen people suggest making projects on GitHub which I started doing a month ago. I've also got involved with a recruiter, but no bites there either. I've also seen suggestions about trying other fields in software development. Originally I thought of just doing software engineering or programming, but I've applied to QA/testing/analysis and consultant gigs. Still nothing.

Is this normal though? I know everybody's story about getting hired is personal and unique. You take two people, and they likely didn't get hired the same way. But I thought I was doing most things ""right."" I've got an ""in demand"" STEM degree, have a resume that I believe to be good, I can interview well, and yet I'm not employed. Is one year without getting hired normal for someone like me? Anything else I can be doing to help myself?"

I am making a career change out of the graphic design field and into IT.  I interviewed with a company last week and they presented me an offer to be involved in a paid training / internship.  The requirement is that I complete the A+ in approximately 30 days with a continued path toward sec+ and network+ by the end of the year.

I am self taught in all things computer but I have struggled to read through many of the A+ concepts. A great amount of the info I feel comfortable with and other concepts are foreign.

I am using online practice exams, Mike myers 8th edition and also his testing software to practice.  Would someone have any suggestions to really prep and convince myself to go sign up for a testing day.

EDIT:  Thank you all to commented and offered your insight it is much appreciated.  Here goes..."

30zccb,3,2015-03-31,How to choose between two competing internship offers?,indecisiveCSstudent,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30zccb/how_to_choose_between_two_competing_internship/,"Hello, I am a second year CS major with two competing summer internship offers. One is for a major tech company in Austin, and the other is for the technology division of a major investment banking company in New York. 

As I have never had an internship before or any significant out of class programming experience, it will be an educational experience regardless of choice. In addition, both companies provide fairly handsome compensation. However, neither company has provided insight as to what I will be working on, and will likely not do so until my offer deadline is up.

Given these circumstances, what would be a good approach to selecting which company to work for?

I am currently in second year university, with no internship experience wanting to be a software developer. After trying for the last couple of months to land an internship, I finally got one at a well known company. Initially I thought the position was in software development however after talking to the manager, he told me that I will initially be put into automated qa testing and if I show potential may be moved to development.

I know beggars cant be chosers, but I am not to sure what to do in this situation. This is the only internship I was able to land, however since it is 16 months long, am worried that I might not be able to move to the developer role. I have talked to a couple of friends but have only heard mixed things. 

So I was wondering if people could offer some advice on what they would do if in this situation.

Thanks a lot :)

For my first and second interview, I was wearing a suit, but it was a little awkward because no one else was dressed like that.

Update: thank you everybody for your input. Initially, I was gonna wear khakis and shirt, but I decided to go with a suit after everyone suggested that. I got the job. The CEO said he appreciates me dressing up but next time I can wear something casual. "
30znkv,1,2015-03-31,Internship offer situation - looking for advice,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/30znkv/internship_offer_situation_looking_for_advice/,"Hey guys. I'm a 3rd year Software Engineering major who has been searching for internships for this Summer. It would be my first internship/""real world"" experience. While I understand a very similar situation has come up (and is posted on the FAQ), I've been having a lot of trouble with my situation, as there are a few weird specifics.

Long story short, after several interviews, I FINALLY received an offer for an internship. However, there's a few issues and I'm having a REALLY hard time deciding what to do...

&amp;nbsp;

1) The job (Job 1) is at my university, which is very far away from home. I am unable to go back home over breaks (except for Summer), so I have not seen my family/girlfriend in over 3 months. (Job 1 allows for ~2 weeks of vacation time. One week would be me working remotely.) I would also not be able to get around, as I cannot bring my car to campus for the Summer. This means that I would not be able to participate in many of the Summer activities I normally enjoy. 

&amp;nbsp;

2) I'm not sure Job 1 counts as a good internship experience. While it IS paid, I would hardly call it a true ""software company"" job. Basically, the ""team"" would consist of me and one other graduate student, with a professor to mentor/direct us in creating a website/web-app. (Basically, I'm unsure whether or not this internship experience will make an employer down the road go ""Ooh, let's hire him"", considering I have already completed several team-projects through school.)

&amp;nbsp;

3) I have several applications out to a (fairly large) company (Job 2) closer to home. I would prefer working at Job 2 because it is close to home, pays more than Job 1, and there would be no question about the ""quaility of the experience"" I would be getting during the internship. I feel I have a decent shot at getting Job 2, as my brother-in-law works at the company's graphic design department and introduced me to a few of the higher-ups of the IT department. However, nothing is for certain yet, as Job 2 is still reviewing my applications.

&amp;nbsp;

I have already emailed Job 2 (last week) about the status of my applications, although I did not mention that I had another offer and needed to hear back from them. The professor from Job 1 has told me that the deadline for acceptance is rapidly approaching, as he has to ""submit the paperwork to get me on payroll for the summer"" and ""has other applicants he could proceed with"". In the original offer he mentioned that I was his top choice. Were the offer from a company, rather than a university professor, I would have no issues with potentially reneging if I got an offer from Job 2.

&amp;nbsp;

Hopefully that's enough information. I'm really lost on this one, guys. Thanks in advance for any help that you can offer."
