kye49,3,2011-10-02,"Ok reddit, I really need some advice.  What do I do when the major emotion I get from my mother is anger? (xpost from TwoX)",throwitallaway101,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kye49/ok_reddit_i_really_need_some_advice_what_do_i_do/,"It would be great if I could get your opinions/advice about the stress I've been feeling later with the relationship I have with my mom.  Some back story: My mom and dad divorced soon after I turned 18 years old. I helped my mom through the divorce since she has several chronic illnesses, and my dad didn't seem to care and was still trying to take everything away from her. We ended up getting kicked out of the house and homeless for a year, until we slowly stabilized and I was able to go to college while she claimed disability and retired. I have no contact with my father, and I am an only child.

However, after I graduated college and returned back home, the relationship between my mother and myself has been strained (I moved back last Summer of 2010, now 25 years old). I currently have started in a graduate school program and commute to class (roundtrip it takes 1 1/2 hours per day), and I work part-time at a paid internship that is at another school (roundtrip 1 hour). I am also in charge of mentoring college students in a Freshman seminar course. On top of all this, I do a lot of errands and help my mother make big decisions that she ask for my help in. For example, I got my mom a new cell phone, I took care of her when she was admitted to the hospital for 3 days (she is better now), I help her watch over and get her medications at the pharmacy, I tried to plan a nice vacation for us this past summer (but she ended up getting angry anyways). Even now, I am lending a huge chunk of money to my mom so she can buy a car (we have been sharing one car...).

Lately, she has had more angry outbursts that have been directed towards me. She even admits that she uses me as a ""punching bag."" My mom is very hard on me saying that I am not responsible and that I deserve to be yelled at. For example, and I know I should know better, I do not put the dishes away after washing them, I bang my backpack against the walls (we live in an apartment), I am not cautious enough when I drive, I used a debit card at a gas station (once), I clogged the drain in the tub because I forgot to use the hair catcher thingy. These are just some of the things that my mom explodes on. I don't know anymore if I really am a bad irresponsible selfish person, or my mom has anger issues. It doesn't help that I look exactly like my dad, and my mom points out all the bad behaviors I have that reminder her of him.

Overall, I am exhausted and don't even want to be around her so I try to avoid her (she fights with me about that, too). I don't want to feel this way, but it is stressing me out and I am getting a lot of anxiety. I don't even want to leave my room or go outside to avoid having to see her or do anything else that could set her off. I feel morally obligated to not leave because I know she is getting older and sicker, and I am the only one she relies on. Whenever I try to not engage in the fights (that can last up to hours), she then will say things like, ""oh i see, i guess it's fck you now btch, isn't it!? You don't give a f*ck?!"" I just want to be happy and want her to be happy, too. I'm not perfect, and I take ownership of things I could be more responsible for. But now I'm asking you what do you make of all this? I am lost and don't know what to do or think anymore.

kzkko,22,2011-10-03,Intern vs. t4 guy,[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/kzkko/intern_vs_t4_guy/,"I was require to intern in an IT environment for a quarter when I was in college, so I interned for the college's IT dept. I was t1, just doing inventory, surplus, help desk calls, and a lot of ghosting - you know, grunt work. My immediate supervisor was a cool t3 guy (Mike), and we got along really well.

Anyway, later there were some people let go from the IT dept due to budget cuts, and thus, some techs were moved around. There was t4 guy (we'll call him Dan) who, I swear, didn't know a damn thing. I never worked with him, but I've talked with him enough to know that the only reason he still had his job was because of seniority. 

Dan was transferred to the campus I worked at. When in the IT office, I swear all he did was surf the net. He never left unless it was for lunch, while Mike and I were in and out for tech support.

One day, Dan asked me what antivirus the district used. I had to ask him to repeat the question to make sure I heard him right. Is it common for someone of his pay grade to not know this?

There was another incident in which Mike and I were ghosting new PC's to be placed into a lab. While waiting for the image to drop, we were just kind of sitting (we only had two copies of Ghost), and you know you can't really do much when the image is being dropped. Dan came over and said that we ""sure looked busy,"" in the most obvious sarcastic tone ever.

At least that was toward the end of the internship. I sure feel bad for Mike, though.

I feel like I barely know anything even though I get good grades and every application requirement I look at is so intimidating. I figure I'd go to an interview and just tell them exactly how little I know and how much I don't know but am a hard worker and would do my best to get the work done.  The only problem I see with that is why hire me even as an intern if I can't do the work they give me?

I work for a small IT company and we've got a job vacancy. We're looking for a software developer (Java-ish) and this week and the next I'll be doing some interviews. 

As this is our first time to do interviews with software developers the regular way (we always hired guys who did an internship at our company, so we had the tech part covered pretty well), I'm wondering what a good practice would be to learn about the applicant's technical knowledge and the like.

The basics are covered of course... I'm just looking for insights into the tech part.

The job posting stated they are looking for an "" IT intern who is interested in an entry level, part-time, temporary position performing the duties of a PC technician. This is an ideal position for someone who is pursuing a degree in Information Systems Management or a related IT field and is looking for IT experience.

""On a day-to-day basis this person will be doing computer deployments, ghosting, and imaging, as well as other tasks as assigned. Training will be provided and no previous IT experience is required. This position will include some ""educational meetings"" with various members of the IT department explaining and discussing various other IT operations and topics. ""

So far i meet their criteria for the internship , but i feel that meeting their minimum criteria is not enough to secure this internship. 

What are some ways i can increase my odds of being selected?

Where can i find more information about deployments, ghosting, and imaging?

I graduated in 2009 with a degree in civil engineering from a pretty good school with a GPA above a 3.0. I passed the EIT/FE the same year. However, I made one big, big mistake. I never got an internship during these years, as I instead took summer courses to catch up on units (transferred from a different school after one year and my units were all messed up). That’s not to say I didn’t apply for internships, I just never got one.

I spent the first year and 4 months after graduating at home, second guessing myself day in and day out as I looked for jobs without much success. I was doing the normal routine: applying online, attending a few career fairs, making phone calls and emails trying to follow up, attempting to expand my network, and volunteering for a cat rescue organization. I landed an unpaid internship in November of 2010 with a department of public works, and have been with them since. The experience has been great, and without it, I’d have nothing and frankly be completely screwed. I’ve still been applying for other positions in the meantime, and recently (this week) accepted an offer for another internship for another department of public works doing traffic engineering. It’s great and all, but it is just an internship and not the full time position that I desperately want so I can start my career get the hell out of my parent’s house. *EDIT- Sorry I didn't clarify. Both of these cities are on hiring freeze, so no they are not leading to full time positions at the moment.

I’m open to relocating, but have had zero luck with anything that wasn’t local. One job I interviewed for had 400 applicants, and 60 were invited for an initial round of written interviews (I made it one more round where 17 were interviewed by a panel). I guess what I’m saying is that it seems there are plenty of applicants no matter where you go, so companies seem to prefer the local ones rather than dealing with flying people out or relocation costs. The only exception would be if I knew someone, and that has gotten me a total of one interview where I was flown to Anaheim, but surprise!! Didn’t get the job.

I’m at a loss of what else I can do. I get interviews… they come and go, but it always seems I don’t have the right experience, or someone else has more experience. What really gets me is when I check things like LinkedIn, when people who went to the same school and are younger than me with less experience are getting amazing jobs with great companies in the same geographic area. I know the civil engineering industry is pretty abysmal right now, but…What gives? How come everybody and their grandma can get a job in this industry except for me? So let me hear it. I’m ready to get advice or criticism from anyone and anywhere.

It's my senior year and it's time to go job searching, but I feel like I am screwed.
I am a Computer Science and Computer Engineering double major.  My grades are very good, and I enjoy working with computers (obviously), but I feel like I'm trapped.  I've had 2 internships over the last 2 summers, both with reputable software companies (at the first was where one of my fellow interns introduced me to reddit).  The only problem is that I hated it.  I did the work as best as I could, but the only thing that made those summers bearable were the friends that I made.  I really didn't enjoy the work I was doing and felt like I knew nothing.
That is what I think the root of the problem is, I feel like I don't know anything and the workplace just doesn't appeal to me.  I know it's really easy to say 'deal with it' and that it's just a first world problem, but it's something that has really started to bug me.  It's the moment where I realize that i can't say ""I'll figure it out"" with regards to what I'm doing.

Is there any advice you guys can give me, or questions you'd like to ask?

TL;DR I have good grades, but am worried about finding a job because, when translated into the workplace, I don't like my field of study."

1. Dropped out of college, hated the school I was at, wasn't learning anything, stopped caring, started smoking pot again. Next I went to a technical program that I barely completed (I wanted to take a year off, but my family especially was urging me not to be idle and it was free), I completed my internship, loved almost every second of it, but after my month internship was up they didn't have the funds to hire me(NPO). This quickly devolved into 3 months of fruitless job searching, living off my girlfriend (which I did all during school). I ended up spending most of my time surfing on friends couches getting fucked up on basically anything I could find (I could find a lot). A friend of mine got me a job then that fall and I re-established a (sort-of) healthy lifestyle, despite the minuscule amount of money I made (make). I am still at this job a year later, now working full-time and hating it. I make about 1000USD a month, no benefits. 

2. I have been with my girlfriend for about 5 years now (since late highschool), living together for the past 2-3. She is wonderful and beautiful. She also has severe anxiety and a seriously shitty mother. We are planning to get married next summer, though I tried to break up with her this past summer (I couldn't, I can't do anything that will hurt someone). I love her so very much that I just couldn't. Now we are on a lease together so I'm basically committed. Sometimes I hate everything about her, see's extremely introverted and not very emotionally available, I am very very extroverted and have a variety of shallow relationships with people who never can meet my apparently impossible expectations. I am very intelligent, which may have something to do with it. Not like, straight A student smart, but more read thousands of books and consistently can solve any problem put in front of him provided I can stay focused long enough to get anything done, my IQ (i know I know) was tested at 150. I thought for a while I had ADD, but really it's silly because I can read a book I'm interested in for literally hours without taking more than a few quick breaks, anything else though leaves me feeling like my attention span is completely inadequate. I can never learn how to do anything because I never get past reading about it. Whenever I try to do things I'm easily overwhelmed and flustered.

3. I was apparently depressed seeming enough when I was younger that my mother decided that it would be a good idea to put me on prozac and send me to therapy. The thing is I was 11-12 (and later discovered to be something much worse than depression, but we'll get to that.) I in 8th grade, my parents just divorced, I just confirmed my suspicions that my dad had HIV (he had it before I was born, but again I'll get to that) through peeking at my doctors computer when he was out of the room. throughout highschool medications came and went and after 3 hospitalizations it was finally determined that I was bi-polar  , or schizoaffective, or GAD, or oranic affective, or just depressed, depending on who you talked to. I have little memory of the last two years of highschool due to the anti-psychotic fog. I abruptly stopped taking all of them when I moved out summer after I graduated highschool (lemme tell you, wean off your meds, that shit will fuuuuucccccckkkk up your next year or two if you stop too quickly). 

4. My dad has been terminally ill for decades now, he has many other illnesses now (including cancer), but he has been holding on for a while, though every year he gets more and more consistently sick. I love my dad, but taking care of him has been very difficult at times. Sacrifices have been made and shit happens. 

5. I have no way of helping myself. I don't have health insurance to get treated for my mental illness, so I just smoke pot everyday because it keeps me from getting so depressed I don't show up at work. I quit for several months a while back to see if that was part of what was causing me problems, but I was just crazy as fuck, with zero impulse control and ended up just getting way more fucked up all the time. I make it to work a lot of the time now.

6. I have no skills at all. The only things I'm good at are finding and listening to music, talking to people, and playing board games. I feel lost like I'm trapped in a poor people prison where I can't get any education or jobs. I don't have a car either so while I live in a city with public transport, it's completely inadequate for most trips, and I don't make enough money to even consider being able to get a car. I feel like my life has hit a dead end and I have no where to go and no one who even begins to understand me (I know that sounds pretentious, but I can't even find people who read books anymore, much less one who is social), every once in a while I find someone I connect to, but I always end up being left feeling unsatisfied. I swear I get along with almost every single person I meet, but I can't seem to get any deep connections. Sometimes I find myself just dumping my life on acquaintances that I run into because I feel like I just have to hold everything in because no one can relate to me to help me.

I guess I'm not really suicidal, (I get so sometimes, but who doesn't) but I think the only thing that keeps me from being suicidal is not being able to tolerate hurting the people around me. I just feel lost and alone and afraid because I can't seem to step up to the plate and do what I need to do, no matter what I try to do. I am always just getting by.

There is so much more to it too but I think I've typed enough for now."

I am two quarters away from completing my B.S in Computer Science. I wanted to apply for some local county/government internships and I read that they do an extensive background check with DOJ. I later read that the DOJ never clears records for any conviction, even if they're expunged or years old. 

In 2010, I got a misdemeanor ""willful resist/obstruction"" charge, to which I plead guilty.

Now my question is, is this basically going to bar me from getting an internship/job anywhere where these kinds of background checks? Is this the type of check that they run everywhere (assuming I wanted to get a small part time job) Is this type of background check common for all software engineering/ computer science related jobs? Am I basically screwed for life?

Thanks guys."

l4kpw,2,2011-10-07,Should I be patient or should I be bold? A dream career is on the line.,internthrowaway,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l4kpw/should_i_be_patient_or_should_i_be_bold_a_dream/,"I need some advice. Since this is my first time going through something like this, I really, really, *really* don't want to fuck this up. 

*Background:*

I'm a college graduate of 2011, from a top university in the country. I double-majored in two media/communications fields, have pretty typical resume: one outstanding thing, a cool and somewhat applicable internship from summer of jr. year, and then some meh stuff to fill the page.

After graduating, and travelling for the summer, I arrived back home in search for a job. Good leads didn't pan out, not a lot of responses from typical jobs, and didn't want to settle for the ""not quite a career, but a little better than a temp"" jobs from craigslist. 

*The job:*

I got an unpaid internship at a small tech start-up, who make a product I use regularly, as well as being directly related to my interest and degree. It wasn't going to cost me a lot (just commute and lunches or whatever), but to a never-been-fully-employed bank account, it was a gamble. A gamble I hoped would pay off by being the kind of internship where they groom you into a full-time employee, as opposed to the ""we want free labor"" variety, but if it didn't pan out, at least I had more work experience in a relevant field.

After two weeks, I was very comfortable with what I was doing. My responsibilities grew. I managed the part-time interns. I perform boring, but essential tasks. It got to the point that if I left, I'm not sure what they would do (the part-time/summer interns have left). 

It's been a month now. Not only am I doing all the interny stuff, but I have also been hugely important to the recent success. You see, all the other employees BUILD the product, but no one in that office knows what should go IN the product like me.

I arrive at work a half hour early yesterday, and listen to a meeting going on in the conference room. The CEO wants to find people who are like me - who know content - but who are more experienced, and actively making content. So **(tl;dr:) basically, my boss wants to hire someone who's doing what I'm doing already as an intern/capable of doing/studied to do/dreamed of doing, but is looking for an experienced professional instead.** If he saw my resume, I'm sure he'd realize I'm perfect for the job, but I'm positive he hasn't.

After his meeting, I admitted I heard what he was meeting about, and tried to subtly suggest that I have experience and contacts for the sort of thing he is looking for, and he responded by pumping me for my contacts, but ignoring my qualifications (although looking back, I probably undersold myself/was too subtle, because I wasn't sure how well admitting to eavesdropping was going to go over)

I'm a month into a ""three month internship."" So my question to you fellow ex-interns, or hiring experts, or anyone is this: Should I stay the course, be patient, and hope that it occurs to him that I'm a smart hire? (note: money is very much not a problem) Or, should I ask for some of his time/send him an e-mail to explain what I'm capable of?

**EDIT:** ya'll say, ""be bold."" I won't lie, that's what I was leaning. but what I'll reemphasize is that this may or may not be the ""internship that grooms into employment,"" but I don't know, and am terrified to fuck that up by being assertive and barking up the wrong tree about something."

l4xeo,0,2011-10-08,"Got an Engineering degree from MIT, but in a tough situation...",ackermann,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/l4xeo/got_an_engineering_degree_from_mit_but_in_a_tough/,"So I got an engineering degree from MIT.  Great, right?  But I am concerned.  MIT may be the #1 ranked college for what I studied, but I was lazy, and really squandered my time there.  I didn't do any internships or anything.  I didn't take advantage of the many opportunities MIT provides to get involved with research.  I didn't do much networking, or make many connections with the very smart people around me (I have pretty poor people skills).

On a 4 point scale, my GPA was 2.9, just below B average.  Most engineering jobs from companies like Boeing, they clearly state minimum 3.0 GPA to apply, otherwise I assume your resume goes straight to the trash.  Now, MIT is hard, and if I would have gone to lesser university, I might have gotten a 4.0 easily.  But I don't know if I can convince someone of that in an interview.

Perhaps more concerning, most engineering jobs ask for a bare minimum 3 references.  Stupidly, in my 4 years at MIT, I only got to know one professor well enough to ask him to serve as a reference.  I could start emailing random professors I had classes with, but I didn't get to know any of them well, and worse, its been almost a year since I graduated.  So few of them probably remember who I am.  So I don't really know what company would even give me an interview since I don't meet the 3 reference requirement.  I've never had any jobs before so I have no previous bosses who could be a reference.

So what do you think reddit?  Have I screwed myself over, by squandering my time at a world class university?  Or will the MIT name still get me an entry level engineering job?

I suppose I should just apply for a job and see what happens.  Continuing to wait probably isn't going to help.  I guess mainly I've been scared to death of finding out that I am unhirable, and that I have permanently screwed up my career by squandering my time at MIT.

l7e2c,525,2011-10-10,A Horrible Game,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/l7e2c/a_horrible_game/,"There was a running joke that our workplace was haunted. It was an older office building, and we were on the 33rd floor. I had been skeptical, but my attitude changed as the rainy summer wore on. A strange quality seemed to hang about the place, coming and going at odd times. I soon developed the ability to sense it beginning. I would be working, eating, talking... some mundane activity... and then I would feel a slight rotation of reality, as if existence itself had faded into a subtly different spectrum.

It was during those times that work became grey and unbearable. Paranoia was the first and most vague symptom. I would repeatedly sense someone coming up behind me and alt-tab back to my work - only to find myself alone. I would hear soft footsteps on the carpet, or see a shaded flash of someone approaching in propagated reflections... but there was never anyone there. There was only the ever-present gloomy rain against the glass walls of our floor. The other interns reported these same experiences in hushed tones.

Then, equally without warning, the indescribable tilt would fade. Reality would right itself, and the 33rd floor would become a normal cubicle farm again.

The occurrences became disturbing enough that we took to researching the effects. We each took a different category. Jake investigated whether the place had a history, and Steve looked into similar experiences reported elsewhere. I turned to science, and soon struck gold. I found a published paper that detailed how a standing air-wave of a certain frequency could cause an unexplained sense of fear, paranoia, and even visual hallucinations. The study seemed to explain exactly what was happening.

We were immensely relieved. That discovery also happened the day before we were scheduled to run the office alone for the afternoon. All of our coworkers were slated for a corporate restructuring meeting. Steve suggested that it was the perfect opportunity to play around with the air system. I agreed, wanting to alleviate my fears by taking control of them and making them seem harmless. Jake agreed as well, though he seemed hesitant.

It came as no surprise that the afternoon in question was gloomy and rain-soaked. We saw nothing but streaked rain through the windows around our floor. The atmosphere was perfect for our game.

We wanted to see how far we could push the experience, and bet on who could stand it the longest. I found the floor's air controls in a hallway closet, and we messed with them in an attempt to modulate whatever it was that caused the strange effects. After a few adjustments, I felt that inexplicable shift. It was working. A few more minutes of tinkering caused another, deeper shift, and I knew we'd done it. The very air seemed to pound through my head, in a manner imperceptible and impossible.

We returned to our desks, alone on the floor. We sat in sight of each other, so the first few minutes were spent joking and laughing about how tough we were. That stopped at the first distant noise we heard. We each snapped to face the distant end of the office, but saw nothing. I could feel my heart beating faster, and I knew it was starting.

A loud noise erupted under my hands, and I jumped up. They watched me, stifling laughter, as I answered the phone. We continued working for another twenty minutes, occasionally looking around for something we couldn't specify. The various offices around seemed to take on a menacing cast, as if somebody was hiding just inside them and watching us whenever we looked away.

I remember looking at Steve and noticing how *real* he looked, like a movie on the wrong framerate... he looked like a textured sack of flesh and organs moving about, and the thought profoundly disturbed me. That's what he really *was*...

Something moved at the other end of the floor. Again, we jerked to look. This time, I thought I saw a grey shoulder as someone slipped into a cubicle. I peered at the spot, but saw nothing further. I slid my chair around with a start as something clattered behind me, but, again, I saw nothing. I turned back to Jake and Steve, who watched me with wide eyes. I felt another shift, and the blanket on my thoughts grew heavier as the floor's emotional connotations faded further into a dark and unfamiliar space.

""Where's Steve?"" I asked, turning to Jake. He seemed worried. I was literally just looking at Steve a moment ago... or was I? Did I look at Jake and merely imagine that Steve was also there? We jumped up and ran to the hallway, where we found him closing the closet door that held the air controls. I could almost feel the building pulsing. It seemed to sync my heartbeat and breathing with a rolling heaviness in my awareness.

""Just seeing if I can't..."" Steve began.

""Can't what?"" I asked.

""Didn't you ask me to turn it up?"" Steve asked, forming his words with trouble. I shook my head. Jake grabbed my arm, and we three turned as one. At the distant end of the hallway, at the T junction, a grey form walked past.

Steve yelped, and we ran back into the cubicle space proper. A grey shade took slow, jerking steps between the foam walls a few rows down. It seemed to be facing away from us, and we hid behind a desk as it turned. Something hurt inside my head, just above my eyes. Steve looked even more like a grotesque sack of flesh, leaking shiny fluid from vivid pores on his sagging skin, and I found myself unable to look at him even as I had to crouch next to him in our hiding spot.

We froze in silent terror as the indefinite grey apparition took halting, broken steps past our hiding place. I somehow summoned the strength to look up as it passed, and saw in its ragged outline an expanse of undulating nothingness. A circle and a jagged line floated through it, and I realized what I was seeing.

""Come on,"" I whispered, fighting an intense lethargy that tried to prevent me from speaking. ""It's not real... it's... in our eyes... I saw veins...""

I staggered to my feet, and helped pull Jake up. I couldn't bring myself to touch Steve, who now seemed to me an aberrant abomination of quivering and pulsing organs. I was seeing him as he truly was, without my mental filter that made people seem like people... I turned to continue toward the hallway, but froze.

Dozens of grey entities stood throughout the maze of cubicles, watching us. They seemed to shift and redefine each time I moved my eyes. I took a step, and they made jerky motions toward Jake and I in sync. I kept telling myself that they weren't real, but I could *feel* their eyes on me. I felt their malice.

I took one step at a time, carefully wending our way through the cubicle maze as the apparitions took steps in rhythm with mine, trying to reach us. Sweat poured down my face as I calculated each next step, finding myself further and further from the door to the hallway. What the hell was I doing? I couldn't focus... the floor's breath still pulsed through my head.

Jake's nails dug into my arm. The atmosphere shifted negative even further. The rain-slick windows visibly darkened, as if night had fallen. I looked at Jake, whose eyes were glazed with terror. When I looked back, the grey forms were vanishing one by one, each turning to the south wall of glass before fleeing into nothingness. There came an overwhelming sense of something approaching...

I ran for the hallway, Jake hot on my heels. The closet door with the air controls was already open. Had Steve found his way here without us noticing? Who had adjusted them the final time? The living pulse of the floor rang through me with an intensity so full that I knew the perfect frequency had been found. I wasn't about to wait around to experience what was going to happen.

My fingers cracked into the door. I stared at them in pain, and reached to open the door to the air system controls that I had sworn was open. I couldn't locate the handle! I could see parts of it, but was unable to recognize the object itself.

""Jake, open the door!"" I told him, but he just stared at me in terror.

I started flailing at the slick metal, and felt it open just as the hallway lights dimmed. My hand went for the controls, finding them this time, and I shut it off.

A rush went through me a moment later... a barely discernible lifting of the weight on my thoughts. It was just enough for me to pull Jake into an elevator and hit a button for another floor as the hallway became pitch black. As the elevator doors closed, I felt an awareness brush past, something heavy and filled with rage that had barely missed us.

I felt reality shifting back to light and normality as I wiped blood from my nose.

""No..."" Jake muttered. ""We can't...""

""Can't what?"" I asked him.

""I didn't tell you,"" Jake continued. ""I didn't want to believe it. The place did have a history... reports of things... they got worse the fewer people there were...""

I froze with agonizing fear and regret. We had left Steve alone on that floor. Somewhere above us, a scream echoed with soul-chilling terror.

I lived the next few days in fearful panic, which turned to confusion when I returned to work the following Monday. Steve was there, sitting at his computer and doing his job, and made no mention of our game gone horribly awry.

I watched him covertly for hours, still seeing a mechanical contrivance of flesh and pulsing organs instead of a person. I thought it was just my imagination, except for his eyes... they were lifeless and dull. I shuddered and had the urge to hide whenever his gaze fell on me. When he spoke, his words seemed to mask a dark void, and his smile was empty and mocking.

It was at the end of the day that I finally snapped and ran. It was his goodbye... as he waved at me, I had the flash impression of an enormous black shadow over him, pulling strings like a marionette. His arm jerked in mockery of a living wave, and it was then I knew: Steve was dead. All that remained of him was a corpse, pulsing, breathing, and walking around as some sort of twisted prank. His lifeless eyes watched me go with a tilted, off-kilter smile.

""So who do you think won our game?"" his voice called out as I ran for the elevator. His laugh echoed behind me.

I never returned to that building."

I do care about her though I wonder if any of our differences can ever be bridged.  At the bottom, I have included a “TL;DR” summary.

Whenever I do see her during the week, she is almost always quiet and moody.  In addition, I wonder why she often displays frigid body language around me.  She often says that she is terrible at giving warm and fuzzy signals, but I feel skeptical about this.  Though I have met her friends, I have had some difficulties getting her to meet my friends.  The past two times I have tried to introduce them to her, she has resisted going.  She keeps insisting that she is somehow interfering with my time with my friends, even though I have made it clear that they would like to meet her and that she is nothing like Yoko Ono.  

The only time she is ever really affectionate verbally or physically is during and after sex.  There are no problems with sex at all and we are both equally satisfied.  My only concern is that I don’t want sex to be the only time that we are intimate, even if sexuality has a huge impact on my level of happiness

She does like to give gifts and has given me a few books.  This weekend she surprised me with a cake when I was told to expect an e-mail for a second interview with my internship prospect.  Often we split the costs of things on our dates...  I pay for dinner, she pays for movie tickets.  We both take equal parts in planning our dates out.  We also keep in contact on a daily basis (mostly text messages with a few phone calls a week that I usually initiate.

She told me this was the first time that she was in a ""normal"" relationship where she was not treated terribly and that I was the first nice, caring boyfriend she's had.  Generally, I appreciate hearing these things, but hearing the word “nice” has always seemed like a romantic death knell to me.  Maybe she has good intentions, but the word “nice” has been forever tainted to me and I can’t help but see it as a warning that I will soon be single.  The fact that she was in a fetal position in my bed, looking as if she was heavily debating something to herself did not reassure me.

TL;DR:  I (M/24) care for my girlfriend (F/24), whom I have a healthy, satisfying sex life with and who is  generous, but her aloof behavior is making me question our future.

I'm a second year chemist, and I was looking at IAESTE for it, but they don't offer any of the countries on my 'list'. I'd very much prefer to go with an exchange organisation.

My first choice would be Karachi, Pakistan, and I *have* found some companies to apply to and have two relevant contacts, as well, but again, I'd really prefer to have some international organisation to fall back on if anything goes wrong; I'd be leaving in June but cannot easily get travel insurance from my current location before July.

In general, I'm considering Pakistan (preferably Islamabad, Punjab or Sindh), Singapore, India (preferably the north), UAE, Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Nepal (in that order). Really I'd be happy for pointers with any of them; I'm planning to spend the next few summers doing this sort of thing, so my first choice doesn't have to happen this year.

I've got a pretty decent idea about visas and other organisational stuff that needs to be done for this to happen, I'm really just looking for a way to find an internship.

I'm specialising in computational chemistry, so I'd very much prefer that, but since it's probably unrealistic to find a placement relevant to that at this point in my degree, I think the petrol industry would be a great option, too (because petrol is the best back-up plan ever).

As a 3rd year student interested in entrepreneurship, both the technical and business aspects, I've come across only a very small list of product management / development internships at tech companies / startups and would like to know if anybody is looking for any?

I'm sure this comment thread will be helpful for other entrepreneurial minded students like me as well. I think Product Management internships, besides doing your own startups, are the best way as a student to get experience with getting very good technical and business exposure, which many successful entrepreneurs thrive on / find a good balance between. I've done a few business internships, but they're very disconnected from the technical side of the companies whereas software development internships tend to focus a LOT on simply coding coding coding (while this is slightly different in startups, there's still a huge emphasis on the code!).

I think PM internships are great for startups as well. Startups are looking for amazing coders that can also wear business hats, while I'm sure they'd also love business guys who don't mind / are good at coding as well. In my opinion, it's the best recruiting tool for startups (PM Internships).

With that note I'd love to hear from the Reddit Startup Community both on PM internships that you're looking to fill / consider taking students for AND your opinions on product management as a gateway to building good business and technical skills."

When I say abusive language, I don't mean swearing, I mean saying things to tear me down, attack my contributions to the family, belittling my career or sneering about how she doesn't care about our sex life.    
  
In the past few weeks it has gotten really bad. She is especially aggressive if I challenge her in any way. ""You're already going to do what I say, so just do it and don't complain."" I have been standing up for myself more and more, because I do *not* want to sit idly by and let this become the status quo. It seems like the more I stand up to her the more she escalates.    
  
For the past few days she increasingly wants me to wake up and deal with the baby, who has been a bit fussy since she's learned to roll over and wakes herself up when she rolls at night. No problem, but I don't usually hear her cry so my wife has to wake me up. I'm a deep sleeper, but I would wake with a word or a gentle shake, instead she's decided that I ""won't wake up"" unless she hits me.  
  
Last night she kicked me awake. Tonight she did it again. I immediately got up and dealt with the baby, but when I laid down I said, ""don't fucking hit me, you have been warned."" She immediately swung at me and punched me in the fucking temple, and when I say immediately I mean she connected before I finished the word ""warned."" I did something I've never done in my life, I swung back. I punched her as hard as I could, square in the ass. I've been in martial arts for years and pride myself on discipline, but being struck in the temple it was an instinctive reaction. I know for a fact I have told *her* that a light blow to the temple can kill, even if you are untrained. In our argument I expressed this to her, and she denied striking me at all and specifically hitting me in the head. It's been an hour now and my head still aches where she hit me. [Edit: Next day - no visible bruising but I have a nasty headache and the side of my head feels swollen].   
  
This initiated fifteen minutes of indignant hysterics. I kept repeating, ""it's not ok to hit me. Don't hit me. Find another way to wake me up."" She insisted that I go sleep on the couch. I refused. She pulled all the blankets, pillows and bedsheets from the bed. I still refused to leave. Finally, she dumped a cup of water on my head, stormed out, jumped in the car and left. It's 2:56 a.m.  

There are two things I feel are relevant. First, my wife was pretty severely abused as a kid. Second, she has often said that she feared this abuse would make her lose control and become abusive herself. Her father left her mother and six kids, and while I don't personally like her dad that much he doesn't seem like the type to walk out on his family. 
  
Perhaps it's for the best that she slammed the door before I finished the sentence, but as she left tonight I started to say, ""I think we solved a mystery tonight [slam] what could possibly make a loving father leave his wife and six kids."" Her mother is known for embroidering the truth, and her mother's official explanation is that her father was doing drugs and she kicked him out. This has never seemed a satisfactory explanation to me since her mother also had a history of drug and alcohol abuse.    
  
So is there some kind of biological basis for what's happening to her? Did her mother, for lack of a better description, lose her fucking mind after she had kids and drive her husband out of the house doing crazy shit like this? She was a very sweet, gentle and kind person when I met her. We've been together for almost seven years now, I never expected the honeymoon to last forever, but this seems to me to be a dramatic personality shift.  
   
I feel it necessary, in my own defense, to point out that I am gainfully employed, in a career I graduated from college to do. I did graduate a couple years after her. When we met I was working full time and taking night classes. We moved in together and I was the primary bread winner while she finished school. When she graduated and got her career started I went back to school full time, and finished a four year program in 2 1/2 years. During that time I worked, my average was over eighty hours of work and class per week not including study time. Of course, my pay was awful and she to this day resents ""having to support me."" Lately she has taken to talking about all the things she could have done with ""her"" money if she hadn't had me to support. I completed an internship during my senior year and landed a full time career position within a month of graduation, in the middle of the worst recession since the great depression.  
  
I do the majority of the housework, I do home improvements, I take care of our four dogs, I do all the yard work, I do all the cooking, I give my daughter her baths and read to her every night. I see my daughter approximately 1 1/2 hours a day because I often spend 2-3 hours riding the bus to and from work to save us money (at my wife's request). I don't drink, I rarely smoke pot, I don't cheat. Basically, I think the worst thing about me is how much time I spend on Reddit which is usually a couple hours after she goes to bed and in between chores on the weekend. I've been staying up late on Reddit lately and often falling asleep on the couch instead of in our bed, but I honestly feel like this is a reaction to her pushing me away and not the other way around. The past few nights I made a point of going to bed with her and tonight's episode was the result.  
  
Since my daughter was born my wife has done the majority of the care for her, especially night time feedings. In the first few months we established this routine, primarily because she would be up and out of bed to get the crying baby before I was even awake. 
  
In other words, I am not some kind of unemployed, uninvolved, lazy douchebag. I don't feel that I deserve to be treated this way, or that I have done anything to earn her spite.
  
**TL;DR:** My wife's personality has dramatically changed since the birth of our daughter, eight months ago. She has become verbally, psychologically and physically abusive. I'm hard working, a dedicated father, do most of the domestic chores and have been very patient with her up until now. In the past few weeks I've been standing up for  myself and she is escalating her violent behavior.
  
**Edit:** Ok Reddit, I've decided on a course of action.  
1) We're going out to dinner tonight, not to talk things out but just to try to relax and enjoy ourselves.  
2) In the next couple days I plan to hash things out, work out a better arrangement for sharing night duty and try extra hard to make sure she gets enough sleep. If this is all due to sleep deprivation (which she has been suffering for eight months now), problem solved.  
3) At the suggestion of user *scarlettenoir* I will also insist that she resume birth control at the earliest opportunity, as the first signs I saw of personality change were when she switched from pill to patch several years ago. Things have really gotten bad only since she's been pregnant (which is probably totally normal) and since the birth, when she hasn't been on any birth control.     
4) If this doesn't solve the problem I intend to document all incidences of psychological and emotional abuse in a google doc spreadsheet. If she gets physical I will file a police report.  
5) If extra sleep doesn't seem to help her mood and outlook I will insist she seek professional help.  
6) If steps 2-5 don't help I will consult a lawyer and begin divorce proceedings. By this point I should have enough documentation of abusive behavior to attain custody, child support and possibly alimony (I'd really like to take the house and car, too). Let's all hope it doesn't come to this.
  
I honestly think she wants to work things out, but this isn't going to be easy. Thanks for all your feedback and advice. Contrary to some responses on here, this has really helped me think the issues through and come up with a plan."
lbu1a,13,2011-10-14,ADVICE: The perfect one page entry-level resume template,[deleted],resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/lbu1a/advice_the_perfect_one_page_entrylevel_resume/,"After observing this subreddit for some time now, one fundamental flaw I see in the vast majority of the resumes people are posting for critique is the lack of a passable layout.  I would say with the exception of content, design and layout is the second most important element in a resume.  With most entry level jobs having hundreds if not thousands of applicants, the ability for you to showcase your skills in a clear and concise manner in less then 30 seconds is absolutely essential.  If your resume looks terrible, regardless of your gpa, school and work experience... there's a good chance it simply won't be read or taken seriously


Before I give advice, I may as well put a disclaimer here: I am an upcoming University graduate and (with the exception of looking for a candidate to replace me for one of my internships) have no formal HR training or experience.  That being said, I was very successful in landing interview requests based off my resume and recently started a little resume editing consulting I do on the side which has been successful.  


Now that we got that out of the way, I present to you [the following site](http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/investment-banking-resume-university-student/).  Yes, I realize that is an investment banking site.  Yes, I realize that if you are seeking advice on this forum, you probably aren't looking for an investment banking job.  The reason that site is an excellent resource is because investment banking is one of, if not the most competitive industries to break into.  One major element in breaking into investment banking is having a perfect resume .  If you scroll down on the aforementioned link, you will find .pdf and .doc links to the *cleanest* one page resume template I have seen.


I highly recommend watching the 25 minute video that accompanies the template.  Even though it is catered to investment banking, the author gives a lot of insight into why the template is effective.  Additionally, the video provides excellent commentary on how to effectively to create meaningful bulletpoints that sell your skills (or lack of skills) to HR managers.


I should also mention that the industry you are applying for should have its own ""acceptable"" do's and don'ts for your resume.  For example, in IT it is generally a good idea to showcase your technical skills somewhere near the top of the resume (the ibanking template has a tiny section at the bottom for this which is not so ideal).  Other technical fields sometimes require more elaboration on school projects and academics.  You need to find out what makes a solid resume for the industry you are targeting.  



A resume is not something you can throw together in 30 minutes using a ms word template.  It requires continuous improvement and should be customized for each and every single job you apply for.  Ask professors, friends, ask recruiters at networking events, find people on linkedin, etc... gather as much feedback as you can about your resume and constantly seek to make improvements.  "
lbr8z,5,2011-10-14,Please help me get over an emotionally abusive ex,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/lbr8z/please_help_me_get_over_an_emotionally_abusive_ex/,"22/F - The backstory of this is very long, as I was brainwashed in this ""relationship"" for over 2 years. Basically, if you could take the list of ""signs you are being emotionally abused"" and paste it here, that would describe what I was going through. I was being degraded on my appearance, opinions, my individuality, and self esteem in general. I was made to feel stupid and powerless. I started to notice he wasn't treating me right after a year.  I felt that I loved him (25/M), but at the same time something was wrong, I started feeling very angry and verbally fighting back. I had never got myself into a verbal fight with anyone in my whole life until I met this guy. We would often drink together, thus my reactions began to lash out even stronger. I would get angry and then he would accuse me of ""not taking criticism very well"" and that my ""people skills were bad because I just get mad all the time and therefore wouldn't do well in the workplace"" (I had told him about a new job I wanted to apply for recently). I would come home crying and my mom would see me and tell me that I had to get away from this guy as he is emotionally abusive. I was completely brainwashed however so I didn't want to believe her. As time went on, I noticed she was right and remained in denial until I couldn't take it anymore.

Anyway, I have been away from him for almost a year now and met a very nice man. We have been together for 8 months now and I am happier than I have ever been in my life. He is aware of what I've been through and the reason why I had to ""get away"" for a bit (I moved to the other side of the country for an internship). However, the suppressed anger built up from my past is still alive and I still feel resentful. I tend to react in certain ways to little things people say or do that my ex used to do before abusing me, naturally, almost like a defence mechanism.  

My issue however is that I feel my angst sometimes carrying on into my new relationship, for really ridiculous reasons. It's like if anything comes up that somehow compares to my ex, I respond negatively, even if it's nothing to get mad over. For example, my abusive ex used to try to compare me to porn stars and make me feel bad about myself for not having perfect boobs, and say really degrading things in general. I never had an issue with porn before I met him, heck, I watch porn myself. My new boyfriend however mentioned it once and I naturally felt so much inner rage, which I'm worried will hurt our relationship one day if I'm not aware of my emotions. I do not care if he watches porn, and all he did was mention it and it set off some natural defence response.  I guess I don't want to flip out at my new boyfriend by accident and have him think that he's the bad guy, which he is obviously the opposite of.  I have had a couple issues at the beginning of the relationship already but I apologized afterwards and he understood. I feel like I'm getting better, but I really want this to stop completely though since I don't want my ex ruining my new relationship as well.

If anyone could provide any advice on how to get over this faster, I would be very thankful.
I'm debating seeking counselling....

Thanks! "

I've wanted to put together my build for a long time now, but was doing a semester abroad for the past few months. I'm finally back in the USA and it feels criminal not to take advantage of Newegg prices... 

Can people take a look at my build and make any suggestions? I lucked out buying the i5 during an internship at Intel (yay half price!), and feel like this is a pretty damn good computer for &lt;$900. I do still need to find a keyboard, but that's not that crucial of a decision...

I'll be sure to post pictures when I'm done, I think I'm the only BaPC'er that's wanted to use the PC-B25F. It's sooooo beautiful. :)"

--

Maybe it was the sense of danger, or perhaps the want to see or hear that which was 'not of this world', but urban exploration was something we'd engage in now and again as bored teenagers.

By 'we', I mean myself (your typical geek, more or less), Mark (somewhat of a shut-in, for sure, but a little social), my friend Erin (the tomboyish, nerdy type), her boyfriend Greg (a total jock.  How they got together, and why they got along so well would be anyone's guess.), and Heather (two years younger than us, and a bit of an outcast.  I think she latched on to our group mostly because we welcomed her, but also because she mirrored a lot of our interests).

The summer after graduation, we decided to have one last adventure.  Erin and Greg were going to university and college on opposite coasts.  I had accepted an internship position at my uncle's company out west, and Heather's parents had enrolled her in a gifted education program at the private academy in town, so we all knew this would be the last time we'd be together.

The abandoned asylum just outside of town.  How cliché.  Of course, the place had a reputation among everyone in the county as being haunted, and the only reason it was still standing was apparently due to stacks of long forgotten dusty permits and lazy bureaucracy.

It was built in the 1920s as a ""rehabilitation clinic"".  A place where the rich and affluent townsfolk could send their ""undesirables"" to be cured of whatever maladies they were deemed to be suffering from, and integrated back into society.

Later, in the early 1950s, a sixth wing was constructed to house more troublesome and permanent patients.  This was the part of the asylum that was rife with stories of violent outbreaks, curious medical experiments, and otherwise known as the true place where the most undesirable of the undesirables were sent to be forgotten.

But enough about history.  This story is about that night, the last summer night our group would be together, and the night which all of us would like to forget, but none of us ever will.

--

Heather was the first to arrive.  We'd all agreed to meet outside of the asylum gates (we were all metal fans, so 'the asylum gates' was not only the perfect meeting place for us, but also a good band name, or song name... it was amusing at the time, anyway) right before dark (because, of course, nothing exciting happens during the day).  Erin and I were next to arrive, and Greg was last.  Late as always.  He couldn't use 'football practice' as an excuse this time, and sadly we couldn't use it as a reason to chide him ('hey, check out the jock hanging out with the nerds, and the artfags!' was a popular meme amongst us, because we WERE nerds and artfags, even Greg to an extent).

Once we had all gathered, the first thing I remember being said was from Greg: ""Do you think we should really do this? We could get in trouble for trespassing""...and after a few seconds of equal parts silence, and incredulous looks, ""I'm fuckin' kidding! Sometimes I think you really believe the 'dumb jock' stereotype."", we all expected that, but the poker-face delivery of his first line was honestly troll-worthy.

""All right, so it's the sixth wing we want, that's where the fun shit is."", he continued.  ""We'll go through reception, up to the third wing, then down to the courtyard, which has a door to the sixth wing.  I don't think you can get in any other way, they're all boarded up tight, and if they're not, it's 'cause they still have some pretty solid bars on 'em.""

We agreed that this was the way to go, and all squeezed through the front gate, and headed towards the west side of the building, where the reception room was.  The sixth wing was on the east side.  Opposite of where we were heading, but it was, as Greg said, the only available route.  It almost seemed like the beginning of a cliche horror movie (and indeed, I was half-expecting someone to yell ""cut!"", or ""scene!""), and we loved it.

--

Gathering outside the front doors, we paused to take in the ambiance, and environment.

Heather thought out loud, ""The moon's out.  We won't need our flashlights until we get to the sixth wing.  You know, if this wasn't in the middle of nowhere, streetlights and neon signs would be our guide, instead of the stars."" She glanced at us, and continued, ""Better enjoy it while you can, guys.  After this, it's bright lights, big cities, and pollution for you."" She was visibly dejected for a moment, but immediately finished with, ""Don't worry though.  I'll hold the fort here, but you have to come and visit when you can!""

I nodded in agreement, as did everyone else, but we all knew it wasn't a real promise.

Once we were inside, it was silent.  The moon and stars shone through the few windows which weren't boarded up.  With every step, our feet made an echoing clack against the broken tile floor.  The reception desk was to our left, littered with documents, and dusty folders, some of which had fallen to the floor, exposing their contents like a soft under belly.

The visitor's waiting room was on the opposite side.  Chairs with stained metallic legs, and a dull brown plastic upholstering, still neatly arranged in rows.  Separating them was a wooden coffee table, with old magazines haphazardly strewn about its surface.  Magazines who's titles reflected things which the building's occupants never had.  Glamour.  Fame.  Time.

These were real people.  Before they came here, they had hopes, dreams, and ideas.  They thought they knew how their lives would play out, and what they would do to realize these goals.  Now, they were nothing more than forgotten, dust covered artifacts of memories that had long since passed on.  Much like their owners.

I took a brief moment to ponder this.  Who were these people? How did they end up here? More importantly, were they aware of the choices they took, and decisions they made, which led them to this place? ...did they know that their lives, their emotions, and their wants would all be collated into neatly stacked papers, tucked away in alphabetically organised folders? ...and did they know that these folders, filed away in now rusting metal cabinets, would contain glib notes such as ""patient 27 seems to be interested in astronomy, however her understanding of basic physics is muted and somewhat warped"", and ""patient 6 has an encyclopedic knowledge of beetles, however no real, or transmutable life skills exist""?

All of their experiences, not relevant... just labeled, ""Session 13"".

Once here, they were numbers.  No longer Brian, who was fascinated with insects, and wanted to be an entomologist, or June, who thought that space-time was a dimension all unto itself, and wanted to be a physicist, they were instead, now, patient 6, and patient 27.

Was it just one major decision that led them directly here? ...or many minor ones, inevitably guiding them along a self-destructive path, much like a tired navigator, sinking his ship on the reefs, before he could reach the coast?

""Hey, space-case!"", Erin said, snapping me out my existential wanderlust, ""The stairs to the third wing are..."", she pointed at the hallway in front of us, leading to the stairwell.  There was a twisted mass of support beams, and crumbled concrete blocking our way, where the path to the upper floors once stood.   ""...well, they're not there any more.  Now, unless someone brought a ladder, and some shovels, we need to figure out a new path to the courtyard.""

""What about the basement?"", Mark opined.  ""The blueprints I found online show a few paths through there, and into the courtyard.  If they haven't flooded, they're likely still usable.""

""Sounds good."", I said.  ""How do we get down there?""

""Not sure, but I came prepared!"", Mark said, and pulled out some papers from his carry case.  ""These are the blueprints.  I printed them off, and took 'em with me.  Wasn't sure if we'd need them, but better safe than sorry.""

Shuffling through the mess of papers, and finding what he needed, Mark declared, ""Here it is! Main reception, to the left.  There's a door leading into the employee lounge, which should have another door to the janitor's room.  According to this, in there, one door leads to the electrical room, and the other is a path to the basement.""

""That sounds like a plan!"", Greg chimed in.  ""I wanted to check out the basement, anyway.  If they stored away all their medical devices, that'd be the place to find 'em, right?"", he continued.

""Medical devices? ...really?"", Erin said.  ""If this is the bloom of some sort of strange sexual fetish, you can count me out, Greg.""

""C'mon! Haven't you ever wanted to do it in a dentist's chair?"", Greg replied.  We knew he was kidding this time.  As friend rules are, though, we still gave him shit for it.

""Yeah, yeah, I know... dumb jock, blah, blah, blah"", Greg said. ""...but I'm honest with you guys.  You know my humour, I know yours.  I'm a blue collar nerd.  Football, physics... I like 'em both."", he continued, ""They're really the same anyway.  You can measure the speed, or location of a particle, but not both, right?""

""That's sort of the idea"", I said.  ""I don't know it well enough myself, but what are you getting at?""

""Well, if I'm the quarterback, and I'm the guy who's throwing the ball, I can think of my team mates as particles.  They all have velocity, and location, and I'm aware of both, but when I decide to throw the ball, I have to concentrate on only one of these things, and they have to as well."", Greg said. ""So when I throw the ball, I have to decide to throw it where they are, or where they're going to be, and they have to decide if they should stay put to receive it, or go where I'm throwing it.""

""Greg, honey"", Erin interrupted, ""that brain of yours...""

""Sorry."", Greg said, realising we were all intrigued but waiting for him to get to the point, ""What I'm saying is... Aren't our expectations of what will happen tonight affecting the outcome?  ...how do we know that if we see something, it's because it's actually there, and not because it's just something we wanted to experience?""

We all pondered this for a moment.  As the moonlight spilled into the room, illuminating the dusty magazines, the rusting chairs, and the tangible silence, we realised something.

These people.  The very ones who had once walked these rooms.  The people who had gathered their dreams and hopes into a now dusty corner, to be filed away and forgotten, they were just like us.  At some point in their lives, however, they had given up.

...or had they?

Well, we were going to find out.

I don't really know what I'm feeling. I guess kind of depressed, but not really? I don't want to commit suicide but I also don't want to live. If you don't think too hard about it, it makes sense and that's how I'm feeling.

I almost feel as if I should end things before they get really bad. Kind of like TV shows that get canceled while they're still good so they don't pump out shitty seasons and everyone remembers it fondly instead of poorly.

I'm currently going through community college and working for an Associates degree in Computer Engineering but I don't think I'll get anywhere with it. An associates is useless according to everyone I know and everyone on Reddit.

I can't find a job. Nothing. I can't find even a minimum wage retail job in my city. Nothing.

I interned somewhere for six months fresh out of high school, that was a mistake. Job? Nope. Not even an interview.

I'm at risk of homelessness - I live with my father, but I can't get a job and he's getting sick of footing all my bills. He thinks that I don't have a job because I'm lazy, and generally has an unfavorable opinion of me that I honestly don't understand where he got from. The truth is that I have been doing everything I can to get a job, but I simply can't find anything that won't cost me more in gas than I would make working.

I don't really have any friends. Growing up I was a really socially awkward kid, and I grew out of that. But right after high school, I moved cities (to go on the internship I mentioned) and now, with no job, I have no way to pay for gas to see my friends. I don't think the two friends that I did have even remember me at this point, it's been over a year.

I play a few games online and I just feel pathetic when I realize my closest friends are hundreds of miles away and the closest we've ever been is playing a video game with each other.

I find that as I get more stressed and depressed my social skills go down, and I can't meet anyone at college. I lock up when people talk to me which hasn't happened to me in years.

Anyway I guess I'm rambling. I don't want to kill myself, but I also don't really want to live. I don't have anyone to talk to. If I tell my mother she will just force a homeopathy regimen down my throat (she's a professional nurse, yet strongly believes in homeopathy? I don't get it), my father will just think this is a ploy to avoid getting a job (despite my depression being BECAUSE I can't get a job), and I have no friends who will take me seriously.

I won't respond right away because I have class in the morning and I am going to bed, but please don't think I'm high risk or anything. I'm anything but impulsive and I'm the kind of person who will plan things months in advance for really simple things, so... it's not like I'm going to pull a trigger in an hour or anything. I will respond to posts tomorrow.

Thank you."

Be it job or hobby, why did you/do you want to do it? Here's why I want to help people.

==========

It's quarter after one in the morning, and as tired as I am, I feel the need and desire to write this down so that I never, ever forget this moment.

==============

While working at Gamestop today, I found the answer that I had been searching for for the question, ""Why do you want to be a psychologist?"" I've known that I wanted to help people with their problems for quite some time now, it seems to be in my nature, but if I've ever had a more concrete experience in my head, I have forgotten it for one reason or another. I will not forget this one.

In walks a man with the look of inquiry on his face, we'll call him Chad, and after exchanging a few words with him, I could easily tell that he was uneasy about something. From his trembling hands, ever-moving eyes, shakey voice, and the aging of many more years than his age, this man was clearly distraught after an experience. 

After conversing with him, I find that he is interested in buying a new PS3, as his old one had died even after Sony had him send it in for repairs, and it came back broken still. Wanting to take care of this man (simply because of how he appeared so upset, though for what I did not know at this time), I tell him that I can certainly sell him on, along with a two year warranty, and that I can also buy his old, broken PS3 as well. He seems to be pretty excited about this, and begins to browse for a game or two while I get his PS3.

While helping him find a game, I talk to him. I try and get to know him, just like any other customer, in order to help him find a game that he'll like, but I couldn't help but want to get to know him a little better than most. He seemed a little more upset than he was five or so minutes ago for some reason, and I couldn't help but ask, ""Are you ok, sir?""

""N-no,"" was the answer that I received, and I was taken back by it for some reason, even though I had certainly already known the answer.

He begins to tell me his life story of the past year; a divorce, losing his house, most of his possessions, and most recently, his kids. I had to stifle it back at this point, but I could not hold back my pity for this guy. He had lost it all, and was now on various medication to help him through the day. On the outside, he looked clean and ... important (for lack of a better word). Khakis, a belt, tucked in, collared shit, and a nice watch. He clearly had a day job where he needed to look good. This is not my usual customer who can sometimes be seen crawling out from holes, avoiding showers for months.

I cannot describe my pity for this guy... Among ten or so other customers, he just blended in, keeping to himself very quietly, though I could see, and almost hear, his mind racing, thoughts ever changing, and his whole body so shakily moving about. I wanted to help him, though I had no idea how. All I know is that when he left, I had done everything I could to make it a little easier for Chad. He wanted to show me the stopwatch that his great-grandfather had given him, and after pulling it out of his pocket, I saw that is was a golden stopwatch, easily a hundred years my senior. It was beautiful, and it seemed like it was the only thing he had left. 

==============

I know why I want to help people. I have met Chad, and Chad has shown me exactly why I want to help others. Whether it's a shoulder to lean on, a person to vent to, someone to help you with a mental disease/disorder, or someone to seek advice from, I want to help people.  No one else in the store noticed him; none of the customers, my manager, or even my district-manager. I noticed you, Chad. You weren't unnoticed, and if I knew more about you, I would seek a way to help you. I can only hope, though, that I'll be able to help many people in many ways, and perhaps we'll stumble across each other again. No one should have to be that doped up on medicine to cope with their day-to-day life. I only pray to God that you find your answer, Chad, and that you find something to help make your life a little better. Though, I hope I made yours a little better, even if only for one night.

I want to be an intern for TWLOHA next summer. I want to take on that challenge of being accepted and finding a way to make it down there to help people who need it most. This is my reason why."

 I have also taken other courses that might be relevant, such Databases (SQL), Data structures, information retrieval and web search, and many other courses in which the chosen programming language was Java.
I have had an internship mostly doing some C# programming doing some XML and text manipulation and creating an msi installer.

There are two things I want:

* I would like to become a web developer, maybe freelance.
* I would like to be able to make some money, part time, doing web development work while I finish university.

I am planning on graduating my senior year this coming May. 

My GPA at the community college was 3.5ish. Since only my credits transferred and not my GPA, my GPA at UMD is 2.3. 

My lack of care from Freshman year is really biting me in the ass now. I have been looking for a job non-stop for after graduation. Either I don't qualify for the job because I don't have a minimum of a 3.0 GPA or even if I do qualify I get no responses back for the jobs I have applied for. I have experience by working at a small financial firm for two summers as an intern and at a non-profit organization in DC as a finance intern this semester. 

I really want to get a job as Analyst position or something in budgeting but I am really open to anything.

I want to know if anyone has gone through what I have and how you are doing now? And what did you do to get to where you are now?

I also want to know if anyone has advice as to how I should market myself or go about finding a job.

lihcr,2,2011-10-20,"LF graduate advice for a disillusioned biomedical engineer (wall of text, sorry!) (xpost from self.biology)",throw_away_bmegrad,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/lihcr/lf_graduate_advice_for_a_disillusioned_biomedical/,"I was suckered by the pre-professional BME course that showed off cell/tissue research. I ended up taking a broad spectrum of engineering, few relevant ""bio"" courses besides premed stuff.


**TL:DR - BME not what I thought it was. I want wet work with actual cells, tissues.**


My undergrad adviser was always busy, the two professors whose research focuses I thought were cool didn't want me (GPA too low), and my independent research proposition was shot down. GPA was really low for two semesters because my fraternity pledge-son committed suicide unexpectedly and I had a friend since middle-school murdered at the NIU school shooting. Spent summers at non-academic internships. Ended up graduating with a major GPA at 3.02, overall at 3.09. GRE test score of 610 English, 800 Math, 5.5 Writing.


*Overall GPA (Major in parentheses)*

* 2.77 (3.00) - prereqs, premed crap

* 2.55 (2.93) - prereqs, couple pre-major courses, NIU killings

* 2.83 (2.92) - Half major, half electives, pledge-son death

* 3.45 (3.42) - Mostly all subspecialty (cell/tissue eng) classes


**TL:DR - Had bad grades early on, didn't get research exp.**


I couldn't take a gap year off (obscure rule), couldn't swap majors without taking an extra year, and it was hard to see cell/tissue classes until senior year.  The capstone courses were quantitative physiology (math class), tissue eng (device/math class), biothermo (physics class), biofluids (nonstop Nav-Stokes math), and Senior Design (device class). Rigid class scheduling meant I couldn't take Biology wet lab courses (Proteomics, Genetics). My low grades meant I couldn't transfer to the liberal arts school for a Biology degree, so I stayed in engineering, manned up, and finished what I started.


**TL:DR - Constricted by rules, lack of cell/tissue wet work, lost hope in college.**


I graduated in Spring 2010. I have worked odd jobs unrelated to health fields (graphic design, painting, tutoring), but I'm not going anywhere with it and life feels so damn meaningless--it's more like I've been unemployed for a year. I tried to get jobs in finance (was 1 class short of Econ minor), consulting, research tech, but I just never could get an offer. I feel like I wasted my undergraduate years. I'm taking online courses in parallel and distributed programming (Python/Java) nowadays while unemployed, and it's kicking my ass but a nice refrain from unemployment woes and being rejected from jobs.


**TL:DR - Jobless, life sputtering, taking programming courses at the moment.**


Do I even start my PhD/Master's search, when I didn't have strong major grades (@Ivy school, so grade inflation) and no undergrad research? Am I even ready for it? I don't even think any professors remember me, or will just look at my grades and say, ""he sucked."" I'm asking Reddit because I hate, distrust, and felt betrayed by school's administration, career center, and BME department. I really don't know, so much of the bio/health fields look interesting to me but I'm worried I'm just going to be disillusioned a few years into another degree program. I mean...I can't even find a shit lab tech job to get some exp. I love learning about how organic systems work, but I just don't know...


The independent research that got rejected was looking at was cell/tissue transplant rejection, specifically looking at parasitic male anglerfish's tissue fusion (and subsequent tissue atrophy) to females. It got rejected because no professors seemed to be working on anything similar. The research could benefit knowledge of angiogenesis, chimeras, histology, somatostatin &amp; growth hormones, tissue/organ rejection, tissue atrophy, etc. How would I go about finding a graduate program that would support this research? Or should I just stay away from bio altogether? Unemployment is driving me insane!


**TL:DR - How do I figure out what to go into? Should I? How do I know which PIs won't suck?**"

Met an amazing guy while volunteering in Asia last January 2011.  I'm a 22 y/o American and he is a 21 y/o Aussie. After leaving Asia, we both went to our respective countries but kept in touch and grew so close together and eventually fell in love.  I graduated in May and came here (Melbourne AUS) for an internship but more to be with him. 

I am one of those girls that will do anything for the people I care about - friends, family, boyfriend.  I love people carefully, but when I do, I love them unconditionally. He is one of those guys that every girl wants to date but no one believes exists.  Not a jealous bone in his body, incapable of being mean or selfish, and the most gentle and loving soul you will encounter.

He just broke up with me meh 10 hours ago.  He was meant to come home (USA) with me in December for Christmas to meet my family.  When I asked him about it again just two days ago, he really freaked at the thought of meeting my family (though I lived with his for 2 months), thought it was too much to invest emotionally and decided that he can't 'give me what I deserve'.  So yep, its over and I am now residing in a country where the number of people I know I can count on half of one hand.



Reddit, I'm searching for 43 ways to mend my broken heart over the next 43 days - until I go home (alone) for Christmas and am back with my family and closest friends.  What would you do? What do you suggest? I have never felt so alone or scared in my life, and it doesn't help being away from everyone I know.  I just want each day to have a purpose, to help me get through the next 6 weeks without him.

Anything, Reddit. Really, anything helps.

I know this is just stress. But I can't shake the feeling that I could just end it and not be worried anymore, not feel anything. I'll keep this brief- I feel like I can't talk without crying and wanting to self harm badly

I'm 19, live at home. Mother is a Jehovah's Witness and very, very strict about where I go and who I interact with. I can be kicked out very easy, and we have a bad history. 

I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder and off medication. I was hospitalized under a 5150 3-day psychiatric hold, after being detained and sent in a police car to the local hospital. This happened November 2010. I quit medication because I gained 40 lbs and my family will not stop outright mocking my weight. I have not told my psychiatrist.

I am triggered badly right this moment because of some pretty easy to list things. I normally do not type like this. I'm at the end of my rope.

1)I have not been going outside, or talking to friends, even online. This has gone on for months and it's both not being allowed to go out and see friends, and personal fear. I don't understand why I am afraid.
 
2) My living situation is more difficult. I am anxious and rarely talk to my family. My brother is visiting for two weeks, his wife has lived in our home for 7 months, and now they moved her elderly grandmother in here for who knows how long. This is a 2 bedroom home and I am scared of not having any space of my own anymore. I need to be alone frequently and crying publically will get me in trouble. And, holy fuck is this stupid- I'm scared of old people. A lot. Bad memories from a internship. 

3) If I have opportunities to go out, I have to lie to be able to go. I cannot ask to go somewhere with friends, or just leave. Most of this is my mother's doing, and she will threaten to kick me out or call me names (slut, accuse me of being a literal prostitute). She has called the police on me to be detained before (see 5150) and I do not pay rent. 

4) I am not being whiny or making things up- there are no jobs in my city. It is a medium-sized city and most jobs aavailable to me are minimum wage, and there are at least 200 applicants per job opening. I have sent out applications, but usually have to take Xanax and (I know) cry for a really long time to deal with stressing out over it. I have recieved no callbacks or interviews. No work history. 

Overall worst feeling is anxiety. I try to not benzos much at all. I have a prescription but rarely if ever fill it. I'm terrified of going to my psychiatrist. I do not want to talk to him. He ignored my self-harm problems (over 35 cuts on my body over the course of two months) and never addressed my hospital stay. I have mixed feelings about bipolar diagnosis (do not recall or believe I experience mania/hypomania ever) and also believe I have borderline personality disorder (maybe with bipolar, maybe misdiagnosed). 


Suicidal. I don't talk like this. I feel like my brain is swollen (...metaphorically? tension headache and being emotionally overwhelmed.) I want to take my car out to a nearby street with a 50mph speed limit and drive it into incoming traffic. I have ""attempted"" suicide twice before, once by climbing onto the outside railing of a highway bridge at 14, second time at 17 by slitting my forearm (extremely unintentional- Cut frequently, was battling strange auditory hallucination and used a much sharper blade than I meant to)

I think I should check in to a psychiatric ward. I am very afraid of my first experiences there. I feel it made me go much more unstable and anxious than I had ever been previously. I have many nightmares about the screaming people there being tied down, of watching many attempt suicide and cut themselves. The 6-day stay cost over 13,000, all covered by insurance. I am unsure if it would cover it all again. It was harrowing to be-at least I see it this way- imprisoned for that long. I have very terrible eating habits and awful sleep since then, and now am very afraid of psychiatric doctors. 

But I want to suffocate myself instead. I want to do this by either turning the cars on in the garage and sleep there tonight, or by tying a bag over my head and hope that kills me. I do not see why I should not. I am sorry this is so long. I do want help. i'm very scared. 

i do not feel: 
worthless

i do feel: unlike myself, panicked, remorseful, anxious in spite of .25 Xanax dose. I do not have more of it and do not abuse it. I feel killing myself would end my intense fear and stress. I feel stupid for thinking so and wish I could snap out of this. I am suicidal at least once every two weeks and formulate plans, and usually end up crying all night and cutting, and get better talking to my SO. My SO is not here, and this entire recurrent bad-suicidal-feelings won't go away with therapy (regular, 1x a week, free) or medication (Zoloft, quit it after 3 months, Depakote, quit after 8 months, currently PRN Xanax rarely)

I'm sorry. I'm such a pain in the ass with this and I wish this would just go away. I didn't keep this brief and my problems are too fuckin much for me to ever want to deal with. "

I have good extra curriculars, a good GPA, and lots of work experience, which includes an internship with GE Aviation. I'm a Southern California native and want to live and work there after I graduate, which is perfect because it seems to be where the biggest concentrations of companies in the industry are located - every major company is here in some capacity except for Honeywell.



My problem is, I go to school on the east coast and non of the Southern California recruiters for these companies have come to the career fairs at my school or those in the area around me. I've gone to three different career fairs in the past two months and managed to meet with Boeing and Northrop Grumman, but the representatives of those companies were interviewing for other locations and could only tell me to apply online.



Applying online hasn't yielded a single result. I've applied to every job in the area that I could find from every major company, and out of 15 or so applications I haven't gotten a single response or interview before my application is put in the ""no longer being considered"" bin. I've spend time crafting individual cover letters for every individual job explaining why I am qualified for the positions (and I am), yet I haven't been able to get an interview. Only four of these applications are still ""under consideration"" and I'm not too hopeful.



My manager when I interned at GE Aviation was very supportive and after my internship ended sent out my resume and cover letter to the plant managers of the two small GE locations in Southern California, asking them to redistribute them to their teams. That was three months ago, and I haven't heard anything from them since.




I've asked friends, family, and career resources at my school for advice and they all agree that networking is the most important thing you can do to get an interview. This is where I need your help, Reddit. What can I do to network to get a job interview when I'm 2500 miles away from my desired job location? How do I make myself stand out when applying online to job postings? What else can I do to get my dream job?"

What I really need is some advice right now. It is my last semester at university and I am able to enter a very strict job field. I will require a high level security clearance with many of the jobs I will be applying for. I am in the Computer Security field. The issue I am having is a lot in my life seems to be going wrong lately. It feels any decision I make goes the wrong way for me. 

About 2 years ago my father died of a massive heart attack, my uncle died about 3 months ago of a cancer, and about 1 month ago my grandfather(father's side) died of cancer as well. I know depression has a very big part of what I am feeling right now and I should talk to someone immediately.

My school recently went to a hacking competition, and I was the first person the professor in charge asked about attending. I had said no but still helped the rest of the team with training. Well it turns out they got first place in the competition, and will all be getting $5000 scholarships, internships, and other prizes.

To top it off I am not eligible for a security clearance since I have tried marijuana within the past year. The ironic thing is it actually helped with what I have been feeling lately. However I will have to wait some time in order to go for a security clearance (about 6 months). What I am feeling right now is a point where I know is very dangerous for me. I am extremely depressed and cannot find the time to get help. My grades have been slipping, I feel the work load I am under may cause me to crack, and almost nothing I do right now doesn't give me any joy. The only thing I had left that I enjoyed was the cyber security exercises to which I dropped out and eventually lost a $5000 scholarship. Previous teams have used me as a scape goat for past failures and this was the first time I have had a change to make a difference but didn't. I don't know what to do right now. The aspect of a job is looming over my head and if I go for now right this moment I will be disqualified predominantly from a security clearance.

What should I do Reddit, I feel there are not a whole lot of people I can talk to right now but maybe the hive mind can point me in the right direction."

It will be also helpful if you give me some topics to reach another level of programming like somethings that not all the people use but help a lot.

My editor came in with a large manila envelope, excited. ""Hey, Rose! Great news! We just got a manuscript! This is a learning opportunity for you; take a look at the cover letter and manuscript, and let me know if you think it's good for our company.""

Let me preface by saying that the quality of the books this company has put out are sub-par at best, and I say that without a trace of the snobbishness that my degree in English entitles me to (and Lord knows it entitles me to little else). They focus on childrens' books of varying genres, and none of them are what I'd call remarkable, or even all that enjoyable.

Now onto the manuscript.

It sucks.

It's written by some Oklahoma mom who admits to being ""deep in the trailer parks"", and has a ""fool-proof"" way to potty-train your child that ""takes 3-5 dys"" and has ""been proven to be very successful"" (this is all in the cover letter; extensive studies I do not think she has). A quick glance through the manuscript gives me the impression that she's haughty, up-her-own-butt, self-righteous, and disguising it as kitschy Bible belt humor.

Now as I said, the manuscript sucks, but so does the company. And I think this isn't entirely out of the company's reach. It's about on par with everything else they've published so far.

We have a mix of Windows/Linux hosts with probably about a 4:1 Windows:Linux ratio. We have a SAN at each Data Center with fiber to most of our servers. Our racks are well kept, clean, organized, as is our Data Center floor (IE cabinets, shelf-space, spare cables). We already have a monitoring system we're relatively happy with (SNMP E-mail alerts, up/down monitoring). The power in our racks are all 0U PDUs. We also have raised floors.

lpe4o,8,2011-10-26,Interview with MS tomorrow for Software Engineer Intern position,raphzthename,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lpe4o/interview_with_ms_tomorrow_for_software_engineer/,"I have never really interviewed for any position within the industry, so I'm really nervous. I don't fear the behavioral questions, but more so the technical questions they may ask. Can anyone shed some light on some of the questions you've encountered?

**Edit:** A few of you asked how the interview went, so I wanted to update my post to include information that may be helpful for future interviewers. The interview started off well enough. I have always handled behavioral questions well, so I thought I did a very good job at the beginning of the interview. When it came to my work experience, I felt I did a good job breaking down what my duties and tasks were, but the interviewer still seemed confused. I basically tried to explain that at my current internship, I work with a team that is responsible for managing a web app. My duties were mainly to create static mockups of the HTML pages that would then be implemented into the web app and put into production. For whatever reason, this wasn't clear to him as he kept asking whether the pages were offline or online. I thought static implied that the pages I worked on were offline and that once put into production, they would be online, but perhaps there was a better way for me to explain it? I never really felt like he fully grasped it, no matter how I tried to explain it.

The interview was thirty minutes long and after all of the behavioral and work experience questions came the technical ones. He asked me what I software I used daily that I would like to improve. I kind of blanked for a minute. I couldn't really think of any improvements except for making the software faster or various little interface changes (such as the horrible ribbon in MS Office). I ended up telling him that I use GrabIt to download nzb files and I would like to see a feature implemented that allows you to limit the maximum download bandwidth. The only settings within the software are to assign your downloads a priority (high, medium, low), but the program always downloads at maximum speed which doesn't bode well if you are trying to browse the web at the same time. Had to take a bit of time to explain what nzbs were since he was not familiar with them.

With about ten minutes left in the interview, I was handed a piece of paper and a pencil and asked me to code a program that would take a number (such as 25) and print out the Fibonnaci sequence leading up to that number. This is the part of the interview where I truly froze. My mind knew what to do and I tried to communicate this out loud. I told him that the most efficient way would probably be to use a recursive method, but I was honestly rusty with recursive methods, so I would try to approach it a different way. I started writing a method that had an **int number** as a parameter. I instantiated a previous, current, and total **int** within the method and then created a while (total &lt;= number). Then I blanked. I knew what I wanted to do, but I just couldn't find the right logic to complete the program.

Before I knew it, my time was up and I had to hand him an incomplete program. Thanked him for his time and while walking to my next class, the logic finally came to me. Scribbled it out and continued to kick myself for the remainder of the day for not being able to figure it out during the interview. Needless to say, I don't expect to be hearing back from them. I was pretty disappointed with myself, especially since I knew how to do it. If I didn't know the answer, I wouldn't have been so down, but each experience is a learning one."

So I'm at the start of my 4th year studying Computer Science at a state university. When I came in as a video-gaming freshman, I couldn't have been more excited about computer science. Afterall, if I loved playing video games, certainly I'd love programming right?! Wrong. Dont get me wrong, I'm a decent programmer and I love computers, but as the years go on in my studies, the less and less appealing a 9-5 deskjob sounds to me. These suspicions were confirmed over this last summer. 

Over the summer I had an internship at a large company full of manufacturing engineers. My task was creating an in-house iPad application as well as writing a few Python scripts. The work environment was the typical cubicle farm and it didnt take me very long to realize that I was out of place. These engineers had to be the most depressing thing I saw all summer. Their entire lives centered around work. They were all overweight from sitting in one place all day. They'd spend easily over 50hrs/wk shuffling through emails, going to meetings, and yelling at guys at the plant. Fortunately, being a computer science intern and not a manufacturing engineer, my work day was alot different, though equally as boring.

In school I'll spend 1-2 hrs a day working on a programming assignment...I couldn't handle spending 8 hrs programming every single day of the week, in the same chair, with the same gray view. I understand that the real world wont be like school, but I certainly know now that I don't want to be doing a desk-monkey job for the rest of my life.

I was also excited about computer science because the job market pays generally pretty well. This isnt so much of a concern now for me. I want to enjoy my future job. I want to be excited about going to work each morning. As I look around me in classes, I notice that other CS students have a passion that I just dont really have anymore. They still get excited about dong their homework assignments, and they even program things for fun outside of class. I don't know if it's just lack of motivation on my part, or maybe programming just isn't my thing.

Anyway, I've been looking at other career paths that would use my degree, yet keep me excited. I've considered doing something in computer security or forensics as I have always loved caper/myster films like Ocean's 11, Italian Job, and whatnot, so I figured that using my skills against clever criminals would keep me on my feet and be exciting. Afterall, I'm a lock-picking hobbyist, so maybe a job in security would be exciting. 

Really, I'm just looking for a career that doesn't involve living in a single office chair typing away repetively at a screen all day. I need something fresh and new each day, something exciting. Any ideas?

**tl;dr** A straight programming job is loosing it's luster, any exciting CS careers come to mind?"

ls7qz,25,2011-10-28,A few stories from the education sector - clueless contractors,PhoenixFox,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ls7qz/a_few_stories_from_the_education_sector_clueless/,"I'm currently at university, studying Ethical Hacking and Countermeasures, which is an entire story in itself. But my main experience of tech support comes from working this summer, in a private highschool. I got the gig because my uncle works there, and I was essentially a barely paid intern, but what the hell, nobody else would employ me. What's the job like in general? Well, there's a rather fantastic [blog](http://angrytechnician.wordpress.com/) on the subject, it's well worth a read-through.

Going from personal experience, however, I've got quite a few stories to tell. If I try to get them all into one post, we'll be here all day, so I'm going to give a bit of generality, and then talk about the contractors I had to deal with.

The school I was working for was across two sites (just down the road from each other), and actually included a nursery and primary school, two secondary schools (boys and girls) and a sixth form college. The buildings include lots of horrible abominations from the 80s, and some rather lovely old buildings too, which bring their own challenges for networking (I've got some rather interesting photos). As those of you who work in education will already know, the usual procedure is to upgrade the network, and whatever hardware is being replaced, during the summer holidays, when the IT guys can basically have the run of the school. Being a rather highly regarded private school, there's a rather large budget for the upgrades, and this means a huge amount of moving and replacing of PCs; we had about £200,000 of gear arriving, mostly from Dell, and it was delivered in two loads, one to each site. Oh, that did not go well! The first load was delivered to the wrong site, with us being left to move all the gear ourselves... and when we got in on the morning of the second delivery, we discovered that it had /already/ been dropped off, and was simply left outside the door of the other site, since there was nobody there at half five to accept it. We were just mind boggled that the delivery men had left a hundred grand's worth of PCs and projectors sitting in the middle of the playground.

Then, you've got BT. Anyone who's had to deal with BT will probably agree that they're generally rather incompetent- this is the company that shut down their training center, only to then take on a huge group of apprentices, before realising they had nowhere to train them. Herp a fucking derp.BT's people came in to deal with most of the networking that was being redone, and it was a bit of a shambles. For starters, we had to re-terminate or move about three dozen cables across the two sites, and we had one networking cabinet that fell off the wall about a week after it was installed. I literally walked in one morning to find the networking manager holding up fifteen grand's worth of gear; ""Oh, good to see you, can you fetch a screwdriver and help me with this?""

Then there was the guy who saw the holes cut in the trunking, ready for the power and network points, and completely ignored them, running the cables through a badly drilled hole in the end of the trunking, down to the skirting board, and around the corner, putting in his own boxes for the connections.

I also got the job of recabling a room where the cupboards containing the networking, power and AV cabling had been ripped out. I found a tangled heap of cabling on the floor, and ended up having to run a chain of extension leads right along one wall to get power. Once I had the whole thing working, I had about a third of the cables left over, and none of us were able to work out where the hell they'd come from. Presumably they were just sitting behind the cupboards, doing nothing.

Not strictly related, but another funny cabling nightmare. I was trying to turn on the power for a new PC, which was plugged into a 4-port bar extension on the floor. I traced this extension on to another, 4-port reel extension (with only that one port used). I followed that cable, and was shocked to discover that it went up into the ceiling, running across the classroom and down on the other side of the classroom. To add insult to injury, it was plugged into a broken power socket.

Just a final little amusing story; we had portable appliance testers in. Not only are they *terrible* for wrapping their labels around cables, inevitably creating a sticky mess for the next person to handle them, but they also have a habit of sticking the labels right over joins; monitors to stands, or those boxes on the back of Dell workstations that protect the rear panels. They also stick them on the boxes, which means they end up getting mixed up when we're working on several PCs at once. The real kicker, however, was them opening up a box of fully wrapped kettle cables, testing them all, and wrapping them all back up. We'd been about to throw the entire lot away (Blame Dell for refusing to not pack new cables with every PC, despite us asking them repeatedly, and despite each PC being individually imaged for us anyway.)

Is there a personal project that I can try to do and complete in ~4 months to help me improve my hardware and integrated circuit knowledge?"
lrugx,20,2011-10-28,Going on 3 years of unemployment. I am lost. ,Spacebotzero,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lrugx/going_on_3_years_of_unemployment_i_am_lost/,"I can remember the day, being ushered out of my own office and paraded on past the entire sales floor. I could barely keep my personal belongings in my hands as people stood up in disbelief to hug me goodbye. They, nor I, could  believe that of the first 20 people to be laid-off that day, I was the 21st and last of the first of three rounds of layoffs. It was a completely surreal day for me. I remember the time, the exact day, and how quickly I went through a pack of cigarettes that my HR Manager friend had given me. We shared a few before I left the parking lot, since he was the one that had to give me the bad news and he too couldn't believe what he had to do that day. 

It's been three years now and on occasion I still have dreams that I am still working at my old job only to wake up to a reality check.

I'm 28 years old. I decided to go back to school to complete what I had started so long ago. I am currently pursing my degree in Marketing, which is something that being unemployed has let me do. Its slow going, but I earn my AA with one more semester at my Jr. College then off to transfer to complete my upper division classes at a university. I still live at home with my parents and now I hardly ever go out of my house. I've become more of a recluse than I have ever been in my entire life. I've become quite depressed, but I do meet with someone to talk to once a week. It helps. The hardest thing has been watching my closest of friends get married, have kids, and move on. I'm completely stuck. I'm moving in slow motion and everyone around me is sprinting. 


In the last three years, I've looked for work. I've had plenty of ""we will call you,"" but never hear anything back and one actual interview which  nothing came of. My most recent push was to network and I applied for a position for which I am more than qualified for. I applied for an IT position and was internally referred by my friend whom I've worked with for years at a prior job. He put in a great word for me and I met almost all of the requirements for this position. This was the best chance I'd have at actually getting a job and at a rather prestigious company. A few days later I received an email stating that I was not considered for the position. I wanted to disappear. 

I have no idea where I'm headed or where I should be going. I have no idea where I belong. My past work experience seems to have no clout. I've had my aunt who is director of HR up in Seattle look at my cover letters and Resumes, my father who also looked at it and got his approval (which is big), and other friends as well. 

I know it's beginning to sound like a rant here, but I don't know where to turn. Should I start looking outside of California? Should I just start pursing internships only? Do I just volunteer? 

I've never been out of work before. I started working when I was 15 all the way up to when I was 25. Then laid off and nothing. What would some of you do in my position? Help.

lro92,9,2011-10-27,Advice for a new grad who wants to develop a game,Xazen,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/lro92/advice_for_a_new_grad_who_wants_to_develop_a_game/,"I’m graduating in December with a degree in Computer Engineering and game development is the field that I really want to get into. I’ve kind of always known that is what I wanted to do. I love gaming, plus I like math and really like programming (I know anything I do will be software related). 

So I was seriously thinking of taking the next 6 months or so to try to develop my own game while working a part time job. I have experience programming (mainly C/C++ but a few others as well) from school as well as a couple internships, but most (all) of the programs that I have written have been console driven. The only thing gaming related I have made was a text based space invaders type game that used the ncurses library. I have no experience with graphics or art of any kind.

Alright, enough background. I just want to know if this is a realistic goal or not. I would really like to make something that is decent and could sell, at least a little. Thanks for your thoughts/advice.

EDIT: The alternative to this plan would be to go ahead and try to get a job at a development studio, but I don't know if they would hire right out of college or not. I was thinking making something on its own, even if not commercially successful itself, would help get a job somewhere. The last option would be to get a job doing some other programming and try to get into game development later, this appeals as I could go ahead and start paying off student loans..."

I am a founder of a tech startup (ctrleff.com), a year 4 computer science student in the National University of Singapore, and most importantly a passionate programmer. And I am seeking (freelance/consulting) development projects in need of bootstrapping my startup as well as a living allowance.

But it is best to talk a bit about my experiences. I have been programming for at least a decade, and doing freelance work since 17 (I am 24 now). In my belt, I have a repertoir of experience in various programming languages such as C, C#, Java, Javascript, Python, Scheme (Lisp), Prolog, PHP. Lets not forget basic SQL (for database queries), bash scripting, html, css, etc. I am especially well experienced with web development (Django, Flask), and just gave a talk on the ""Rapid web development the right way"" of which you can view my slides at speakerdeck.com/u/nubela/p/rapid-web-development-the-right-way . I spent a year at internship at Videoplaza (Swedish tech startup for video advertising) in Stockholm, I have consulted with OCBC (local bank) and TheUpperStorey (marketing firm) on the OCBC Cycling marathon of which I helped with my experience in Django development. I am currently working on a startup on which the primary mode of development is on mobile clients (ctrleff.com).

You can perform some code review at github.com/nubela , you can also read about my recent solo attempt at http://e27.sg/2011/09/19/i-survived-...o-code-a-thon/ .

I'm running really low in cash now, and if theres any startups/companies out there that needs a developer who can seeks pleasure in getting his job done, and am extremely passionate about technology (linux advocate, pythonista, git-meiser) please do email me at nubela@ctrleff.com , thanks!

(PS I hope I did not violate any rules posting it here)"
