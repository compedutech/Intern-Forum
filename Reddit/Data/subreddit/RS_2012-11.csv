What should I expect?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12hhir/thinking_about_applying_for_an_internship_what/,Hey all- I am thinking about applying for an internship at Dell. I live in the area so it will not force me to move. Any idea what I should expect? What the benefits are?
12hcq0,2,2012-11-01,Buddy and I both interviewed at this place - he was picked over me. I need some input,factory81,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12hcq0/buddy_and_i_both_interviewed_at_this_place_he_was/,"I applied for a data analyst internship. I am employed part time in the  IT field with a good job in a company with lots of prospects. I am a senior in college as is my buddy. He is a telecom major - I am a CIS major.

Interesting story. The data analyst position is posted on a Friday - my buddy applies right away and gets a response - he is invited to come to a SQL training seminar that would be in 1 week. I submit my resume that following Wednesday and do not hear from them. I attend the SQL training event just out of genuine curiosity/desire to learn - meet the employer there, introduce myself and give another resume. I even watched a presentation of theirs which obviously spoke to what they care about. I showed my interest - he didn't even attend!

INTERVIEW TIME! I get a first interview - everything goes well. Second interview - I fail to answer one of their trivia/riddle questions and when asked a technical question I failed to demonstrate a complete understanding of the topic.  Second interview - everything goes well. Good conversation - even great conversation. They invite myself, my friend, and another guy to a 1 day ""prove yourself"" event where we work with some data.

I end up showing my buddy/the other guy how to even use.....a PivotTable in Excel.....(which was required for the exercise). We analyze some data together for 9 HOURS - and report on it. I give a good report, my buddy gives his on edge a little more and sounds overly nervous. I even try and use more advanced features to analyze data.




I have a few concerns;

-We both agree that I am more qualified for the position we applied for. 

-my background in IT/background knowledge is far greater then his. While my degree has a stronger emphasis on software development, reporting, and databases. His is all telecom. My work experience/past experience puts my leaps and bounds ahead of him. 

-My current/previous employers are all IT related. I have absolutely no history of doing crappy fast food jobs. my buddy has a typical ""high school"" resume. Lots of crappy jobs. He even worked at my current employer in a lesser position - and was let go as the work was only temp. Where as I am still employed there....

-We both agreed I would likely be the one to get it if anyone in our group did.

So as a result I am genuinely confused. Obviously the tone of this message is ""I am better then him"" - and my buddy and I both kind of agree on that. All 3 of us reported VERY similar results and no one really did a better job there. I am just so clueless - as is he. My buddy and I are just both questioning what works and what doesn't?

/r/Jobs, why was I not picked? My only idea is that I come off as to aggressive/arrogant. But I try and be very modest in reality. Another thought is that maybe the level of expectations were higher with me? As in my buddy exceeded expectations while I disappointed.

Anyone have any clues on how to analyze this further? "

I would really appreciate some insight from non French people. Any input is welcome!"
12gng6,11,2012-11-01,"I want to be a game designer, but I hear it's not entry level.  Should I focus on skills to get me a job as a programmer (i.e, c++), or make as many games as possible (i.e, unity)",hybriddj,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/12gng6/i_want_to_be_a_game_designer_but_i_hear_its_not/,"In the past few years I have progressed from making half finished games in GameMaker and RPG Maker, to completing a few minigames in Javascript and Canvas, to finally publishing two games on Windows Phone.

As I get into more coding-heavy environments, I am starting to realize that while I do enjoy the problem solving aspect of coding, I feel as if that's only true because they are relatively simple 2D games, and if they were much more complex studio games, it would be way over my head.

On the other hand, I've always really enjoyed the design aspects of my games, but as I have read in the sidebar links, ""design is not an entry level job.""

So I'd like some advice.  I have some time off before I go back to school for my final two semesters.  As I have said, I've made a few games, but I want to make more to enhance my portfolio before I apply for jobs or internships.  I see three options in front of me.


**Option One: The C++ Route - programming**

This option comes from the fact that you have to do something before being a game designer, and in this case it would be with the thought of being a programmer.

Many jobs I've seen for entry level programmers in a game studio require experience in C++.  Unfortunately, I have none! I've made games in C#, and web languages, but that's about it.

It would take a while to learn C++, I wouldn't be able to make as many games, or as complicated games, but I will come out a better programmer because of it.

**Option Two: The Unity Route - well rounded development**

This option comes from the strategy of making as many games as possible, to increase my development experience.  I feel like this would make me a better designer, more quickly, but I'm unsure how it would affect my chances at getting an entry level job at a game studio.

I've never made a 3D game, so Unity would definitely be a great learning experience as well. I'd be able to create more complex things than in C++, so I'd improve in my overall game development abilities, instead of mainly design or just programming.  But again, I'm not sure what entry level position that puts me up for.

**Option Three: Mods and level design - design**

I am slightly skeptical of this option, just because it seems like people say to make mods and edit levels before making real games, which I've done.  However, I can see the merits of this kind of work; modding or level editing would give me access to the complexity that couldn't be matched by the games I make, which might be a good learning experience as well.  Especially for level design positions, which might be more entry level than the game designer position.

Many of you probably have industry experience where you could shed some light on my issue, and it would be great to hear your opinions.  I may have some misconceptions about what I've said, so I apologize in advance.

Ultimately, I want to be a game designer, but I realize there may be some hurdles before I get there; I just want to maximize my chances in making it happen.

Thanks!


**Edit: I have made games before, and I do know how to program.  I'm curious about the balance between focusing on becoming a better designer but also having the skills (such as C++ for many studios) to get an entry level job, which many say would have to be programming, art, or QA.**"

Nationality: Indian

Age: 22 years old

Sex: Male

Educational Background: Chartered Accountant Degree attained recently from The Institute of Chartered Accountants Of India

Job Skills: Freshly cleared CA, so no work experience yet. But, I have done 3.5 years of internship and I am familiar with Accounts, Audit, Financial Management, Costing, and Indian Laws and Taxation

Language Skills: My English is fluent and I can speak with an accent.

Alternate Destinations: Tell me which options I have other than US/Canada/Europe and I'll consider them

Temporary/Permanent migration: Permanent

**My questions are:**

1) Does anyone have any advice on how/where to start?

2) Which country should I set my eyes on? I would like the US and UK, but I hear it's really tough to get in. Canada seems like a good option. And I wouldn't have a problem with European countries like France, Germany, Italy, etc but If I do decide on a European one, what about languages? How much time would it take for me to learn French/German/Italian/etc and how would I start?

3) What should I do? Leave for studies abroad and then apply for a work visa once I have finished studies or directly go for a job?

4) If I do go for studies abroad, which degrees have a good demand to them so that I can assure that I will get a work visa after my education is complete? What would be the relevant costs and time period?

5) If I go for a job abroad, which countries accept a degree of Chartered Accountancy from India and are willing to hire? How would I even begin doing interviews and landing a job? Once I have the job, how do I assure my residency is made permanent?

6) I just have to ask; I'm obese, specifically around 120 kilograms and have a height of 5 feet 7 inches. Would my weight/BMI be a problem if and when a medical test is conducted? Is weight/BMI given any consideration when applying for a visa?

I work for an online marketing firm that owns a few websites directed towards a female audience. At the moment I'm building a network of bloggers that guest-post in our biggest website to improve our content and have a more down-to-earth feel.

I also contact brands in order to sell them ""our bloggers"" and our website as channels to build their brands within their target audience. As payment we want some stock of their products so we can later use them to keep the bloggers happy.

Let me list you my office problems: we don't pay the guest-bloggers, I have zero budget to incentivise them, and I'm also not allowed to present the bloggers to the brands I contact because that would allow them to negotiate directly with them.

I've told my bosses that we need to formalize our relationship with the bloggers (become something like an agency), and also have a ""packaging"" (a visual presentation of the bloggers) so we can present them to potential clients and stop selling smoke to everyone all the time.

No-one is reacting to my suggestions at the office, the bloggers are slowly getting tired of me not giving anything back, brands don't want to engage and I get a really shitty intern salary.

Outside-office problem: I have to go back to college in march to finish my degree but I need to save money to pay for my living expenses and if I change jobs now it will probably take me a month to find a new internship and if that doesn't happen, I'll have to work shifts at bars, kitchens and that sort of stuff. 

I could just stay and collect my money at the end of the month until I go back to school, but I feel miserable here and I really want to learn new things and be involved in a better planned project. 

Should I risk it, quit and try to find something quickly or should I stay put where I am? Am I being a moany bitch?

12hzhh,4,2012-11-02,"Future plans - sensible, or not really?",Throwini,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12hzhh/future_plans_sensible_or_not_really/,"I'm looking for opinions and input about whether my plan makes sense.

History: First time around, I had an undiagnosed medical problem that as a result led to missing the majority of classes, and not completing the majority of work. I did eventually graduate - just - with a GPA under pass, with a BS in Chemistry, which I was mostly studying since A) I didn't really know what I wanted to do, and B) it was the major I had most of the prereqs for, and C) family pressure to finish. Since then, said medical problem has been diagnosed and treated, and as long as I take a little white pill every morning, I'm perfectly healthy.

Over the last year or so of recovering, and the last couple of classes to graduate, I've thought a lot more about what I enjoyed doing, done a few of the various online classes that have recently become popular and enjoyed it - and done well - and I'm a lot more certain that this is where my interests lie. I've also historically always been very, very good at math and the (limited) programming I'd done in the past.

That said, my options:

1) Try and get a job as an inexperienced programming hire. Probably difficult - no experience, no projects I could put on a resume - Yet! Cons: learning the less-immediately-useful stuff covered at uni is more difficult without feedback, or occasional motivation, or even simply knowing it exists to learn.

2) I have an offer from one of the best CS universities here (non-US,) to study CS as an undergrad. My previous classes will count for their gen-ed requirements, so this is probably ~3 years worth, less if I apply for every exemption possible (I probably wouldn't try to exempt everything - some of the classes I scraped a pass in, I honestly don't know the material at all.) 

3) Try and get a masters place in a CS course. Problems: I doubt many would accept me, given my GPA and lack of prereq classes. It could potentially be quicker.

Financially:

 - I have about $40k in savings, the majority from a deceased grandparent, with a tentative verbal (non-binding) wish: 'use it towards your education.' 
 - If I go into undergrad, I pay zero tuition, and receive $15k/year non-repayable (it's income, not a loan) from the govt here until either I graduate, 4 years have passed, or I stop studying fulltime. Catch: I have to start within the next 1.5 years, and can't take a semester off or drop to part-time.
 - If I go into a masters, I pay tuition, unsure of the amount, and do not get anything from the govt. 
 - There's also the possibility of working part-time, and obviously I'll try for summer internships each year.
 - I'm independent, flexible and have no real commitments (I live in a rental, no debt, family lives a very long way away. Rent is expensive, I'd be lucky to pay less than $200/wk + bills. No car, but don't need one.)

Financially, I think this leans towards studying undergrad.

Academically/motivation:

 - I would like to go into computer science, possibly into AI or machine learning, but I'd also like to get the broader background. My motivations behind wanting further study are not just 'degree to get a job'
 - I enjoy learning, and find this kind of thing to be really interesting. There is a slight possibility that I could be interested in research, too, though not academia. 
 - I don't have enough programming experience - yet - to be able to get a job through experience, though FizzBuzz and the like are simple. 

Very long term plans:

 - potentially move to the US or UK. I have EU and AUS passports, and Australia has a special work visa scheme with US which should make it simpler (one that doesn't usually hit it's quota.)
 - work on something I enjoy. Not so concerned about how much it pays. 


I'm leaning towards accepting the CS undergraduate, even if it means more time, and neglecting to mention I ever studied another degree to any potential employers. 

 - Anything I haven't considered here? 
 - Best way to explain the gap in history, without going into medical details or showing the old transcript?
 - **If you were me, what would you do?**"

I work in risk reporting (about a year so far) and would ideally like to get into a quant equity research type of role.

Background info: math/stats undergrad + a math finance graduate degree working at a major Canadian bank in Toronto. I passed the CFA L2 Exam this past summer and I gotta say...I REALLY enjoy the CFA material.  Looking back, I just wish I had taken business courses to get a good grasp of fundamentals (and not just courses on probability/option pricing/stochastic calculus). Of course some good internship experience would have been ideal as well, but my resume is almost all academic.

I used to work in model development (about 1.5 years) at an insurance company, but left because my career was heading towards becoming an actuary.  So I've got a pretty good modelling background from my previous role and a broad understanding of the financial industry from a risk point of view from my current role.

I would really like to get into investment/asset management as a quant, but what's really hurting me is (a) I don't have the relevant experience, and (b) Toronto is pretty small...who's hiring?

When I sit down to do programming for class I feel like I could be getting paid for it. Not mention, the stuff I'm doing in my internship is much more interesting than the projects or homeworks. I graduate in 1 month anyway, if Reddit doesn't prevent me. Double major in math. It's been a rough 4 years to say the least. I got into some trouble freshman year and got kicked out of my dorm/school, quickly transferred right after the incident to a better school and dominated my sophomore and junior years. School was cake. Now, however, I'm plagued by even the thought of getting started and I wait til the last minute to start. I'm producing crap but still passing ±0.25 of the std. dev. so I'm not too worried, just tired of school. Honestly, at times, I feel embarrassed to be doing so well and trying so little. 

I've gotten some full-time offers but have yet to accept anything. Some offers are too far but pay well (80k) while others are close and pay average (60k). I want a lot of stuff so naturally the more the better. Living at home could save me ~12-16k/year but what fun is that. However, in terms for student loan debt, from what I estimate, I have more than the average student ~$46.5k but I've already paid ~$8.5k so I really have ~$38k left. I received tons of need/merit based aid too, went to public school, and took 4 AP courses in high school. It's retarded expensive to go to college, even if you do everything right like me ;)

Car has been having problems recently and I just found out I need to pay another 2k for the Fall semester since I dropped a class because of laziness and bc I didn't need it for anything, just an elective to reach full-time (12 credits). I lost a 2k scholarship that was already credited to my account since I dropped to 9 credits. Bullshit is that shit. Pretty mad about dat doe.

Thinking about buying a GTI too. Wicked awesome little cars. Have yet to test drive one but looking forward. That, or a 2013 audi/bmw Just can't wait til school is over and I get started at my job, save vigorously a few months (12-24), pay off all my loans &amp; get a nice ride to replace the POS granny-mobile 02 toyota solara I've been rocking the past ~4 years. Hopefully a nice car will impress easy-to-get girls. If not, I can still appreciate the german engineering....

12mkek,16,2012-11-04,"First job out of school--how important, really? I accepted an offer I'm really not happy with; should I keep looking (and eventually renege), or deal with it?",the_bell_tolls,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12mkek/first_job_out_of_schoolhow_important_really_i/,"I'll try to be as concise as possible: 

--Soon-to-be CS grad (December).

--3.5+ GPA from a nationally recognizable (but not elite) school.

--Interned at a large, well known tech company this past summer (same company whose offer I'm currently feeling buyer's remorse on).

--Two other internships in addition to the above.

--Very strong soft skills (e.g. writing/public speaking/presenting).

--Proven skills in desirable areas (mobile and web development).

--Proven ability to think differently (through innovative projects I've created or taken on).

In short, I'm not an absolute superstar (my school/educational background doesn't do me any favors), but I'm still a strong candidate by any reasonable measure. While I enjoyed the aforementioned internship for the most part, there were several things I saw and learned about the company as a whole that I didn't really like (no major ethical concerns or anything of that sort, just cultural issues).

For a variety of reasons that I'll only bother to expound upon if asked, I ended up accepting an offer from said company before I really had a chance to go through full interview cycles with all of the other companies I was interested in.

These are some of the tangible reasons for my concern:

--I accepted a mediocre starting salary (it's actually quite poor with respect to the upper echelons of the tech industry), and I'll be working in an area with a high cost of living. Before you ask: the offer was non-negotiable (I tried, and had leverage). Money is not my primary motivator but it still chafes to see people I know with inferior qualifications taking much more lucrative offers. Given the current demand for up-to-date developers, I feel like I severely undersold myself.

--The job involves travel. This sounded exciting to me until I actually started traveling regularly for interviews. While traveling, I feel lonely and disconnected from my family/friends and the rest of my life in general. I'm an extrovert, which you might think subdues that effect (because I can and will engage people I don't know), but it actually amplifies it tremendously.

--I have a strong suspicion that my skills will be underutilized, which will prevent me from growing. I'm not expecting to be given any authority or placed on high profile engagements as an inexperienced hire, but I do at least want to be challenged and given an opportunity to show what I can do...and I'm not at all sure I will get that in this job.

If it seems like I'm whining or being unreasonable, I apologize. I'm sure plenty of people (especially soon-to-be or recent grads in other majors) would trade places with me in a heartbeat, but I'm not here by accident. I got here though an enormous amount of hard work and careful planning, and I don't want to see all of it screwed to pieces because of this. I don't expect a ""perfect"" job or an exorbitant salary; I just want to be content. And for the reasons above, among others, I already feel as though I won't be.

The question is: what do I do about this? What are my options at this point, and the potential/likely consequences of each?

Thanks, guys."

I'm currently working for a small but fast-growing start-up company. We recently hired some new employees and interns and we have a strong suspicion some of them are wasting loads of time on the internet and/or visiting possible damaging (porn/warez) websites.

At the moment we don't have a proper network, just a router connected to a monitor. 

I was hoping someone can suggest us a good, free monitoring tool so we can see what kind of websites are visited and for how long? It doesn't need to do more than that. 

Thanks."
12oppb,2,2012-11-05,I do not have a web development portfolio and client's won't hire me because I don't have one. How do I get started in web development professionally?,AspiringWebDev,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12oppb/i_do_not_have_a_web_development_portfolio_and/,"Forgot to add this is a x-post from /r/webdev

Contemplated for a long time whether to post this in fear it would just be taken as a sob story but I really need help so here goes.

Hey Reddit, I'm currently a college student who just finished my first year in Comp Sci. 

I come from a single parent family and my mother has been unemployed for a few years. Since the age of 14 I've been learning web development on my own so I could help with the financial difficulties of my mother and myself. During high school, I worked at multiple minimum pay jobs (places like McDonald's). Then one day in grade 12, the apartment where my mother and I lived at had a bedbug outbreak. Long story short, this apartment already had the issue in previous years, and since we were the first tenants to notice the first bedbug in 12 months, the manager put the blame on us and took us to some tenant's dispute court. We couldn't afford a lawyer and the government cut back on free lawyer services for tenant disputes so we were forced to pay $4000 CAN for ""damages"". 

This was when I decided that going to law school (despite having had a scholarship) and leaving my mother to fend for herself was not an option. I applied to the local technical college to pursue my interest in Computer Science. After finishing my first year, I went into the co-op program and am currently working at a company with ~70k employees worldwide. Because of my family's financial situation, I have dropped out and extended my ""internship"" with this company. However, with the constant budget cuts and because most of the interns here are graduates or 3rd year students, I am at a disadvantage and have no hope for getting a full-time or contractor position.

I have wanted to break into freelance web development for quite a while now, but I do not have a portfolio to show. Every company/person I have approached will not even let me make something for them for free, partly due to my age, but mostly because I have nothing to show off.

I am looking for some guidance from the Reddit community and most important of all, I would appreciate if you guys could let me work with you (remotely) on some of your projects for free.

Sorry for the long wall of text, I'm not great with words.

Edit: I noticed I wasn't being very clear in my original post. Web development is a passion I have and I hope to get into it professionally.

[Why did the newer spongebob episodes stop being funny?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tm4te?context=5)|Mostly because parents were complaining and Nick had to crack down on the innuendos.
[When the show got big did you brag at school about being a voice? Did anyone not believe you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6to6f2?context=5)|My dad would come into all my elementary school classes and do a presentation about how to draw Hey Arnold, so I was already pretty well known for having cartoon connections. Spongebob didn't really get big until about 2 years after I did the theme song so I almost forgot about it for a while. I didn't put 2 and 2 together until middle school.  
[Favorite spongebob episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tlw4h?context=5)|Hooky! The one where they ride the fish-hooks edit: actually Band Geeks might be my favorite, as a band geek.
[Since you say you're a band geek, are you a fan of the Phantom Regiment Drum Corps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tpg8k?context=5)|Unfortunately I never got into drum corps, but I was in the UCLA marching band for a few years! 
[What do you play? I used to play oboe. They made me stop in high school when I had to do marching band because ""if you trip the reed is going straight into your brain"".  So I picked up bass drums, saxophone, and the pit instruments. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6ts35d?context=5)|Play trumpet, I was in the Rose Parade herald trumpets a few years back in high school. 
[Is mayonnaise an instrument?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tu5z1?context=5)|No, and horseradish isn't an instrument either. 
[Did you do anything for Invader Zim or Avatar The Last Airbender? Those are still my two favorite shows on Nick (no offence\). Also, what was the sense of humor of the staff over at the studio? Did any of the voice actors tell any off color raunchy jokes in the voice of show characters, for example? Also, Viacom: Great evil, or The Greatest Evil?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tqc2o?context=5)|I never had anything to do with those shows, but I can vouch for the sense of humor. These guys have dirty minds. Some of the animators would have topless drawings of sandy on their walls, or graphic pictures of patrick's butt, etc.

For instance, I've met Snooki: [Link to i.imgur.com](http://i.imgur.com/HkU4M.jpg)
 |But the nicest person was probably John Heder (Napoleon Dynamite). He was pitching a show a while back with his identical twin brother (I met them both) and I showed him how I knew the dance from Napoldeon Dynamite. He was impressed :P Can't find the photo right now but I'll try to find it. 
[How many kids were there? What part did you sing, if not all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12b3rd/i_am_a_childs_voice_in_the_spongebob_squarepants/c6tmqgr?context=5)|We all just sang the whole thing, screamed it more like!

[Holy crap. I recognized your Dad's name immediately from ""Hey Arnold!""-- that's my all time favorite show!! You both are awesome! I'm also a huge old school Spongebob fan.

12ne7t,4,2012-11-04,College student struggling to survive. Looking to break into web development,[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/12ne7t/college_student_struggling_to_survive_looking_to/,"Contemplated for a long time whether to post this in fear it would just be taken as a sob story but I really need help so here goes.

Hey Reddit, I'm currently a college student who just finished my first year in Comp Sci. 

I come from a single parent family and my mother has been unemployed for a few years. Since the age of 14 I've been learning web development on my own so I could help with the financial difficulties of my mother and myself. During high school, I worked at multiple minimum pay jobs (places like McDonald's). Then one day in grade 12, the apartment where my mother and I lived at had a bedbug outbreak. Long story short, this apartment already had the issue in previous years, and since we were the first tenants to notice the first bedbug in 12 months, the manager put the blame on us and took us to some tenant's dispute court. We couldn't afford a lawyer and the government cut back on free lawyer services for tenant disputes so we were forced to pay $4000 CAN for ""damages"". 

This was when I decided that going to law school (despite having had a scholarship) and leaving my mother to fend for herself was not an option. I applied to the local technical college to pursue my interest in Computer Science. After finishing my first year, I went into the co-op program and am currently working at a company with ~70k employees worldwide. Because of my family's financial situation, I have dropped out and extended my ""internship"" with this company. However, with the constant budget cuts and because most of the interns here are graduates or 3rd year students, I am at a disadvantage and have no hope for getting a full-time or contractor position.

I have wanted to break into freelance web development for quite a while now, but I do not have a portfolio to show. Every company/person I have approached will not even let me make something for them for free, partly due to my age, but mostly because I have nothing to show off.

I am looking for some guidance from the Reddit community and most important of all, I would appreciate if you guys could let me work with you (remotely) on some of your projects for free.

Sorry for the long wall of text, I'm not great with words.

I know

*PHP

*Wordpress

*HTML(5)/CSS(3)

*Javascript/jQuery

*Some SEO

*API development

*Responsive design

Edit: I noticed I wasn't being very clear in my original post. Web development is a passion I have and I hope to get into it professionally. It's not just a something I want to do to ""survive"" and get by. As for the degree, I will try my best to complete it, but I never know what may happen to further block that path. If that is the case, I will not finish the degree just for the sake of having one if it brings major struggles for my family."
12n2vq,304,2012-11-04,"Wait, Windows isn't free?",pizzaboy192,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/12n2vq/wait_windows_isnt_free/,"Here's my wonderful story from about 2 years ago.

I used to work at a wonderful smalltown phone company that provided tech support to local businesses for a set yearly fee. We'd also do things like computer repair for internet customers, set up TV and DVR systems for customers, and would order machines through Dell Business to then resell to customers. It wasn't the worst place in the world, but it also wasn't something awesome to be at. (I got paid $10\hr 5 days a week as an intern, so I won't complain). 

The biggest problem was the supervisor who I (and the rest of my coworkers) had to deal with. The kindest way to describe him was a grade-A idiot. He had 4 years of tech school training from 1999, and a few years in the Marines. That was his entire work history before getting a job where I worked. And he was in charge of all IT orders, and customer relations. (To make it worse, he got busted by the company for stealing over $6k in merchandise from the company, but they couldn't let him go because he was the only person who knew how to set up the DVR systems)

Anyways, on to the horror:

IT supervisor decides to sell a local business a new server (Their old one was a re-purposed Dell tower that we had sold them a few years prior) and promptly quoted them a price before even checking with Dell (I think he quoted them something like $900 for a server with 2TB in RAID, and 2 Xeon processors (he doesn't know what AMD means either) with 8GB of RAM). Mind you, this server was going to sit and serve files and possibly some quickbooks and an Exchange server. Nothing fancy, nothing he knew how to do.

He then calls Dell and sees how cheaply he can get the server for, as to mark it up to $900 and then keep the rest as profit. In cutting corners, he was able to get one from their refurb department for $750, with as many sub-par and out of date specs as he could. (DFS Direct Sales is a great spot to get business grade laptops for personal use btw)

One of the many things that our wonderfully bright IT supervisor kindly overlooked was the product description in BOLD saying ""NO OS"" in multiple places. He didn't ask anyone else in the department for approval since he was the supervisor and had all buying powers. 

A week or so later, the server arrives. it's also 4th of July weekend, and so nearly nobody is there. I was lucky enough to show up one of the days to basically man the place (and being an Intern, that was a scary proposition since I barely knew anyone who we had contracts for). 

Seeing the server, sitting on a testing table, all plugged in, running, sitting at the ""No Operating System Found"" prompt, with a support tag taped to it from the company that we sold it to saying that it wasn't working was a laugh. Taped behind it was a three page conversation from Dell's online chat support between the Supervisor and Dell. Three pages of him saying that the server was broken, and her telling him he ordered a NO OS system. On page three he finally asks what OS means. 

Needless to say, that debacle lead the company owners to re-evaluate his ability to buy products without approval from the rest of the department. Not that it kept him from buying the company's servers without our approval, and royally screwing them up too.

Glad I got out when I did. My co-workers who decided to tough it out say it hasn't gotten better yet.

tl:dr: idiot IT Supervisor orders refurb server for company and has no idea what OS stands for."

Some of my specific questions and concerns:

Where do I send this thing? Everyone knows the big names, but how do I find smaller companies where I'm more likely to be hired? Where do I find ""startups""?

I'm unsure if my community college is something that I should remove. I did get the AA there, but it's Liberal Arts and as such, is worthless.

I have no experience in the CS field outside of academia. I figured listing my retail and escrow experience would be better than nothing. Am I screwed because I was unable to find an internship over summer?

I got a call saying the the building wouldn't be fully functional until the beginning of February, and I won't be getting the position anymore.

I am currently a third year student at a well known public university and am majoring in Chemical Engineering. My cumulative GPA is a measly 2.5. I currently have an internship under a private company off campus and an undergraduate research position under one of my professors. 

One of the things I really want to do after obtaining my undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering is go to graduate school, but I am not sure that I would be able to get in with my weak GPA, so I was thinking of staying a fifth year and obtaining a Computer Engineering degree.  I know that I would not want to work in a laboratory and would want to work with something that uses computers, such as protein simulations, software programming, and etc... I also have some weird desire to want to become a professor, so let's think of that as my dream job for now. Another concern that I have is if I would have enough financial aid for my fifth year, so I would probably have to ask my major adviser about it.

So the options that I kind of laid out for myself is:

Apply to graduate school during my fourth year...

1. If I get in, then go.
2. If I don't, stay a fifth year and get my Computer Engineering Degree and then reapply for graduate school after. 

-  If I still don't get into graduate school after my fifth year, then I'd probably have to go into the industry. 

So, with that, I would like some help from you engineers of Reddit in helping me influence my decision. Thank you very much for reading! Sorry for my English and formatting on this post. Oh, I might have posted in the wrong subreddit before this /r/Engineering as I did not know that there was an /r/EngineeringStudents subreddit.

12pht1,1,2012-11-05,[Build Help] Shooting for 800-900 dollar gaming PC,Snarkozard,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/12pht1/build_help_shooting_for_800900_dollar_gaming_pc/,"Hi! I landed an internship next summer, so I finally get to do what I've always wanted to do, and build a pc.

A friend (and the sidebar here) recommended PC Part Picker, so I went over there and drew something up quick. I really have no attachments to anything on the list, so anything goes substitution wise. I'm trying to get it down to around $800-900, going as high as $1000.

Basically for gaming, I do some software development, so managing VS and Eclipse would be nice, but I'm sure anything even slightly better than my current laptop handles them fine. I'll be doing some Photoshop work, but not a lot by any means.

I've read a bit on it, but I figured diving into it was a good way to start. My main question is, can I drop down on the CPU/Memory/GPU at all, or am I as low can go for good performance? I'm not a stickler for graphics, even medium at a good resolution is fine.

Some thoughts: 

* Is DDR-2133 worth the cost? 
* Do I really need a sound card?
* An SSD is a improvement I'm sure, but that's probably a good place to cut?
* I'll only be getting one of the monitors, but if it fits in the budget, the 23 would be nice, as my current second monitor is only around 19""
* Are the case, power supply, and cooler good enough? These are all important things I don't really want to skimp quality on, but seem to have cheap options available.

So, if most of the things are at a good, low price already, the luxury things I would cut are the SSD ($120), the sound card ($22), and the 23in monitor ($249), putting me down right around $1050.

Even just help on 1 or 2 of the questions would be awesome! Thanks!

I was ""IT Intern"". The IT department was 4 of us. If it used electricity and a screen, we were in charge of it. As the new guy, i had to answer the helpdesk phone. I am here to tell you about the worst user we ever had. Illonka.

Illonka was the worst employee the bank EVER had.

She was hired because she was Bulgarian, and this was '07, just after they joined the EU.
She had a very good contact book for banks in the new EU member states, and it was this the bank wanted.

My Dad (nepotism yes) quickly assimilated her contacts in 6 months and after that it was a waiting game to get rid of her.

She spoke bad english, and used computers in the worst way, e.g:

- my Dad is a luddite, he wouldnt use a computer unless he had to.when he must use a program, he gets someone to show him how to do what he must. makes notes. understands.

- Illonka is told to use a program. Gets someone to show her. forgets. Guesses. messes everything up. does not understand why things go wrong when she does the wrong thing.

In the department we developed the ""Illonka test"", if she could use it without catastrophic ruin, then it was bullet proof.

I think the only thing that was ever Illonka-proof was MW-Word. and only just.

So whenever we upgraded phones, software, anything, she got it first and it was our ""worst case scenatio"" testing.

If someone could misuse something, she would. This went on for a while, daily problems:
"" i went to the bathroom, and my screen is black"" . . . ""wiggle the mouse"" - this was normal.

Every new thing was Illonka proofed. we made sure our guides were Illonka proof. we made sure no one could possibly ruin anything.

The term ""idiot proof"" was synonymous with ""Illonka proof"".

Worst user EVER.

She was made redundant 2 weeks before i left. She broke down in tears at her desk, and my boss took us for a pint to celebrate that lunchtime.

It was over. we had survived.

12rvtr,1,2012-11-06,SE undergraduate needs advice for his senior year.,niceguy321,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/12rvtr/se_undergraduate_needs_advice_for_his_senior_year/,"Hii, a little background about me: I'm a junior in his undergrad who's planning what to do for his senior year next year. I realized that I had only planned to take only one class for Fall 2013, and I have spaces for about 4 more class. Same goes for my Spring 2014 (my last semester in undergrad) where I only planned for 3 classes which includes my Senior design class and only have 2 spaces left.

I was debating whether to take random CS/SE related classes to fill in the spaces just to glean extra knowledge for the future, but I'm hoping for recommendations from the more experienced redditors :x

My experience includes 4-5 years of Java, 1 year of low level programming (MIPS assembly), and 1.5 years of C/C++ in a Linux shell. I'm decent/fair at computer science/discrete math (although I dislike it), and the highest math I ever gone up to was Integral Calculus. 

These are the electives my school offer for CS/SE:

-Digital Systems Laboratory
-Intelligent Systems Analysis
-Intelligent Systems Design
-Numerical Analysis
-Organization of Programming Languages
-Digital Logic and Computer Design
-Advanced Algorithm Design and Analysis
-Human Computer Interactions I
-Human Computer Interactions II
-Computer Graphics
-Artificial Intelligence
-Introduction to Machine Learning
-Automata Theory
-Compiler Design
-Data and Applications Security
-Introduction to Computer Vision
-Computer Animation
-Implementation of Modern Operating Systems
-Human Language Technologies
-Embedded Computer Systems
-Digital Forensics
-Computer Science Project
-Introduction to VLSI Design
-Database Systems
-Object Oriented Programming Systems

I love learning about things in the CS field, so I really want to take advantage of the resources here at school while I'm still in it so that it'll be essential to me later on in life, and be organized with what I take rather than taking random classes (but I don't mind taking random CS classes for the sake of learning).

My other options can be taking other random, beneficial classes that are outside my major, research internships/do internships at those time, or take graduate courses for CS~~or just stay home and play MOBA games all day~~ lol

If there is another option that I did not mention or consider, you're more than welcome to mention it to me :D

Thank you!!"

Questions from a college student,riptide_wave,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/12v6h8/best_way_to_get_a_internshipjob_questions_from_a/,"First off id like to say that I admire every one of you, and the work you do on a daily basis. Currently I am a freshman in College who is working on a BA in Applied Computer Science. I was wondering what is the best way to get a Job, or Internship with a sysadmin (Network, Hardware, General System Administrator, Etc). I have been doing computer work literally my entire life, and for the past 8 years I have been hosting servers out of my basement just for fun. Ive done crap with AD, Exchange, BES, linux, you name it. I may not be the smartest chip on the block, but I can learn quickly. I have also passed a cisco A+ course at a local tech college, but have not taken the test due to time and money. My question is what is the best way too show these skills to companies, and how can I try to get a internship or job? I love college and all, but my job on campus in IT really kind of sucks and my dream job for life is to be a datacenter or private sector Systems Administrator. All and any advice is highly appreciated. 

EDIT: If it matters, I reside in South East Minnesota. No real places for work here, but id easily be willing to re-locate to the Twin Cities after this school year. (transfer colleges)"
12v2l6,4,2012-11-08,I am bored and underutilized but am afraid to quit.,EnginerdThaThurd,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/12v2l6/i_am_bored_and_underutilized_but_am_afraid_to_quit/,"*Background:*

Recent Mechanical Engineering graduate with 2 years of internship experience in signal processing and programming.  I worked with a company that provided semi-active damping suspension systems to major automotive manufacturers.  It was challenging, progressive, new, and I really enjoyed it.

*Problem:*

When I graduated in June I applied everywhere I have ever dreamed of maybe one day working.  Tesla, SpaceX, Boeing, BMW, FirstSolar, and a bunch of other companies I can't think of at the moment.  I got calls, a number of phone interviews but a lot of them didn't go anywhere.  I realize I am a recent graduate with limited experience so I expected some disappointment.  There was a local place looking for a manufacturing engineer and I was anxious to get a job so I accepted, knowing it wasn't really what I was looking for.

Fast forward to today:  I am bored out of my mind, tasked with simple monotonous jobs and am under-utilized in my abilities as an engineer.  I feel extremely lucky to have a job at all and to not have to worry about student loan payments (half parents, half internship) but I desperately need a change.  I am the kind of person who is more than likely going to bounce around from job to job every few years anyway, but I don't know if I can last that long here.  It's only been 4 months and I already loathe waking up in the morning to go to work.  

I'm just not sure what to do. Do I secretly look for other jobs with a resume that doesn't include this position on there?  I know I shouldn't quit without some sort of backup.  My plan is to buy a home in the next few months with money I have saved up, but the commitment of a mortgage is what is making me look at how happy I am at my current job.  I even would like to get a job out of state.. I don't know, I am having a quarter life crisis and I don't know what to do.  Up to this point everything has been laid out in front of me.  I knew I had to finish high school, finish college, find a job.  But now what?  I love the freedom of choosing to be/do whatever I want but at the same time it scares the shit out of me.  I don't want to burn bridges and end up unemployed hating myself for being so arrogant.  I know I need experience and this job offers me some practical knowledge about manufacturing processes and the workings of an essential industry, but it's not necessarily the experience I want.  

I know a lot of people would kill for a job right now, and I don't want to sound ungrateful.  I am merely looking for any input about what someone in a similar position would do.

But the most experience I have, is in web development, and penetration testing. But regardless of that, I got the most interesting purposal today. 

A friend of my family runs a software company. It's decently large, and offers lots of oppurtunities. He said he understands I don't actually have a large amount of experience in software development. So he made me a challenge. Learn as much as I can in three weeks for C++. Apparently if I can impress him with how much I learn, he'll hire me to start at an intern type position. I think this would be a great oppurtunity for me ... an eighteen year old. So I am reaching out to you reddit, what is a great book / course for me to do in that time to learn C++ as best I can. I am a fast learner, and I dedicate myself to whatever the task is.

I cannot take this anymore. :(

I want to work in paid internships with the organizations and companies I love. The open source companies, mostly, but I will take pretty much anything that won't completely destroy my soul.

[How many times have people steered away from you because you were in prison?  What was the first thing you did once you were out of prison?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yeby1?context=5)|C: I haven't had anyone sneer away from me because they have been more interested in how I survived being in prison for something I didn't do. The first thing I did when I got out of prison was to do whatever people suggested that I do because I hadn't adapted to the so-called ""free world"" yet.
[Did your family believe in your innocence? Have they welcomed you back with open arms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yeruw?context=5)|C: My family has always believed in my innocence but have always been bitter because they were not financially able to provide me with adequate representation.
 |R: Yes, my family always believed. My mother, my sister, my children. They always believed and gave me support because they knew me back then. After 20 years and me still there for something I didn't do and my family seeing the commercials saying ""innocent until proven guilty"" but I was still there...so they let doubt slip into their minds, except my mother. They asked for me to accept their apology after I was released.  My mother passed away a year before I was released but she always believed that I was innocent. 
[Did you ever think that you'd be able to prove your innocence and escape incarceration?  In any way are either of you going to be compensated for having your youth snatched from you?  What do you plan to do with your newfound freedom?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ye4b6?context=5)|C: I always believed that I would prove my innocence if I survived long enough for the future to catch up with my case. I'm a sci-fi freak, and I always believed that I would be cleared through the use of DNA. The Bible says the blood of your brother cries out. That's DNA.  R: Prayer kept me sane. Faith. With me having life without parole. My mother and the support of other convicts in prison. I tried to prove my innocence by habeas corpuses and all, but I kept getting denied because I couldn't argue with the attorneys. 
[What kind of compensation did you get? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ye622?context=5)|C: A slap in the face. You can't compensate for all the years that I spent in prison. But, on the other hand, where is my security? Because, we are not able to receive social security.
 |R: They needed to perhaps have more support in place for those like us who have been gone so long and wrongfully convicted. I had to wait for a long time for compensation and for support. 
[This might be a bit sensitive but how do you feel hearing Mike Tyson say after leaving jail, the he wished he ""actually"" did rape the girl in question?  At any point, did you become so bitter that you actually wished you did commit the crime?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ye9yh?context=5)|C: I can relate to that. That was not abnormal for him to think that way. I had no animosity against the victim but I was mad.
 |R: We were both victims. I forgave her but I knew who committed the crime when I was in prison. I forgave him too. 
[What are your feelings regarding the justice system? How would you change it? Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ye65g?context=5)|R: I would change somethings like advertising ""you're innocent until proven guilty"" because you're actually ""guilty until proven innocent."" I sat 24 years a ""guilty"" man so how is that commercial right?
 |C: I would make sure that the District Attorneys do their duty to first thoroughly and completely investigate all cases prior to ANY indictment so that attorneys can have an actual, full and complete opportunity to accurately represent their clients. If they don't investigate what the police give them, then attorneys are not presenting all the evidence. 
[Have you spoken with the prosecutors or jurors who were involved in your original trials? If so, what happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ye63g?context=5)|R: Yes, I spoke with the Public Defender for my case, who is now a judge, and the attorney that represented me during trial. Long conversation with both and all of us were happy. The Lord covered me the entire 24 years that I was there. I never spoke with the District Attorney.
 |C: I spoke with the DA but I am still angry with the DA because he is still patting himself on the back for having a ""fair trial"" and ""doing their best."" How can they still pat themselves on the back when I was innocent?
[What was your experience like working with the Innocence Project? How long did they represent you? If it was an extended period of time, did you struggle with the fact that the students you were working with finished their time with the program and left you behind?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yem8q?context=5)|R: [Note: Robert worked with the Innocence Project out of New York but GIP was local counsel] Once GIP learned of me being in prison, I was home before I knew it. The intern working on my case kept the case even after she graduated...until I came home. My experience was wonderful. More support than the entire time that I was in prison.
 |C:  In prison: I used to wait for the mail to get a letter from GIP because I was writing them letters every month to hear their response and the hope in which the interns provided me. The interns never left me. Every single one of the interns that worked on my case came to my wedding and still, as of today, have not forgotten nor have I forgotten them. And GIP will always be a part of my life because I am completely a part of GIP. 
[How would you react if you saw the victims of crimes that weren't yours in public?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6ye4by?context=5)|C: I wouldn't react. Just another person.
 |R: *tips his hat* ""How are you doing, ma'am?"" And then just keep on going because we were both victims. I can relate to her hurt because I can relate to mine.
[I am a college student in Kansas who does news segments for a local TV station. I aspire to create documentaries as a future career.

 |I lost my mother and my sisters and all of my faith and belief.
 |R: The Lord called up some of my loved ones when I was in prison. Getting sick in prison from tattoos.

 |R: Me neither. I don't believe in the death penalty. There have been innocent people executed who shouldn't have been. For example, Troy Davis and others. You cannot take a life for a life, nor an eye for an eye. 
[Is the hottie GIP intern single?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yg8my?context=5)|C: She wouldn't be safe between these two guys if she was. ;)

 |R: Continue to donate more so that others, not just me and Clarence, can come home. Because without the Innocence Project, we would still be in there. 
[What would you change about the American prison system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yejqu?context=5)|C: Food and the sleeping conditions. The food is not for humans. And the sleeping conditions are inhuman. And it only makes the incarceration inhuman.
 |R: Education. There is less education in there now than when I went in. There is not enough supporters out here. Lack of communication with your loved ones.  Need more help with the bacteria in jails because the conditions are unhumanizing. 
[Were you ever asked to come to terms with an admission to your crime in an effort to increase your chances of parole? If so, please describe any thoughts that you might have experienced during that period.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yeqhh?context=5)|C: Yes. I was asked to participate in a sexual offender class in which I got highly offended and locked down because they said that I overreacted because of my refusal to participate in such stupidity.
 |R: If I had been eligible for parole, I would be able to answer this question. But, I had life without parole. I did not have parole to look forward to.
[What is your (Clarence and Robert\) relationship now?  Did you know each other in prison?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yf2ut?context=5)|We did not know each other in prison. Since we had the same lawyers at GIP who brought us home, we can relate to each other. We are friends. It's the reason we were both late today; we were together. 
[How has this changed your views on religion in any way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yfi7m?context=5)|R: It only built a better and stronger relationship with the Father. It should be as strong in prisons as it is outside.
[Did either of you ever consider suicide at any point?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yfi7m?context=5)|C: I believe that prison is the crossroad on which the Lord takes people to bring them to him to do his will. 
[Have you seen The Shawshank Redemption?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yg9vi?context=5)|C: Yes. But, the Memphis Three movie (Paradise Lost) was more realistic and, also, raised questions, once again, about our justice system.
 |R: Yes. It was a good movie and I could relate to his feelings of incarcerated and wanting out.

Did they know you are innocent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12v9dv/we_are_two_men_who_spent_42_years_in_prison_for/c6yhusc?context=5)|C: Most inmates never accepted that I was in prison for those crimes because they believed it did not fit my character or personality.

I wish my lawyer have had the test done on me during the trial. The DNA testing back then might have still proven me innocent.
 |C: ""How did you become involved in this case prior to the police's photograph line-up and the identification?"" Because I spent 18 years asking myself that question.
[Did you meet anybody else in prison who you thought was genuinely innocent? Did lots of people who actually had committed crimes claim they hadn't?

Nor can they maintain such a claim without being actually innocent because only the innocent can maintain their innocence. Because, years, time, and insults will cause such a person to give into their guilt.
 |R: No. Lots of men who were in prison admitted that they were guilty and I met a few that were innocent. There were more in there that would admit that they were guilty of their crimes than innocent.

 |C: Yes. I got involved in a lot of riots about food, beds, space, treatment, and petitions for prison rights.  And, I got the name ""ChainGang."" It means ""institutionalized"" and a ""veteran.""

I go on speaking engagement trips but would love to have a vacation somewhere such as Las Vegas because I still like to gamble because gambling is how I ate in prison, because if I didn't win, I didn't eat. This is because I was unable to make commissary since I didn't have financial funds coming to me in prison due to the fact I had shut everyone out from the so-called ""free world.""

 |R: Joyful. Grateful. No anger. No hatred, animosity, or revenge. I didn't have any negative and bad thoughts because I didn't want to go back.

Not because i'm lazy or because i like to sleep but because my dream world is more thrilling of an experience then my life has ever been. More then anything would i like to find someone that i could talk to about them. In a 45 minute nap i can lucidly dream an entire lifetime, this took many years and a lot of practice but now it just happens on its own. However unlike most lucid dreams i can't control the world around me only my actions within the dream itself. In short, every morning when i wake up i have lived an entire life from start to finish, with love, loss.. pain and being a different person.

It feels as if every morning everything i know is fake. I have to spend 30 minutes or more trying to figure out if i'm dreaming or if i'm back in my unfufiling life. I have grown up poor, rich and everything in between and every life is different with the exception of two things- a girl that is unreachable and unattainable by any means. And a desperate sense of not wanting to wake up. I know exactly why these things are always persistent and are stemming from my actual life.

If you went to sleep... suddenly your a child again.. you have new parents. you create all new memories..new friends. your first day at school, your first love, kiss... You have new dreams and aspirations...a job. Your death. And wake up to remember every emotion you felt during this dream, how could you stay sane? This is currently what i'm trying to figure out.

I can't move on with my real life because i spend the better part of my awake day mourning the loss of the people i knew, the people i loved.. and the most painful... the life that i had. It is to the point where this is uncontrollable- when i don't want to dream it happens anyways. I can't talk to anyone about this because sometimes i don't even know whats real and whats not. So intern i stay as a quiet person roaming this world more alone then you could imagine.

It could very well be that this life is a dream as well. And not actually knowing if it is or not hurts.I have lived a 1000s of lifetimes and all of them being unique different, and memorable. This is my secret that is ruining my life. Does anyone else experience this?"

We've all had them i'm sure. Those moments where you learned something by making a huge mistake. For me, this was quite recent and thought I would share and like to hear other peoples stories. (Sorry if this violates rule # 3)

A bit of background. Outside a short intern for a government job (they downsized a bit and the intern was the first to go) I have not had any real solid IT work experience (4-5 years in call center work, but most of that devolved into reboot the system work), and i'm fresh out of college this June, so pretty green.

I work the night shift, i'm in charge of making sure backups work just fine and our 3 24/7 customers have someone to call to in case something happens. Now, I do work 4 hours during the week when normal calls come through to get some experience with that.

One day I get a call from someone saying they can't access a file. Well I remote into their system and find they can't access a link in a email. The link is legitimate so I try accessing it on my system, no problems but it's a PDF saying please update adobe to fully use the system. I was able to pull it up via chrome on her computer and now she's upset that the file won't open.

Small confusing as can be conversation mostly going back and forth on who's company the link goes to (It's hers, no it's the governments, and back and forth). 

I say we may need to have that file replaced or upgrade adobe. 

Customer: Oh, i'm the owner of the company I can authorize that

me: (Owner? Ahhh crap). Okay, how about we start simple and I update your adobe.

I open up her reader, simple go to help and check for updates and yep there are some. I download the updates and it asks to reboot.

me: okay, we need to reboot.

Customer: This won't reboot the server right? Just my workstation correct? (Take note, she did say workstation)

Earlier she was logged in remotely into another computer and was working so I assumed that is what she was talking about, and since she was no longer in that system I was sure it would of been just the workstation.

me: Yeah, it should only reboot your workstation. (all this time stumbling over my words, and being the nervous new guy, since I get an average of 5 calls a week and most are to unlock accounts)

Customer: Are you new here? Are you sure this won't reboot the server?

Me: (trying to keep face and not make things more difficult, i ignore the question) I'm sure.

I restart the system and ....

Customer: ... what just happened. I lost connection!

Me: (What, oh no ...)

Customer: I can't connect with my thin-client!

Me: (THIN-CLIENT! No one said ANYTHING about a THIN-CLIENT!)

Customer: You just rebooted the server! *click*!

At that moment, I realized I had just took down a multi-million dollar company for 30 minutes for an adobe upgrade.

Lesson learned, make sure they aren't using thin-clients before a reboot!"

In short, I'm the average disfunctional young adult who doesn't know what to do with his life. I won't bore you will all the shit any depressed person goes through.

I'm now pondering on making some changes in my life. I graduated this year but, although I got plenty of odds to make it, I don't want to join the corporate rat race. I gave it a try twice (internship and 4 months as an employee at different companies) but it just doesn't fit my personality and it made me miserable. I'm currently also dealing with personal issues like low self-confidence, mild social anxiety, ... so that's not helping either.
Now I got this crazy idea to apply to become a fire fighter or something in that direction. New experience, some physical work, probably also plenty of time to read and/or study (= being somewhat on myself!), ... If it turns out oke I'm willing to do this or something like it for the rest of my life if needed. Stress, bosses, general workfloor bullshit, ... I want to minimize them as much as possible. Don't care about a few hunderd dollars more or less each month, just want to stabilize my life a bit with a job that doesn't demand too much from me.
Maybe I'm tossing four years of college down the drain but at this point I just don't care anymore. I have always challenged myself in my spare time and have never cared much about formal education. Never went to class in my last three years, only finished for my family/friends, which in hindsight was stupid. Feel like I have to break free from whatever this is. I feel cornered. Maybe this stems from my childhood, listening to my parents bitching about their work for hours each night. ;)

Anyone else out there that did the same with somewhat the same profile? How did it turn out? What were your reasons for doing it? When you felt better/had new interests/..., were you able to get a higher-end job now that you were labeled low-end employee? 

I'm just fishing here, hoping to get some new insights!

While there are a few larger companies that hire students in advance (like Microsoft and Google), I wonder if I'm wasting my time by applying for jobs now. I've also been somewhat picky in the job that I want, I feel that I'd rather work somewhere that I can grow in an area I'm interested in, rather than just get a job for the sake of earning money.

I believe getting work doing something I enjoy, and growing through work experience would be optimal for my future, but I've even thought of attempting freelance work just to ensure I'm doing what I want to do after I graduate (which I haven't even really narrowed down yet, more so I know what I don't want to do). I wonder if I would be better off just getting a job anywhere I can, but worry that it will not lead me down a path I would be happy with.

I'm a graphic design student close to graduating. The thought of just finishing my studies scares me. Up to this point, everything I did in life had to be done good. I'm scared that I'll turn out to be a complete failure in life after I graduate. This problem keeps me up at night and is basically controlling my entire life at the moment. It's a problem that has started 2 years earlier (of course I was far from graduating back then) and has build up to a point that I can't stop thinking about it. I've tried talking to my girlfriend about it, but she just tells me to let it go and not hink too much about what I need to do next.

When I was younger, I got bullied a lot for being fat. The bullying and the teasing has made me very insecure. At first I was insecure about my physique, but as I got older and my physique changed, I didn't care too much about that anymore. I still have mental scars. For example, I just can't stand the fact that people can be better at something than I am and for some reason I just have to set high goals for myself in life. This sounds funny, but it causes a lot of stress inside my head. Whenever I undertake something, I just have to accomplish something with it. I can't do anything for fun. I do stuff because it leads me towards a certain goal in life. Without setting those goals, I feel depressed and aimless. 

I've done lots of things next to my studies. I've been an intern at a good design studio and done a lot of work as a freelance designer. I've also started rowing crew when I started studying and achieved my goal to compete in the World Championships under 23 y/o. Next to that, I'm building up my own business with talented people I see around me. 

Thinking rational, I don't have a lot of things to worry about. But still I'm freaking scared to death that all my plans will fail and I will end up with some dead end job for the rest of my life (or worse). I just can feel myself getting more and more depressed, for a reason that I think isn't that good.

What do I do?"

He's a great friend of mine. Josh and Hanna, even though they are only 22 and 23, have been together for 6 years. High school sweethearts. The problems began about a year ago, before we all lived together. The details are probably not perfect, but you'll get the idea.

Josh went to another state for an internship and was gone for 5 months. Hanna cheated on him while he was gone, and told him about it. She apparently flew down there to see him, they patched things up, she came home. Then, she cheated on him with another guy, I'll just refer to him as Guy2 from now on. I don't know what ensued after that, but I know that Josh was informed, and I know that when he returned from his internship he and Hanna were still together. The **DAY** after he returns, we're having a welcome-home party, where Hanna informs him that she ""misses"" Guy2. I don't know why she felt the need to tell him that, especially at that moment, but it was devastating to Josh. This was the night that Josh told me everything that had been happening between them. 

The very **NEXT** day, I talk to Josh and he informs me that he was checking his e-mail on Hanna's computer, where she had left her e-mail open (I don't know how much of that is true but that's his story), and he found recent e-mail correspondence with Guy2. Apparently they were pretty graphic, and Hanna had said some pretty bad things about Josh to this guy. Also, I'm told that Guy2 is a polygamist and Josh presumes that is the only reason that Hanna hasn't left him for Guy2. Fucked up, right? 

This is right before we all moved in together. We had all been looking for a house, and Kristen and I had just been hoping that Hanna and Josh would figure things out. In hindsight, we were stupid. But, I digress. We moved into a house together. Josh and Hanna had their shit together, if only outwardly. After about a month of living together, all Hell breaks loose. I'm sitting in my room with the door shut, Hanna and Josh are up stairs when I hear him start yelling, something like ""I told you not to do that!"" At first I didn't understand until I heard him mention Guy2, asked why she had been talking to him, and continue to call her every name in the book, all the while she's yelling and crying and saying she didn't mean it. It was kind of traumatic. At this point, I was sure that they would break up. I didn't see how they could salvage things after all that they had been through. BUT! They did. They stayed together. And things were bad for months. Josh was miserable. They're both really unhappy in this relationship. So after months of that, of us tiptoeing around, we start to see things improve. Josh has a smile on his face, Hanna is going out to the club with us, everything is looking better. Hooray, right? Yeah, then it happened again. More yelling, screaming, name-calling, the whole deal. Josh found another e-mail on Hanna's phone (because, since the last time, he checks her texts and e-mails daily). It's like they're putting on a show for someone. That happened about a week ago. Josh has been sleeping on the couch and spending his time in the basement. Hanna barely comes down from upstairs. After talking to Josh last night, it appears as though there is still a chance that they will try to make it work *again*. 

Reddit, I'm tired of living in a house that is in constant turmoil. What do I do?? (Again, I apologize for the length...)"

To give you some background...

I am a 21 year old German student, studying Business Information Systems with the focus on software development. Before I can start my last year of studies, I am required to do a 5 – 6 months (payed) internship, starting March 2013. I tried desperately to find something in Australia, for several reasons. One is, that I have been to Australia before and I really like the country and especially the people. Second my SO lives in Sydney and I could finally see her again. At the moment I am in France, studying at a “Grand Ecole” for one semester. I am fluent in German, French and English (my English is better than my French).

I really tried everything, I guess. I sent a lot of applications (not standard ones!) to several companies. But no-one really looks for an intern at the moment. I am quite flexible, I focus on software development, but I had/have (e.g.) accounting lectures as well. The main language we are learning is Java. But I guess apart from that, I have some other good skills.
Of course I check(ed) seek.com.au and other websites, but I can't even find an open position. If I got replies, they were all negative, I don't think most of  them looked even at my CV. I am really desperate and would be glad over any advice/position/nice comment…

Thanks for really anything in advance.

Cheers!"

131rx2,0,2012-11-12,"Reddit, I despise my job. Am I being an entitled brat or do I have a good reason for feeling this way?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/131rx2/reddit_i_despise_my_job_am_i_being_an_entitled/,"Reddit, I hate my job, I’m extremely unhappy, and I don't know if that’s OK.

It wasn’t always this way, but it didn't take long to realize that something was wrong. I went from intern to full-time at a small PR firm (6 employees and the owner) the day after I graduated from college in May. When I was an intern, I was learning a lot, I liked my work, and I gelled well with the office culture. However, these past few months have been filled with political standoffs, unkept promises, and disrespect that has led me to dread checking my e-mail in the morning. I go to bed nearly every night and think, “Man... I’d be so much happier if I was just unemployed.”

My first day involved salary negotiations where I was handed a very low number (I’d make more as a waiter) with the promise that my ""bonuses"" (including a mid-year bonus that was allegedly coming the next month) would get me to the number I wanted. Being as excited as I was to get my first job out of school, I didn't object and I didn't get it in writing. 6-months later and no bonus. Red flag 1.

I was told that I would work 40-hours a week with the stipulation that ""social media never sleeps"" and that I ""may"" be required to put in some after-hours work. I'd been at this long enough and knew the rules of the game and didn't initially consider it. However, as time went on, more work got piled on me and it became 50-hours a week, and then 60-hours a week. When I expressed my concern that maybe I needed help managing my time to stay under 40-hours a week, I was told that I'm ""paid to do my work no matter how fucking long it takes."" I don’t get paid for overtime. Red flag 2.

The company is run by one person and they have the final say on everything that goes out the door. However, they are just one person and do not have the time to handle our 20+ clients as well as all of the business development. The problem with that is, not only is my work bottlenecked by their schedule, but when they’re having a bad day, everyone has a bad day. Did I write a perfect pitch? Too bad, the boss is in a pissy, uptight mood and that one misplaced comma means I have to start from scratch. It was their dream to start their own company and work 100+ hours a week and ignore their (clearly failing) marriage, but it is not my dream. Why do I feel like I’m on the hook for the boss’ day too? Red flag 3.

Because this one person is constantly busy, they have no time to listen to anyone’s ideas or thoughts. They have no time to teach a young employee anymore and I’m not getting anywhere in my career. That’s fine for the rest of the employees, because they’re all experienced workers who love working 60-hours a week (and getting overtime pay for it, but I’m not supposed to know that), but I’m no longer learning and my work has become dry and mundane. I worked a minimum of three jobs/internships all throughout school and never said no to putting in the effort needed to do good work, but now I find myself cutting corners and begging the clock for 6 p.m. I don’t know what’s happening to me. Red flag 4.

I’m quitting this job and moving to a different city to find a new one. I know the day that I’m putting in my two-weeks notice and I’ve written it on my calendar, but it’s still not for a few months. What I’m looking for now is some sort of vindication of whether or not I have a right to be as disillusioned with the idea of having a full-time office job as I am. I’m grateful that I found a job right out of school, but does it sound like I’m just being a brat and squandering this opportunity? Or do I have legitimate cause for feeling the way I do? How do I put this in perspective to make the next few months bearable? Am I just going to find this same stuff elsewhere? I feel like I’m too young to feel stuck in a job, but maybe that’s entitled thinking -- I just don’t know.

Wat do?

tl;dr - Overworked and underpaid for my field, lied to about bonuses, no chance for learning or advancement, boss’s mood regularly disrupts the entire office’s workflow, and I’m to the point that unemployment seems more appealing. Am I an entitled brat for thinking there’s more to life than a dead-end and unfulfilling job even though I just graduated from college?"

135cj0,10,2012-11-13,The last few weeks have been Hell.....,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/135cj0/the_last_few_weeks_have_been_hell/,"It all started about 4 days before Halloween. I live in North-Eastern Kansas, and I go to college about 15 minutes away from my house. I also have drive to North-Western Missouri for my job. It's actually not even a job, its an internship, but I digress. I frequent NoSleep, you writers are amazing. Me; not so much. But, I need to get my story out... Maybe get some help. 

So as I was saying a few days before Halloween this scary shit has been happening. Some one is following me. EVERYDAY. To school, from school, to work, from work, to the store, from the store, etc.. My friends tell me I'm being ridiculous and I just think it's the same car everyday. But, I know it is. I see the person behind the wheel. Same person, same car. Following me everyday. Once I arrive at my destination, he drives on past. Always turning and smiling as he drives by. I can't help but look. And its wholly unnerving. His eyes soulless. His grin devilish... It's burned into my mind.

Now there was never any confrontation, just following. Until last night. I pulled into my driveway and he drove past. I ran into the house faster than Usain Bolt. A couple hours later, I took the trash to the street, around 9 o clock at night. (Tuesday is trash day) I peer down the street to see the car parked 2 houses down, under the streetlight. I see him, staring straight at me. Smiling. THAT HORRIBLE FUCKING SMILE... I panic as he hops out of the car, never breaking his gaze, and sprints in my direction. I haul ass back in the house. He begins banging on my front door. Laughing maniacally. I run upstairs grab my Colt out of my dresser and lock myself in the bathroom. 30 minutes pass and my dad finally gets home. I tell him everything. He tells me to stop making shit up.

This morning I left for work and the car wasn't following me after a few minutes like usual. I thought maybe I was making it up. Maybe I was going crazy. But then I saw it. That green Taurus. He wasn't smiling though. He was visibly angry. His disgusting, emaciated, acne scarred face quivering. The whole time I'm watching him in my rearview I almost crash my car, but luckily looked up soon enough. As I looked in my rearview again I see him put the phone to his head. My phone soon started ringing.

""You little fuck. You think you cant stop me from getting what I want?"" 
""WH-WH-WHAT THE F-FUCK DO YOU W-WANT!"" 
""You know damn well what I want, you think you can stay away from me forever? *horrifying chuckle* yea... you probably think that."" ""WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!""
""Walmart. ----, Kansas. April, 1998. I'll get you back.""
*phone clicks off* 

I checked my rearview again and he was gone. This morning, I hurried into my workplace and sat in my cubicle and cried. That month and year I was kidnapped from the Walmart in my hometown. I was found a couple weeks later after I'd escaped but I don't really remember it. My family just uses it as an example to my younger siblings and cousins as to why to stay close to them in public places, and not talk to strangers. Since I don't remember it, it never bothered me. But, this shook me up pretty bad. I'd moved around a lot growing up, before getting kicked out of my mom's and sent to live with my dad a few years back.

I'm still at work and I would've posted earlier if I wasn't so busy. I don't know how to proceed. I plan on telling my dad what happened and hope he'll believe me and not think I'm fucking around. I texted my mom saying to call me ASAP, but she's probably still busy at work. I'm so lost right now. And scared. I'm a average sized. 6'1 160, I've been training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Judo, and Boxing the last couple years, since it's my life dream to be an MMA fighter and I wrestled my whole life, but this guy is huge. 6'4 230, easily. I wouldn't be able to take him on I don't think. I keep a machete in my car though, because I thought it was funny, but now I'm glad I do just in case he catches me off guard in my car. I have multiple guns in my house so if he breaks in thats not an issue. I'm just scared he'll catch me off guard while I'm without protection.

Hopefully, I'll get answers from my mom and dad on if they can help me anyway. I'm sure my dad will just end up calling the cops like I should've before it escalated to this. But right now I'm not sure what to do. I get off work in an hour. But I'm too scared to leave the building right now."

So much of the work is really simple enough that you could train a monkey for it (or an intern if you don't have a monkey).  But then I remind myself that it's really not easy for most people.  For most people technology is scary.  Scared people are dumb.  So onto the story.

Guy calls up the service desk and he's pissed.  Working from outside the office and he wants to login using VPN.  For the uninitiated that's Virtual Private Networking and it allows you to connect to private company resources like email and file services over any internet connection.  One of the things that makes it secure is an RSA token which basically generates part of your password using a very complex algorithm.  You've got a copy of the algorithm either running on the remote systems that you need to authenticate to, and on your laptop or RSA token.  The RSA token is really just a little hunk of plastic with a screen showing the current number (it changes ever minute).

The guy on the phone is pissed because he keeps on trying to log in and it won't work.  We check the logs and it shows that he's putting in a bad number and it keeps locking him out after repeated failed attempts.  So we unlock him and are getting ready for another run when he says ""and another thing.  When did these things start to have letters and not just numbers?  Why didn't you guys send us a an official communication warning us about this change? (insert a 5 minute rant about how IT never communicates anything).  Almost as soon as he's said that we realize what the problem is but we wait until the rant is done.

""Turn your token over. You've been holding it upside down.  That's not an L.  It's a 7."""

Great right? Only thing is, they want a portfolio. I'm more than a competent programmer, but I never thought about making one, mostly because I'm an electrical engineering student, and my coursework isn't rooted in software, not really. I've only taken more of an interest in software only recently as well, so most of this semester's classes have a fairly large programming portion.

So my question is, can I cite school assignments? I'm hesitant to do so because even the most involved ones don't span any more than 2-3 weeks. Here are some of the ones I'm thinking about digging up:

- A Conway's Game of Life simulation

- Pipelined MIPS datapath with branching and forwarding in VHDL

- Pedometer using the Mikro Board for PIC24 (actually in progress). One of the job requirements/preferences actually lists knowing how to use at least one microcontroller, so I think this is a good one to cite.

- Misc. simple Kinect games

- Implementation of A* search.

- Demonstration of stereo matching, geometry, Harris detectors, SIFT, and RANSAC algorithms (computer vision stuff)

The above will also show another concern of mine: most of that is nothing if not standard. Not only do classes reuse assignments, it's not as if well established solutions/implementations aren't found for most of these. Despite all these concerns though I don't have much else to go on.

Another question I have is, how do you present your portfolio? The person from HR that contacted me didn't say much, just to add my portfolio to my application. Could I use like a Github account for this? Should I ask for what kind of format they'd like to see, or this is there a common industry practice regarding portfolios?

[How awesome is it that you will get to list this on your resume? Even if it has nothing to do with what you want to do, it's still awesome to list ""The 3 Broomsticks in Hogsmeade"" as past work experience. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707qmz?context=5)|It's very awesome that I get to put this down. I've worked in one of the busiest theme parks ever. I feel like I can do almost anything.
[How old are you / qualified are you to do what you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707qmz?context=5)|I am 21. It technically doesn't take a lot to do what I do. The only thing that makes this job different from other jobs is that it is in the middle of a theme park. I just deal with thousands of people every day.
[Best costume you've seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707qmz?context=5)|The best costume I've seen had to have been this large group that came in. Mostly all of them were wearing various Hogwarts robes. But there was one guy that came in and dressed head to toe like Dumbledore. Beard and all. It was a great day to work.
[Any famous people show up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707qmz?context=5)|Yes, from time to time famous people show up. Recently while I have been working there we have seen, Shaq, Eddie Murphy and Seth Green. 
[You said wearing robes is frowned upon. But \[spideyholla \](Link to www.reddit.com said guests in costume make employees' days. What do employees think of guests in costume, and how do guests who wear costumes get treated by park employees?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70g5cz?context=5)|My coworkers and I absolutely love it when guests dress up. It really does make our day to see someone so enthusiastic about it all. I love to interact with these guests because it's easy to play into the fantasy. 
[What's it like when a celebrity shows up at a theme park? I feel like they'd get mobbed the whole time and it would be terrible for them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70jd73?context=5)|They actually have their own personal team of Universal people to help them through their day. To not get mobbed they some times will travel backstage from place to place. At the 3 Brooms we get notified a 30 min in advance for VIP party. We usually set up and reserve tables for them and show them special treatment when they arrive. We have to treat them great but can't get all crazed fan on them. We would get fired haha. But it's usually just in and out quickly so they don't get mobbed by the regular guests. 
[But you said, ""When it comes to wearing the robes and costumes the park does frown upon it only because that could mean a lawsuit for Universal. They won't say you have to take it off, they just don't encourage it."" How risky is it? What advice on avoiding getting in trouble or otherwise having a bad time would you give to those who want to come in costume?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70j3nb?context=5)|The individual employees have no problems with it. We love it! So no we won't say really anything about it.
 |It is the company, Universal, that does not encourage it. If someone buys a robe there and decides to put it on and wear it around the land and somehow they get hurt in it, they could come back and sue Universal about it.
 |I'd say it's not risky to go in costume. I've seen it done many times before. If you want to go in costume by all means do it. The employees will appreciate it and it does make their day. :) 
[What are some of the odder choices of costume you've seen? I've read about a couple of instances of people going to the Wizarding World dressed as the Doctor from Doctor Who (which is kind of appropriate in a way - Doctor Who is an incredibly British sci-fi series\), for example.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70jtoo?context=5)|Haven't seen too many odd costumes. Closer to Halloween I saw a few ""goths"" I guess. Some general witches. But I personally haven't seen anything too odd. 
[What are the must try/ must get items in Harry Potter land?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707isg?context=5)|Butterbeer for sure. I always tell everyone to try it at least once while in the land. The only other place they sell it is England.
 |Wands you can get online or buy. But I always recommend going to the wand shop Olivander's to see the Wand Ceremony show.
 |I always recommend going on the castle ride at the very least. It's unlike any other ride I have been on. Quite good.
 |Most of the merchandise you can get online outside of the park. If you are into souvenirs then there is a butterbeer stein and Hogs Head stein you can purchase that says ""The Wizarding World of Harry Potter"" on them.
 |Honeydukes for sure. There cauldron cakes are delicious. They have some interesting combinations of candy that you don't find in most places.
[I actually logged in to comment here about the butterbeer.  I was working in the production kitchen (that big building over by wardrobe, behind the employee grill\) when we created the recipe for the butterbeer, and was one of the first people to try it.  Stuff's awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70du1v?context=5)|Do you still work there? That place is a mystery to me still... lol 
[Butterbeer is the best. Still have the mug I got when I first tried it. You also forgot to mention to pick up a HP SCARF when you're there! I got a gryffindor scarf and it is the best and whenever I wear it I get compliments. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70bn6y?context=5)|Meh scarves don't serve much purpose in Florida. :P 
[Do they make butterbeer beer version?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70jmjn?context=5)|No sadly.
[Is the butter beer actually beer? As in, not a codeword* for some non-alcoholic punch concotion?  *Librarians had a release party for all the people who had a hold on HP7 before it was released, and not everyone was 21.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70amck?context=5)|Butterbeer is non alcoholic. And we do not sell an alcoholic version. 
[Is the butterbeer vegan? or is there dairy stuck in it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70cssx?context=5)|The butterbeer is actually gluten and dairy free. 
[I don't...I left Universal about 3 years ago. :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70fs7s?context=5)|That's still cool though lol. I never knew what they did in there...
[Is it true that the Butterbeer is just cream soda with some butterscotch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70atch?context=5)|That's kind of what it tastes like. Yeah. 
[You know how all of the pizza places in the park use the same dough? Same hamburger buns park-wide? Same soups, sauces, fruit cups and all that? All made in that building.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70kqv2?context=5)|Wow. So it's a food production warehouse? 
[Most interesting encounter with a crazed HP fan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707k5m?context=5)|I have come across a few Huge HP fans. Needless to say they are all interesting, just not crazy.
 |One time a huge group of people came in with robes on from Hogwarts and one of them was dressed as Dumbledore. The awesome thing was they all had wand, some had the HP glasses and they played their role. They talked to me about Hogwarts, classes, Hogsmeade and tons of other stuff. It was quite enjoyable. Not so much crazed but noteworthy.
 |Also this other time I was working at the butterbeer cart. (You get so many characters just working out there)  I encountered this young girl that just constantly grilled me with questions about the series and HP land. She asked a lot of why's and how's. It was the cutest thing ever. She wasn't so much crazed either but really really into it. So I gave her a butterbeer for free. She deserved it.
 |But I am still waiting for the day that we get that crazy fan in the land. That will be an entertaining day at work. 
[Stop calling me a muggle, fucker.  :\)  Actually, I do have a question, have they considered having a little show where one of the *customers* develops magical talent right in the middle of a crowd?  I think that would be awesome if they could pull it off.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707a8z?context=5)|I haven't heard of any talk of one, yet. But the only thing that is similar to what you are saying is the show at Olivander's. There they let in about 30 people at a time and the wand keeper working at the time will pick one person out of that crowd of 30 and will have them participate in the Wand Ceremony, where the wand 'chooses you'. It's a pretty neat show to watch. 
[I must've missed that one when I went.  It was crazy crowded, which I should have expected of course but as a Florida local it still bugged me lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707ez7?context=5)|Yeah the line for Olivander's is usually as long as the line for the rides. I would definitely recommend trying it one day, especially if you are a local. The best time to go to the park is February or September-October. We tend to be less busy then. 
[How's March? Not too busy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70fyr7?context=5)|Not too busy. But that is spring break month so a lot of locals come to the parks. 
[Are there any special ""codes"" there? Like, I heard at one amusement park, the code word for vomit was a ""protein spill"". Is there anything like that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707fv6?context=5)|In the 3 Brooms there are a few.
 |If someone hands us a huge bill and it turns out to be counterfeit, we are told to tell the customer the bill is ""failing a security check"" and needs to be inspected by an expert. When at the Butterbeer carts we have radios that go back to the office in back. If a counterfeit is spotted out there it's a number code we say over the radio. 10-86 I believe.
 |If we have VIP's coming to eat at the restaurant, we refer to them as the ""special guests"" usually.
 |As ""wizards"" we have the option to ""Smuggle Muggles"". This means we can pick a random family or group of muggles and show them the best treatment throughout HP land. Like taking them to the front of the lines, giving them a private tour of the place. Treating them like VIP's.
 |Those are the major ones. 
[What does it take to become a Smuggled Muggle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707oa2?context=5)|Honestly, it's random chance. It depends on if the employees have the time and energy to do this. It was a ""power"" we were given by our managers to make a random family's experience that much better. 
[If I just flat out asked you to smuggle muggle me, would you? Would any other employee, now that I know what it means?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70edcf?context=5)|No lol. It is something that is meant to be a surprise to the guest to enhance their experience. I would not recommend asking to be smuggled.
[So... What does it take to bribe a wizard to become a smuggled muggle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c708vr4?context=5)|If I was working, I would say a TON of cauldron cakes and treacle fudge. :P But that is technically not possible. 
[How did you get the job? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c7082i6?context=5)|I applied to universal online originally for an attractions job. I scheduled an interview and went in. The process took about a day and my interviewer asked the usual questions. She asked if I was familiar with the park and I said yes, I especially loved the Harry Potter section. She then asked if I wanted to work there in food and beverage instead of attractions. I said YES! and she just asked some basic HP trivia questions. Voila! I was hired. 
[What kind of HP trivia questions did they ask you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70b60o?context=5)|What are the 4 houses?
 |What paper does Luna's father edit?
 |What are the positions of a quidditch team?
 |What drink is served at the Three Broomsticks?
[What year did you graduate from Hogwarts? And what house were you in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c709iho?context=5)|4 years ago and Ravenclaw. REPRESENT!
[My wife and her mother, aunt, and cousin are all going next month (the aunt found out about a year ago she has cancer, and started planning the trip then\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c7085ib?context=5)|I'm sorry to hear about the cancer. :(
[Any tips to make sure they have a great time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c7085ib?context=5)|I would say they HAVE to go on the castle ride (Forbidden Journey), get a butterbeer and I would highly recommend Olivander's. Take your time going through the land because there are so many tiny details everywhere that truly make it all magical. Throughout the day you can catch the Frog Choir singing, and the Conductor for the Hogwarts Express. Oh and if they like sweets Honeydukes is AMAZING. 
[Awesome, I'll let them know!  The cancer sucks, for sure, but I think she's responding well to her treatment. :\)  (oh, and I don't know about Forbidden Journey. My wife gets pretty motion sick\)  Link to penny-arcade.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70cax8?context=5)|Yeah people who tend to get motion sick have issues with the ride unfortunately. :/ I hope they have a great time though!  
[Can you tell us about the upcoming expansion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c708fjs?context=5)|Technically I can't tell you more than what Universal has already released about it. :( They are very hush hush about everything. I don't even know too much about it to be honest. 
[How accurate are the attractions to the movies/books?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c708piu?context=5)|In the HP training class they said the builders of this project tried to make this place as close to the books/movies as they possibly could. I would say they succeeded. The place looks VERY much like what you saw in the movies. The 3 Broomsticks is almost an exact replica of the set from the movies. They said that when the actors from the movies came in to the 3 Brooms it was like being back on the set. 
[I had my first legal beer at the Hogs Head Pub. Just wanted to shout out to the hot bartender who gave me my first drink being 21.  I forget her name, but she's hot if that makes any difference?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70abco?context=5)|Lol it does since there are very few bar tenders. 
[What really is the butter beer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c708sv3?context=5)|Formal answer I am trained to give: ""It is a very sweet drink that is reminiscent of butterscotch and shortbread cookies.""
 |My answer: It tastes very similar to cream soda. A little more butterscotchy.  
[So its non-alcoholic...?  Link to www.youtube.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70d010?context=5)|LOL. That is a response I get a lot haha.  
[What's your favourite part of the attraction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c708ntn?context=5)|As far as the whole Harry Potter land goes...I would say the Forbidden Journey ride (castle ride). That is one of the best rides I have ever gone on. Plus the line itself is so detailed and fantastically built. I love just walking through the castle to look at all the different rooms and props there. So magical. 
[Are you required to put on an accent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c709gks?context=5)|No. They actually discourage it if your accent is not natural. Most people that work there don't have an accent. The ones that do have it naturally. 
[This and the snow on the roofs of everything were the only two parts of the park I disliked. After I noticed those two off pieces the whole rest of the experience felt a bit forced. I'm truly surprised that its not encouraged to learn a passable British accent.  Edit: correct an autocorrect. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70m1hk?context=5)|Yeah that would make it feel way too forced. I have to say though the train conductors have the accent and it makes it kinda cool haha. They are fun to work with. 
[For someone who knows very little about Harry Potter, what is this place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707ack?context=5)|It is a replica of the Hogwarts castle and the little town Hogsmeade from the books/movies. The castle looks exactly like the one from the movies and has a ride through it. The town Hogsmeade is very similar to the one shown in the movie with all of the famous stores like Honeydukes (candy store), Zonko's (joke shop), Olivander's (wand shop), Three Broomsticks (tavern), and a few others. There are a few other rides that keep with the theming. They even have a portion of the land that represents the train station and platform 9 and 3/4.
 |Basically, it's any HP fan's dream place. 
[Olivander's is on Diagon Alley, not in Hogsmeade.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c709psv?context=5)|This is true. And while going through the Harry Potter training class they explained that Universal and WB pretty much wanted the highlights of each place. 
[""Basically, it's any HP fan's dream place""  What about the Warner Bros. Harry Potter studio tour featuring legit Harry Potter props and outfits? And a scale model of the Hogwarts Castle used for the Panoramic shots.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c7091aq?context=5)|This is also a dream place for fans, including me. I've never been to the studio tour so I can't compare the two. 
[You ever had any of the cast come in to eat or do promotional stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c708ygn?context=5)|Yes, but not while I worked there. Most of the major cast has visited HP world at least once. Especially when it was just opening up. But lately they haven't been over. No need to now really. 
[What would it take to become a Beauxbaton's student in the park? Cause that'd pretty much be the best thing ever, even if it did mean making a new reddit account. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c709apc?context=5)|This I am not sure of. It is a different department than what I am under. My guess is to apply to Universal and you would have to audition to be one of them. Much past that I don't know. 
[Have you seen people spread ashes in the park?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c708255?context=5)|I have not seen it actually. I did read about it on here though.. neat idea but I bet security was all over that one. 
[Oh I could have saw you. I was there in may. I got stuck on the ride inside hogwarts (I can't think of the name right now\).  Do you ever work outside the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, in other places in the park?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c707we1?context=5)|I have not yet but as a Universal employee I can pick up shifts anywhere in the parks as long as I am trained for the position I am picking up. But 3 Brooms usually keeps me busy enough throughout the week lol. 
[1\) How old are you? What a qualifications do you have/did you need to get this job? and 2\) HOW CAN I GET A JOB THERE?  or rather, how does one go about getting a job there? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c709kyf?context=5)|I am 21. You just need some sort of customer service. And you just apply to Universal and say you are interested in working in Harry Potter. 
[We went a while ago and noticed items moving in the restaurant.  Are there any cool out of the normal things we should be looking at like at the restaurant the stuffed head moved after a while. What else is there? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c7098lx?context=5)|Honestly there are shadows and moving things everywhere. Just have to look for them while you are there. Outside of the 3 Brooms I'm not sure. I know that the clock in the middle of the courtyard has an owl that comes out on the hour kinda like a coo coo clock. And there are constantly moving things in all of the window shops throughout the whole land. 
[I'm going to be auditioning next year for Halloween Horror Nights! So tell me though, how'd you go about getting a job there? Harry Potter and Marvel would be the two sides of the park I'm most interested in... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c708x1r?context=5)|Universal is constantly hiring. Just put in an application. As long as you don't have a record you should have no problem with getting an interview. In the interview I would say just express your interest in where you would like to work. They don't always positions open, especially in HP world, but if you get hired you can always transfer to the place you wanna work later. 
[Why would there be a lawsuit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70l7zu?context=5)|If someone got injured they could blame Universal for it. They just want to cover their butts on all sides so they don't lose money. 
[Were you a big Harry Potter fan before working in the park and how has the experience changed your perspective on the franchise? Thanks for taking your time to answer questions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c709w0x?context=5)|Yes I was a huge fan before. Still am. But working here has changed my perspective on the franchise. There are tons and tons of things employees can an cannot do because of the direct contract Universal has with WB. If these are violated by the employee, they have a good chance of getting fired. WB is very strict with their idea and image of what they want the place to be like. 
[Can you expand on what these rules and regulations consist of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70m246?context=5)|Like there are certain things we can and cannot say. If someone asks us what butterbeer tastes like we have to say ""It is a very sweet drink that is reminiscent of butterscotch and shortbread cookies."" We actually all had to go through a butterbeer training class. They train us to get into ""character"" as wizards and say muggle when we can. The wardrobe we wear is very strict. They wont let us wear shorts at least in the summer. That's not the image we want. We aren't even allowed to have the butterbeer prices posted out at the carts because it goes against ""theming"" according to them. Believe I get so tried of saying the same speil for 7 hours straight.
[WB are bastards that way.  I tried to buy a 1989 Batmobile from a guy a few years back, WB came and confiscated it.  Or at the very least it was a cease and desist, can't quite remember.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70fw5q?context=5)|Either way that's a shame. How awesome would it be to have that Batmobile?! GAHHH!
[It'd be really cool to have the prices posted in galleons and sickles then give the muggles conversion charts (or maybe I'm just too much of a nerd\). On a side note, do you know if Universal does any type of college internship like Disney?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70rmrk?context=5)|I know during the summer they do have some college programs. At least in HP world. We had a lot of people just there for three months from the UK and Indiana. It was really neat to meet and work with them. Idk if they have any programs for local kids at all though. 
[Do you know how to get one of these summer internships? I'm from Australia and would love to work in the park. I actually got an internship with Disney World a couple of years back but I coudn't afford to fly myself over. :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70zu5j?context=5)|I don't know really. They internships we had come in this year were schools from Indiana and the UK. I am sure you could find something on the universal website or find a number to start talking to people. Also ask the school you attend to see if they do any programs like this and if not you could try to start it?
[Who are your favorite characters from the series?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70a3bs?context=5)|Mad Eye Moody, Lupin, and Sirius Black. All of them are BAMFs.
[What's the least crowded time of year to visit the park?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c709f30?context=5)|February and September. Those are the dead months. And May somewhat. 
[Neat!  i'm going to be there over thanksgiving; anything i should be sure and not miss?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70904g?context=5)|If you have the time do everything. If not get a butterbeer, go on Forbidden Journey, go to olivander's and Honeydukes and if you are hungry eat at 3 Broomsticks. 
[What kind of food do you serve at The Three Broomsticks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70jyas?context=5)|Lunch: Chicken and ribs that have been smoked. Turkey leg. Roasted potatoes. Wedge fries. Corn on the cob. Cornish pasties - basically puff pastry with meat and veggies inside. Shepard's pie. Salads. And some usual kids menu stuff. Drink wise - butterbeer, lemonade, pear and apple cider, hogs head brew, pumpkin juice and fizz and tea.
 |Breakfast: usual breakfast platters. We have a traditional english that includes blood sausage. Haven't tried it yet. 
[When is the best day of week/year to come?  When I went it was so crowded I just had to leave.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70akkr?context=5)|February, September and May. Dead months. no lines no waiting. 
[Even in the Harry Potter parts, it's dead? Is that part still more crowded than the rest of the park?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70d4va?context=5)|No it's still pretty dead. There were days I was literally trying to find something to do/clean because no one was there. The only thing that is consistently busy is the butterbeer carts. There might be less than a 5 min wait for that. And it would only be slightly more ""crowded"" than the rest of the park. 
[I visited during the busy seasons, when the line for the castle ride averaged about 90 minutes. HOWEVER, I never waited for more than 5 minutes for the Dragon Challenge. I've loved that ride since 1999 when it was still Dueling Dragons (and the line was much longer\), so my family and I rode it 6 times in one day. I don't know why it was comparatively unpopular (maybe because of the less overt theme?\) but I was NOT complaining.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70fr6s?context=5)|Maybe just because it wasn't as ""new"" as the rest of the land. It was already an existing ride, but the name was just changed. 
[What is the butterbeer and how can I make some for myself at home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70a1wd?context=5)|Butterbeer is very sweet and tastes like butterscotch. And I don't even know how to make it lol. I just sell it.  
[Is it crazy overpriced? Are you a HP fan? Where are you at school?  How do you manage your school and this job? Butterbeer= good?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70bz0p?context=5)|Its overpriced because it's a theme park but not too much so. I am a huge HP fan. I go to Valencia right now. And the managers are pretty good about being flexible about the schedule because a lot of us are in school. And butterbeer is great. I personally prefer the frozen kind. 
[Is it true that you guys are planning an expansion at the park this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c70aeho?context=5)|Yeah... I don't know about this year but soon. But like I said I can't say more than what Universal has already said about this. 
[Can you tell us anything about the new portion of the park they're going to be opening? and what is this ""course"" like that you have to take?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/132dg0/iama_employee_at_the_wizarding_world_of_harry/c709tvw?context=5)|I cannot say anything more than what Universal has released.

They specifically said we can't sell Coke products in the land. I'm guessing they kept the alcohol because it makes them more money. Many guests are very surprised we don't serve coke. Some have gotten upset about it. It doesn't make too much sense but we are just following orders lol

Also, how do you present it?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/133nm4/whats_okay_to_put_on_your_portfolio_are_school/,"I applied for a software engineering internship last week, and just heard back. Great right? Only thing is, they want a portfolio. I'm more than a competent programmer, but I never thought about making one, mostly because I'm an electrical engineering student, and my coursework isn't rooted in software, not even mostly. I've only taken more of an interest in software only recently as well. 

So my question is, can I cite school assignments? I'm hesitant to do so because even the most involved ones don't span any more than 2-3 weeks. Here are some of the ones I'm thinking about digging up:

- A Conway's Game of Life simulation

- Pipelined MIPS datapath with branching and forwarding in VHDL

- Pedometer using the Mikro Board for PIC24 (actually in progress). One of the job requirements/preferences actually lists knowing how to use at least one microcontroller, so I think this is a good one to cite.

- Misc. simple Kinect games

- Implementation of A* search. 

- Demonstration of stereo matching, geometry, Harris detectors, SIFT, and RANSAC algorithms (computer vision stuff)

The above will also show another concern of mine: most of that is nothing if not standard. Not only do classes reuse assignments, it's not as if well established solutions/implementations aren't found for most of these. Despite all these concerns though I don't have much else to go on. 

Another question I have is, how do you present your portfolio? The person from HR that contacted me didn't say much, just to add my portfolio to my application. Could I use like a Github account for this? Should I ask for what kind of format they'd like to see, or this is there a common industry practice regarding portfolios?

Please let me know what you think, I'd really like this internship. Thanks all"

136wyw,378,2012-11-14,Trends in Engineering Student Resumes - Top Mistakes After Reading 100+,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/136wyw/trends_in_engineering_student_resumes_top/,"A few weeks ago our group of engineering recruiters threw up a thread where we were accepting and reviewing engineering student resumes. [Check it out over here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/119sce/need_help_on_your_resume/) We ended up reviewing hundreds of resumes, and we found some interesting trends that we'd like to share.

#1. Perhaps the most interesting one is that well-formatted resumes almost always belonged to students with a lower GPA. Students with higher GPAs (3.5+) almost always had badly formatted resumes. My guess is that students with lower GPAs focus on presentation value to make up for the weaker GPA. There is good news for them - it works! The presentation value matters more than you think it would. Having a bad resume is like not wearing a suit to an interview. When we have to sort through resumes quickly, our eyes naturally gravitate to good looking resumes, and if we have two equally qualified candidates to choose from, we might as well choose the guy who has a nicer resume. After all, it looks like he put more work into his job hunt.

This trend seems like a really strange thing to us overall. You work hard and pay big money for an education to get an awesome job. If you have a 3.8, you have the tools you need to be awesome, so why not spend an hour or two making sure your resume shows you are awesome?

#2. After staring at a stack of resumes, your eyes begin to glaze over and you eagerly identify good formatted resumes from afar. To give you a better idea of what a good resume looks like, we are assembling the best and the worst resumes from the past month and we will show you what their formatting looks like. We'll be making that post in the near future, but if you want to get the scoop faster, [subscribe to our newsletter!](http://www.cockrellcareeradvice.com)

#3. About half of the resumes submitted did not have a GPA attached. People who expressed concern that their GPA was low didn't actually have extremely horrible GPAs. Most people who said they were low were in the ~2.7 range, which is not as bad as it seems! Perhaps the only time we would recommend not writing your GPA on a resume is when it is below 2.50. Many large engineering companies have their cutoffs at 2.50, and by not writing down your GPA, you are automatically disqualifying yourselves from some good job opportunities.

If your GPA is not listed we know you are hiding something. Instead of making us work to call you or interview you about your GPA to make sure you are a good fit, it's easier for us to find another candidate who is a better fit on paper.

If you are still nervous, consider listing only your Major GPA or list it first.

Listing your GPA, even if you think it is low, will put you above the masses.

#4. A decent number of people put pictures in their resumes. We have seen pictures of people's faces, QR codes, university emblems, pictures of application icons, and more. It looks funny! Having your face stare up at me will grab my attention, but in a bad way. Keep your resume picture free. It looks clean and professional that way.

#5. For descriptors, everyone seems to undervalue themselves. Students ""assisted"" with projects or ""participated"" in something. What does that tell me? Readers of your resume are not interested in your generic job description. We want to know what *you* did! Did *you* calculate the horsepower of a pump? Did *you* draw a schematic for a piece of equipment? Did *you* program 10,000 lines of code to make your employer's life easier? Did *you* save the company $1,000 with your accomplishments? These are things that we are most interested in.

A real common one is that people like to put is their senior design projects on their resumes. Instead of speaking about what *you* did on that senior design project, students often say what the team accomplished. So it doesn't help us to know that your team designed a car. We want to know what part of the car *you* designed.

#6. Although it's good to be specific on descriptors, you want to be specific on what you accomplished. This does not mean throw engineering jargon into the resume. Even as engineers, we do not always understand what something technical like ""Worked on a DC-28 modulator which increased palpitation of the deglobber"" means. Show your technical capabilities, but do not lose us in the finer details!

#7. We were surprised at how many people have had industry experience in terms of internships and co-ops, and did not represent those experiences well! A lot of people put their experiences in chronological order, but this can be to your disadvantage. If you were an intern at ExxonMobil last summer, and you are a cashier presently at school, then do not list cashier first on your resume! The internship from ExxonMobil is much more impressive and should be listed first.

So make sure your best experiences are up top. Recruiters who are in a massive hurry might not read the bottom halves of your resumes.

Let us know what you think and post any questions on anything - resumes, job interviews, career fairs, whatever.

Do you want an engineering recruiter to critique your resume? We can – it’s what we do.

We just released our first service and are offering a promotion to get the buzz going. We will look at your resume and offer personalized advice for $4.99 until November 21st. After that, the price will go up to $69.99. [Interested in having us look at your resume? Click this link!](http://www.cockrellcareeradvice.com/services) 

Any other, non-personal questions you should post in this thread below! We have also done some mock interviews with a few people we have met on Reddit and have gotten awesome feedback. We are looking for more people to mock interview. If you are interested, email us at **talk@cockrellcareeradvice.com**

**tl;dr** Write down your GPA. Format matters. No graphics. Talk about what *you* did. Be specific on your descriptions but don't get too technical. Put the good stuff at the top of your resume.

[EDIT] Thanks for the great response everyone! It looks like we answered everyone's questions. Feel free to PM this Reddit account or email us at talk@cockrellcareeradvice.com if you want to touch base."

Are there any European redditors who succeed to find a job in the US? I read that one must be somehow sponsored by the company that hire you. Is it really tough? How do you manage the interviews from Europe since we cannot go in the US with a tourist visa in order to find a job?

My job would be, I guess, something related to software engineering. Since after my master's degree I directly started my PhD, I don't really have any kind of professional experience but 3 months of PhD. 

I already considered to find an internship during my PhD but I would prefer to have a ""real job"" for an undefined amount of time.

**A Little Bit about me**




I'm a college student studying Multimedia Production. I am in the third semester now. The course teaches about a wide variety of things. From Coding to 3d to after effects to animation. It is a great course. But about a year I will need to be finding a ""work placement"" (essentially an internship). 

That is where I would like to be prepared. I am excelling in everything involving code. I am even being paid by the school to tutor some of my struggling classmates. I just don't really know what I need to know to make a good impression on a potential employer.

What I currently am skilled in is Html, Css, Flash Scripting, Photoshop (I know it's not coding related, but I am good with it), Php, and JavaScript. I able functionally use 3ds max, after effects, and Illustrator (trying to get better).

[When people say that string theory doesn't make testable predictions, do they mean that it doesn't predict any new phenomena, or do they mean it fails to describe known phenomena?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tb1h?context=5)|String theory predicts many existing phenomena, like gauge forces and gravity.
[I'm told that Hawking radiation occurs when a virtual particle with negative energy falls into a black hole, gaining enough energy to become real, and its positive-energy partner escapes. What happens when a positive-energy particle falls in and its negative-energy partner tries to escape?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tb1h?context=5)|The negative energy particles can't escape, they always fall in.
[When a photon interacts with a charged particle, does it push the charged particle in the direction of the photon's trajectory? Or does it push a positively charged particle in one direction perpendicular to the photon's trajectory (because electric field is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of an electromagnetic plane wave\) and a negatively charged particle in the opposite direction? In that case, what is the direction of the momentum of the photon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tb1h?context=5)|Depends on the interaction; different possibilities have different likelihoods, according to quantum mechanics.

 |The Higgs is an indication that there really is something called the Higgs *field*, which fills space and gives mass to other particles. After this, we're looking for whatever we can find -- hopefully dark matter, maybe supersymmetry, certainly any surprises Nature wants to throw at us.
 |Theoretical physicists propose new models to describe the laws of nature, as well as working out the consequences of existing ones. Lots of sitting in coffeeshops scribbling equations on pieces of paper. We propose models, the experimentalists come along and shoot them down.

[Do you believe the ""wierdness"" of quantum mechanics is here to stay?

Is it possible some form of hidden variables will restore locality?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u6rc?context=5)|Bell does basically rule out local hidden-variable theories.

 |Fiction is different, you shouldn't expect the same standards as you would get in a documentary.

[If we were to establish contact with an alien race, would we be on par with sharing physics information with one another (have we found out the majority of what there is to know\), or are we in our infancy with our knowledge of physics? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u3vj?context=5)|Total infancy. We know a lot, especially when it comes to the Standard Model -- the aliens won't overturn that. But it's hard to say how much we don't know.
[Do neutron stars and black dwarves emit radiation in the same way that black holes emit Hawking radiation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70ttay?context=5)|Nope; the radiation from black holes arises because there is an event horizon, a point of no return. Ordinary stars/planets/etc don't have that.
[If nothing ever escapes from a black hole, does that mean gravitons are coming from just outside the event horizon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70ttay?context=5)|Gravitons don't really ""escape"" from a black hole. (Nor do photons, when the black hole is electrically charged.) It's better to say that the black hole supports an external gravitational or electromagnetic field.
[If there was a neutron star with a mass less than the Chandrasekhar limit, would it turn into a black dwarf (or white dwarf, if the transformation released a lot of energy\)? If so, would the transformation release enough energy to eject matter faster than the escape velocity? If so, would that matter be made of light elements, heavy elements, or middleweight elements such as iron and nickel?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70ttay?context=5)|The Chadrasekhar limit is actually the point beyond which a white dwarf will collapse to a neutron star. If for some reason there was a neutron star lighter than that, it would essentially stay a neutron star forever.
[Best short explanation I've seen: Link to www.youtube.com.  Best long explanation I've seen: Link to www.youtube.com.  Electrons spin, and move. Suppose an electron is moving toward you, and it is also spinning around itself (image a rolling fighter-jet, and you're looking at it as it speeds toward you\) - it can either be moving ""clockwise"" from your point of view, or ""counter-clockwise"". We call this a left-handed or right-handed electron, we call this the electron's ""Helicity"".  If you are looking at an electron, and you see it is left-handed, but someone else, who is in a moving train, could look at the same electron, and see that it is right-handed. The electron's Helicity depends on how fast you are moving, relative to the electron.  This is not true for massless particles! A photon can also be ""left-handed"", but *everyone* will agree it is ""left-handed"". It does not matter how fast you are moving, you will always see this photon as left-handed.  Summing up - massless particles (photons\) have a definitive Helicity, massive particles (electrons\) don't.  Now the weird thing: there's something called weak interaction. Not important for us what that is. But here's the thing - ONLY left-handed electrons interact with the weak interaction. WTF? This can't be consistent, because electrons are massive, and they don't even have a definitive Helicity!  The solution: electrons are actually massless. In addition, there is some field - the Higgs field, which is constantly interacting with the electrons, slowing them down. They APPEAR to be massive, because the Higgs field is ""on"" (non-zero\) everywhere, and is constantly ""slowing the electrons down"".

What can I do as a member of the public to promote and participate in physical cosmology research?  2\) I'm so fascinated with physical cosmology that I would like to apply my Computer Science career to the field.  What role would a computer scientist with a literacy in mathematics, algorithms, simulation, and physics have in physical cosmology theory and research?  What other skills are usually found within members of a cosmology research team?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tigl?context=5)|Thanks!

[If quantum entanglement can take place across distances vastly greater than would allow near-instantaneous information transfer at the speed of light, does that mean that quantum relationships are in some way more fundamental than spacetime?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u41m?context=5)|I think that's fair, yes. We can't use entanglement to transfer information faster than light, but quantum mechanics seems to describe the whole universe in a non-local way. That is, given that QM is true, the interesting challenge is to explain why the accessible universe follows local rules. (It's a challenge we've mostly met, I think.)
[Hi Sean. I have read ""From Eternity to Here"" and really enjoyed it. I have also taken your TTC Course on Dark Matter and Dark Energy. My question is: Since time and space are part of the same thing called spacetime, and the expansion of the universe is accellerating, wouldn't that mean TIME is also accellerating (since according to General Relativity time and space are inseparable\)? And what implications does this have as you go backwards in time? Does it ""slow down"" or decellerate? And what could this mean about the very early stages following the Big Bang? Is it possible that time scales were actually longer than estimated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tdjg?context=5)|Nope. ""The universe is expanding"" is really just shorthand for ""space is expanding"" -- time doesn't expand or accelerate.
[Can you explain to me why particles gain mass ""like I was 10 years old""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70t8pp?context=5)|Probably not! But very roughly: think of waving your hand through the air, then waving it through thick molasses. The latter is harder, requires more push, right? The Higgs field is like that molasses -- it makes it harder to push particles, therefore giving them mass.
[So actually mass comes out from nowhere? Or, more likely, 'everywhere'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tegk?context=5)|The Higgs field is everywhere, giving mass. That's the 1964 idea that seems to have borne fruit.
[At what point does the electromagnetic repulsion of two protons equal the gravitational attraction between them? Do you think it is possible that gravity could be an emergent or statistical force? In nature how are basis vectors chosen for quantum measurements? How do I become a physicist and do you want to get coffee some time?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70ulaq?context=5)|The electromagnetic repulsion is always much larger. Both gravity and E&amp;M depend on distance in the same way -- an inverse-square law. So if one force (gravity) is weaker at one separation, it will be weaker at all separations.
 |I do think gravity could be emergent, but the details remain elusive.
 |The preferred basis in quantum mechanics is basically fixed by the fact that interactions are local in space. Superpositions that are macroscopically different will quickly become separate from each other.

[1\) If gravity and linear time movement forward are linked; and the Higgs particle is the supposed source/mechanism contributing gravity to matter; then if you were to destroy the higgs particle would time cease to only move in one direction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70xbcg?context=5)|1) I don't think ""gravity and linear time movement"" are linked. There would still be time without gravity, and even an arrow of time under the right circumstances.
[2\) One theory was that our universe is inside a black hole. Then are there other universes inside our black holes? Each with time movement magnitudes slower/faster than the preceding universe?  3\) Where is the matter/light that a white hole spewing come from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70xbcg?context=5)|3) Short answer: there probably aren't any white holes. If there are, they naturally turn into other forms of matter and energy. It's basically the formation of a black hole, played backward in time.
[4\) How does the higgs particle relate to string theory? How big of a step is the discovery of this particle to getting closer to a unified theory?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70xbcg?context=5)|4) Not really related to string theory much at all. The Higgs is crucial to the story of unifying the weak and electromagnetic forces, but the strong force isn't directly involved.
[5\) If all matter has an opposite anti-matter counter part. Does the Higgs particle have an anti-higgs particle. Could anti-gravity technology be made from said anti-particle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70xbcg?context=5)|5) Not all particles have anti-particles; photons don't, for example. There is no anti-Higgs in the simplest models.
[What are your thoughts on human interstellar travel? Specifically, do you think one of the currently proposed ideas for FTL travel (Warp drives, etc.\) hold promise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u4ov?context=5)|I think FTL is a non-starter in the real world. We can travel to other stars, but we'll have to be patient.
[What makes the cosmologists and physicists so sure there is actually something out there called Dark Matter, instead of just the gravitational models being wrong/poorly tuned for larger scales?  Is there some sort of smoking gun out there that leads one to conclude ""matter"" over ""back to the chalkboard?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u73c?context=5)|We've certainly tried to make models of modified gravity -- I've tried myself! But the data just don't point that way any more. We've seen gravity pointing towards places where there seems to be very little matter at all.
[What kind of technologies could possibly come out of the Higgs discovery? Could starships be powered by Higgs-drives (or something like that\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70tkyc?context=5)|Sadly, no. (Chapter 13 of the new book.) There are spinoffs of the experimental effort, of course, from new computing technologies to better superconductors. But the Higgs itself is all about discovery and understanding, not about better tech.
[What's in the works for the next-gen colliders after LHC? And what do the napkin designs look like for two generations out? What sort of time frame will they be built, what energies will they reach, and what might we expect to see with them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u0sl?context=5)|The most popular next-generation plan is to collide electrons and positrons together at high energies. (The LHC collides protons.) Electrons are harder to get to very high velocities, but the collisions you get are a lot cleaner. So now that we've discovered at least one new particle, an electron/positron collider would be a great way to study it.
 |Past that, harder to tell, but a much-higher-energy proton collider is an obvious choice. Another possibility is a muon collider; muons are more massive than electrons, so they get to higher energies, but they also tend to decay. All of these are pie-in-the-sky right now; nobody is stepping up with $10 billion+ and offering to finance a new particle accelerator. Hopefully we can cobble together a working international collaboration.
[If we could build a muon collider this century, is it conceivable that a tauon collider could be built centuries hence for even MOAR POWER, or is there some fundamental barrier beyond the ""muons and taus are heavier electrons"" abstraction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70u85r?context=5)|Muons are unstable, but they do last long enough to let us imagine building a collider based on them. Taus are just to short-lived.

[In follow up to my earlier question ""Does time accelerate with spacial expansion?"" (the answer was 'nope'\), is the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics responsible for this segregation between space and time (usually known today as ""spacetime""\) ? How IS IT that space can expand without affecting time within that space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/134vvm/i_am_sean_carroll_theoretical_physicist_and/c70ugtw?context=5)|Nope again. The 2nd Law fixes the *arrow* of time -- the difference between the past and future -- but nothing about the ""geometry"" of time (which falls under the purview of general relativity).
 |The real point is that, in the real world, we have a situation where you can ""slice"" spacetime in a fairly sensible way into ""space plus time."" In principle that can be done in an infinite number of ways, but in practice the matter distribution of the universe picks out a ""best"" way. Once that is done, time is just time; it's the same everywhere. (On average, at any rate; there are local effects from gravitational fields of matter and black holes and so forth.)
[(1\)Everything in the universe seems to be following well defined physical laws which can be expressed in terms of mathematical equations.

For people like me, thinking about the origin of the universe, universities are definitely the way to go, along with maybe a couple of research institutes.

13651g,1,2012-11-14,[Build Ready] First build!!!,millerlite14,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/13651g/build_ready_first_build/,"I'm super stoked to building my first PC.  To be honest, I made a mediocre build a few weeks ago, but I didn't like a lot of things about it, so I decided to go all out.  This is going to be a general purpose machine, used for programming, gaming, VMs, and other things.

First some things to note:
* I spent around $1500 on the build, getting nice deals on all the hard drives and the graphics card (which make up a *huge* part of the cost).

* I got the 8GB of EVO RAM free with the mobo.  I actually routinely use &gt; 7GB of memory easily, so I purchased the Ripjaws 16GB pack.  If/when I build my first server, I plan on using those 8GB in there; but since that won't happen for a while, I just threw them in my build.

* I have a crap ton of programs, and I hate feeling cramped on a boot drive, so I got a new Samsung 830 512GB on eBay for relatively cheap.

* I have a dedicated SSD for games.

* I have 4 HDDs in RAID 10 for data.  I have a lot of music, photos, and documents, so I needed at least 1.5 TB.  I wanted to try out RAID 0, but I'm kinda scared of the Barracudas failing, so that's why I chose RAID 1.

* I'm running 8 (yes, 8!!!!) fans, all of which are either PWM fans (which are adjustable) or molex fans connected to a cheap fan controller which can adjust voltage.  All the fans will be regulated by the mobo.

* Yes, the CPU cooler is not necessary, but I didn't like the stock fan, so I bought a cheap aftermarket cooler.  I got a 92mm cooler to fit in the the Blackhawk case (larger coolers hit the side fan, apparently).

* Running Windows 8.  Huge fan of it.

* I'll be getting a third monitor next year when I begin my real job.

I have some back story for why I got the parts I did for those interested, after the PCPartPicker list.  I'm still open to suggestions, so I'm looking forward to your thoughts!!!

So some people may consider this a cookie-cutter build, and well, it admittedly kinda is.  About 2-3 weeks ago, I thought I bricked my primary computer, a laptop, by flashing the bios.  HP was completely unhelpful since my laptop was running Win8 (""I'm sorry, but we do not support Windows 8 and our HP drivers for it because Windows 8 has not been released yet"" - HP Tech Support, 10/24, 2 days before Windows 8 release). The internetz was for once not helpful, so I decided to screw all the traditional OEMs and buy enough desktop parts so that I could move my hard disks to the desktop.  I had to move quickly (I'm a CS college student that depends on his computer for everything), so I quickly bought what I needed, all of which were on pretty good sales and were relatively well reviewed:

* i5-3570

* BlackHawk case

* ASRock Z77 Extreme 4 (came with 8GB EVO RAM)

* Apevia 680W PSU

I ended up resurrecting my laptop 2 days later using Chinese forum magic (the interwebz never fails me), and I didn't feel like returning the desktop parts that were coming.  I realized I had some money laying around that I had saved up for a while (I work my ass off in my term-time jobs and internships for this type of money), so I decided why the hell not, I've always wanted to build a computer so why the hell not right now, and why not make an investment on the thing where I spend so much of my time.

I put together the build of those 4 parts plus my laptop disks, and it was sooooo awesome.  So I bought the rest of these parts over the next few weeks, and I'm finally ready to build Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  I bought a ton of sleeved cable extensions and/or cable sleeving, so I expect to have a relatively clean and uniform build once I'm done with it (I've been hooked on [r/cablemanagement](/r/cablemanagement) lately).

Geez, this ended up being really long, but I'm really really really excited about this.  I've always dreamed of building a computer, and I'm pretty stoked that I finally have the time and money to do it.

**TL;DR I bought a few parts by accident, then built out the rest of my build using those parts.  Build will be complete this weekend, and am still open to suggestions.  Looking forward to your thoughts and comments!**"
135gk3,1,2012-11-13,"Hey Reddit, I just got my dream job offer -- but there's a twist: I already accepted a different offer... Please help me! What would you do?",jobofferme,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/135gk3/hey_reddit_i_just_got_my_dream_job_offer_but/,"So here's the situation (being completely honest, I know some people will judge me):

So, I interned with company A this past summer and ended up getting a full time job offer from them. However, the process of turning my intern offer into a full time offer took some time and I wasn't 100% positive it was going to happen; so, like any other risk averse individual, I applied to a few different firms, one of which (company B) was hiring for a job I've been eyeing for the past two years.

A week later, the full time offer from company A ended up coming through and I had a short deadline to accept or reject it. As I said above, I'm pretty risk averse and couldn't let myself turning down a decent job offer in the field I was looking to enter without another offer in hand; so I accepted it.

However, after accepting it, I didn't have the guts to tell company B that I'd accepted a different offer, so I finished the interview process and didn't really expect to get an offer because I didn't feel that I interviewed as well as I could have. As you probably would've guessed, I actually ended up getting the offer from company B.

And now here I am, with an accepted job offer (at a firm where I already know a lot of our local office) and another one in hand (at a firm where I would much rather work, better compensations, more prestigious, etc.): I don't know what to do. I know reneging on a job offer after accepting is frowned upon, but at the same time, I know for certain that I would get better work experience, quicker career development, etc. with company B but I don't think that being afraid to hurt some people's feelings is a good enough reason for turning down company B.

Also important to note that my start date with company A isn't until Aug/Sep/Oct of 2013, so it's not like I'd leave them scrambling with only 2 weeks to find someone else.

And I feel like this should go without saying, but I'm going to say it anyway: if I do end up backing out of company A, I will do it as graciously as possible, explaining my current situation (there are also a couple other reasons why I like B, like it will let me stay near home and help my family take care of our grandma), and apologizing with all sincerity. I've hit ""friend"" status with a number of people at the firm and would definitely (try my best to) keep those relationships going forward. However, I still expect a few people to give me an earful, maybe about how they will badmouth me if they ever get the chance.

So, what do you think Reddit? If I back out of A, do you think I should be afraid of people going around bad mouthing me? (To be honest, when I hear people bad mouthing others, it says more to me about them than about the person they're bad mouthing...). "
139kwd,7,2012-11-15,My American visa processing experience (advice for newcomers) ,[deleted],germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/139kwd/my_american_visa_processing_experience_advice_for/,"Right off the bat: I'm still in processing so this will be an evolving thread with edits made as the process develops.

I'm a 26 y/o American gay dude who fell in love with a Mexican dude in San Francisco who happened to be in the United States on a year long internship from Germany where he is a university student. Not wanting to end our relationship, I gave notice, sold all my stuff, packed my bags, and got an airplane for Germany. I arrived October 1. 

I mention this because there are ways to secure your legal stay in Germany if you're able to get married to a German citizen or if you're married to someone enrolled in a full time study program. Don't quote me on this one, but it seems to be my only ""get married"" option without taking into account the obstacle of the current US gay marriage recognition status (getting married in your home country seems to be easier than in Germany regardless of the situation). However, there's many people who will read this and not be in a position to marry a German citizen or have a spouse studying in Germany. How the work permits function beyond simply being allowed to stay in the country isn't something I know too much about in the case of legalizing your stay this way. 

I'll admit that I was knowingly naive in thinking that it'd be smooth sailing and ""an adventure"" to come to Germany and figure things out here. **I've read many posts  about Americans wanting to come to Germany and the visa process and how it all works, so I decided to write this post to share information through experience.** I wish I had made similar efforts before taking the plunge. 

I came with the intention of learning German (no previous knowledge) and enrolling in a masters course eventually. The Ausländerbehörde (foreigners office) told me today that you can remain on a student visa for up to 10 years. Easy cake. A simple language school enrollment will suffice to give you a student visa. There may be a minimum amount of hours you have to take, but I'm enrolled in an intensive German class that runs M-F from 8:30 am to 12:30 pm. I told the school management that I intended on remaining enrolled for a year to obtain at least a C1 proficiency German level and so that they would give me a proof of enrollment a year out from my enrollment date. Germany measures language proficiency on a A-C scale with levels in between A 1 part 1, A1 part 2, B1 part 1, etc. It takes two modules, or 200 hours to complete each letter subsection, so it will take me eight months to reach level B1. So far the masters programs I have found that require German language proficiency require the equivalent of a B2 or C1. 

The tricky part is that you can't work on a student visa for language courses. Apparently you can work up to 180 days or 240 half time days per year under a normal student visa. 

**Step 1**: If you're an American citizen, either get a student/work visa ahead of time by contacting your closest German consulate or come to Germany with your automatic 90-day visa. This post is geared towards doing the latter. If you choose to get a visa beforehand, you'll process that either in coordination with the university you're enrolling with or a company that has already extended an offer of employment to you. 

**Step 2**: If you intend to stay here longer than 90 days, you must go to the local Bürgerbüro to register where you will be living. I didn't do this until almost to months into my stay and I regret it. After waiting a good half hour in line, I was giving a one week free pass to use on the tram and a coupon book to many establishments in town. It would have made my life much more easier had I done it right away. Take your passport and local German address. I took my U.S. voter registration card which had been mailed to my German address in case they wanted some kind of ""official proof."" They asked me the city in which I was born, city my passport was processed in the US, and my religion (weird I know).

**Step 3**: Go to the Ausländerbehörde. You'll need your proof of registration, which you received in Step 2 at the Bürgerbüro. You'll also need your passport and either proof you're enrolled in a school or a work contract from a company that wants to hire you. You'll be given an appointment to return to the Ausländerbehörde (my appointment was set more than a month out) with a couple of documents. 

These include: 1) Official Registration from Step 2 2) Passport and a copy of it 3) biometrisches Lichtbild *biometric photograph*  4) Proof of enrollment (if studying) or Arbeitsbescheinigung/Arbeitsvertrag *work offer/work contract* 5) Krankenversicherung *health insurance* 6) Mietvertrag *housing lease* 7) Anmeldung zum Sprachkurs *language course registration* 8) Kontoauszüge der letzen 3 Monate *three most recent bank statements* 9) 110 Euros in cash

These items were highlighted on a list for me to bring in my particular case. You may also be required to bring any of the following: Schulbescheinigung, Ausbildungsvertrag, Zulassungsbescheid, Sparbuch, Lohnbescheinigungen der letzten 3 Monate, Geburtsurkunde, Heiratsurkunde, Immatrikulationsbescheinigung, Verpflichtungserklärung, Vaterschaftsanerkennung, Sorgerechtserklärung, Erklärung über die eheliche, Lebensgemeinschaft, Anlange Angaben zu den Eltern i.e. *School certificate, apprenticeship contract, letter of acceptance, savings account, salary certificates the last 3 months, birth certificate, marriage certificate, registration certificate, co-signer, paternity, child custody declaration, declaration of marriage, cohabitation, basic information of parents*

At this point, I need to wait until my appointment and *cross my fingers* that the English language school I want to work for gives me a work contract or official work offer. On this point... I strongly recommend you get a CELTA certification long before you start looking for English teaching gigs. Most reputable places require them and they're good world-wide. Otherwise I'll be on a student visa to learn German and be unable to work until I get another job offer and redo the visa process to get a work permit.

**Bank Accounts**: Apparently you can open a bank account just by virtue of being American. I'll be testing this out next week. Keep in mind Germany isn't ask keen on plastic as the US. I haven't used plastic other than to buy train tickets. No store or restaurant I've been to so far accepts them, even large department stores. Be sure you'll be able to withdraw Euros from an ATM before you come. Alert your bank you'll be traveling and keep in mind there's a foreign transaction fee on every purchase or withdrawal.

**Credit Cards**: Before coming to Germany, I applied for a CapitalOne credit card. They have no foreign transaction fees and no annual fees. 

**Mobile phones**: You can get a pre-paid phone without a contract by simply walking into a T-Mobile store. If you have an iPhone from the US, you will have to unlock if if you're still under contract at home, or call your provider to have them unlock it for you. I'll leave it up to you to figure out how to unlock it if you're still under contract. If you really don't know how to use the internet, message me and I might tell you.

**Gyms**: So far I haven't figured this out. There seems to be huge waiting lists at all the gyms and they require a bank account to register because they automatically withdraw from your account every week. "

I was expecting to talk to the CTO about a backend software engineering internship, but I got a frontend engineer instead.

The questions were entirely frontend stuff, which I hadn't brushed up on, so it didn't go very well at all. I probably should have told him I was expecting a backend interview.

Is there anything I can do to salvage my chances? It's a really awesome startup that I'd love to intern at.

[Since Scribblenauts Unlimited is the first game in the series intended to be displayed on a large HD display, how much of the artwork for objects had to be redrawn?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cdun?context=5)|We re-drew all the backgrounds for Scribblenauts Unlimited to have that HD feel. The characters and objects were updates from the iOS version.
[The Wii U version includes licensed Nintendo characters; are there any Pokemon or do I need to manually create an ""electric mouse""?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cdun?context=5)|No Pokemon sadly, we just didn't have enough time to get all of Nintendo's IP in. But hey you can create your own content now with our object editor!
[Why did you guys decide to move to the Wii U with such a tiny user base when you had such success with iOS and have left Android untouched?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cdun?context=5)|Wii U was a great opportunity to work on a launch title. As for android, we've always considered it, so we'll see in the future.
[Which would Maxwell be able to defend himself better against: one horse-sized duck or one hundred duck-sized horses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cr9b?context=5)|See... here's the thing. In any other AMA this makes no sense. But in Scribblenauts Unlimited you could make a horse-sized duck and 100 duck-sized horses and pit them against Maxwell.
 |So... find out for yourself!
[Can you share some completely unexpected solutions that people have come up with to solve levels?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cgqz?context=5)|Since you can apply adjectives to almost anything now directly, I've seen people deal with incoming enemies by just tapping them, typing ""dead"" and watching the creature instantly poof.
 |It's kind of weird to have that much power.
[You've said that the Nintendo characters found exclusively in the WiiU version of Scribblenauts Unlimited might be added to the 3DS version in a patch. How easy would this be to do in terms of the patch process? Would Nintendo be open to the idea? Also, why no object editor in the 3DS version?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cg54?context=5)|We might, but I don't want to get anyone's hopes up. So for now we'll put it in the ""tentative"" box.
[Which version of the game do you prefer playing? PC, 3DS or WiiU?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cl1h?context=5)|Wii U, but probably because the system is so new. The local multiplayer is a fun little goofy thing too, which is only on the Wii U.
[Do you know what your most popular object is? Personally, If I can finish a round by playing Cthulhu I do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cfws?context=5)|Cthulhu has to be up there as top 5 most popular objects I'd say.
[Loved the video you did with Mega64! What was working with them like? How did you guys meet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71ciu4?context=5)|That video was a lot of fun. We met at PAX one year and just hung out. They came over to our office and played a really early version of Hybrid. They're super genuine people and just love what they do.
 |When I was working with them on the video I could see that they had a real passion for their videos. They truly love doing that. It's inspiring to see people have such passion for what they do.
[I own the original Scribblenauts on DS and must admit I have HOURS of playtime at the main menu screen but didn't much care for the game itself.  The main reason for this was that too many puzzles relied on navigating the environment and the stylus controls were very sensitive.  I'm really on the fence about spending $30 on your Steam game.  I'm in awe of your drawings and dictionary but I wish there were more clever word puzzles and not so many action\twitch puzzles.  Knowing this, do you think I'd enjoy Scribblenauts Unlimited?  Are there more puzzles that can be solved with words as opposed to having to navigate the terrain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71eyn3?context=5)|There's virtually zero action/twitch puzzles in Scribblenauts Unlimited and the controls were fixed in Super Scribblenauts. :)
[Does the 5TH Cell office have epic games of scrabble?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cfdl?context=5)|No... That's never come up before actually. But we totally should!
[When's the game coming out on Steam in Europe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cmpv?context=5)|No release date has been announced yet, but it IS coming to Europe. We haven't forgotten about you guys! 
[Did you have to buy licensing to any characters you added into the game? (Cthulhu, for instance\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cil9?context=5)|Nope. We've never bought licenses for objects in Scribblenauts. Though, objects like Cthulhu are no longer copyrighted due to how old H.P. Lovecraft's work is.
[I have to say, I was really hoping that Hybrid would have really taken off more than it did.  I feel like you're all a very creative team and I'd hate for you guys to turn into another Media Molecule and just make the same game over and over.  How do you feel about the success of one particular game defining you as a game maker?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71d3b1?context=5)|It's much better for our studio to be recognized and loved for something than nothing. :) Ya know? Scribblenauts is our baby, built from the ground up right here. So we're proud of it. I know I am.
 |We do have aspirations to continue to try new and different ideas. I want to keep pushing creative boundaries. Even inside the Scribblenauts universe.
 |Hybrid had some things going against it, and I learned a lot from that game. But Run Roo Run was a big success, so was Drawn to Life. They just weren't media darlings the way Scribblenauts was.
[What's the next step for Scribblenauts? How do you add more than adjectives?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71cn2y?context=5)|Well Scribblenauts Unlimited upped the ante with the object editor allowing anyone to create anything they want.
 |We don't think of the franchise as a game about words so much as a game about imagination and creativity. Adjectives fit in with that mantra and so does the object editor.
 |As for what's next? Well... there's a lot of different directions one could go!
[Is there any item creator on the 3DS or PC versions of Scribblenauts and if not are there any plans to add it later on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71ct1x?context=5)|There is no object editor for 3DS. Te system really couldn't handle it like the Wii U/PC can. So we decided to focus on making it for those systems instead.
[How did it feel coming up with the idea to Scribblenauts? Didn't such an expensive idea intimidate you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71gkv2?context=5)|1 - Not currently, but maybe in the future. We'll see. 2 - Run Roo Run and Scribblenaut Remix have done amazing on iOS, so yes! 3 - Well at first the question was, is it even possible? But Marius really saw how to break out the idea into manageable chunks and we just went from there. We love doing very daunting stuff here. It's a lot of fun.
[Also, waiting for Scribblenauts Unlimited to be available for preorder in my region on Steam!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71gkv2?context=5)|Scribblenauts Unlimited will be available outside of NA soon! But there's no current date, sorry.
[How many custom objects can be saved?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71g8v1?context=5)|900+ Or something insane like that. It's a lot. Plus you can download other people's as well, not just your own.
[Did you have to purchase a license to author for Wii and the other platforms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71ggnp?context=5)|You don't purchase a license to make Wii games, but you do purchase development hardware. You have to be approved for development by the platform holder.
[So...is the story mode of Scribblenauts Unlimited going to end like Drawn to Life 2 did?  Also, you guys are awesome, I've been fans of your work ever since the first Drawn to Life game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71hhtw?context=5)|Lol. No, I promise Scribblenauts' ending won't make you cry.
[What kind of budget growth have you seen from the first game to now being a launch title on a new generation console? How has 5th Cell grown since its indie beginnings doing mobile games?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71d5n9?context=5)|Budgets have increased for sure. Especially from the original single platform DS game to a multiplatform Wii U, 3DS and PC game.
 |5TH Cell has grown from a core group of about 6 people when it started to 60 now.

 |When we made Drawn to Life, our first DS game in 2007 they gave us dev kits even though we were a small mobile developer. So they've always been good to us.
[What made you decide to sell EXP boosts in Hybrid, a retail game?  It puts you in the odd position of selling the means to bypass an artificial barrier that you created. If you are concerned about the severity of the grind, wouldn't the interests of your players be better served by lessening the grind, or keeping it strictly to cosmetic rewards, rather than trying to sell microtransactions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1370ew/i_am_jeremiah_slaczka_from_5th_cell_creative/c71kae6?context=5)|Hybrid has a unique microtransaction model.  Within around 1-2 hours of gameplay the player will reach roughly level 15. By then they will have been given access to every category of weapon and ability the game offers. No one has a gameplay advantage at higher levels, just more options.  With that in mind some people have lots of time and little money. Other people have a little time a lots of money. But both want to enjoy the game equally. And that's why we did it.

It was a good while... They showed us a hand-carved wooden mock up of the GamePad. It felt great even then.
[My favourite 5th Cell game is still Lock's Quest, and still the only 5th Cell game I've finished to completion. Does THQ own that outright?

So I'm a sophomore CS student in SoCal and I've literally applied to all the companies I could find for a summer internship. I've done all the major companies and even tried the smaller, lesser known ones that some people may not even know about. I've been to my school's job fair. I've applied online and all that, but I've just received a couple of emails back saying that I'm basically not qualified yet. I'm about to finish learning basic data structures (linked lists, tree, heap, sorting) and I've tried being involved in outside projects. What should I do now? I plan to finish taking the next data structures course in Spring and I am enrolled in a course that will teach me Assembly and C in Winter. I just kind of feel discouraged because I've sent out so many applications and I don't see any progress. 

If anyone out there has time to check my resume, I would appreciate that too.

137wsu,1,2012-11-14,Told my boss I'm not coming back next year; now what?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/137wsu/told_my_boss_im_not_coming_back_next_year_now_what/,"If you read through all this and share your advice I’ll love you forever. Because I really have no one else to turn to...

I’m 23 years old. I moved to where I currently live three years ago to attend college. A few years ago I landed what seemed like a cool internship; fast forward to now and I’ve graduated and still working for said company. I want to make this brief but there’s a lot to cover:

I’ve hated living here for years now. There’s not much to do and all my friends moved.

I’ve hated working with this company for years now. I switched positions a few times hoping things would improve, but they haven’t.
 
A few months ago I asked one of our out-of-town vendors if they were hiring. Turns out they’re expanding and the position would be incredible; I would learn so much, have fun, and make good money. They’d love to hire me. Now, they didn’t want to step on my boss’ toes, so they ask him if it’s okay to talk to me and he turns them down. After a week being pissed I go up to my boss and basically say “WTH?” and he then gives them permission. In the midst of this conversation I tell him I’d “stay through the end of the year.”

WELL, as of now I still haven’t nailed down an offer from this vendor. My contact tells me he still really wants to hire me, that I’d be a great asset, yada yada but they need X amount of contracts before he can hire me (a.k.a. they need adequate cash flow). There is also some tension between his company and my current company regarding a contract they had, things could go to court, and it’s just an all-around awkward position for them to be in. (This dispute has nothing to do with me, it's just a debate over exactly what the contract entailed.) He tells me to be patient and that we will work together—and I actually believe him, he’s very trustworthy and means what he says—and he left me with the impression that the timing should be right sometime in the first quarter next year. 

However, I’m starting to get worried because, presumably, in six weeks I’m out of a job. Not that leaving this job is a problem, it’s just that it’s sooooo much easier to find a job when you already have one, and the economy’s still weak. And, despite everything this guy (who's now my friend) is telling me, I still don't have a job/contract in writing. I also have plenty of friends fresh out of college who can't get employed.

So, what do I do? Do I desperately search for another job? Do I say “fuck it” and jump on a plane and go somewhere exotic for a few months until this guy (hopefully) gives me the go-ahead? Or something else along those lines (go skiing, surfing, etc.)

I should mention I have zero debt, no obligations, and by the end of the year will have around $14,000 USD in my back account. I worked my way through college, and between school/work/living here I’ve had about zero fun for the past three years. 

Thank you. And ask me anything.

Hey, I just got an internship with NASA (woot!) in California, so this spring i'm going to be moving out of my apartment. I have a lease there with a friend (who is also a pretty chill guy) for about $675 a month plus utilities. We split the rent so it comes out to about 335 a month plus utilities.

It's on the corner of University and Alafaya... in a small apartment complex. Actually has a nice interior for not a lot of money. 

Anyway, I'm looking to rent this out by the month (no lease) for at least 4 months (january - april) at which point you can continue until the lease is up (July) if you'd like... or I can move back in.

It's my old boss. I haven't heard from him since [Mr. Suit tried to have me killed](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/11umnj/new_job_new_city_same_shit/).

We chat a little and then he says, ""I'd forgotten about [Batman](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/12y16r/we_dont_need_no_stinking_files/)."" Only he doesn't say Batman's real name, he says Batman and I feel my blood run cold. Before I can answer, he says, ""bippyz, eh?""

Fuck. ""When did they unblock reddit?""

""They didn't, I lurk on my phone."" This now explains what he used to do in meetings. ""You're fucking hilarious, I miss you. But you have tell them about the time you broke the Internet because Mr. 1pm was a moron.""

So for Skinner, my ex-boss, who is totally cool, here is when I broke the Internet.

I was working for an asshole who would vanish every day around 1pm to 'go to the gym.' I left work at 5pm, and generally didn't see him from 1pm onward. Hence the name Mr. 1pm. 

At the time, I was working on server security, but also keeping our mcafee distros up to date and pushing them to desktops. Technically I was only the server virus person, but the desktop guy had ALS, and was out a lot, so I'd cover his workload. We would always test the distros before a push, because sometimes they have 'bugs.' No, quirks. Whatever. They'd magically stop anyone from accessing the network.

You all probably know where this is going.

A distro (definition, I think it was a DAT file, it's been years) came in. I reviewed it, checked to see if it needed to go now or on our normal Thursday night push, and then tested it in the sandbox. I followed ALS guy's directions carefully, because I am not Windows smart, make our normal changes. After I test, I asked the intern to release the viruses onto the sandbox, and we test again. All good. The senior tech is out, but this is a basic weekly update, so I put it in the queue, document it, and go home at 5pm.

At 2am London calls. The Internet is down. I can't debug from home VPN, so I drive in and start to work on it. Lo and behold, there was something I missed on my check, the new file was bad! Wait... It's Wednesday... And that isn't my distro. I always put my login ID at the end of the add-on, so people knew who did it. This one is unmarked.

Diving into the matrix I pull out the credentials of Mr. 1pm. He saw my work, decided I was wrong, redid the procedure, and force deployed it so the next time people logged in they got the new version. Except he did it all wrong. Mother fucking hell. Of course, since I'm supposed to be doing viruses this week, it's my fault and I broke the Internet for London.

I decide not to quibble that point, and get to work cleaning the fuckup. By 6am, I've got it backed out and cleaned and I'm redeploying, when ALS comes in. I tell him what happened, with my error logs of proof, and he sends me home to sleep. The next day, Mr. 1pm blows a gasket at me, screaming that I have to do what he says, even if its wrong. I shouted back that I would never do the wrong thing, morally, ethically, or technologically, just because he said to. I may have invoked Godwin's law.

One Month later, I'm assigned to the server team, building out a thin client network. Mr. 1pm is transferred to where he's no longer a manager.

tl;dr Following orders never got anyone in trouble. Just ask the Nazis.

13ev7v,0,2012-11-18,"I'm a Yale student struggling with doubts about going into finance/consulting. I want to make a difference, but I also want to make money. How do I figure out my path?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13ev7v/im_a_yale_student_struggling_with_doubts_about/,"Let me start by saying that I am hoping for thoughtful discussion on both sides, and would particularly love to hear from people who may have been in my situation before.

So here's the deal:

**I have been extraordinarily lucky in many ways.** I come from a middle-class immigrant family. I know how many people - many of them smarter than me or harder-working than me - who, for no other reason than that they were not lucky in one way or another, will never have the same opportunities that I will. And that's not right.

Like the naive, idealistic college student I am, I want to do something meaningful and significant with my life, something that makes a difference to others and positively affects the world that I'm a part of. But I've somehow slipped, rather naturally and easily, into a path that many would argue leads in a different direction. It is likely right now (for reasons including my choice of major and previous internships) that I will soon be working in finance/consulting, making considerable amounts of money and not doing a damn thing to help others.

Don't get me wrong - I'm not one of those people who think that being a banker automatically makes you an immoral, greedy, sociopathic bastard. I fully believe that responsible, ethical, socially-minded bankers exist (I've met many of them) and that if anything, there's a real need for them. But does becoming a banker make me a hypocrite or a traitor to my belief that our greatest duty is to make sure we leave the world a better place than we found it?

Some part of me thinks that I can go into finance/consulting for a few years, and then maybe go to business school or law school or transition to a different field. In the long term, I think I’d like to be working in international development in some capacity – maybe in the public sector, or in a nonprofit. But am I just deluding myself? A local graffiti artist painted [this](http://yaledailynews.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2012/01/22/GEDC0580_t620.jpeg?fbf2daa044e08a86b24c9c38cd7501865a0e2373) in a classroom last year, and it stuck with me. (Actually, the artist is a Princeton grad who quit investment banking himself, giving the message even more impact.)

I don't know. Maybe I'm just going through that inevitable finding-my-purpose-angst college phase. Maybe I'm just looking for validation on an anonymous internet forum that I'm not selling out; that I’m not turning into a person I don’t want to be.

But I think I really, truly, am just looking for advice. For a number of reasons, it wouldn't be very helpful to discuss this with my parents. I've talked to my friends about this, but many of them are struggling with similar questions as well. I don't know what to do, and I feel like the time to decide is coming closer and closer.

I know that nowadays it's common to switch from career to career in totally different fields, that it's more like a jungle gym than a ladder -- but I'd like to start my career well doing something that challenges me, excites me, makes me proud (and yes, something that will make it easier to transition into something even better afterward). But I also want to be successful, in the traditional sense and in my own judgment, and yes - I want to make money.


Help me, Reddit.

tl;dr - College student career angst: Wall St. versus public sector/nonprofit/development work/anything else.

Edit: I included the fact that I'm a Yale student in the title because I think going to a top college changes the context of the question. I'm sorry if I sound pretentious or arrogant; I'm not trying to. I just want some thoughtful guidance, and Reddit can be good at that sometimes."
13dv8s,10,2012-11-17,"Coming towards the end of a 4 year MEng CS degree, feeling totally unprepared for the world of work.",red548,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/13dv8s/coming_towards_the_end_of_a_4_year_meng_cs_degree/,"So... in around 6 months, my degree will come to an end. I'll have to go out into the scary real world. Just thinking about this makes me feel ill. I feel like, other than receiving a piece of paper (MEng CS, which will likely be a 2.1 or 2.2), I've wasted the last 3.5 years of my life &amp; no-one in their right mind would employ me.

Looking at every ""What to expect at X interview"" post and similar, I rarely feel like I'd be able to answer ANY of those questions. As an example: Crack the Coding Interview - Even looking at the very basic problems, I'm fairly sure I wouldn't be able to solve any of them (that I haven't seen before) under pressure. Given enough time I could probably come up with some kind of solution to a few of them, but most people could do that if they spent a week learning the basics of programming.

In terms of languages, I'm passingly familiar with a fair few languages (C, C++, Java, Python, Prolog/Mercury, probably some others) but I wouldn't say I have much more than a superficial understanding of any of them. I do (usually) enjoy programming when I spend time doing it, but the level of expertise required to produce solutions to assignments is generally low, and I haven't gone further than that. I realise now that just doing what is required to progress through my degree, spending free time socialising/gaming etc. with practically zero 'hobby coding' is a terrible way to approach things, but there's nothing I can do to change the past.

Industry Experience - None. I'm an idiot for not taking the opportunity of applying for an internship, but again, not a lot I can do about that now.

I suppose what I'm asking is, where should I go from here? I realise there isn't going to be any 'quick fix', but just worrying without actually doing anything about it is not going to get me anywhere. I'm missing years of knowledge/experience in so many areas that I really have no idea where to start. 

Any advice greatly appreciated! Also, apologies for all the self-pity, but I needed to get that off my chest."

I'm in a bit of a contorted situation that limits my options. I've also asked for advice here before and received it, so I thought I'd come to you folks here at cscareerquestions again. Here's my quandry:

I'm graduating in a month with a BS in Environmental Science, from a decent public university in NC. I have, unfortunately, come to despise it. I'm upset with the job market in this field, and with the sorts of work available to me. I feel like I was sold a degree that I didn't really want, and I'm only coming to that realization in my last semester. Fortunately, my debt situation isn't terrible, because I did my first 2 years at a community college.

I've recently started programming (again). In high school, I loved computers, and I took all the computer courses I could. I got talked out of pursuing a degree in computer science by my family and some bad  HS counselors. I lived in a shitty small town, to folks there computers were toys. I feel like an idiot. Hindsight is 20/20 and all that. I'm REALLY enjoying programming though. I'm not any good yet, but it keeps my interest like most subjects don't. I'm struggling to get my head around OOP at the moment, but I think I'm getting it.

So here I am, fresh out of school with a degree I don't want, but for the first time I feel like I have a direction. I want to be a programmer. I don't know yet if that means software development, web development, or what, but I like this a lot. My skills are few, but I'm learning, and I'm about to graduate, meaning I'll have a lot more free time to learn.

I'm not skeptical of my ability to become a decent programmer on my own. I am skeptical of being taken seriously without a degree, and of my ability to get my foot in the door for internships and jobs without the resources that a university offers. I'm thinking very seriously about going back for a 2nd bachelors. It would double my student loan debt (which isn't as bad as it sounds, since I'm not in awful shape now), and take about 2 years. My options for universities are sort of limited by other factors. My girlfriend and I are moving to NYC next summer. She has a job lined up there already, and she's planning to attend grad school in the city. Personally, I'm fucking STOKED to live in NYC, I love the city. But that does limit my options for schools.


**Start here if you don't care about my sob story**

So my question is this: I'm looking for schools in NYC to get my 2nd bachelor's. Would going to one of the better CUNY schools, like Hunter College/Brooklyn College, for a CS degree be a reasonable way to shift into a career in cs? The private universities like NYU are simply out of my price range."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Do you find that people (maybe other students in your classes who have to introduce themselves over and over\) are generally understanding about your condition, or do they get annoyed? Do you think it's weird that other people can recognize faces because it's not something you're used to? What kind of clues do you use to recognize people that might say hi to you in passing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73bvbu?context=5)|I feel like a lot of people think I'm bullshitting them and that I am just rude and don't remember who they are, to be honest.
 |It's usually the MOST uncomfortable when it happens that I don't recognize someone who is another race, even though it happens to me for people who are all races-- white, black, Asian, etc. I feel like people think it's just another instance of the trope 'Oh white people think all Asians look the same.'
 |It is definitely weird to me that other people can so easily figure out who people are. My brain just doesn't process faces the same way that others' do. As a kid I always wondered why they blacked out only people's eye area for anonymity sometimes. I'm still not totally sure how that works actually haha.
 |People who say hi in passing... It helps if they're wearing their usual clothes or I expect to see them in this area. Like, if I always see Joe at the gym and I see him there in gym clothes, I'll probably be okay. If I see him at a formal dinner wearing a suit and tie, and didn't expect him to be there, he might accidentally get the bitch face of 'Wait, how do I know this guy... Fuck fuck fuck'
[I feel awkward when I can't remember someone's name when I see them. Can't imagine how weird it must be for you! Thanks for doing this. Super interesting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73c161?context=5)|If you want to learn more about the condition 60 Minutes did a GREAT piece about it ([Link!](http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7417242n))
 |I was really excited when this aired, this condition doesn't get a lot of coverage but it's really interesting and still being researched.
[Does this make watching tv or movies difficult?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73brq4?context=5)|This is actually where I have the most problems. Movies can be so confusing because it's obvious to other people who everyone is, but here I am thinking that the same person is two different people, or the opposite. I find myself asking my friends, 'Is that the same guy from (earlier scene)?' or having other confusing moments. People change their outfits and looks in movies so much and there's often a lack of context clues. Watching the movie 'Synecdoche New York' is how I actually got into researching my issue and figuring out what was wrong with me a few years ago. I thought my perception was normal.
 |TV is less confusing after I've seen a few episodes of a show, there's usually set patterns characters fall into, more context. I also probably gravitate subconsciously to shows that make more sense to me.
[Do you only have difficulty with real faces or does it work for things like drawn faces, like cartoons/anime as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73d8z0?context=5)|Some things I can. If it forms a simple happy face (like the fronts of cars example) I totally can! But the man in the moon, I still don't know where I'm supposed to be seeing a face.
[People often see faces in inanimate objects (clouds, front of cars etc.\) do you do this as well? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73d8z0?context=5)|Drawn faces are much easier to remember, but I think artists also try and differentiate their characters in cartoons and stuff.
[I love happy cars.  How is your ability to detect or distinguish emotion on human (or inanimate\) faces affected?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73elmv?context=5)|I can totally read emotions. :)
[Do you see faces when you dream? Also on a personal note how is your dating life? How can you determine if someone is attractive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73cafu?context=5)|I dream a lot but I don't remember seeing people's faces in my dreams really. I think it's more like those agreed upon notions in dreams where your brain tells you 'this person is here' or 'this happened' even if you didn't see that thing actually happen in your dream, if that makes sense.
 |I definitely have a 'type' that I rarely stray from when it comes to boys. If they are tall, kind of lanky, dark hair, and glasses I am often hook, line, and sinker. There have been only a couple exceptions. I can determine if someone is attractive I think the way other people do... Just a feeling? Certain things do stand out to me though, like a nice smile or prominent blue/green eyes. Those are easy to evaluate and remember I guess.
 |I have a guy that I have been on and off with over the past two years and once it had been a long time since I had seen him as we used to attend different schools. I finally got the chance to visit him last year after maybe two months of not seeing each other, and the first time I saw him again I was like 'hot damn!' But funnily enough, we went to get a quick bite to eat and he disappeared momentarily in a crowd, and for the life of me I couldn't recognize him until I remembered what shirt he was wearing.
[Did you do an AMA a few months ago? Another young woman with the same condition did one, and they said they found tall guys with dark hair attractive. If it wasn't you then I find it interesting you'd both have such similar taste once you remove facial characteristics.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73je98?context=5)|Probably just a coincidence that we like the same 'type,' tall dark and handsome is a *thing* so to speak haha. But no, I have not done another AMA.
[I really don't know much about this condition. Can you tell me more about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73bs58?context=5)|In a nutshell, it's just difficult for me to remember what people's faces look like. I've thought two people were the same person before, I've not recognized people who have said hello to me, etc. I rely on context or non-facial cues (hair, usual clothing, the way they walk, voice) to distinguish between people.
[Do you know what you look like?  Can you pick yourself out in a photo, etc? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73cw0u?context=5)|Yes, usually. There have been a couple times I haven't recognized myself and I am not sure what triggers that. The last time, I was at a cafe and I looked in the mirror they had on the wall while waiting for my food. I startled myself for a second because I didn't recognize me. I don't even know why that happened, I was wearing a normal sweatshirt and my hair looked the way it always does.
[Can you easily remember family members faces, such as your mom's/dad's face, or is it hard to remember their faces as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73cbk7?context=5)|With a lot of familiarity it becomes easier to recognize people so it's definitely easier to remember my mom and dad's faces. I still have mistaken another kid on the beach for my brother a time or two.
[Do you recognize your own face immediately when you look in the mirror, or does it take a second?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73czic?context=5)|Usually, yeah. It is rare that I don't recognize myself in the mirror and on the few occasions it's happened it REALLY startles me and kinda bothers me.
[When you didnt recognize yourself, were you thinking ""who's that beautiful girl over there?""  or ""how did that girl get so ugly?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73ha9v?context=5)|Haha! No. Honestly I didn't even have time to think a complete thought, I think I just looked in the mirror and was jolted because whatever I was expecting to see was different somehow? Hard to explain.
[I might be a little late to the thread here, but if someone showed you a picture of your own face without telling you what the picture was of first would you know it was you? I'm just curious because if you're looking in a mirror you expect to see yourself but a picture could be of anyone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73kyb4?context=5)|Yeah, I think I'd be able to do that. At least, I'm able to see myself in like the backgrounds of photos and know it's me and stuff. With a lifetime of familiarity I can get a face down, like I rarely mistake my parents for other people even if I can't 100 percent picture every one of their facial features in my head right now. Recognition from a lineup is slightly easier than trying to conceive of a person's face in my brain for whatever reason.
[Hey, this is really interesting. I was wondering if people have ever claimed twins, even if they looked quite differently? Or vice versa, have you met twins and mayb even recognized 1 twin sibling for whatever reason and the person did not recognized you for a change? Overal question is how often you get false positives and get into real akward situations because of those? Thanks a lot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73h5bs?context=5)|Once when I was in middle school, there were two boys that were kind of tan with brown hair and both were named Garrett. One was in my morning English class and another was in my Science class in the afternoon. I thought they were one person and treated them as such. I always wondered why this kid was really nice in the morning but kind of a dick in the afternoon. Then... I saw them in the same place at the same time.
[Can you recognize race/ethnicity? And for guys can you recognize their facial hair?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73h427?context=5)|Facial hair is another cue but can be dangerous if it gets shaven.
 |I can differentiate between different races and ethnicities.
[I actually stopped a black dude in the street once to say hi to him, only to find out that it wasn't the guy I knew. From now on, I'm gonna say that I have prosopagnosia when this happens.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73hj1l?context=5)|Lol great.
 |Don't expect it to work, usually when I explain it in these types of scenarios I sound more like an asshole.
[What exactly constitutes a ""face"" that surpasses recognizability for you? For example (and correct me if I'm wrong about this\), I'd imagine you wouldn't really have any trouble distinguishing basic smiley faces...but with a certain amount of detail/skill a drawing can get better and better until it very accurately depicts a typical human face. How difficult is it remembering these well-drawn, accurate faces vs. the poor, basic and archetypal faces? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73e95q?context=5)|It's definitely easy to distinguish basic smiley faces. Cartoons like Hey Arnold or Family Guy or something are also easy to distinguish. I've never really been tested with photo-realistic drawings so I don't know how that'd be but if it's anything like realistic graphic renderings they use in testing I suppose that would be difficult to distinguish.
 |Supposedly there's a part of our brain devoted to recognizing faces. It's different from being able to distinguish, say, different-looking flowers or something. So I guess the more something looks like a real face, the harder it is for me to perceive.
[Being able to talk over phones and communicate with text in real time probably makes this easier on you than if you were born in any previous time. That being said, have you developed strategies like 'accidentally' butt dialing someone to name check them? Do you think you'll fall in love with someone for secondary reasons like a distinguished mustache, or a favorite hat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73qyvh?context=5)|Technology today probably makes it easier, you are right. Facebook is helpful in that I can see someone's face in pictures over and over!
 |I've never 'accidentally' called someone to see if I was talking to the right person hahaha. I guess subconsciously maybe I gravitate toward people that are easy to pick out.
[Thank you for answering really every question. :\)  Do you have any proof for you condition you can provide to us? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73dg58?context=5)|Hmm. Unfortunately I can't think of what I could really do to provide evidence but I think my answers make sense and are consistent at least, haha. I've been tested but I don't have the results here at my apartment at school or anything. 
[Medical records with your name blotted out might work. Could you message a mod?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73meb4?context=5)|Unfortunately I'm in my apartment at college so I don't have quick access to that sort of thing. I think that somewhere in my comment history from like last semester I've referenced the fact that I have prosopagnosia, I'll try and find that at least!
 |[Link to an 8 month old comment where I mention my condition](http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/qxizc/does_anybody_else_think_tarzan_is_simply_playing/c41aonx)
 |Here's the comment I was talking about, at least!
[I take it you have a hard time telling Joseph Gordon Levitt and Justin Long apart too? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73d7z1?context=5)|Hehe. I think they're both cute! But yeah they look pretty similar.
 |I've told people Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon look the same to me and they think that is very silly, for what it's worth.
[Is there any treatment for prosopagnosia? have you ever participated in any studies to find out what causes it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73d2le?context=5)|I'm unaware of any treatment currently that would work. There's actually still a lot of research and the cause isn't totally pinpointed.
 |I participated in a test where I was to look at six faces (computer generated and not in color, also no hair) and then I had to pick them out of lineups that included faces that weren't part of the original six. It was extremely difficult and I think much 'purer' than other things I've participated in that use celebrity faces.
[*and the cause isn't totally pinpointed.*  Neuroscience student here to back you up. There is a strong suspicion that the fusiform face area-- FFA is involved but, as with most brain-related things, there might be multiple causes that may or may not work together. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73kiop?context=5)|Ooh cool, thanks for the input! The brain is so mysterious.
[I've heard that some people with face blindness cope by memorizing certain details about a person (e.g. glasses, hairstyle,etc.\)  Do you do anything similar to that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73cjv6?context=5)|Absolutely. Glasses, hairstyle, moles, an unusual nose, big bright eyes, clothing style, the sound of their voice, etc.
[What do you do? Did you ever had job-related problems by your condition?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73d92y?context=5)|I'm still a student but I've had some internships and a job in retail. The internships so far I've just been doing BS office work and phone stuff so it doesn't come into play. The retail job though... Sometimes I couldn't remember if I had already helped a customer, or what kind of small-talk conversation I'd had with them on the sales floor.
[I'm confused as to how your condition works- Is it that when you are thinking about someone that isn't right in front of you, you can't picture what they look like? Or do you see people you have met before and are unable to remember that you know them? (at least until there is some familiarity\) Or both?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73lavn?context=5)|I can meet someone, have a conversation with them, then later leave and try to recall their face and I just can't conceptualize it, can't see it in my head the way I guess a normal person could. I remember pieces like a crooked nose or big ears but I just don't know how people put it all together, if that makes sense.
 |I find other ways to compensate so that I can still realize I know someone, even if I can't remember their face, when I run into them. 
[That's rough. Do you have any other issues? What do you do when you apply to jobs? tell your difficulty upfront? what type of jobs to you sought out because of this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73dyzb?context=5)|I don't have any other issues really, haha. I don't mention it in job applications as I think it complicates things and I do a pretty good job of compensating for it with the strategies I've mentioned.
 |I'm a poli sci major though and my goal is to work in DC so I'll be dealing with people my whole life, haha.
[Aren't you afraid of offending a prospecting employer by not recognizing them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73eru3?context=5)|I mean it could happen if I ran into them somewhere after the interview or something but I guess it's a risk I'm willing to take. It would just be too cumbersome to explain since it's not a very common condition and people don't usually talk about it. I feel like I'd look crazy if I explained it at an interview.
[I wonder if there's an ""opposite"" of this condition. I've read a LOT of your answers, and it's almost the exact opposite for me. I'm WONDERFUL with faces (I'm also an artist, I do portraiture, but I think this is because I'm good with faces, not the other way around\). My friends actually joke all the time about how good I am with faces and different facial features. Like, if someone thinks two people look alike (like you said, Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon\) I ATTACK that shit. I can point out sooo many differences between two people that look alike, even with twins. It's never been hard for me to distinguish between twins like Mary Kate and Ashley, or Tia and Tamara, Zach and Cody, etc. I'm also really good at telling what actor is likely related to other actors (last night, in fact, I was watching Scott Pilgrim, and I noticed that Wallace looks a LOT like Macaulay Culkin and I told my boyfriend that I bet he was his little brother. My boyfriend said that he WAS Macaulay Culkin and I said a bunch of the shit I normally do about the differences, then we looked it up and I WIN. It's his little brother\).  Also, do you sometimes wish you didn't have this? Or is it not a big deal? I've read that you said a lot of people just think you're being a rude dick that doesn't bother to remember, and I know that must suck, but does it affect any other major part of your life? Like, do you enjoy making art and are unable to do it (FUN FACT, a very famous and awesome artist has this condition, and he actually uses it to create amazing portraitures. Chuck Close \), or something similar? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73um6a?context=5)|I believe an opposite of this condition does exist. [Check this article out.](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/05/‘super-recognizers’-are-the-ones-who-really-will-never-forget-a-face/) They're called 'super recognizers' and these people never forget a face, apparently.  Honestly, while of course it would be nice not to have it, it doesn't really ruffle my feathers that much. Sometimes people think I'm a jerk but they usually get over it. In general I'm a friendly, personable girl and I have a good social life. My ways of getting around the condition allow me to just kind of forget I have it sometimes. Sure, there's those 'oh shit' moments when I'm not sure who this person is who just approached me, or I can't remember which of the three brown haired guys in class is the one who I borrowed a stapler from last week and I need it again now, but I live to see another day haha. I still enjoy arts and crafts but as a kid I definitely enjoyed drawing animals more. That's pretty common though.
[As someone without your condition, to me it seems like there are an infinite variety of differences in a person's face. When you look at someone's face, do you tend not to notice differences like eyebrow thickness or nose shape, and is that what leads to your inability to remember faces, or is that not how the disease works at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73cmkx?context=5)|If anything I think people like me miss the forest for all the trees. I think I process individual pieces of a face the way a normal person might (that's a nose, those are bushy eyebrows, etc) but a whole face altogether does not always look very different from another whole face. That's why I have to pick out individual parts to remember.
[So then, is it immediately obvious to you when meeting someone of one particular race or another? And if indeed you see the features without attaching a 'face' to them, are you quite skilled at guessing someone's heritage (oh, high cheek bones, baby-blue eyes, sunken eyes -- that bloke's gotta be Russian\), or is that equally difficult due to your condition?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73de5l?context=5)|I can still tell what race people are, and I can usually make a pretty good guess about whether a person is Korean vs like Japanese or Filipino or something, though I think all that is more about attention to detail than processing the whole face.
[But can you see other things normally ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73f71w?context=5)|I can see other things normally, tell animals apart, tell cars apart, etc.
[Can you recognize your own face ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73f71w?context=5)|I usually can recognize my own face but there have been a few times I've startled myself.
[Do you see other peoples faces and just cant remember them or you cant see them at all ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73f71w?context=5)|I can see them, they're just difficult to distinguish between one another / remember.
[Curious about that -- You say you can see the details of a face but then forget what it looks like and won't recognize it in the future.  Is that true for other things?  Can you see a fairly unique dog and recognize him again?  Same for a car?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c747qt0?context=5)|Cars and dogs and flowers and all that jazz-- can remember it just fine. Scientists think that involves a different part of the brain.
[I have this as well. Do you find that you don't look at peoples faces very often when you should? Do you ever stare at the face of someone you know well and realize that after years it's simply not known to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73l1n8?context=5)|Hm. I guess it's hard to determine if I look at people's faces less than I should as I don't know what amount would be normal. I'd say I concentrate on people's faces more sometimes when I barely know them as I'm trying to find a little feature to identify them by. But yeah, maybe I pay less attention to what my friends' faces look like (other than emotional state) because I just know I'm not going to remember. I'd never really thought of this, I'll have to monitor my behavior.
 |As for the second question, I've done that. Usually it's shortly after I've confused someone else for them and I go, 'How is that possible, I've known him for six years'
[I have this too.  I use the sounds and tone of people's voices in order to remember who they are.  How do you remember who people are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73ggw5?context=5)|Voices are really important! Also hair, clothing style, a weird facial feature like a crooked nose...
[What kind of test is there for such a thing as I too have similar problems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73dkfy?context=5)|[Here](http://www.faceblind.org/facetests/) is one, I took similar tests that I think were somehow related to this organization through university.
[I did that test just randomly and I got a 28%, how accurate do you think a test like that is? I don't really notice it in daily life but for the life of me I just couldn't remember who most of the people were. Is it something that I might have just gotten used to where I look more at how a person is dressed and figure out who they were anyways without focusing on the face, or was it a conscious struggle for you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73efdy?context=5)|Was it a celebrity test? Personally I don't find those very accurate because poor results could indicate just a lack of pop culture awareness, or just trouble with names.
 |I took a test that used graphic renderings of faces (not of famous people) which were colorless and had no context indicators and I think those are much more reliable indicators of this problem.
 |To be honest it took a long time for me to know I had prosopagnosia because I compensated for it and kind of just assumed I perceived the world just like everyone else. It also affects people to varying degrees, like some people can't recognize their family members ever, other people can. 
[Can you tell a person's gender by looking at their face?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73qvk4?context=5)|I don't think I have any more difficulty with that than the average person.
[Thanks for answering, I was genuinely curious :\)  Have you read 'The man who mistook his wife for a hat'? Do you think its portrayal of prosopagnosia is accurate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73r0g5?context=5)|Hm, I've never heard of that book so unfortunately I won't be able to comment on its accuracy :(

Genetics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73h4t9?context=5)|You can be born with it but certain brain injuries can cause it too. I've always had this condition. I believe my mother may have a milder form of it.
[Does this work the same for animated faces?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73d726?context=5)|I don't have trouble with that, though animated faces in general are made distinct through some sort of interesting cartoonish feature or clothing or something. It's sort of like the law in fiction that you don't have two characters with the same name, if you're going to animate them I doubt you'll draw two characters to look extremely similar! 
[This might be a funny question, but eh?  I have face blindness as well (self diagnosed, though I agree with every answer I've read here\). When I smoke weed (which I've only done a couple times\), I find that I can suddenly focus on a face, and I feel like I actually can remember them. I haven't done it enough to actually test this hypothesis, though.  Do you have any similar experience?  (inb4 ""nice try, narco""\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73p1pe?context=5)|This is interesting! I've not noticed an effect on my face blindness by any substance but you should definitely keep testing this out and maybe contact your university's psych research center or something about it. I bet they'd think this is intriguing.
[Does this happen even with people that others say look completely different?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73bz6g?context=5)|I've had this happen where I'll ask friends 'do you think they look alike?' Or I'll think two actors look the same and they're like 'No, that's ridiculous!'
 |People with similar hairstyles and no particular standout feature (weird nose, bright blue eyes, a birthmark, etc) are totally fair game for me to process as looking alike, even if other people think that they do not. But a lot of times I pick a feature, memorize it, and that helps me from making mistakes.
[Assuming you've drank alcohol before, how does being drunk affect your ability to recognize/distinguish people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73n6sz?context=5)|When I'm drunk I still just can't really distinguish people but I don't think it gets worse.

[Have you played 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors on the DS? It's one of my favorite games, and one of the characters suffer from prosopagnosia.

I'd love for more people to know about face blindness because it's difficult to explain to people on the fly without sounding kind of crazy.
[Can you recognize yourself in a mirror or photographs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73gbks?context=5)|Most of the time.
[Do you have learning difficulties? Or is it just related to faces? i.e., trouble with dates/remembering to do things/or assigning a person to a context by name (Barack Obama is the president, King Tut was a pharaoh in Egypt, for example. You're most likely never met the president, but you know he is the president by name.\) or where places are, such as where you classroom is, or where the cafeteria is at school. Lastly, do you have little tricks to help you remember?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73ptw3?context=5)|I don't have learning difficulties, thankfully, and no real issue with memory of dates, tasks, or directions. I actually have a pretty good sense of direction.  I've got lots of little tricks but most of them are subconscious, like focusing on how a person's voice sounds. 
[What are romantic relationships like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73hjce?context=5)|If you look around in the questions you'll find an anecdote about an on off relationship where I find this guy sexy as hell but I could not recognize him later when he disappeared into a crowded area until I could remember what shirt he was wearing! And it's not like we had just met, I have known him for years.
 |I still find certain people really attractive, I definitely have a 'type,' just sometimes it's hard to remember what these good-looking boys really look like. I just know I thought they were cute when they were right in front of me!
[Do people who know about your condition always greet you with ""Hey 30rockette it's me ""so and so"""", just so you don't you have to worry about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73pavf?context=5)|Ooh no. I think I might start to find that patronizing actually haha. I compensate for it well, I think. With friends who know about my condition  I already know the sound of their voice, hair style, and other context clues that can help me figure it out. There might be a delay compared to the instantaneousness of the way people see a face and just 'know' though.
 |The kindest thing people can do is just not get offended when I don't immediately know who they are. 
[Hey I have this too! Good to know I'm not completely crazy! Do all your friends like to make fun of you and ask you what people look like? Or do I just have terrible friends?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73loyf?context=5)|Oh, my friends do that too. Haha.
[Is there anything that can be done to help make identification easier for someone with face blindness that isn't patronizing? I don't want to be constantly saying ""hey, it's me, Mark"", but nor do I want them to be unduly confused about who I am.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73jjte?context=5)|If anything just don't be offended when they have that look on their face like 'Wait, who are you?' That's the best help. That, and don't change your hairstyle or pop up where I'm not expecting you. Hahaha.
[Does this have any effect on how attractive you find people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73hxzi?context=5)|I still can perceive attractiveness and I definitely have a 'type.'
 |I can find a guy really sexy, but it's hard to really form an image of his face in my head when he's not right in front of me anymore.
[When did you first realize you were different? When did you first learn that the condition has an actual name?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73l759?context=5)|I learned the condition had a name when I was in middle school when I read a magazine article about someone with the problem. I really related to it but I didn't talk to anyone about it, didn't know how to pursue more info at that age. Still, I guess I knew I was different around that point to a certain degree, then more so at 18 when I started talking to people about it.
[So does everyone look like SlenderMan to you ? Or do you see faces and can't associate it with the person ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73fwda?context=5)|Hahah, no, people don't look like the Slender Man. I see a face, but when that person leaves I can't remember what that face really looks like. And the next time I see that person, I won't recognize them by their face the way I guess most people would, I'd more likely recognize them through context or the sound of their voice or something.
[Can you tell animals apart? I don't know how far facial recognition extends, so maybe animals are easier because there's so much more variance in color, body, etc, but I know I could recognize, say, a closeup of my dog's face versus a vaguely similar dog's.  People can generally recognize face-like shapes (like this or all the many photos on reddit of tree knots and water spouts and other things\). Are you able to do that at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73rvrr?context=5)|Yeah, I can tell animals apart, like I know my cat from other cats I see.  For that picture, I saw the shoulders and neck first for some reason but I could see the face there. 
[Is it the face as a whole that troubles your memory? As in, can you remember small details,like a nose or eyes, easily and put the details together? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13evu2/i_have_prosopagnosia_face_blindness_inability_to/c73uk8u?context=5)|Yeah it's like the whole thing that's a problem. I can remember the little pieces by focusing on them but they don't naturally come together in my head.
[Do you remember the color of peoples hair?

13ggjr,0,2012-11-19,[Build Help] smartphone VS small laptop - school,e13e7,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/13ggjr/build_help_smartphone_vs_small_laptop_school/,"This may be slightly off topic, but I need help deciding between a Smartphone and a small (about 11.6"") laptop for the next semester of school.

A little background: I have a [cracked Rezound](http://www.htc.com/us/smartphones/htc-rezound-verizon/) and a [15.6"" lead weight](http://www.xoticpc.com/sager-np6165-clevo-w150er-p-4344.html) gaming laptop (resembles my laptop, except mines 1lb heavier and 1 generation older). The phone is cracked and in poor shape and is only going to get worse, while my laptop is fine but barely portable and extremely inconvenient to lug around to class (plus on linux the GPU driver makes it use 100% power all the time so the fan can get annoying in quiet lectures). I am returning to school after a semester off -  I did freshman year, a summer and a semester of an internship, and now going back to classes.

My question is: Should I replace my phone with (most likely) a [Droid DNA](http://www.htc.com/us/smartphones/htc-droid-dna-verizon/) (others will be considered but this phone is ***sexy***) or a small and fairly portable [ultra-ish book](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834230735) (will be like that, but probably a little cheaper).. Most of my classes are natural science; genetics, geology, physics, with calc, creative writing, and some labs. I anticipate writing quite a few papers and being able to use whatever technology I have in lecture. My budget is definitely under $800, hopefully under $500, but prioritising quality/experience over bargain. 

I am ^*fairly* attentive in classes, though I do bore easily and end up on reddit + unrelated interwebs inevitably. It's a lot easier for me to continue taking notes when I'm on paper, though I type much faster than I write and organise stuff much better on a FS than in a RL binder. 
Scheduling is much easier for me with my phone and the cracked screen on my Rezound bugs the hell out of me, so I will replace it no matter what it just depends on if I downgrade to some shit flip-phone or buy the new 1080p quad-core piece of deliciousness. I don't text too often and I'm not big into UI customisation. If I got the laptop, It'd be 100% linux so I could have some separation away from League of Legends (I may just hand off the gaming rig to my brother)

SO! The laptop or the smartphone? I would love to hear hardware suggestions besides the ones I've posted, I don't have much depth of product knowledge here. 

&gt; TL;DR - How important is a keyboard to you

Thanks!"

I hope this is the right subreddit for this. If not, sorry about this...  

Okay, so over the past few months, I've been an intern with my City.  I'm using Microsoft Access to create a database filled with useful information on our downtown area's commercial properties.  I have quite a few fields in my main table.  Several concern the property's characterostoc (parcel #, Address, legal description, suqare footage), several concern the property's purpose (uses, zoning, whether or not its vacant), several concern owner and leasing agent information (owner address, phone number, email address), and several concern tax information.  

Considering this isn't my only project, it's taken quite a while to come up with the appropriate fields, gather all this information, and organize it.  

The purpose of the database is for our Community Development Office to have all the information they need readily available if investors ask for it.  For example, if someone wants to open up a restaurant, and needs at least 2000 Square Feet, somebody with the City can find the information in minutes and say, ""it looks like four properties fit your criteria, but only two are vacant, you can reach the owner here...""  Suggestions?

I'm sorry if it seems like I'm just asking the internet to do my homework for me. I've gone through some online tutorials, but none of them have presented the information in a way I can understand and relate with this current project.  

tl;dr:  I've organized a lot of property information in a MS Access database, but now I don't really know what to do/how to utilize/what are the Access' useful applications."

",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13ihq1/reddit_whats_the_worst_thing_your_parents_have/,"I'll start.

It's a bit long, but it serves as an interesting story.

Also, keep in mind that all of the bedrooms are upstairs and the living room entrance is at the bottom of the stairs on the first floor. 

Saturday night, my girlfriend didn't have a place to stay so I invited her to stay at my place. We decided to watch a movie in my living room and, of course, she fell asleep through it. When the movie ended around 1 in the morning, I decided to wake her up. Talking led to kissing which eventually led to her being spread eagle whilst I gave her the two fingers love treatment. In the middle of me being knuckle deep in my girls slosh box, I hear my father say from the bottom of the stairs, "" You know 'ImOnlySuperHuman', I'm a very light sleeper."". I suddenly peek over the top of the couch to see my fathers disgusted expression. As my dad walks to the computer room, my girlfriend and I sat on the couch wishing that all of this was one bad dream. My girl quickly pulled her pants on and then walked upstairs to the guest bedroom. I followed shortly after. When I arrived at the bedroom, I found her sitting cross-legged and crying. At this point, i knew i had really fucked up. Seeing her cry made me feel like the worst person in the world. I hated to see her like that. I just couldn't stand it. I knew she felt ashamed and embarrased and I was feeling the same. I managed to get her to calm down and I told her that everything was going to be okay. Once she eased a bit, I told her to get some rest. I then decided to talk to my father about the situation. I walked downstairs to find him at the computer. The conversation is as follows:

Me-""I'm sorry"" 
Dad-""For what???"" 
Me-""(I'm confused as hell at this point)....uhhhhhh"" 
Dad-""(Who is browsing the interwebs) there's an internship down in [blank] for marine biology if your interested."" Me-""uhhh. Yeah. I'll look into it""

I then walk back upstairs to let my girl know that he is completely avoiding the topic. We then go to bed and, of course, both of us can't sleep. I wake up at 6 to take my girl to her aunts house because her cousin has a soccer game about 2 hours away that she really wanted to go to. The entire 15 min drive was complete silence. It just felt so awkward. Since then, I have made it my mission to make it up to her. The awkwardness has diminished and we are still going strong :D Since then, my father doesn't seem to be disgusted by what he saw. In fact, he gets this goofey smile when he sees me and my girl together. Its kind of weird, but he's cool like that. So I ask you Reddit, what's the worst thing your parents have caught you doing???

TL;DR My dad caught me finger-pounding my girls cock socket. Things got weird. Really weird.

I just finished drafting my letter of resignation, and am still mentally listing the pros and cons of handing it in tomorrow. 

I have a very unique working situation where I'm basically managing the apparel business of a very wealthy old friend. (Extraordinarily wealthy. Like one house in Aspen, one house in Nantucket wealthy.) I have a degree in fashion design as well as 2 years of internship experience from large global companies. I'm very well qualified to help her get where she needs to be with the business, but we keep running into roadblocks that are continuing to put us deeper into the red before we even begin.

All of these problems stem from the root problem of my old friend having zero professional experience. I somewhat suspect that their mother funds the business to keep them out of trouble as they have a history of drug abuse and other related issues. 

We started off strong, but the past couple of months, it seems, their interest in the daily doings of the business has waned drastically. We are currently moving into an office and incurring expenses related the move, and we've hit financial hiccups involving a missed credit card payment and backed taxes. I originally signed onto this venture as the person to help get her line designed/sourced/manufactured, but have become somewhat of an accountant (she has only just decided to call a professional one) and have also spent the last three weeks painting our new office which they have spent a total of 1 hour in in the last 2 moths of us renting this space.

The past couple of months their behavior has gotten steadily worse, and I can't rationalize away the feeling that I'm slowly devolving into this person's glorified personal assistant. She once called me at 9:45 at night (election night, actually I was at a bar watching the news with friends) to come over and fix her printer because it wasn't printing out her school essays for the following day.

What first sounded like an amazing way to boost my career, now seems like it's not worth the headache and emotional stress its giving me. We've had a few blow-up fights related to her low level of seriousness about the business, and lack of communication skills, but this week I've reached my breaking point.

We had a friend put together a great website for us and he is just waiting for us to deliver content to fill in the wireframe. We were planning on delivering on this post-holiday sometime in the next couple of weeks, as the office is slowly but surely getting together. He also does an amazing job of keeping up our Wordpress. He also hosts our website for free. Out of the blue she contacts me tonight saying she wants to drop our web developer and use this web.com service. A quick google search later, it's blatantly obvious that this company is pretty scammy.

For some reason her inability to check this herself has just sent me into a tailspin. I just don't think I'm going to be able to be a constructive force in this person's business venture, and frankly, I don't see how I can be an effective/sane worker under this kind of leadership. 

I've got great options, as I'm a fresh graduate with a good portfolio and great experience to aid my job search. I'm pretty confidant I can walk away from this and pick up work fairly quickly.

**TL;DR:** My very wealthy and highly inept boss's antics are causing me a great deal of stress and her rash and unreasearched decision to drop our experienced and highly effective web developer has led me to pen a resignation letter to hand in tomorrow.

What was your last straw moment?"

On my primary account, I noticed a session on my Reddit account login history from an IP address I didn't recognize that was last active almost two months ago.

I know exactly where it happened since I don't frequent public wifi venues often, and likely how it happened.  For the record, I use unique, randomly generated passwords for every online resource I use to mitigate stolen credentials, so I am not at all worried or auspicious that it was a result of a data breach elsewhere.  I do not have any other wireless enabled devices except for my laptop.  I always make it a habit of using a socks proxy/SSH tunnel for that reason when I'm mobile.  I simply didn't enable it in time when my browser window was open.  I was only on for a brief time, then logged off.

I woke up my laptop from hibernation into a venue with public wifi, the only time I had done such, and had Reddit open (Firefox with RES).  I make it a good habit of SSH tunneling via a socks proxy -- I simply didn't enable it in time and someone was waiting. 

I was able to replicate this behavior in Wireshark because RES periodically checks the logged-in account for mail using session cookies in the clear, therefore, I am fairly certain my password was not stolen, and even if, it was worthless.

The individual was in or near the venue, sniffing data, and likely used an off the shelf kiddie tool to hijack my account.  This person also viewed my e-mail address, because I specifically remember at the time looking through logs on my virtual private server and noticed a visit to the website, and a failed login attempt.  Unfortunately, those logs had been recycled and I wrote it off as nothing big at the time (this server does not get a lot of public traffic).

The IP address from my session traced back to a server at a smaller industrial company ~40 employees according to Linked In.  I do not have the identities of some of the profiles, but I have titles, and one of them has the title along the lines of security and is listed as a computer science major at a local university on an internship there.

I'm at a loss of what to do.  I highly suspect (although I have no proof) that this young intern is the person responsible.  I also can reasonably assume that this individual is using his work's VPN or an unauthorized proxy on his workstation to access my account and access my server from public venues.  

My biggest concern is a company of this size has a person of unethical character who may  to commit other crimes.  It could also be other person(s) who head up IT.  I'm reluctant to contact anyone there, but I am not looking to open a criminal investigation, partially because I don't want to raise attention to my reddit account to even more people I don't know.

I'd like the company to have their own workforce and resources audited.  The way I see it, if the company wants to call up law enforcement if they feel inclined to press charges, so be it.  I wouldn't mind seeing this person lose a job and/or booted from college.

What is the best way to go about handling this?  Should I try to contact their parent ISP, someone in this company's small IT department and take a risk that it could be that person, or the college's internship department?  I am not interested in pursing law enforcement because I know they won't lift a finger on behalf of a lone individual.  "

There is a career fair tomorrow at my college and I need a little help. I'm redoing my resume, but what should my objective be if I wanted to get an entry level web /tech related job or settle for internship at the companies I hand them out to. Anyone got anything that sounds snazzy? Basically I'm in college and because of the grant I have, I can only work 18 hours a week and can't make but so much per hour. Seems like a good opportunity for a company to use me for basic coding and stuff at 14/15 bucks an hour. Not sure of which companies will be attending the career fair but there will be say several business that do have a tech department, Cell phone companies, etc etc.

I really like REUs but will an employer look at my resume see a bunch of REUs and say


* 'why aren't you in grad school?' 

* and I'll say 'Because I don't want to be , I want to be developing' 

* will he then say 'Then you should have done internships.'

**The problem is - I can't lock down an internship.** I've been rejected from 3 companies - one of which I had an interview with. 

 Part of why I can't get an internship - I hope - is because my home town doesn't have a lot available .

I'm starting to worry here , is there any advice about how to get the internship , Or is it ok if I *settle* with another REU?

I have a man's life in my hands.
This whole situation is making me quite **depressed.**


I run a small graphic design business. It is growing to the point that i need to hire an assistant.



My father-in-law was working at a bar where he met a young man going bar to bar trying to get sell graphic artwork (banners, menus, etc) He instantly called me up and recommended that i hire him, or give him a shot as an intern. I live an hour away from the bar and the guy and the bar they were at. I say that if he does not find anything, he is welcome to try a short term internship.


Months go by and i do not hear from him, I totally forget about the call.


Last week he calls me. ""Hi dude, I've moved close to you, can we start that internship.""


_______________________________________________________________________________


Uh. OK...


_______________________________________________________________

Turns out he has been homeless/bouncing around from couch to couch for about a year now. His laptop has broken, and has no where to live. Day one I have him build a laptop from my scrap parts. 


He now has a laptop filled with industry standard software, and a machine that he can use to make a living.


We have been at it for about two weeks... 
Week 1 he is not a good worker.

Texting every 5 minutes.
Forgetting key parts of the tasks.
Smoke breaks every hour.


End of week one he receives a talking too... 
Head in the game or else, ect

I gave Week two:
ok. I still have to ride him, but he is getting better.



-----------------------------------------------------------



CONS:
Smoker

He lost his car for running away from police in high speed chase.

I've had pieces of hardware disaperar and reaper only when i ask about them.

Needs lots of training.


today he tells me he was molested as a child. 

He is near my baby everyday.

Could be a junkie

My Productivity suffers

-----------------------------------------------------------


PROS: 

Nice Guy

Has potential

Works cheep


----------------------------------------------------------------

The bottom line is that if i stick with him he can turn his life around for the better. If i fire him... he is completely out on the street. If he excels at this job, it might really turn his life around.


But he is hurting my business and closer to my family than i would like.

13jgvf,2,2012-11-20,"My friend is suicidal, keeps hitting on me while she has a boyfriend",MagneTismen,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13jgvf/my_friend_is_suicidal_keeps_hitting_on_me_while/,"I admit that this sounds like a first-world problem but my concern is sincere. 

Background: I'm currently working abroad in, let's call the country ""Japan"", and I always try to meet up with my friends whenever I have some time off. My friends, let's call them Sean and Andrew, are also working here on an internship. So Andrew is usually in a long-distance relationship with his gf, let's call her Ayumi, which is why he chose Japan to work in for the internship and we all get along very well. One night Andrew's girlfriend brought her friend, let's call her Mika, to a night out. I always joke around with everyone about everything and we're all having a good time. Several times during this night I state clearly that I have a gf home and how I miss her being abroad for several months, and Mika is also talking about her bf who lives abroad.

Fast forward one week, we're all going out clubbing with some other friends of ours. We have some dinner and hit the clubs, everyone is having a good time (except me who had an aching stomach until morning, probably due to something I ate). Anyways. While a few of us is sitting around just talking Mika comes over and sits down in my lap. No biggie, I think, because it doesn't matter to me and Ayumi told me before that she just gets all clingy when she gets drunk. What struck me though was that she just blurts out how she has been hurting herself for several years my cutting or burning her body. I did notice bruises on her arms and wrists before but since her daily activities involve labour-heavy work I figured that it was from her job. We proceed to talk about this for some time and she's all ""I'm not doing it now because I'm getting stronger"" which I find relieving. Following this she proceeded to dryhump me on the dancefloor all night.

I later learned from Ayumi that Mika once took a box of pills and luckily ended up in the hospital since they found her soon after she took them.

A few weeks later me, Sean, Andrew and Ayumi is just out for a coffee when Ayumi says that Mika is still hurting herself. Thing is, during this time (even now) Mika keeps texting and calling me and says how much she wants to go out with me to ""just have a drink or two"". Just last week we made plans to go out to dinner with everyone and just 2 days before the night she texts me and says ""I haven't called anyone else, are you ok with that?"" I instantly texted Sean, Andrew and Ayumi and begged them to come out with us because I would be extremely uncomfortable with just me and Mika considering her texting me all the time while having a bf. I caught a really bad cold and had fever in that morning so I texted my friends saying that I probably couldn't make it but I would call them in the afternoon to see if I'd gotten better. Mika then texts me back asking me if she should come over to look after me while I'm sick. I've met this girl probably 3 or 4 times at this point, she knows I have a gf whom I love, I know she has a bf. Maybe this is just me but I feel this is just too awkward, especially when I live more than an hour by train from where Mika lives. Incidentally I ""got better"" and went out to see everyone to avoid having her come over.

I want to have the ""let's just be friends""-talk but considering she is suicidal I don't really dare to say anything straight up. Every time her behaviour and suicides comes up in conversations she covers her body with her arms as if she's trying to hide scars. Whenever we meet up I try to steer the conversation so that I can at least once every time say out loud that I love my gf and that Mika's bf definately must love her since they can keep up the long-distance relationship. She always goes out of her way home to take longer walks or ride the train/bus for longer than she needs to be alone with me for sometime. She always linger in the hugs and tries to hold my hand whenever there's a chance.

I already have one suicide in my family and I don't want another one in my life, but the situation is getting absurd. Reddit, what do you suggest I do?

My ex Alex broke up with me, because he got an internship at a church and they found out I wasn't Christian and told him to break up with me. To make matters worse, he was my first time. The break up destroyed me. I was losing not only the guy I lost my virginity to, but also a guy that made me happier then anyone else had. Anyway, we (mainly me) decided we should still be friends. I really wanted to, because I had a small hope we might get back together and I was terrified of losing him completely.

Well, the break up was about 4 months ago, and I've been trying to move on. The only issue is after I go on a date with a guy, I keep thinking about Alex. Or I'll end up seeing Alex and hanging out with him. The worst part is that every time I see Alex, he kisses me, or let's me hold his hand, and it makes me miss him terribly. No matter what I do, I can't seem to get over him... And I'm not sure if it's just because he was my first time or if it's because I miss him.

This is putting a serious strain on me getting over him, or finding someone new. I know there is next to no chance of me and Alex getting back together, but I still can't get him out of my head. I just don't know what to do....

Also, I know most people are probably thinking, just STOP seeing him altogether. And I actually have tried that to no avail. 


Please. Help me?"

I've had two internships that lasted around seven months each. One was at a large public company and the other one was at a small growing company. 
I decided to move on from the large company to the small company for a small pay raise and more experience in my field. 


I went to our university job fair in the beginning of the school year and went on a couple interviews. 
A couple weeks ago, I received a job offer in a small city more than two hours away as an applications developer and accepted it.
The job starts in January and I left my last job last week. 


My plan was to look for jobs locally until the job starts, and if I can't find something to just take the job and move. 

I don't really want to move away to a small city and the pay is much lower than what I was expecting for my field. 
I feel like if I were to stay where I currently live, I would be able to find a job that pays more and is close to friends and family. (I live near Dallas, which has an abundance of IT jobs.)
Now I feel like one month is not long enough to look for a job, because now I have to look for apartments while applying for jobs and going on interviews.

Now I'm torn between accepting the job and moving away to a small city, or rejecting the offer and just looking for jobs locally.

**TLDR:** Got a job offer and don't want to move away to a city that has nothing there.

I'm a 25-year-old with a degree in journalism, and I've been working for the last three years for a regional magazine as a web intern and, subsequently, a web editor. 

Since graduating college, I've had this nagging sensation that computer science is more up my alley, holds better job prospects, and is just generally something I'd enjoy much more than my current line of work (what I enjoy most about my job is the administrative stuff, web design stuff, coding, etc.). 

This is something that has been killing me lately, and I'm finally at the point where I'm about to call the registrar and see about enrolling. It's tough to go through this early phase of professional work, always knowing that you're not quite doing what you want to be doing. Regret is a heavy burden to carry around, and I just can't seem to shake it as I enter my mid and late 20s.  

Have any of you done something similar? The idea of going back to school after working for the last few years in a professional capacity seems a little daunting, but when I think about where I want to be in ten years time, I just don't know if this is something I can pass up any longer. "

A little background on myself...I graduated from a very good school at the start of this year and had a job lined up with a very small web development studio in SF. I am not from the area and so I moved to San Francisco. I have realized that I do not want to live this far away from my family and that SF is not the city for me. I will have a year at my job in a few months and am starting to look for jobs back home. I have worked on some pretty large projects for some fortune 500 companies, so that will definitely look good in my portfolio. I program in primarily in Rails, Backbone, and all of your typical front-end stuff. I even have a couple apps in the app store for both Android and iOS.

My question is, will it look bad when I am applying to other companies if I only have 1 year on the job? I have had 2+ years of internships prior to my first ""full time"" job, so that might help..right?

From talking to other webdev's it seems people move around from job to job a lot in this industry.

Has anyone had any experience doing this sort of thing?"

I genuinely enjoy software engineering and programming: I'll make data flow diagrams and design apps during my downtime at my job.

In short, I've applied for several internships, yet haven't gotten a single response. I don't know if I should start specializing in a specific language or area of development or keep things broad to spread the net wide. 

I'm graduating in June and am worried that I will not be hireable upon graduating. My current plan is to attend some hackathons and tech groups via meetup.com (SF Bay Area). 

Does anyone have some hints or tips for someone in my position? Thanks for your time."
13r32b,0,2012-11-25,"Reddit, I'm leaving the military with a large family and experience as a web designer. Where can I go from here? Thank you for your input.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13r32b/reddit_im_leaving_the_military_with_a_large/,"I've got a big decision to make. 

I'm 25, married with four little boys and only a couple of months left in the Marine Corps. What I decide to do next will determine the following twenty years of our lives. As such, it has been a great deal of stress for me over the last year.

I've made the decision a while ago that I don't want to stay in the military. And unfortunately, all of my peers and mentors in the military are shocked at any other decision that doesn't involve staying in the military because of the size of my family. I get it. I have quite a full plate, but I also think a lot of people get ""stuck"" - military or otherwise - in a career they aren't happy with out of fear of failing.

I don't want that to be me, but I need to be smart about this next step.

I have been focusing on learning Ruby on Rails only recently and have a solid background in HTML and CSS. To an experienced coder, I'm very much a green horn. You can see my freelance and contract work at http://turbofish.net and http://bluereach.com respectively. A lot of what I do for client work is using CMS or pre-built templates and themes, and just modify them as needed.

As someone with a family depending on me and no more than 3-4 years in web design experience, how likely is a career in web development? I would love to build web applications and start my own business-to-business SaaS or work with an existing company, but I often wonder if I'm delusional and should settle for something outside of the industry. I simply don't know enough people to get a good assessment of my skills vs. the industry standard.

I'm currently taking college courses on the side for a CS degree, and plan to continue pursuit of the degree once completely out of the military (and fortunately, the GI Bill will pay me $1400/mo. during school months for housing expenses in Arizona).

Am I at least capable enough to land a decent internship someone? Should I just keep on dreamin? Are there some harsh realities about my circumstances that I need to embrace? Or is there a good shot at pursuing this dream to become a web developer in a shorter span of time than I'd thought? 

Thanks for your feedback. I'm very receptive to sound advice and I'd really appreciate any expert input. 

I'm also not a very private person (I believe you are who you are, online or otherwise) so I'll be willing to share any other bits about myself if it helps you in lending some input. Thanks again."

[Where is my side of fries?!?  I need to sell table 13.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763m05?context=5)|FOR THE LAST TIME WE DON'T HAVE FRIES CUT LINDSAY THAT IS ONLY FOR BANQUETS how did you find me on reddit.
[I want to be a better cook. Not professionally, just at home. How should I approach this. Is there some theory? Good books for that? How would you list some of the skills one needs to acquire?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761xhx?context=5)|Before I started doing this professionally, I learned a lot from Alton Brown! Good Eats is a great show that explains the why of cooking instead of just giving you a recipe. Tasting everything throughout the cooking process is very important in helping you understand how to season food. If you want to learn more about food in general, On Food and Cooking is a wonderful reference.
[How much of the food at the restaurant is actually prepared fresh?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761xhx?context=5)|At my job, EVERYTHING, although I've worked places where that isn't the case. Most of our produce is grown specifically for us on a local farm and our seafood comes in every morning fresh. The only thing that is held for any length of time is soup, which may have been made 1-3 days before.
[It seems like a lot of hard work in harsh conditions. How do you carry on, when you don't even get to eat what you cook?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761xhx?context=5)|I love what I do - it makes me really happy to create something yummy and perfect that will make someone's day better. I'm lucky to work for an employer who doesn't make us work doubles, which is nice. I try just about everything I make, too!
[What do you think are the defining skills of a head chef? Cooking skills, organization, or leadership?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761xhx?context=5)|All of the above, but the most organized leader in the world won't be a good chef without awesome skills and knowledge. A great chef should be a teacher and garner respect because he/she knows more, not because of a bigger salary or more years experience.
[What is the career path for a professional cook? And what is the usual timeline?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761xhx?context=5)|I guess everyone wants to be a chef eventually :) I didn't go to culinary school and started as a cook after working FOH for a long time. I would think that for someone highly motivated, they should be able to work up from an entry-level cook position to a salaried position as a sous within 5 years. 
[How are kitchens organized? What positions and duties?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761xhx?context=5)|The kitchen I work in is large - we can do like 500-600 people at dinner on a really busy night. There is the chef, then a few sous chefs under him. They are the ""managers"" of the shift and can do anything in the kitchen, help out any station, etc. They also organize and designate prep work. It's their job to know that we will need x more gallons of whatever for tomorrow so we need to do 36 things to make it on whatever timeline. Then there are the cooks. Sautee station is the most senior cook position - sautee calls tickets to the rest of us and is the most experienced dude (sometimes a sous or the chef will work sautee.) Under him is broiler - steaks and other stuff, then hot appetizer station, then cold appetizer/salad station, then desserts - lowest man on the totem pole. Desserts are made by the pastry chef - the dessert guy just plates them up.
[Wow you went from FOH to the line? that's pretty rare at least in my experience. does your kitchen get tipped out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c76442w?context=5)|Nope. I just like food better than people and not hating my job was worth a few hundred a paycheck for me.
[As a former line cook at a high end establishment, the interns from culinary school knew next to nothing about the real world of restaurant kitchens, and not all students did the intern thing.  What have you learned in the kitchen that you don't see in culinary graduates?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c764rjj?context=5)|Humility.
[Do you make hot chocolate with water or milk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c762kt1?context=5)|WHOLE MILK BITCH.
[Why does it matter if you are female?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c762ksf?context=5)|Because it's less common, I guess. I've had people IRL ask questions about working in a traditionally male-dominated industry. I'm one of two women in the kitchen at my job out of about 20 people.
[After being in a high end restaurant all day, when you go back to your house, what food do you crave?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761tzi?context=5)|I make a lot of really rich food at work. When I come home, I just want something fresh and simple. I like seafood and veggies. My husband's favorite dinner is udon noodles with shrimp, mushrooms, and kale.
[Never heard of Udon before, but it sounds delicious from the description on wikipedia.  Do you make the broth, and if so how do you do it?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c76497o?context=5)|Dashi powder 'cause I'm lazy. I put furikake on top.
[What's the longest time you've been 'in the weeds' in the kitchen? AND How many times does your restaurant turn over a night--I mean, how many times does the dining room get refilled or get full again? Basically, what's your longest shift?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c7629dt?context=5)|In the weeds? Maybe 30 minutes. The chef and sous are really good about jumping in and helping anyone who's sinking. I frequently have shifts where I don't stop moving at my fastest pace for 6 hours, but I don't get super behind too much.
 |We can squeeze in 4 full turns on the busiest, busiest night. 3 is more typical. 2 on a slow night. I work day shifts generally, though - lunch turns over 3-4 times in 3 hours! My longest shift was 10 hours. I'm usually out in 7-8 hrs (night shift 8-9 hrs), but I'm lucky to work somewhere with good scheduling - that is NOT typical in the industry.
[How much money do you make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763a76?context=5)|$10.50/hr.
[THANK YOU so much for doing this AMA. I've been wanting to talk to someone who works in a Louisiana/New Orleans restaurant for a while...  What dishes would you recommend that involve seafood for someone like myself who unfortunately, cannot get the freshest quality due to where I live?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763cg2?context=5)|Look for IQF fish at the grocery store in the frozen section. It can frequently be better quality than whatever's at the seafood counter if you're far away from an ocean and is available everywhere. You can make any recipe that would call for fresh. Just thaw under cold running water first.
[Favorite version of shrimp and grits?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763cg2?context=5)|Grits with chevre in, with NOLA-style bbq shrimp with lots of sauce! I make this for dinner whenever u10s go on sale.
[Im English and love fine food. I recently did extremely well for myself and as a huge once in a lifetime treat i shall be going to The Fat Duck restaurant in Bray - what do you think of Heston Blumenthals inventive ""scientific"" cooking style?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c764acw?context=5)|I love to watch videos about it and I think it's interesting, but it's not where I personally want to go.
[Global, Henckel or Shun?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761qvn?context=5)|Shun if I could afford it. :( I get my knives from restaurant supply stores and an asian grocery.
[Have you read the Liquor series by Poppy Z Brite? It's three novels about chefs and restaurants in New Orleans. If you read them, what did you think about how them? If not, book tip!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761oy8?context=5)|I haven't, but I've seen interviews with her. Putting this on my wish list!
[What would be your best advice or tip to an aspiring cook? I currently work at two bars but am really trying to get into fine dining and high end cooking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c76315x?context=5)|I was hired with no kitchen experience at all. When asked why I should be hired instead of a more qualified applicant, I said that you can always teach recipes and technique, but work ethic and more importantly passion for good food are things you can't teach. If you can convince some chef that you are really going to put your heart into what you do and you're anxious to learn, they might give you a shot. I guess my best advice is learn as much as you can constantly - there is SO much to learn - and then market the shit out of your desire to do so.
[Do you pack your own lunch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761og5?context=5)|No, one of the sous chefs makes family meal for the entire staff every day. It's usually pretty good! A lot of the time it'll utilize the bits of meat left over after a large cut is portioned out, so we'll get things like ribeye grillades and grits, or pompano poboys.
[You're making me miss NOLA :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c762fge?context=5)|Come back! We have u10 shrimp to share!
[I'll bite.  What the heck is U10 shrimp?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c767a60?context=5)|Shrimp are measured in number per pound, so 36-40 are 36-40 shrimp per pound. u10 is under 10 per pound, the big ones. I have never seen u10 shrimp as a common grocery item anywhere but the gulf coast.
[Is the food you make higher quality than the food at a chain restaurant or is it just presented and prepared differently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c76219b?context=5)|Much higher quality because of the quality of our ingredients. Applebees or wherever is getting everything shipped in from Sysco. Our products come from local suppliers - fresher and tastier!
[What's your favorite thing to cook? Least favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761pc9?context=5)|My favorite thing to cook at work are butter sauces, because keeping them perfectly emulsified is a fun challenge. At home, I like to cook (well, ""cook"") ceviche or anything cured-fish-related, like homemade lox, shime saba, etc. I have never managed to fuck it up, the different flavor combinations you can use are pretty much endless, and I think cured fish is delicious!
 |My least favorite thing to cook at work is croutons, because slicing all the bread takes forever. I like making everything I make at home.
[I love ceviche and it is incredibly easy to make. Any other type of cooking in lime or acidic juices you can reccommend? Or variations of ceviche? I tend to use shrimp. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c7641qf?context=5)|Rice vinegar makes a nice seafood cure for a change. It's nice also mixed with a citrus. I really like fatty fish for cured preparations - tuna, mackeral, salmon... Poke is a great ceviche alternative!
[What would you recommend for learning more about butter sauces? I am on a low carb diet so I can be liberal with butter as I cook any kind of meat. I've tried mixing heavy cream or white wine in after I cook the meat but it rarely comes out right. 1.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c7634l1?context=5)|[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLmzaYpBYgw) is a good demo of how to make the kinds of butter sauces I make at work.
 |It seems from your comment that reducing may be the critical bit you're missing.
 |Take whatever liquid you want - wine, in that video, or worchestershire, or hot sauce, or stock, or anything else or combination of whatever - and reduce it and mount cold butter into it. You'll get a smooth, creamy sauce with a nice thick mouthfeel. When I first learned how to do this I was surprised that I could make such a thick, creamy sauce with only butter and wine - no roux or cream.
 |For a simple heavy cream sauce, sautee some shallots and garlic first, then pour in cream and a little white wine and reduce til you get the thickness you want. I like using porky things in sauces like this at the beginning - finely diced bacon, ham, smoked sausage, etc.

[Hi, thanks for doing this AMA. I'm currently a young, white, female culinary student and I have a lot of questions.   I'm in California, and find that most restaurant kitchens are 90% hispanic males, in your experience, what demographic makes up the restaurants you've worked in? Do you find being a woman has hindered you in any way?  Did you like to cook before going into the business? If so, has making it your career caused you to hate cooking as a hobby? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c766lz9?context=5)|I'm in a different area of the country, but down here kitchens tend to be a mix of white and black men, who don't in my experience tend to be as overtly sexist as latinos. It's just a boys' club making dick jokes around here usually. I feel like I have to work harder to prove myself, but that also comes with inexperience - not just being female.
[What advice can you offer a culinary student whose goal is to work very fine dining, in a very popular place? What can I do to open these doors to me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c766lz9?context=5)|Be willing to start at the bottom, be humble, learn as much as you can. Try and get your externship somewhere you actually want to work. I've worked places where we ended up hiring the really good extern.
[What does your typical day consist of? How long are your shifts? Do you enjoy what you do? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c766lz9?context=5)|Yes. I still like to cook at home, but after a long day sometimes I'm not in the mood.
 |I work day shift, about 8 hrs. 3 hrs of prep, 4 hrs of service, 1 hr of transition to night shift guy/leftover prep. I love my job - it's the most enjoyable job I've ever had.
[Who are your most/least favorite ""celebrity"" chefs?  And what is your most hated current food ""trend""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c761qcm?context=5)|I like the Barefoot Contessa show. Does she count as a celebrity? I don't like Emeril or Mario Battali because of things I've heard from their employees about working conditions, and I hate Guy Fierri because he's just a douche.
 |Cake pops can suck a bag of dicks. EW.
[What is the most overpriced meat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763p5s?context=5)|Chicken. Cheap as hell to make yourself. Why spend 30-some dollars on chicken?
 |Bluefin tuna and lump crabmeat are the least overpriced.
[I worked at a fine-dining sushi place for about 2 years and the bluefin that we got shipped in would be 2grand for a 50lb chunk of fish that wasn't even cleaned or anything.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c76745d?context=5)|But sooo delicious. Glad it isn't my job to portion that shit as it would be really hard to not just take bites.
[Oh god, do I not miss that line of work. I used to be a line cook for a country club, I remember one night we had a full dining room + two parties of 20 ordering off the menu, I had to cook 42 steaks all going out at the same time by myself. Every temp imaginable, and there were 3 different sized fillets (8oz, 10oz, 12oz\). I came so close to just walking right the fuck out, but the chef and I were good buddies. I still have no idea how none of the steaks came back.  Any crazy/hectic/ohmygodgetmeoutofhere stories? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763aea?context=5)|I do not envy that! I know the guy on grill gets fucked like that on the regular, but I don't work grill yet. The most annoying thing I have to deal with is people sending a shrimp app back because it's served (here and everywhere, traditionally) with the heads on. I have to then stop what I'm doing to take apart their shrimp like they're a 3 year old.
[How often do people complain because they found a few bits of the sand vein? And on a different note, how many bruises, cuts and blisters do you have on your hands *so far*?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c765d59?context=5)|Out of towners complain about shrimp veins, locals don't care.

[I personally love Fergus Henderson. By far my favorite chef of all time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c762r8b?context=5)|I guess she doesn't really count as a chef, but I love Alice Waters for being a champion of veggies.  When none of my coworkers are around to make fun of me, I'll turn off all the lights, lock the doors, and watch Ferran Adria videos on youtube. So far away from what I make (and what I WANT to make, which I guess are different) but I CAN'T STOP WATCHING, sitting alone in the dark, mentally shamesturbating to molecular gastronomy videos.

[4\) Best hole-in-the-wall in NOLA?  Oh man, is that one a loaded question.

All my favorite hole in the walls are not holes in the wall any more. MRB, this bar on St Phillip in the Quarter, has SURPRISINGLY good food.
[1\) Never been a fan of August and last time I had a terrible experience there. My vote goes to Stella.  2\) Stella 3\) Agree with Parkway for poboys.  Have you tried Revolution?

[I love Green Goddess, but they don't make the Sultan's Nest anymore. Do you ever get up to Baton Rouge?

[Wow, yeah that's so terrible. It makes me angry for you guys.  Okay, piggybacking in another question!  NYC is seeing a big sustainable food movement. I saw on one of your other responses that you get your food from local sources. Does that mean non-factory-farmed, sustainable sources? Is that common in high end restaurants down in NOLA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13pske/iama_female_line_cook_at_a_popular_highend_new/c763qcm?context=5)|Very common down here. Seafood has always been local for NOLA restaurants, so there's no big change there other than places are now using the fact that they source from Bob the Shrimp Guy as a selling point. Local produce is featured pretty heavily on menus down here and many places have contracts/relationships with farms where they get stuff grown specifically for them. One of the benefits of living in a warm climate is you have local produce year-round.

13qob5,1,2012-11-24,ECE Major here. I'm losing my shit because I can't get over the feeling that I'm gonna graduate and not know anything.,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/13qob5/ece_major_here_im_losing_my_shit_because_i_cant/,"Hi! I'll try to keep this brief and not give my life story.

Until very recently I always kinda assumed I could get by simply by being really smart (sorry for sounding like a douche). I slacked through high school because I was a little shit. I basically did no work, got maybe a B average, but got into a good school because I did very well on my SATs. Now that I'm in my third year of college I've got a 3.9 GPA and am completing my second internship at a certain very large company, making awesome money.

So on the surface it sounds like I'm all peaches and cream, but I'm getting some serious fucking [imposter syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) lately. I worry that I studied the wrong way; I understood everything at the time, but I feel like I've forgotten so much. I could learn it again easily, but if I'm asked to solve a problem in an interview I think I would choke really bad. My whole life I taught myself to believe memorization was for suckers. I had a phone interview a few years ago and wasn't able to tell them what a pointer was. I'm very good at programming, yet I didn't know what a fucking pointer was because I thought I was above memorizing jargon. I basically fooled myself into believing I was fine when really I was fucking lazy and wrote off anything that required more than minimal effort.

So anyways, I'm currently going through some scary self-examination. I'm afraid I don't know anything practical so I'm trying to jam myself full of information from all facets of electrical and computer engineering and I might be slowly losing my mind. Anyone have any experience similar to this? Any advice? How much do interviewers value intelligence/ability to learn/problem solving skills versus knowledge? I'm gonna really buckle down for the rest of my studies, actually read my textbooks and such. Right now I'm studying for the FE exam, I figure that's worthwhile.

Thanks! Sorry for the rather manic post."

So my question is am I never eligible due to this restriction? I know some non-citizens who seem to have gotten past this barrier and got internships in companies that don't hire non-US-citizens. What companies do you know that are hiring non-US-citizens in the US?

People tell me to get one back in my home country; the problem is I don't speak the native language there, since my family grew up out of their native countries. It's been really stressful lately for me, I just want something for next spring/summer/whenever. 

tldr; non-US-citizen trying to get internship in engineering field in the US, believes I can't due to eligibility restrictions, wants to know if you know any companies that hire non-US-citizens in this field. Thanks for reading my semi-rant."
13u5g8,9,2012-11-26,"Struggling in Pre-Calc, Want to Complete a CS Degree, Want to Program at the Very Least",vaelroth,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/13u5g8/struggling_in_precalc_want_to_complete_a_cs/,"I'm a junior in college and I've been working towards getting a CS degree over the past few years. I whizzed through my programming classes in community college without a solid background in mathematics. I did just fine (As and Bs, once I got the hang of things) in classes that supposedly required calculus as a prerequisite. I got out of the prerequisite by demonstrating my computer literacy at the community college. Now I'm struggling to keep up. It is too late in the semester to switch to audit of pass/fail, but I'm determined to keep trying.

I should provide some background as to why I'm in this situation to begin with. Like many, I've changed my major a few times in college. Before I settled on Computer Science (which I love, and thats why I'm here asking for advice!) I was following a very liberal arts track. As a result of this, I've been distanced from any kind of practice with mathematics at all for the past many years. I had pre-calculus in my senior year of high school, and that was the 2005-2006 school year. **What skills are imperative for me to brush up on during the winter so that I can succeed in my next semester of pre-calculus?**

I program a lot in what little spare time I have. I've recently been fooling around with Processing, and I was trying to teach myself how to work with Git over the summer. I really need to focus on my maths before I can continue with real computer science classes at my current institution, so I suppose I need to put programming on the back burner for a bit while I get going with math again. **Despite this, should I be looking for internships to get some real world experience? Would my associates degree be enough to get me a decent job if I can demonstrate real-world skills and develop a more serious portfolio than just school projects?**"
13u1v0,1,2012-11-26,"Calling all coders, do I have a fighting chance?",boatBurner,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13u1v0/calling_all_coders_do_i_have_a_fighting_chance/,"I've got a big decision to make.

I'm 25, married with four little boys and only a couple of months left in the Marine Corps. What I decide to do next will determine the following twenty years of our lives. As such, it has been a great deal of stress for me over the last year.

I've made the decision a while ago that I don't want to stay in the military. And unfortunately, all of my peers and mentors in the military are shocked at any other decision that doesn't involve staying in the military because of the size of my family. I get it. I have quite a full plate, but I also think a lot of people get ""stuck"" - military or otherwise - in a career they aren't happy with out of fear of failing.

I don't want that to be me, but I need to be smart about this next step.

I have been focusing on learning Ruby on Rails only recently and have a solid background in HTML and CSS. To an experienced coder, I'm very much a green horn. You can see my freelance and contract work at http://turbofish.net and http://bluereach.com respectively. A lot of what I do for client work is using CMS or pre-built templates and themes, and just modify them as needed.

As someone with a family depending on me and no more than 3-4 years in web design experience, how likely is a career in web development? I would love to build web applications and start my own business-to-business SaaS or work with an existing company, but I often wonder if I'm delusional and should settle for something outside of the industry. I simply don't know enough people to get a good assessment of my skills vs. the industry standard.

I'm currently taking college courses on the side for a CS degree, and plan to continue pursuit of the degree once completely out of the military (and fortunately, the GI Bill will pay me $1400/mo. during school months for housing expenses in Arizona).

Am I at least capable enough to land a decent internship someone? Should I just keep on dreamin? Are there some harsh realities about my circumstances that I need to embrace? Or is there a good shot at pursuing this dream to become a web developer in a shorter span of time than I'd thought?

Thanks for your feedback. I'm very receptive to sound advice and I'd really appreciate any expert input.

I'm also not a very private person (I believe you are who you are, online or otherwise) so I'll be willing to share any other bits about myself if it helps you in lending some input. Thanks again.

Only full time positions are available, no internships, part time, summer work programs, or telecommuting. If you are a recent graduate, you must demonstrate real-world Java or web development (JQuery, CSS, etc) knowledge to be considered. Thanks!

**What we do**

We develop 911 emergency and public safety software. Our software revolutionizes the way emergency first responders receive calls, react, and deliver critical emergency services to the public. We believe that by applying innovation to the public safety sector, we can make a difference in people’s lives. Our products include next generation VoIP 911 communication (voice, sms text, and video), computer-aided dispatch, GPS enabled mobile units for fire/police/EMS, maps and live data delivery, police and fire post incident management/investigations, and data mining/reporting.

**How we do it**

We believe in agile software development. Our well defined and efficient processes are backed by the best tooling we can find. Some of the tools we use include JIRA, GreenHopper, FishEye, Confluence, SpiraTest, Balsamiq, Subversion, and Jenkins. We believe in continuous integration, unit testing, and automated testing. We like clean code.

Developer happiness is important to us. Work areas are quiet, spacious, window-facing, and all developers get fast boxes with dual 24” monitors. We have our own development lab to run load tests or bask in the warm hum of the server racks. Our systems engineers ensure that production issue distractions are kept to a minimum. Our QA group keeps us in check and even helps with the automated testing.

**What we’re looking for**

We’re looking for people passionate about software development. If you have side projects, contribute to open source, or enjoy reading about and discussing technology, then you sound like a great fit. We believe a strong foundation of data structures, algorithms, and design patterns is important. Our product line covers many diverse development areas such as distributed soa, web, backend, mobile, maps/gis, databases, caching, reporting, data indexing, and high availability. Each of these areas in a mission critical environment contains their own unique and difficult problems to solve. As such, a strong foundation coupled with the desire to learn, grow, and solve hard problems would make for a strong addition to our team.

**Junior Developer**

You have the passion and are ready for a challenge but are still getting started with less than a few years experience. You have exposure to some of the technologies listed, and are very eager to learn more while becoming stronger in the areas you already know. 

**Mid-Level Developer**

You are a seasoned developer with 2 to 5 years experience that can solve tough problems. You’re strong in at least one area of the software stack and are eager to expand into others. You are familiar with best practices and know how to write clean code.

**Senior Developer**

You are a very strong developer with over 5 years of experience. You are adept at breaking down and solving very complex and difficult problems. You’ve been exposed to most areas in the software stack and very strong in a few of them. You’re able to learn and integrate new technologies independently. You enjoy mentoring and guiding the more junior engineers.

i am a sophomore studying Aero and Mech Engineering. It is not the internship application season and I have a few questions. If you could help me with any that would be awesome and I will be forever thankful. 

Little background: I have a 3.7 GPA. I have my Gold Award (the girl scout equivalent of an Eagle Scout). I have been on many planning boards. I have even started a new event while being on planning boards. I am on DBF (design build fly) and work at a faux cinema my school holds on the weekends. I am also AutoCad certified and I have much experience with SolidWorks and NX. When i leave college I want to work on Unmanned Autonomous Systems, fighter jets or commercial airplanes 

My main concerns and questions. 

- The company I really want to work for is called AeroVironment. Since I've been doing research on them since my Senior year of HS, they have mentioned plenty of times that they usually only accept Juniors. Being a sophomore how can i make my cover letter, resume, ect better in order for it to not only stand out, but also show them that I am very serious about their company and really want to work for them. 

- Unlike a lot of kids who get these internships I don't have steller projects I've worked on, or previous internships. What are some things I do have under my belt that I should highlight to show that I am a hard worker and willing to push myself. 

- Lastly with structure interviews what are some suggestions people have to calm nerves and answer the question going into detail, but not dragging on the question and repeating what you've already said. 


TL;DR : Engineering student needs help making her resume stand out to potential internship employers as well as highlighting certain skills to show she is ready for an internship with their company. Also worried about structure interviews and how to answer the questions without getting lost in the story and repeating herself. 


Any little bit helps. I wasn't sure who else to turn to. 
Thanks Reddit!"

I've looked around gamedev, but couldn't find what I was looking for. Hopefully this won't be too repetitive.

I've been programming video games since I was 12. I've always used gamemaker (I started using drag n' drop, of course, but finished completely in GML, the built-in language.) It's not great for making advanced games, I know, but I never needed anything more than that.

I'm in college now, and I've learned Python and Java pretty easily in Computer Science courses, but I haven't gotten anywhere in terms of game development. I love making games, but I'd like to be able to make games in more useful languages. I'd like to make games that I could not only have fun making, but also could put on a resume or an application to a game development studio (gotta get those internships.)

I'm more than willing to commit the time and energy outside of classes to learn a new language or engine, but I don't know where to turn. There seem to be a whole lot of options.

Any advice?"

Whoo, this is a doozy, so get ready. A year ago, I was friends with a guy (we'll call him Seth) who liked me. I knew he liked me, but tried my hardest not to pursue it because I had a boyfriend (now fiance) for 5 years and he was away in another country on an internship. Seth and I hung out often, I went to his place to watch movies, he cooked me dinner and we went hiking, kayaking and he came to see my horse even. I only wanted it to be friend like environment, but I have to admit, I flirted just because it was nice to have the attention (my boyfriend and I at the time were fighting...). So... when my boyfriend came back home, I broke up with him but continued to talk to him and Seth. Eventually I got back with my boyfriend, not thinking it would hurt Seth as much as it did. I tried to make an apology, but I had hurt him too much so I gave him the space he wanted. He got a girlfriend (we'll call her Jenny) shortly after I fucked up, and the two got serious quickly. When I tried to talk to her, introduce myself or bring up a conversation, she snubbed me, ignored me, or generally was a bitch. I tried to friend her on FB and she sent me a message that all said, ""I will not friend you, nor will I ever friend you or talk to you because of what you did to Seth. I cannot believe that you did that and I refuse to associate with someone who could hurt him so badly."" Well, I was a little put off because she hadn't heard my side of the story because she never gave me the time of day, and tried to explain that we were just friends, I didn't mean to hurt him, etc. She blocked me. So... this went on for a year, I was all up their butt trying to figure out what the fuck to do, tried to talk to Seth and Jenny, but only Seth was cordial to me. It grew to the point that I couldn't stand thinking, hearing, or being around Seth or Jenny, and it made it all the worse because they are friends with my friends. I felt like I was forcing my friends to choose between me and them whenever we all got together. Only my boyfriend and another friend see the true side of Jenny and Seth, but my other friends think the world of them. I still can't stand them, but Seth and I are cordial to each other. I unblocked Jenny (out of spite) earlier today from FB, and she then proceeded to block me. All the old feelings of hatred have come back, and I hate that every time either of their names come up in conversation, I want to say, ""Ug, she is such a bitch!"" Not to defend myself, but I feel like I am a great person, who fucked up terribly and will pay for it for the rest of my days, but shouldn't you give someone the benefit of the doubt and get to know them before you make a judgement call? My boyfriend and I will be moving at the beginning of the year together, so I'm away from them until I come back to visit monthly, so that at least is good, but I still can't help myself from snooping on FB to see what they're up to. What do I do? Has anyone else been in this situation?"

This might be better in r/engineeringstudents... 

Quick question:

I'm interested in finding a legitimate company in an English speaking country in Europe to do a summer internship.  I'm a junior in Industrial Engineering with prior internship experience.  I've been searching around the internet but keep getting travel internship program websites where you need to pay to go.

I feel like there must be companies in England, Ireland, etc that would like students from the states to come intern.


Any thoughts or suggestions to look?  Experiences?

I had a 3 year CS apprenticeship including .NET internship. Now I'm working on a CS B.Eng. and currenty doing an ERP .NET internship in China.
I'll just make a quick list of some of my concerns for readability:

*I feel as if the IT skill level is higher in the US than in Germany (judging by what I hear in discussions)


*I now have to choose between four directions in college: networking, mobile development, media CS (audio,video processing) and technical CS (industry, robots) which can you generally without much thought recommend and why - for the US market?


*I planned my career path as follows: Coder, preferably in C# - Software Engineer - classical middle Management - own company (possibly earlier due to skills or finding profitable market gap)

Advice would be most appreciated"

She got an internship at Nordstroms in San Diego. I moved with my company to the closest production store to move up in the company. The closest store was in Ontario CA (about an hour and a half from her).

Everything seemed to be going well (we've been together for a year). We had a great thanksgiving dinner then yesterday she calls me and tells me she doesn't want to hurt me but her feelings are not what they used to be.

She switched her status to single. I was bawling on the phone. 

I left her a voicemail today asking to talk just to get some closure. I won't beg for her back but I just want more understanding. I love this girl with all my heart and it hurts so much being in a city now with no one. Christmas is going to be really tough. She hasn't returned the call.

Anyway, I was having bad thoughts last night. It's scary to have these. I was seriously considering taking myself out with razor blades in my bathtub.

What should I do reddit? I have no one here but coworkers. I've talked with a few friends back in Tucson. Should I move back? I won't be able to move until February to transfer stores.

I'm really lost right now reddit and I don't like these thoughts."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How do you publish your material?  Are you broadcasting the show online?  If you've worked with TV networks before, how different is owning and producing the show yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c771nw0?context=5)|The BEST part about this crazy adventure of mine is that I did NOT have to answer to people who will water down the show. Who will homogenize the show. Who will change the show to appeal to timid advertisers. The problem with TV, and movies too, I suppose, (although, I don't make movies) is that the people with money decide what is good and what is not... or how a thing should be presented... Well, i didn't want to listen to someone else tell me how to make the show I wanted to make. And that's the best part... Creative freedom.
[You didnt answer the first question.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c772k5v?context=5)|The show has been sold to more than a dozen TV channels internationally. Here in the US, I've decided to do something UNIQUE: It's going to premiere on a popular site where I can set a very small fee for people to see the show. I'm excited about this experiment, because it allows me to retain the ownership of what I've created, and it allows me to get it to what I hope will be fans where they want it -- when they want it - and how they want it -- along with behind the scenes stuff... Fans will be able to suggest experiments... and will even be able to participate.
[So if a TV network tries to buy your show or idea, will you not sell it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c770r75?context=5)|Actually, now I would not sell the show. I feel like I've gone down a long long road -- where I've self financed the series -- and that opportunity to sell it on the web is such that it's possible to make back the money invested... and best of all, I'd retain ownership of my series.
[How'd you come up with the idea? I'm also curious to hear the story of how you got started, like what you were thinking going in and what challenges or unexpected things occurred. Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c771v1d?context=5)|I have been making TV shows for about 20 years. And I have worked on quite a few shows. Politically Incorrect, Bullshit, Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn, Punkin Chunkin and many many others. 
[Wait, Bullshit with Penn and Teller?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c772xji?context=5)|YEs. I was a writer for one season, the supervising producer for another season, then the show runner for 2 more seasons. I was there for a total of 4 years. It was a terrific experience. 
[Damn, that show was so awesome. How was Penn and Teller offscreen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c773fn7?context=5)|They were lovely guys to work with. Very supportive of my work.
[Try not to give much thought to the trolls in this thread that already swept in and treated you like a piece of shit for doing what only Louis has come close to in terms of original creative control. Great job and good on you for not giving in and doing it on your own.    How did you first land on the idea of doing it all by yourself?   What are the programs you use to edit and produce the show?   What was the original idea you had when starting off?   What was the most difficult thing you encountered making it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c772cvl?context=5)|Well, I have been making TV for many years. I have created a number of series and worked on a # of shows. And I just got tired of killing myself to make some other guys dreams come true... So - I decided to invest in myself. At least then, I could blame me if it didn't work... and if it was a success, it was because I killed myself to make it so (BTW: I had help from MANY many gifted and talented friends and colleagues who helped me make the show as producers and editors. Also, the hosts of the show, Brad, Mark and Chris took the material I wrote and made it better than I could have imagined).
[So.. now that you have your very own 6 hour long self-edited-produced-funded film about science, how exactly do you plan on getting broadcasted? Or do you plan on releasing this on an alternate medium, like the interpipes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c772nj2?context=5)|The show has been distributed internationally on various TV networks. HOWEVER -- I am responsible for US distribution... And Im going to put it up on a popular website -- and charge a very nominal fee for viewing. This will allow fans to see the show when they want, where they want and how they want. And I will make them part of the show -- by opening up a forum for people to suggest experiments, and to even appear in the show. I think that if people see something that is unique, that gives them information they care about, and they're entertained along the way, they'll support the nominal fee to watch. Or, at least I hope they will :)
[*Im going to put it up on a popular website -- and charge a very nominal fee for viewing.*  And... I'm gone.  With all the free content options available why would I want to pay for the equivalent of a Discovery Channel show?  Go ad-supported or watch it die a long slow death.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c7736m3?context=5)|I think that with free content you get what you paid for. With This vs That, you get a series made by people who have made many of the shows you already watch... and best of all, at least from my perspective, the show is not watered down or homogenized by network executives who have to bow down to timid advertisers who insist on bland programming and nothing controversial to sell their precious soap. I think there's an audience for imaginative, dynamic and unique programs that come from a single voice that is aiming to give you the truth -- and is not playing to the lowest common denominator.
[I watched the first clip about loading an airplane.  It seems like a moderately interesting show I might watch while flipping channels but not sure I would pay much, if anything, for them.  How much are you asking for the episodes?  (I say this as someone who paid Louis CK for his standup special because it was non-DRM'd and relatively cheap.\)  Another question: What are the economics of selling a show like this to, say, the Discovery Channel, TLC, or the Science Channel.  How are the deals structured and how much $ is paid and when?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c776ml3?context=5)|A top line Cable Chanel would pay in the range of 275K to 400K for the average 1 hour show (give or take). A higher end channel and their premiere show would fetch maybe 20-40% more. As for ownership, it depends on your ability to make a deal with the channel, they look at what kind of deals you made in the past... But, mostly it depends on how badly they want the show, or if they are bidding on the show against a competitor. The #s vary.
[Do you even lift?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c770et8?context=5)|Good question. But, no. I don't exercise anymore. 
[Pro Tip: If you are going to do and AMA and have a website for your show you might want to set the videos to something other than Private. I was actually intrigued, went to your site, saw an interesting episode (the airplane one\), went to watch and got denied. My immediate reaction?

[I'm sorry, how is this different from Mythbusters at all?

Can Ninjas walk on water? I don't know any ninjas... and knowing this won't help me in my life one iota. I wanted to make a show where there are two choices that we are presented with in a given situation... we nearly always pick one over the other - because we think our choice is the right answer -- I wanted to show people the two options head to head... and then scientifically demonstrate -- with leading experts -- why one is preferable to the other. That way, when you're in the same situation, you'd be able to make a better decision.

It was not as expensive as a typical TV show because many people contributed their time and labor -- with the hope that I'd sell the show -- make back my money and then pay them. It's a unique situation. Thankfully, I have terrific friends and colleagues who had faith that I could pull of something that when you think about it - is actually incredibly stupid. I said to them, I'm going to make a show that's as good, as big, as dynamic, as professional as anything you see on TV... and I'm doing to do it for 90% less money... and I'm going to mostly do it by myself (With your help, of course). So -- the prospect of doing something outside the box has made this incredible adventure totally worth it. I've loved every minute of it.

[Congratulations on what sounds like a reasonably successful project.  How do you intend to differentiate between your shows and so many others with a similar premise (i.e. Mythbusters and it's contemporaries\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c77253z?context=5)|Let me be very very clear. Mythbusters is a fine show... But my show is VERY VERY different. The difference is the same difference as between fiction and non-fiction. Yes, they are both books. But, one is about stuff that is well, not real, and one is about stuff that is real. I think of my series as Factual Entertainment. I have no stake in the outcome of the experiments... and my politics play NO role that I'm aware of in the construction of the show. I wanted a show that was just the truth. That's why our motto is: No Bias. No Bullshit. Just science, fact and funny.
[So, a couple of questions.  Do you plan to charge people to download/stream or are you counting on dvd sales, advertising, etc...?  Is this your first experience producing a show/movie?  Are you planning to finance more shows if you recoup from this one? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c772ri9?context=5)|We plan to make it streamable... one episode a week for 6 weeks. This is NOT my first experience... I have created and ran many TV series. The most recent is a show that is on Playboy TV right now called ""The Truth About Sex"".

First, I think of the material on the show as interesting to BOTH genders, regardless of who is presenting it. Everyone cares about traffic, travel, the weather... HOWEVER in season 2, assuming I get to do it, we will definitely be adding a FEMALE co-host.

[Lol no problem man. not even just the myth busters comparison, but i think i hate reddit. everyone has such a fuckin shitty attitude and it makes me want to stab them in the eye.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c77453s?context=5)|You know, I think of this as an opportunity to talk to people who are inclined to like the show given its subject matter -- but who are also very savvy of being jerked around - and can tell when something isn't authentic... I think it's my job to convince them that I have something that they'll like... and that if they pay the 2 or 3 bucks to see it -- they won't feel ripped off. These people who follow Reddit (like myself) are people who care about what's going on in the world, are actively engaged, have opinions and know what they like and what they don't. Again, I think it's vital for me to make them see that what I've got is in their wheelhouse... and is about something they care about. I hope I'm able to do that. I'm certainly trying.
[When i'm done work i'm gonna take a look at all your links! but i guess here's my question instead of bitching for a change... do you like penn and tellers bullshit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c7759oo?context=5)|I worked on Bullshit for four years. I ran the show for TWO years. I loved every minute of that experience.
[That's so bad ass.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c77i8kc?context=5)|Thank you for the encouragement. It means a lot to me knowing people will support an independent project.
[I dig the idea of it, pretty cool stuff. What was your favorite thing to test? Why was it? How often are guests on the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c774yzg?context=5)|My favorite thing to test was the effectiveness of Hybrid cars and comparing it to combustion engine cars. I thought people were being sold an idea that hybrid cars will save people money, gas, and save the environment - HOWEVER -- I also thought, because Im just naturally skeptical, that all of that is bullshit. So, we tested three hybrid cars and the two best combustion engine cars under the same circumstances to see which got better gas mileage. The results were very surprising. And it's not the kind of experiment you could see on traditional TV because advertisers like Toyota and Ford and Honda would never support it. I think this was my favorite test because so many people are interested in doing something good for the environment... and it would be good if their good intentions were rewarded with good outcomes. When this episode premieres, I think people will be SHOCKED.
[What made the combustion engines the best? Did you go buy the highest stock mpg or was there a lot more involved trying to figure out what was need?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c77556s?context=5)|We researched which combustion engine cars were rated in a variety of places as having the BEST mpg -- at the time of the test, it was the Chevy Aveo and the Smart Car. We tested them against two Priuses and the Hybrid Honda Accord. We took them up to Lancaster, CA, to the automotive proving grounds and ""raced"" them at the same speed, the same distance at at the same time... and then determined gas usage.
[How much did it cost to produce a show like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c773jsc?context=5)|Too much. And since my wife might be reading this, I'm going to say $1. :)
[How much did it cost you to make it altogether?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c773fpm?context=5)|Well... there's a chance my wife is reading this - so, I'm going to say it didn't cost much at all :)
[What was the hardest thing about creating a show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c7743in?context=5)|Hmm... Well, I have created a number of shows. I think the hardest part is convincing other people that it will be good. I get the idea so clearly in my head... I see it all.. And then I have to convey that enthusiasm and the show's mechanics to people who have heard a million TV show ideas... And I have to convince them that not only is mine unique, but that it will be good for them, and their channel. And I have to do all this thinking and creating in a vacuum... I mean, when I create a show, I don't know precisely who it will be for? Or, even if anyone will want to buy it. And Yet, I have to think it all out... I always invest and make a really exciting presentation... sometimes I shoot a sample of the show.. .and that takes time and costs money.. And yet, I don't know if anyone will want it. The thing I tell people is: I think of myself as a baker. I make delicious deserts. I show up at the TV network with a fantastic cake for them to sample. Unfortunately, some days they are buying scones. And I'm fucked. But, that doesn't mean that cake isn't good. It just means that my cake won't be a TV show. You have to have very thick skin to not take any of it personally. 
[Are you going to link to any of it? or are you trying to get people interested so that they will pay for the privilege of seeing the first episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c773cgg?context=5)|Actually, I'm going to make parts of each episode available for FREE. Then, after you watch a little bit of it -- you can decide if you want to pay a VERY small fee... and see the rest. Go to: facebook.com/thisvsthatshow and click ""Like"" and you'll be sure to get the information when it's released next week. Thanks for being enthusiastic. It makes me very very happy to see that people are interested in the work I create.
[Looks like an ok effort but the questions you are asking are from the limited imaginations of middle aged joes, none of them interested me. I guess you are appealing to that market but I don't see the wide appeal. Here's a question for you: Is science wasted on beer swilling, big car driving, gun shooting idiots?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c773e6w?context=5)|So - what would you like to see us investigate. I'm happy to consider it!
[Investigate which show is better: mythbusters or thisvsthat.  Since you said everything you do is conducted without any self-imposed bias, this should be fun to watch. i would pay at least 5 dollars to see the results.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c774ons?context=5)|However, it wouldn't be scientific. It'd just be opinion. Again, this is a show about science. We measure things, test things, want results that are repeatable... The comparison of my show and another would just be opinion. 
[How is this different to a low-rent mythbusters? If you had the same budget as mythbusters what would your show do differently? Thanks and good luck.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c778azj?context=5)|It's different from mythbusters in a very important way. Mythbusters, for the most part, explores things that are well, mythical. And fictional. ""Can Ninjas walk on Water?"" This show focuses on non-fiction. Things that are real. For instance, what's the best kind of roof to have on your house if you live in a hurricane zone? I think of This vs That as non-fiction entertainment. We are using science to investigate things that really happen to all of us. 
[Not explaining *everything* that you are testing, and rather just going into the very specifics of the test itself. Tell us your hypotheses, tell us your expectations.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c777nfz?context=5)|PS. That's a joke re: hazing the intern. Sorry you didn't like it. You're not going to like all the jokes.
[Since you went with online distribution for the US showing, did you ever consider using the YouTube premium channels?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c773fg7?context=5)|I looked into Youtube... BUT -- they don't yet have a mechanism where by content creators can charge what they think is a fair price for their work. So, their is no method there yet, that I'm aware of, to recoup the production costs.
[You seem a little bitter against television networks. Witht hat in mind, how do you think you're gonna get picked up with that attitude?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c775dw6?context=5)|I am NOT bitter about TV networks. Not at all. I am describing for you how it works when you make a TV show for a TV network. In fact, I have created TV series for a number of networks. This vs That, however, will be made available to viewers on the web. It's a show I created, funded, and produced. I wanted an opportunity to be the one who made all the decisions (in concert with my colleagues and friends who helped on the show)... and didn't want to take notes from people who didn't have the same vision for the series that I did.
[Fellow reality Producer / Editor here.  Did you pitch ""This vs That"" around to networks before deciding to do it yourself?  If they all passed on it, what made you go ahead and produce the series anyway? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c776i2k?context=5)|I had the show set up at TWO different networks. And the deals weren't good. So, I had to pass. What made me do it on my own was my overriding desire to see this series come to fruition. It is genuinely the marriage of the two things I'm interested in: in my personal life, I have always been interested in find out the truth -- whatever it may be -- and, professionally, I like to make TV shows. So -- a show that set out to uncover unbiased answers to questions people have... fired me up. There have been MANY shows I've created... but, I didn't make those on my own. This one has such an elegant premise... and the material seemed easy for me to wrap my head around. I just knew that this was the kind of show I could make on my own, if I decided to.  I mean, I had done quite a bit of work that prepared me for this leap... So, I knew I could do it... The question was did I have the stamina to see it through.. and could I convince enough people to get on board my train and help me realize this crazy goal I had... WHich was to make a show, edit the show and then distribute it from my garage. And we did. And I couldn't be happier about the outcome... or more appreciative of the people who helped me get to the finish line. Afterall, the people who worked on the series with me didn't just make the best version of my idea, the contributed much that makes the show even better than I had hoped.
[It's great to see a Producer take his own show to completion.  As someone who's been out pitching shows, I sympathize.  On a side note:  Are you looking for an experienced Producer/Editor?  If so, I'd like to find out how I can be a part of this awesome experiment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c77762e?context=5)|Thanks, however all six episodes are in the can... That being said -- if it becomes the kind of success I hope it will become, we'll be making more shows... At which point, we'll be staffing up again. Drop me a line at Thisvsthatshow@gmail.com.
[Pretend that your show was on a TV network -- what commercials/teasers would they show to reel me in? (sell me on this, hombre\). ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c774e9p?context=5)|Here's a promo for the series: [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nwfmCErgUo)

It's among my favorite material in the show.  
[You're skeptical about an overwhelming scientific consensus? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c7796fe?context=5)|No. I'm skeptical of a rush to judgement... and science that doesn't -- because it can't -- take into account temperature fluctuations that have happened historically -- because there is no record against which to compare.

Brad Sherwood is one of three hosts. He's terrific on the show. Very funny. Brad is one of the funniest people I know. We have worked together a number of times, and it has always been great.
[How does that differ from testing a ""myth"" as what Mythbusters does?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c7778km?context=5)|How one navigates through traffic does not fall under any of these definitions.

There's no myth about what is the best way to navigate through traffic. Here's the dictionary definition of Myth: a traditional or legendary story, usually concerning some being or hero or event, with or without a determinable basis of fact or a natural explanation, especially one that is concerned with deities or demigods and explains some practice, rite, or phenomenon of nature.

It elaborates on what is essentially fiction. Can a ninja walk on water? This vs That is about finding the truth in situations we all encounter in our actual, everyday lives. It ventures to scientifically test those situations where you find two (or more) decisions you could make... and proves which choice is better/faster. It provides people information to make better choices in their lives, better informed decisions. I hope that explains the difference to you.

And yes, the show is financed independently, and it's a show that uses science, along with the leading experts in their fields, to answer questions we've all considered... but had trouble finding the answers to. We had the good fortune to work along side scientists from the Fermi Lab, UCLA, USC among many others. I even met the guy who has the patent on stain resistant carpet. 
[Because he isnt doing things on *their terms*  aka, he didnt think of a creative way to make them think he wasnt self promoting.

The goal from the very beginning was to make something that people would immediately see spoke to them, in that it was ABOUT something they had considered, thought about, or talked with friends/family about... And to then show them the two decisions they could make about any given situation... and then prove, through science and with the help of experts, which was actually better. The point being -- that when people find themselves in these situations, they'll be better ""armed"" to make the right decisions for themselves, because they'll have some information that wasn't biased -- and has no agenda. That's why the show's motto is: No Bias. No Bullshit. Just science, fact and funny.
[This TV show already exists. It's called Mythbusters and it's wildly popular!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13tgdm/iama_the_creatorep_of_a_cool_new_6_hour_tv_series/c771gi9?context=5)|Actually, Mythbusters is a show about MYTHS. It's a show mostly about fiction. For example, Can a Ninja walk on water? I don't know any ninjas. And the answer to this question will not help my life in one bit. My series is about stuff we all run into every day, it's stuff we think about, and talk about with our friends. For example, what's the fastest way to navigate through traffic? Stay in your lane or weave in and out? What's the fastest way to board a plane?

I know this is a longshot and most likely a selfish cry for aid of some sort but im honestly just tired and cant handle the pressure anymore

Im just writing off the fly on whats on my mind so i apologize if im all over the place.

I am a 28 year old (28 in december) male currently living in Malmö (Sweden).
For as long as i can remember ive been shunned and an outcast as much in social life as in the job market.
Ive had a few internships that has led to like a christmas job where after i get the usual (we will be in touch if we need you), to never hear back and finding out they employ some other random person

Now im not really sure what or how things go around normally since my childhood was basically non-existent until the age of 14. Prior to that i was physically abused by my stepdad among other things (some i to this day try to just block away)

Ive been on medication for the few past years with a heavy depression. I have anxiety attacks constantly and on top of that insomnia.
What i have done to combat said things aside from medication. Is playing video games alot trying to get online friends. Not much luck there either to be fair with you

As for depression. I got pets. They cheer me up when they happy alot. And make me laugh, something i find myself rarely doing anymore or even smiling

Friends? non-existant. My 2 pet birds (one which i'll get to later) are my friends

Now im just trying to keep it short and this is where my cry of help comes

I earlier this year had a somewhat large sum of money saved up. Not much for maybe your average working man but for me it was alot.
In February month i wanted a friend for my bird so i bought him one. A cute one on top of that that sadly passed away a few months later due to an enlarged liver and her feces had blood. She basically passed away within a few hours after i noticed

And yes i did notice it earlier but with the +400% vet fee's (we're talking about at least 400-500 dollars just to see the vet since it was on a weekend) There was no way i could afford that. I had already spent roughly the same amount on her treatment a few weeks prior

Now i took that blow hard but i kept hoping maybe it was just her time despite her beeing young. I got another one and well. Its all going well until a few weeks back . It was due to her laying too many eggs  she got a weak bone structure and excess liquid and we sorted that out.

Now however she also got a small swelling on her liver and im just hoping that the same fate wont happen her.

Where is this all leading
Im not sure what ill do if i lose her, ive already tried to commit suicide twice before .

Im hoping this medication she will have for roughly a week more  can aid her but im low on money all together

For rent, for food, for her well-beeing and yes i place her above me. I love animals beyond anything

I can manage to survive on bread and water if it so helps her live

This is my main cry of help. Funds to help her. Or at least try to, knowing ive done all i can. Even if i have to sell all my possessions, not that it would revenue anything
I never in the past 10 years christmas or done anything special for my birthday. Cause i dont feel i deserve it. And even if i could id probally use it for my birds


And yes you may ask if wellfare exists , but they have also turned their back to things

Ive probally forgotten a few things that i really wanted to talk about and just talked about one thing, but all i know for me that little bird is worth to me than anything

Please Reddit
Help

**TL;DR**
Need help with vet costs, food, rent
Need a friend or two
Someone to talk to or ask for advice
Need a job

I'm graduating with a Computer Engineering degree in May, and I want to do web/software applications. I've been doing C# .NET business applications and web sites for a large insurance company as an intern for a couple years now and I really want to continue programming. I'm not too fond of the electrical engineering side of my degree. I've been offered a job at a computer consulting company doing a variety of applications/testing for clients, mostly other large companies. The offer is $50k/year with good benefits in Tennessee, a place with a very low cost of living. I like living here and haven't really considered relocating, though I know we're not exactly a technology hub.

My question is, some recent posts have said $50k is low, but it's hard to say where in the country they are or what exactly their skill set is. Is this good for my location and the job at hand? I feel like I'm middle of the road when it comes to my skills. I've performed better than most of my classmates but the thought of going to a Microsoft or Facebook programming test terrifies me. Am I doing myself a disservice by not moving to San Francisco and looking there right after graduation? I guess I just want some insight into the pros and cons of starting my career at a big insurance company or consulting company as opposed to something in silicon valley."

 I was just wondering if anyone could critique my personal statement for me! I understand it is still a little rough, but I still have two days before the deadline.

If anyone has any questions for me, I'll attempt to answer them, and if this goes well enough then I'll try to post my second one on here.

Thank you guys!

Here is the prompt: 
**What is your intended major? Discuss how your interest in the subject developed and describe
 any experience you have had in the field — such as volunteer work, internships and employment,
 participation in student organizations and activities — and what you have gained from your involvement.**

And here is my response: 

""My intended major is a bachelors of science in Computer Science. My father is a network engineer, 
and has been since i was born, and he was the origin of my interest in this field. Ever since I was a
 toddler, my father had kept me around computers, showing me games and taking me to his workplace to show 
me how the technological department of his job functions. He taught me the basics of troubleshooting with his office computers,
 he showed me the main server room for the Oakland (removed for personal reasons) office, and granted me a general 
knowledge of computer servers by the age of four. As I grew up, the involvement of my life with 
computer science has only grown. I never truly knew if I had any talent for the subject, until my junior 
year of high school. I took AP computer science with Java, and it changed me completely. I began to think 
with logic loops, and began to see how things could work if they were coded, basically it opened my eyes and
 realized that this is what I am good at. I began to find myself spending my free time writing programs and 
working on coding challenges I found online, such as Project Euler, where challenging mathematical and computer 
programming problems are given and you must solve them through with your own codes. I continue with this hobby 
today and I have been only getting better from my two most recent computer science courses, one involving C++ and
 the other MATLAB. I still think in the same manner, and it helps my decision making skills. I have never 
had difficulty learning anything related to computer science, and if an assignment is ever difficult, I do not see this 
as a burden, I see it as a challenge. My desire for knowledge of computer science is only growing, and because
 I enjoy this so much, I could see myself at a major company applying my passion and talent for this subject.""

13x6m6,5,2012-11-28,CGI Internship Interview Tomorrow- Need general or specific advice,theguyjb,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/13x6m6/cgi_internship_interview_tomorrow_need_general_or/,"
I have an interview for a programming internship with a company called [CGI](http://www.cgi.com). I do not know much about them. I connected with them via a job fair on my campus. After an extended discussion with one of their representatives, I gave them a resume, received a screener call, went through a few emails, and then landed an in-person interview. I would like any general advice possible, and have a few specific questions.

The interview is a two-hour interview with 3 people. One of them is an engineer, so I am sure I will have some coding/logic questions. I am not particularly worried about this part- they know where I am in school, and I believe I've done enough prep work to show I am beyond where my completed coursework would place me. I want more so to know how to deal with the other two interviews.

I am pretty personable and consider myself to be well spoken. My concern is that I do not know much about the company. Their website lists them as a consultancy group but fails to elaborate much further. During the job fair conversation, the representative mentioned much of their work is under NDAs and that he could not tell me much about any particular product. This makes it difficult for me to prepare for the obvious question of ""Why do you want to work here?"" Any suggestions here?

Also, though I don't expect to receive an offer tomorrow, I need to know what to do if it does happen. The internship would be over the summer of 2013. I have applied for several other internships that pay better and are more prestigious, but don't expect to hear from them until next year. Is there anyway to stall?

Finally, are there any other questions for which it would be vital for me to prepare? I think I have most of the obvious, typical interview questions covered. This is, however, my first coding interview, and would be my first programming position. I think it's likely I am a better candidate than they would be used to, considering the area, pay, and type of job, but I'd rather go in prepared than overconfident.

I am not sure if this is relevant, but I am fairly old for where I am in school. I am currently a Junior, and will be a Senior when this internships starts, and I am 29.

**TL;DR-** I have my first internship interview tomorrow, and would like to know what to have prepared.

Are there any tips/advice/suggestions for me?",kjl_nyc,NYCjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCjobs/comments/140pp3/i_graduated_in_may_2011_with_4_years_of/,"I'm 24 and as the title says, I graduated last May.  In 2007, I interned for the summer at a non-profit (the Fresh Air Fund) and continued to work for them during the summer of '09, '10 and '11 with my responsibilities increasing upon each return.  When my (paid) internship ended last August, I was optimistic about my chances of finding a job.  By last December, I was discouraged and afraid because I began my monthly payments for student loans in November- my savings won't last me forever.  So I contacted my boss, and he told me that I could return for the following season.  I started working there again this past  January, and my internship ended with an invitation to come back next year (2013).

I am grateful for the invitation, but really do need a full-time job.  I can't keep falling back to the position of an intern.  At this rate I will end up going back next year, which is fine, but I'm afraid of this becoming an endless cycle where I can't find a job and therefore go back to this seasonal internship which I cannot make a living out of.

**TL;DR Graduated a year and a half ago; still cannot find work and because of it, I keep returning to an internship that I began in 2007.  Am grateful that I have the internship to fall back on, but I cannot make a living out of this.  What more should I be doing?**

-------------------------------------------------------------

*To answer questions that I know may follow*:

**I got my BA in Sociology &amp; Anthropology at a liberal arts university in New Jersey.**  In retrospect, I wish that I had majored in something more practical (such as business or economics).  At that time, however, I knew that I enjoyed learning about people and had this crazy idea that I could do something to help- this is a big part of why this particular non-profit stood out to me so much.  It also would have been smarter to go to a state school due to the costs, but again, this was not something that occurred to me.  I just felt incredibly fortunate to be going to college.

**I know that it would have made sense for me to pursue a job as a social worker, but I did not want this**.  I considered it until my junior year of college.  I know that it can be satisfying work for some and that there is a lot of good in it, but I believe I would lack the necessary emotional detachment from the work itself.  This is somewhat irrelevant, but my family was also concerned because the work can be dangerous.  

**I have been looking for some sort of work as an administrative/office assistant** since this is a setting that I am familiar with.  I would like to expand my skills an include some sort of bookkeeping/record keeping and hopefully work my way up to something accounting-related, but of course the job market is competitive and employers can afford to increase their standards.  At entry level, the majority of positions want at least a year of experience in the specific field that you're applying for.  My best bet is then to apply for jobs that had similar job functions as my internship's and work my way up from there.

**I cannot afford to go to grad school right now**.  I have a pretty sizable loan to pay off and do not want to finish grad school, unemployed again with an even bigger loan hanging over my head.

**I have asked my boss to let me know if any full-time positions open up** which he said he would, but because the organization's programs take place during the summer, there is not a ton of work during off-season.

**The reason why I kept returning to this internship** was because I liked the full-time staff, the position is paid, and because I was working for a great cause.  I would read evaluations of experiences written by participants and actually tear up because they were so thankful.  Even if the work was boring, it was worth it.

**I will not work at a place such as McDonald's** because that would be a huge insult to my mother.  My father was laid off shortly after I started college and has been on disability since.  My mom worked incredibly hard to keep me in school, none of which I understood until after I graduated.  I know that this all makes me seem extremely ignorant/oblivious to the world, but my mom hid a lot of things from me while I was in school because she didn't want me to worry.  I asked her why she essentially didn't tell me anything about her problems- I could have transferred to a much cheaper state school.  She told me that it was because I was happy and seemed to have found a place where I belonged (I did extremely well in school).

**I know that many people have been out of work for longer than I have** but I am particularly desperate because I'm the only one of my sisters that is still living with my parents, we are under considerable financial strain, and I don't want my mom to bear this burden on her own.  She managed by herself while I was in college, and this is the best way that I can pay her back."

The offer is coming from somewhere that in general has the best benefits in the area for as large as it is beating out everything I've seen. I'm wondering if they undervalued my pay rate or if this is reasonable? I was expecting a bit more in the $72-75k range but I don't know if recent uncertainty with budget cuts in Congress maybe influenced the offers coming out of the defense industry?

I really like the work environment and I know first hand that the employee turn over rate is incredibly low. My understanding is offers here are not negotiable after talking to other recently hired employees as your pay is decided based on some formula they use internally."

What are some ways I could gain independant income?",slootem,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13zppo/reddit_i_get_paid_more_than_most_people_my_age/,"Reddit, I work at a top organization and get paid more than most people my age who have just finished university with a bachelor degree. Due to the stress I've developed panic attacks, chest pains, and migraines. I'm considering to leave, but what are some ways to gain independant income that I could try?

The situation:
After graduating uni my best friends dad got me hired at a top organization. Previously to that I was on the job market for a few months.  I wake up at 6am to get to work by 8:30am and I usually get home by 8pm if I'm lucky. My SO works in the same city where we live and have a dog. Before we got the dog we talked about my work schedule and how he'll need to take care of it in betwen his work schedule and I'll help out when home.

The problem:
My work is so stressful that even when I'm home I'm freaking out if something was done or not. I have NO work-life balance and constantly feel as if my brain is against me being that I can't stop thinking about work. Sometimes I can't even sleep.
 
My work is very interesting, but because there's so much to do I feel as though I can't concentrate completely on it being that there's other things that need to get done. My SO is tired being the only one to take care of the dog. I totally understand but at the same time what can I do? When I'm home I'm so tired from traveling and work that I just want to lounge or cuddle with him and the dog.

My position is for a term of 3 years. I have only been working there for 8 months. While working here I developed panic attacks, chest pain and migraines. If I can carry out my term I'll be set for my next career but lately I'm wondering if my sanity and health are worth it.

I constantly think of suicide as my only option out, but I don't think I could kill myself because I don't want to let my family down (my family is poor and I use my money to help pay for things they need). Instead of suicide I choose not to worry about my safety in various situations and look forward to something or someone randomly killing me.

If I leave this place I know I wont be getting paid no where near the same salary or benefits that I'm getting paid now. Aside from this place I have only had random internships. I like working with people and not behind a desk but I don't know what I can do that pays a decent salary and benefits that allow me to do such.

My questions to reddit:
Are these feelings normal? Is this how everyones career life feels like? 
What are some reliable ways to gain independent income if I was to leave this place?
What can I do to minimize my stress if I was to stay?
What are my life options in general?

I'm 19 and about a few months ago I was considering dropping out of college and applied to a web firm as a junior developer from off of Craigslist. I came in for an interview, did a simple GCD calculator, and sliced up a PSD. Then I backed out of quitting, got an internship and went back to college. 

Apparently the lead developer told them to call me back in because ""this is brilliant"" (my work). One of my best skills is that I'm quite fluent in backend and frontend. They argued back and forth about whether I was too busy or not and then they asked me to freelance. So here I am, freelancing at $35/hour with people and an atmosphere i love and working another programming internship at $15/hr which I absolutely hate. Right now I'm working on a project for a huge financial company worth billions. 

QUESTION: I love the fact that I can workout, go to school, hold another job, and work on my side startup while freelancing. If I list that I freelanced for X development agency, how hard / uncommon is it to land another job similar to this ? Basically, is it possible for me to freelance for another company at 19 like this or did I just get batshit lucky?"

I chose to become a teacher despite criticism about the ""challenge/worthiness"" of the major, warnings from past teachers about the current political environments, etc, because I felt so strongly about the purpose of education. Lately though, I just feel hopeless about this being my future.

My facilitators and university liaisons have given me great feedback after observations. I feel confident and comfortable in front of a classroom, have a good vibe with my students, and have been told that I'm ahead of the curve in terms of behavior management and instruction compared to other interns. 

The trouble is, it just doesn't feel rewarding. I can't figure out why. I love my students. I love having those ""ah-ha!"" moments with them when we're all in sync. But more and more I am frustrated with expectations from the district and administration (especially with the Common Core implementation) without having adequate support, and feeling like I've been thrown to the sharks in terms of all the ""professional"" expectations.... I come home and stare at stacks of homework to be graded and the data forms to be filled out and new tests they want administered...I'm at my wit's end trying to work with students that are still at a 2nd grade reading level and don't seem to respond to anything I try... I am trying to pull together a curriculum and (besides math) I feel like I'm just making it up as I go along. Even with successes, I don't feel like there is anyone to celebrate with me-- I may be excited, but I get the feeling back that it's not enough. Will anything ever be enough? 

I guess I feel like my old free-spirit has been quashed by the overload of expectations, time, and, honestly, loneliness. It hasn't affected my instruction or preparation yet-- I don't want my students to suffer because of my confusion, so I do my work and leave my personal life at the door-- but I'm scared that it will if I can't figure out a way to inject some new hope/energy.

Sorry this is so long. I tried explaining all of this to my boyfriend and while he was supportive, he doesn't completely understand why my emotions are so involved. I need advice from people in the field.

**TL;DR:** I'm feeling overwhelmed and unfulfilled about teaching and I'm hoping I can get some encouragement or advice to keep me going."

I hadn’t been aware of them, but it made enough sense. NoSleep, it’s been a long several months for me. Night terrors couldn’t be the worst result of this stress, yea? My brain has to cope with trauma somehow and thus far I hadn’t found many healthy methods to work through these things.

I watched as Joe made his tea and busied his eyes elsewhere. He wasn’t the kind to press or get into people’s business. “Bad dreams then, I guess. Shit, sorry, man. Not keeping you up, I hope?” He laughed and turned to face me and admitted the first night he woke up terrified, thinking something had happened. But when I didn’t answer him as he tapped on my bedroom door, and then found all the doors into the house were all locked, he realized that it couldn’t be us being robbed or anything. “Remember what I told you, when was it, sophomore year? Dude, you should really try that lucid dreaming my brother and I got into a while back. I mean, I know we talked about it for fun then, but it may help, you know?” I nodded absently and stood to grab a mug from the shelf and made myself some coffee. Well, most of what I put in it was coffee anyway. 


I know, maybe I was too dismissive, but that’s how life is. You suffer, your body suffers. Even my skin had been looking so awful that the rare day I didn’t have time for make-up in the morning I looked like a zombie. Couldn’t manage my senior thesis paper with my mind racing, couldn’t clean because I felt too lonely, and really couldn’t be lonely or I… well, didn’t handle that well. And went to ridiculous extremes to avoid those feelings that ended up biting me just as hard as facing it all head-on. Maybe this would be the control to turn that around.


 “Count my fingers, yea? And read signs?” Joe nodded to confirm as he reclined in the comfy reading chair in our living room. “You will usually have more than five per hand in the dream, but you have to make it a habit during the day or you won’t remember to count when you’re asleep. And signs will change each time you see them. Make that a habit, too. The first few times you’ll probably wake up when the lucidness sets in, but after that you’ll figure it out.”


So I did. I got ready for work very aware of my fingers as I put my shirt and blazer on, the posters in my room as I put my pants and boots on. I intern at a hospital and help substance abusers work their programs, and carry their burdens and join in their laughter and help prevent their failures. I thought with time it would get easier. It hadn’t yet. I get too attached. All through counseling that day, I was distracted from the patients by the signs on the wall, by the fingers folded into my palm. They told me about AA meeting I could go to and where church meetings were being held. There were always five fingers. Or ten if I kept counting. …three, four, five, si- “Hey, girly, wake up.” One of the guys from group called out his nickname for me and I smiled instinctively, like a porcupine raising its quills without a second thought. “I’m here!” The men and women of the group mostly smiled back, accepting that some days I really had more on my mind than helping them through their various addictions. I was just in training; their actual counselor was having no trouble without me, of course. The topic of the day was liver sclerosis and some of the men had been sharing their detox stories. I looked back to the hand out they’d been reading from and watched the picture of the hardened and swollen liver. It stayed a liver no matter how hard I stared. 


While group went on without me, my mind took to wandering, which can get dangerous if I don’t monitor what thoughts surface. Those thought… With all the training I had to help people, it wasn’t the easiest thing, but I’d finally broken down and started therapy of my own. Discussing with the school counselor all the things I wish I could divulge to my friends. But they’d turned into strangers lately, shadows of caricatures that couldn’t relate to anything I could share about myself.  Sometimes, the counseling felt fake, too, though. She was enormously sweet and supportive for everything I brought her. But I knew why she asked what she did, what her angle was when she divulged some of her own experiences. I knew these tactics because I used them all the time. 


“Wake up!” a car horn sounded over the profanities that followed the shout. Right. Driving. Oops. Without my consent, my head had apparently directed by body to drive my car out of the parking lot and straight into the wrong lane of traffic. I tapped ash piling up on my cigarette out of the window and realized I’d been like that recently, no head on my shoulders. My coping mechanism of repressing everything made for a terrible memory and slight ditzy-ness from time to time. As I righted my car and hit the breaks for the red light, I reached for my coffee that had been refilled twice since the morning then counted my fingers on the steering wheel until I finally made it home. 


I sat on the edge of my bed and began peeling off my jeans down to my boots. I’d put a La Dispute record on to add someone else to the room. Especially a man with his background noise, desperately yelling his stories. They enveloped my head enough to stay distracted. My thoughts were scattered as I unzipped the right boot and slid it off my foot until my eyes registered the muddy looking fabric of my jeans. I tossed the boot down, rushing to take the left one off, then my pant leg, but nothing was wrong there. Back to my right lower pant leg and I tried to continue pulling. Except that I was pulling off more than the fabric. My skin, covered in flaky blood, had started healing to my jeans with the scabs firmly interwoven. Like ripping a seam, the pants complained vocally as each cut was separated. I couldn’t tell what sections of my leg were scabs versus just dried blood except for the pain; it all looked like a disaster.


 From under the knee there were scratches dug into my skin, a few inches right of my shin bone, all the way down to just above the ankle. I sat, stunned, and let my fingers play with them, trying to understand that they were real. Pressing them open, scratching the edges a bit, and tracing the pattern the blood had taken as it was moved around by my pant leg. It stung so much. I guessed they had to be real. I wasn’t ready to admit it just yet though. My skin parted as I pulled the edges away from each other, peering inside myself a tiny bit. I checked my posters and got up to wash it off. Water and hydrogen peroxide applied, they had started to act up a bit, seeping tiny trails, but at least I could see them now, count them. About 8 truly deep cuts, and a collection of 11 much smaller ones. 


I can share pictures if you like, I made sure to document it after the shock ended. The rest of the night passed in enough of a blur as I tried to ignore what I must’ve done to myself. Three beers down and a glass of wine almost finished, I was hazy enough to lie down, alone, without panicking. I drifted off to sleep that night, pushing the worries of controlling my bad dreams as far out of my mind as possible. Then clarity hit me as my consciousness slipped away. I need to wake up… Maybe I’ve been screaming for other reasons.

14216p,1,2012-11-30,How to deal with lazy co-workers?,Kreeker,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/14216p/how_to_deal_with_lazy_coworkers/,"I'm an electrical engineer, and started my first professional job 5-7 months ago. I graduated Magna Cum Laude, but had to take a Quality Engineering job because I did not obtain any internships...

Anyway, of the Engineers at my company, Quality Engineers are probably the bottom of the totem pole. My company doesn't really deal with anything that is going to kill anyone, so I feel like people think we aren't that necessary.

My problem is that my fellow co-workers, specifically in my group, are lazy, and it pisses me off. The real problem is that another guy started around the same time I started, and my manager seems to group us as one unit. We are in the same lab, and sometimes work on the same type of product or work on a totally different one. The co-worker is a nice guy, but he is a time watcher and does not work hard at all. 

An example from today: He comes in 1 hour early to to leave 1 hour early. Today when I came in at the normal time he had not even started working yet.  I know this because he specifically made a comment about it, and I'm pretty sure he does this every day. Maybe I'm the minority, but when I come to work, I come to work. Am I the crazy one?

I honestly could care less if someone is lazy, but the fact that I'm considered a part of that person, I can't stand it.

I don't really know what I'm looking for from this post, but I just needed to vent...

141yy4,16,2012-11-30,Got an offer for the position as an SDET - but I want to be an SDE,ZZXXFS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/141yy4/got_an_offer_for_the_position_as_an_sdet_but_i/,"Hi!

I'm from Germany, I've got a BSc in CS from the [Technical University in Munich, Germany](http://www.tum.de/en/homepage/) and I did some internships in Germany and in Brazil.
One of my greatest wishes has been to work in the States; more specifically, in CA.


I finished my studies here in Germany and applied through Microsoft University Recruiting, passed a phone interview, and then passed four technical interviews on-site. Eventually, I was offered the full-time position as an SDET in WA. 


The job is paid very well and the benefits are very nice, too. However, I was playing with the idea of working and gaining experience as an SDE at MS for a couple of years - and then, eventually, to move to CA. My recruiter said that it'd be possible to switch roles (SDET -&gt; SDE) after **a few years**.


Now I'm not sure what to do. That's the closest I have ever been to making my dream of moving to the States come true, but at the same time, it feels like there's a serious catch.


* Once I switch roles after **a few years**, my experience in the new role (SDE) would be 0 years (Please correct me if I'm wrong!); so back to square 0, while I got older.
* Thus, I'd have to be with the same company for more than just a handful of years before I can change employers, places, roles (SDET -&gt; SDE). Otherwise, I can't say that I'd have long-term experience in the field I'm applying for (SDE)


I'm sure I want to be an SDE and I'm also sure that I'd do a great job as an SDET even though it's not the job I was looking for. Also, I'm willing to work very hard and to learn a lot.

I'm just not sure whether the additional lifetime I'd have to spend only to finally have the SDE role is worth it. I mean I could try my luck somewhere else, or I could do a masters here in the meantime, etc.


What are your thoughts on this? What would you do?"
141ui5,0,2012-11-30,How do I move on from a betrayal by friends that I've had since elementary school?,Rilmawen,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/141ui5/how_do_i_move_on_from_a_betrayal_by_friends_that/,"I'm at a loss, my friends who I've been friends with for years have stopped responding to my texts or calls.

If you must be honest (which I'm fine with), please don't be mean. I'm already hurt by this enough as it is.

To give a better idea of what's going on, my (former) best friend's fiancee hates me, because I said something to her that was misinterpreted to her fiancee. So for six months, he hasn't spoken to me. I have learned my lesson from that.

In June, another former best friend had her wedding, during the wedding everything was fine, but I made a mistake by attempting to talk to my other friend's fiancee. That caused him to get really mad at me and officially block me on facebook. It took another few months, but I was able to move on, or get to the point where I'm not filled with rage every time I think about the situation.

Fast forward to this fall. The friend who is engaged and I have seen each other a few times since September, maybe a handful. I've tried to text and/or call, trying to be understanding that she is extremely busy. I am too. Same thing with the other friend who just got married. Now both of them ignore me. On facebook, calls, wherever.

I tried to go out with another friend last weekend to catch up, who is friends with these two people. She is known for not being a very good friend, who is 'fake', in the sense that she pretends she's there for you and then really isn't. She told me that these other two ""friends"" don't really like me any more.

It's really upsetting, I've known two of them since elementary (the one I met last week to catch up I have known her since elementary school, but haven't spoken with her much, we ended up going different paths). But the other two we were very close. Now suddenly...nothing.

I realize that one just got married and is busy, but that doesn't mean she should ignore texts. These two friends (engaged and married ones) text a lot, so that they don't respond doesn't make sense. The engaged friend is also busy with work and an internship, but she still finds time to respond sometimes. She may be mad because I have attempted to reach out to her a bit too much, and now I'm trying to back off, but it hurts.

I don't know what to do anymore, because it seems to me, obviously they don't want to be friends with me. Beyond the engaged friends' fiancee being mad at me, we had hung out after that happened and everything was fine. Yet now...nothing.

I have never felt so betrayed before. I feel like I have no one to turn to, I mean as a friend. I have good parents and a wonderful boyfriend, and a few friends from college who have their own lives, but no one I can confide in as just a friend. I'm seeing a therapist for anxiety/depression, so me feeling this rotten about it may have something to do with that, but it still hurts.

My question is, how can I move on? I'm quite shy, so I have trouble being really open w/ new people for fear somewhat of judgement or that they won't like me.

I know this will be downvoted, but I could really use some advice from an objective person.

Also, my mother thinks these friends are stuck in high school related drama, which I agree. Maybe I need to grow up? I don't know.

I'm not in any self danger, just looking for advice.

Tl;dr Best friends forever no longer applies, looking for advice to move on.

141p8x,0,2012-11-30,"Despite having two internship offers I have had my eligibility revoked on the second to last day to receive an offer for NO GOOD REASON. How do I deal with this situation, Reddit?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/141p8x/despite_having_two_internship_offers_i_have_had/,"Alright, a recent string of events has led me to a really fucked up situation. I'll try to make the background information as quick as possible.

I'm a junior in physics. I transferred and between state budget cuts, rising tuition and undergraduate research positions already being filled I applied to a competitive internship program funded by a certain federal agency at a national lab across the United States.

After receiving an offer for a position before the internship began, I had reached out to one of the facilitators; we'll call her Emzara, and talked with her about the program. We had a relatively long conversation and she told me I sounded like a match for the particular city where the national lab was, and the university there as well. I hope this isn't too revealing? She also informed me that it was possible to apply for a second consecutive internship and that I should consider it.

To make a long story short; I had little programming experience prior to the internship, I was a little slow to get started but I picked it up quickly. My mentor wasn't very available nor approachable during my internship, and was also gone for various things about 1/4th of the 16 weeks, sometimes for multiple days in a row, but I was still expected to have results to show at a weekly meeting. I missed two out of 8, because you really can't make computers go any faster. I got a nasty email from him that was ""semi-motivational"" right before he went on vacation for an entire week. I tried emailing him my results and asking quick questions I had about what I was supposed to be doing (as I was not informed) and got no response...for a week. These constant vacations of his caused me to either have nothing to do, or be working ~60 hours a week.

Anyway, I had already reapplied for a second internship and we are 12 weeks in. I went and talked to the program facilitators about possibly reaching out to other mentors due to the lack of support/availability as well as the erratic schedule (and sometimes extremely long hours). The deadline to receive an offer was in two weeks. I went and met with a scientist, talked to him and he told me to email him and told me some people that I should email additionally. I emailed him and his suggestions and got back to work. This was right before Thanksgiving, unfortunate timing.

After my mentor got back his attitude towards me changed and he began being much more communicative, more helpful overall and a bit more encouraging. I feel like a mutual understanding was almost achieved. This continues, and this past Tuesday I go back to the program facilitators and tell them that despite reaching out to other mentors, I would stay with my current mentor as well. I was planning on emailing the other mentors to remind them after they had shaken off the food coma. 

When I explained this, the demeanor of Ezmara changed drastically, she raised her voice and told me that **1) that if that were to happen we would have to have a sit down meeting with her, her boss, my mentor, and myself** and **2) she would not have me manipulating the program and pitting mentors against each other**. I had done exactly as she told me to do! Nothing out of the realm of professionalism!  I was flabbergasted. She then proceeded to tell me to not speak with any possible mentors, that she now needed to discuss it with her boss and then proceeds to tell me to leave; that she would email me if there was any further information. Needless to say I booked it to let her cool down. 

I also received an offer from a mentor at this point, unrelated to the emails I sent out. However I was told explicitly NOT to speak to other possible mentors. I emailed her, and asked how the meeting went. She told me that she would contact me when she had further information. Then, today, I ask to meet with her and try to talk to her about what happened and she **denies saying what she said.**

I go back to my building and them am immediately emailed by the program head, asking to come meet her as soon as possible.

I get there and she explains to me that her and Colette met with my mentor and asked if what I had told them in confidence was true! With explicit details for fuck's sake! He didn't know how long I was working...he wasn't around nor responsive enough to figure it out!

So now, today...the fucking day before the offer deadline, this lady tells me I will not be placed for the spring...under any circumstance, and to go back to my home institution.

Problem is because I had an offer and everything was going fine, I missed the deadline to readmit to my home institution (as they drop you after two semesters ((Summer+Fall)). Now I cannot register for spring classes.

So, please Reddit, tell me what the fuck to do? I have in no way acted in an unprofessional manner, and have no idea why this is happening...
