bm3pi,7,2010-04-03,I don't know if I should be a computer science major anymore...,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bm3pi/i_dont_know_if_i_should_be_a_computer_science/,"Hey Reddit,

I'm nearing the end of my second year of my university career in computer science. I like it; the field is interesting, the pay is as I understand it great, but as I look for an internship online, I can't find any sort of internship that I can apply for because all I learned from my university was Java (I picked up C# on my own), and all these internships online want me to know PHP, Ajax, CSS, C++, SQL, etc...

How can I possibly compete? I didn't start programming until I went to college, and academic wise, I'm doing great (Deans honor list, Undergrad research). But as I look at the industry, I get a feeling of hopelessness like no other. I'm busy enough with academia as is; I can't possibly learn all those languages at the same time. Maybe computer science isn't for me. Maybe I should have gone down a more linear major, like Biology. 

I'm feeling pretty depressed and hopeless right now Reddit. Can anyone offer me some words of wisdom? I get the feeling the university doesn't prepare me for half the jobs out there. What's the point of getting an A in class anymore if I know I can't do anything with it later?"

I'm an undergrad in Computer Science and I realized that while taking an internship and non-major coursework I'm not really advancing much in CS, my first love.  I was wondering if any of you would like to get together and take an interesting text in a certain area (Algorithms, Machine Learning, Data Structures, etc. etc.) and go through it, getting together once or twice a week to discuss what we had gone over.  I was thinking 3-5 people myself, but perhaps if there is enough interest a few groups could be formed.

Just a thought.  Definitely comment here or send me a PM if you're interested."
bmvrz,0,2010-04-05,"I have a unique opportunity this summer, but I also have opportunities that would further my education/career.",Caked,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bmvrz/i_have_a_unique_opportunity_this_summer_but_i/,"Alright, first and foremost, I'm currently a Junior/Senior in the Mechanical Engineering field. I'm on my fourth year, and have been through several co-ops/internships without a semester off. Mind you, I'm not complaining, just setting up what situation I'm in for the rest of the story.

Essentially, the semester after high school, for my senior trip, I went to China. Now, a month before I left, I shattered my knee cap, so everything went wrong from the start. I arrived in China, and due to the nature of travel in China, walked close to 10 miles a day with a leg immobilizer on. Furthermore, before I left for China, I had apparently picked up Staph infection. I didn't realize until a few days into my trip, but essentially it forced me to come home early. But, I digress, this was not the reason for this post.

Onto the actual purpose of this post. The friend I initially went to China with has recently graduated, and has planned another trip for the summer to visit relatives. I have been working my ass off to make money for this trip, but just now, my parents have decided to 'sit down and talk with me' about my expenses. Currently, I have roughly $1500 sitting in the bank, and am continuing to work through this semester, while taking classes full-time, to try and make enough money to make this trip. My parents are worried that I'm going to be put in a bad situation with how much money I'd spend on the trip, and how little money I'd have when I got back.

While I understand their worry, my question is about the risk vs. the reward aspect. I currently have the opportunity to partake in an internship with an engineering firm nearby over the summer. While this would solve my money issues, it wouldn't necessarily be my 'preferred' option. Furthermore, I can continue to take classes and get closer to graduating which, while overall getting me closer to finishing school, would not be my 'preferred' course. My question is, am I deluded in thinking that I would be capable of going to China and have enough money to live off of when I get back, or should I take the internship/coop and just hope that I can return to China at a later time?

To summarize, I'm not generating very much income due to living expenses, school expenses, and the like. So, my parents are worried that I won't have enough money to live off of and all that when I return from China. 

Also, considering my money issues, would it be feasible to pick up a second job in between ending this semester and leaving for China to make enough money for the trip? Otherwise, would it be ok to take out 'student loans' to make the trip to China, or possibly put it on credit?

I know this is essentially not the ideal situation, but I always hear about how experiences are more valuable than materialistic items. And, being an engineer, I will most likely make more than enough money once I finish school to cover the credit/loans. Also, I've pretty much sold all the possessions I can feasibly get rid of.

Anyway, I would like everyone's opinion: Am I being hard-headed when considering my parent's opinion? Or, should I attempt to make the trip and just work my ass off to make the money?

Here is a link for a little more insight on what I went through over there and the link if anyone is interested. http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/az0q5/opportunity_to_go_to_china_but_in_need_of_another/

bnhhc,0,2010-04-07,I have no desire to finish college. Should I drop out or soldier on? Hear my story if you have the patience.,CollegeMan,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bnhhc/i_have_no_desire_to_finish_college_should_i_drop/,"I know, I know. It seems like the typical college kid who just doesn't work and has entitlement issues. That's not the case, at least I hope it's not. I'll find out soon enough.

I never wanted to go to ------- because it wasn't my dream school. I had no intention of going there, until I found out that going to the ---------- -- ----- would lead to an enormous pile of student loans and private loans. I calculated that it would take about 3-4 years at best to actually pay for them all. It was out of my grasp as my parents had bad credit and did not have the means to help me pay for college. They are financially stupid and ended up with credit card debt when I was a child. They improved, but made many mistakes afterwards. So, college savings were out of the question. I cried. Yes, I cried. It sounds pathetic. But, I waited all these painful (emotionally and mentally) years in high school to get screwed over by my lack of foresight.

Yes, I do admit that I'm grateful to live in a world power and not a destitute nation. However, to put the ""painful"" times in perspective, I was clinically depressed in sophomore year of high school and wanted to commit suicide. At the time the only thing stopping me from doing so was my fear of hell. I was a devout Christian at the time. I have been an atheist for some time and I will delve into it a bit later.

My parents told me take loans like everyone else and go to my dream school. But, I told them that I don't find it to be worthwhile in the end. After that harsh realization, I decided to go to ------- because of in-state tuition fees. I lost all the motivation I had for my senior high school classes because there was no point. My SAT scores and overall GPA were way ahead of the curve when comparing to admitted students at -------. Accordingly, I dropped most of my classes and was left with Psychology AP, Statistics AP, Health (requirement), English 4A, and a Study Hall because they did not want me to go out so early. I had late arrival and early dismissal. It was great compared to a full class schedule, but I hated most of my classes.

Admissions time came and I submitted my application after the regular preferred deadline. ------- had rolling admissions so I had a chance to get in even if it was late. I got admitted after a few months and they later sent a warning during the summer about my declining grades as a warning. They said that they made an exception. I think they just let me in because of my scores that were way above the upper percentile of students attending  -------. After all, my declining grades didn't make my GPA that low. The essay was the crappy generic type anyways.

So, after admittance, I was so reluctant to go through with it that I told my parents that I'd like to go to ------- during the spring semester. After all, I could get more financial aid if I sent it during the priority deadline and more aid from the school if I sent the application sooner as well. But, they weren't persuaded and my mother told me that I have to get out of the house. Hahahaha... I was not the prospective student that she predicted when I was in freshman year. She gave up on me years ago.

All of these were life lessons, yet they were mistakes made by my lack of planning. At the same time, I did not learn much from my college classes. My two philosophy courses taught me the proper structure of philosophical arguments yet failed to enlighten me upon new concepts that would lead me nearer to the objective truth. I had to learn about St. Thomas Aquinas which I learned by my independent research during my junior year of high school that bordered upon graduate school research. After all, I did buy the rare Wistar conference book, *The Mathematical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Interpretation of Evolution*, C.S. Lewis's *Mere Christianity*, and Richard Dawkins's *The God Delusion*. Both *The God Delusion* and *The Mathematical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Interpretation of Evolution* provided cogent points with C.S. Lewis providing absolutely subjective and weak arguments. I even researched about the other religions from Daoism and Vodun (Caribbean religion) to Doomsday cults and New Age movements which were espoused by Oprah years ago.

I did all this by myself. I did not need a bloody graduate course nor a repeat of everything I learned for my philosophy 101 course. I was dissatisfied already. The class finally moved on past these themes to newer ones like existential arguments, but they weren't based on science at all. Many famous philosophers did not know about current biology, psychology, physics, and other scientific fields that are essential to seeking the objective truth. They did not have access to it, so their arguments are flawed in that aspect. Studying the classic philosophers feels quite antiquated sometimes. It disgusts me. The blind acceptance of it all.

I tried to have intellectual discussions. But, I merely got irrational ramblings of local hispanic students that got in through affirmative action that argued that god must be real because the bible tells you so. I'm not kidding. I even have screenshots of these posts. It wasn't all that bad. I had some interesting discussions with a select few. But, I wanted more. I did not want the 3% who could think for themselves and remain rational. I wanted the 90%. I did not even have the 50%. I expected too much and it saddened me considerably at the time.

Yes, this was only in my intro courses for philosophy that had hundreds of students. I'm sure some were just too shy or apathetic, but I don't want to talk with apathetic people anyways. I also expected less shy people in college as well because there are more people which means there is a greater possibility of finding people like you. That generally leads to greater confidence outside of that social tribe.

The trend continued as I found out that I could learn the same material by myself through the assigned books instead of going to lectures with professors talking too slowly for my tastes. The braindead students didn't help either.

Now, I'm at the precipice of my stress. The place I hated for its greediness-- my hometown is actually welcoming compared to this city of --- ---------. I'm left with demotivation and disgust. Demotivation stems from the lack of mental stimulation from college for my maturing brain that is growing ever more rational. Disgust at the illegal immigrants who live here that get children for social security and spend all their money on wasteful things, such as cable TV, instead of planning for their children. The children suffer and most turn into their parents. The endless cycle of disgusting drudgery.

I just feel like it's not worth it at all. I had plans for my four years of college to get ready for an internship at a video game company. I've always wanted to work for the games industry since I was 13. I planned out potential mods and the portfolio. I would love more time for that instead of my boring classes, but then I would need to get employed at a dead-end job. My classes and financial aid provide me the time slots necessary for me to finish my portfolio in time. However, this boredom. This utter disappointment has left me with regret. I regret not going to my dream school where I would have chosen dorms. I regret not going to the spring semester. I regret not planning ahead. I regret it all.

What am I to do? I hate this place so much that I'm seriously considering moving to Alaska to temporarily join the Inuits. That sounds like a lot more fun and enticing than continuing my second year. I'm even considering the possibility of staying with some nomads in the desert regions. I just want out. I'm sick and tired of this place, this city, this absolute shameful place full of crack dealers, chain smokers that leech on social security, alcoholics who don't give a shit, hobos that stop cars in the road for their arrogant means, and the general student body at my college. What do I do? Do I soldier on? Do I take a break? I can't ask the psychological counselor here. They're here for freshman retention and not for my goals. What do I do? Experience is truly much more valuable than I thought given my mistakes I've made. I need some input. I need something from the objectively above-average (in terms of intelligence) community of Reddit. I just need something."
bqfwa,6,2010-04-13,I need advice for how to work in a large corporation,Sloloem,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bqfwa/i_need_advice_for_how_to_work_in_a_large/,"I graduated college in May 2009 with a degree in Information Technology, and was immediately offered a job doing software engineering for a large financial firm in Boston, Mass.  I've worked here since July and already the seer amount of bullshit bureaucracy I've been exposed due to the size of the corporation has almost reduced me to tears.  The layers within each silo, and the silos, and the retarded not-my-job mentality that's here is seriously impeding my ability to perform my work.  And for whatever reason I still deeply want to do my work.

Requests for access are done slowly, incorrectly, or never at all.  Problems are closed simply because they're being filed with the wrong group and they don't want to tell me who should take care of it.  Questions asked to people who are supposed to be my co-workers (though many of them are contractors and I'm full time) are answered as if I'm prying into closely guarded secrets, or threatening their jobs, or am just a complete fool.

And I have to ask people where to find things, because finding information here is also a full time job that can take several hours if not days.

And through all of it I have no idea where to go for help, because it's never anyone's job.  I'm frustrated at how difficult even simple tasks are here, and I have no idea who I can talk to about it because I have this overwhelming impression that the corporation simply just doesn't care.

The other companies I worked on full-time internships were small enough that I knew if I hit a brick wall I could eventually 6 Degrees of Separation my way to someone who'd have an idea how I could proceed...some other people I just haven't talked to.  But here I don't even know how to find that out, and the feeling of utter helplessness is depressing beyond belief.

I'm looking for any advice that reddit might have for how to work within a corporation this large and not feel so helpless when I need to depend on another person or group.  Or how to deal with it besides ""get jaded and stop doing work, point fingers when asked why work is not being done.""

tl;dr
Corporate America sucks, how do I deal with the despair of being a cog."

I can remember putting a gun to my head when I was in the 7th grade. I told myself that there is so much out there I can't do this yet. I kept telling myself you need to have sex. You need to love, live, and accomplish things.

If you saw me you'd think that guy has everything going for him (women, grades, money, looks), but inside I'm as poor as an Ethiopian baby. As I'm writing this I can't stop crying, a girl is coming over to spend the night in a half hour and shes probably gonna notice my eyes fuck. I have tons of friends, but I feel like none of them know me. They know me the super social intelligent guy, but they don't know me. I feel I've done a great job of hiding it and training myself into thinking all display of emotion (other than happiness) is weak. I feel like I've been depressed my entire life and in denial the whole time. In a way my intelligence is my downfall, I realized early on that being realistic about the world is negative as fuck because the world is fucked.

When I first started college I was pretty worried about failing out, which is probably why I succeeded. During my sophomore year I came pretty close to ending it, but told myself you have to finish what you start. The hardest thing for me has been living next to a 10 story parking garage, honestly I can't tell you how many times I've stood up there toes over the edge. Everyday I walk past it and it's the only thing I think about despite how much I try to immerse myself in studying or women or hobbies.

I'm a month away from graduation now. I've had plenty of internships, but I can't seem to find anyone to hire me. My plan right now is to go home for two weeks maximum. If I can't find anything by then I'm just going to leave, I can't stay there it's like hell in paradise. I feel, even with a great degree from a top 5 engineering school in the country, I still have no direction. I realized during my junior year I didn't want be an engineer anymore, but I knew I wanted that feeling of accomplishment. Some would say go to grad school, I can't handle anymore school.

I've done my fair share of drugs, experimenting when I can, trying to experience as much of life as possible and really that is all we have (our experiences). Right now I have pretty much zero serotonin in my system. I know my current manic depressive state is most likely caused by this and I'd love to blame it on this which I could easily rationalize any thoughts of wanting to die away, but I know I felt this way even before I ever started. I don't know why I'm fucking writing this.

If I can't find something to do by June, I'm going to hike the pacific crest trail. Part of me thinks this will be great for my psyche, my health, pretty much everything, but I know as I've been backpacking several times on my own that it is bitter sweet. When you're by yourself no one for miles and you're looking over a thousand foot cliff thinking what the fuck does it matter. At least in this place the animals will eat me and I won't get fucking embalmed. As much as I want to go, I feel like I won't make it out. Dieing alone in the middle of the woods has always seemed to me as the most peaceful way to go.

I'm not asking for help or to be talked out of anything. I just want someone to understand how I feel."

btvzp,97,2010-04-20,Stories I have heard at sea.,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/btvzp/stories_i_have_heard_at_sea/,"Hey gang,

In my previous post about a 'demon-possessed house and subsequent exorcism' I lived in as a kid, I alluded to the fact that I used to tell this story out at sea when I was bored on watch. As background, I am a warfare officer in the Australian Navy and I drive warships. The easiest way to describe my job is the person who pilots the ship for 4 hour shifts, and when the Captain walks onto the bridge, he often takes control of the ship off me, if he requests it. As such, I often have a team of about 3-4 on the bridge at any one time consisting of a helmsman (who physically drives and controls the engines on my behalf), a more senior 'quarter master' (QM...whose job is to make sure the admin of the bridge happens while i am busy navigating/talking to the operations room) and another junior warfare officer under training to learn my job, if we have a few of them onboard. 'Watches' are 4 hours long, with the usual rotation being 4 hours on, 8 hours off. As such, one of the most bemoaned watch rosters is being the person who gets the afternoon (12-4pm)-graveyard shift (Midnight-4am), also known in Navy slang as the 'Arvo and Guts Watch'. This watch is hated as it gives you the most broken sleep, as everyone onboard normally has to be up and about at 6:45am to start the day. I digress. 

What this means, is that if you are unlucky enough to get the midnight-4am watch, you need to stay awake. Being up on the bridge of a warship, you need to have everything dark so as to not ruin your night vision out the windows and into the sea beyond. 80% of the ship is asleep, and I personally enjoy the quiet 'downtime'. Weird conversations happen, and more often than not, people start talking about weird things that have happened to them. I will never forget the one night I was on a patrol boat in the middle of the Arafura Sea in northern Australia, and the story two of the sailors told me.

A patrol boat is smaller then normal warships, so I only had a helmsman on watch with me. We were hundreds of miles in the middle of the ocean, and were just having a coffee and a laugh while we sat in the dimly red-lit dark of the bridge, the muffled thrum of the ship's engines, the sound of our bow cutting through the dark water and the muted static of our VHF radio scanning empty channels being the only sounds. Every now and then the wind would pick up and you'd hear the howl before it deposited a thin spray of salt water into our bridge windows. Hopefully I have set the scene and made you feel what it is like to be in the middle of nowhere late at night.

One of the senior engineers had wandered up to the bridge for a coffee and he was sitting on the stairs that led up to the upper deck from the bridge, and I had just finished telling my story about our old house to the sailor on the helm, who was a bit freaked out! The helmsman then told me his story....and needless to say, it in turn freaked me out. And I generally like a good 'unexplained story'. His story really re-enforced my wariness of ouija boards/seances, as this was the prime factor behind the weirdness of the afore-mentioned house I lived in as a toddler. His story is as follows....

THE HOSPITAL SEANCE

To begin with, the sailor told me how before joining the Navy, he used to work as a wardsman at the Royal Brisbane Hospital in early 2001. He said it was a great place to work, with other young wardsmen for company, and as he put it 'heaps of hot young nurses.' A few of the girls were into seances and a few of them were living on the hospital grounds in accommodation while they did their internships. One of the girls suggested that one night they go into an abandoned ward and conduct a seance, because as anyone who works in a long-established hospital will tell you, they are normally hotbeds of weird activity. (My mother is a 30 year midwife and she has some things she said she can't explain...like mothers reporting a 'smiling, kindly old matron with a weird hat who came and checked on me in the middle of the night and patted my baby to sleep'...despite there only being 2 young nurses on that shift all night, but I again digress). Thinking it sounded like fun, he said yes, and a few nights later after work, a few of them (plus a few nurses he hadn't met before) all went up to the disused ward and set up the ouija board.

He said they started the seance and the glass started to move as they had 'apparently' contacted a spirit. He scoffed and thought it was a joke, as the glass was moving randomly with everyone putting a finger on it. Of course he thought that the others were moving the glass. He said someone was given a pen and a paper and told to scribe anything that happened. Little did he know that their innocent night was about to get really weird...

Apparently someone asked this spirit, 'What is your name?' The glass moved and spelled out 'N-I-G-E-L.' They all laughed and someone else asked, 'Are you Good or Evil?' (I have goosebumps as I type this) and the glass moved over to 'EVIL.' Still scoffing, the sailor said some other questions were asked, but they got back a lot of jibberish. Suddenly, about 2 mins later he said the glass started going absolutely nuts, and some people started goetting uneasy. Despite this, it seemed to be following a pattern so someone told the guy scribing to write down what the glass was moving to. He got something like the following, and slowly it started making words. Apparently it read, 'I-L-L-B-A-B-Y-C-A-S-S-I-K-I-L-L-B-A-B-Y-C-A.....'
After a few more repetitions the guy scribing went, 
'Kill baby Cassi.....oh, Cassi kill baby? What the hell does that mean??' (I joke you not here when I tell you this, the sailor telling me the story said this screwed/disturbed him for quite a while) One of the girls in the circle turned pale, held her hand to her mouth and ran from the room sobbing hysterically, like a wailing cry of utter terror. He said one of the guys went 'Haha what's up with her?'. 

One of the other nurses went outside to console her, and the story came back as such. The girl who ran outside confessed to the other girl that she had had a secret abortion 3 weeks prior after finding out she was pregnant. She told NO ONE about the abortion, not her parents, not even her own boyfriend. Her name? You guessed it, was Cassie. That pretty much wrapped up the night, and horrified, the rest of them finished the seance and swore never to do it again. 

After he finished telling me this, I was pretty freaked out, but the other older sailor (he was in his 40s) just sat there and said nothing, and drank his coffee. Trying to lighten the mood, I said 'that was a godo story, but what about you Chief (his rank), surely you have a good one you have heard?' I noticed he was looking really uncomfortable so being a great people manager/officer (lol), I decided to go for the jugular and shame him into telling it. 'C'mon chief, tell us!', I jibed. I probably should have left it there, but he decided to tell us. I don't know if it was true or not, but in hindsight, judging how reluctant he was to tell the two of us, and how freaked out he looked when he told us, it's inclined to make me think. I've included it below as I think this pot might run out of room..."

What do I do?,turtlesallthewaydown,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bvu3g/im_uncomfortable_around_my_moms_new_boyfriend/,"A few years ago, my mom got divorced from my dad (20 year marriage).  During the past few years she's concentrated mostly on her job, resulting in a lot of stress.  Just recently she's found a guy that seems just right for her.  He's of the same religion AND he's a genuinely good person who treats her like a lady.  He was happily married to his previous wife for her entire life, so he never was in any messy divorces.  Sounds perfect for her.

The only thing is, I really can't stand being around him.  My mom is constantly lecturing me on how wonderful this guy is.  He's teaching me some things about how to fix and maintain my car which is nice, but he also got me a very nice toolbox full of tools.  I was really uncomfortable about getting this big of a gift from somebody I barely know.  They're nice tools, but it seems that they're also a common talking point for my mom to show me how wonderful he is.

What's more, they spend a lot of time in the living room of the house together, reading the Bible, listening to music, talking quietly, and being lovey dovey.  I hear kissing noises occasionally and that is something I REALLY don't want to walk in on or even hear, so I sequester myself in my room and do homework until they go out or he leaves (which can be pretty late).  It sounds immature, but I know I want privacy with my girlfriend if we're being that quietly romantic.  This weekend he's been staying over in the guest bed, so he's been near-inescapable.  I can't just go hang out on campus until he leaves, because most places would close before he leaves.

I'm twenty years old.  The college I attend (I study Computer Science and Electrical Engineering) is near my home, so I decided to live at home so that I can save my internship money for a home for me and my girlfriend after college.  When I'm on internships I move a good 200 miles away and live in an apartment by myself, but otherwise I live at home.  I'd prefer not to move out on a whim (although if they did get married I would move out).  Moving out right now isn't an option anyway as I'm moving in a few weeks for an internship.  Getting a local apartment now would be a waste.

How can I improve my situation?"
