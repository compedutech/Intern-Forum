I am enrolled in an online MPH right now, while learning how to code at FreeCodeCamp.  Almost done with the Basic JavaScript projects, and I realize I like programming a lot more then medicine. 

Sleeping 4-5 hours a day, worrying about patients, having to work 80 hours a week, 36 hour shifts with no sleep, and doing something I hate has taken a toll on me.  I am 27 years old, but I look like I am in my mid 40's.  I have always been the IT person in the family, and enjoyed it.  A lot of my education was paid through scholarships, since I finished undergraduate and medical school with honors.  So I don't have to worry about student loans.  

I was wondering what's a fast-track path for someone that is hard-working to enter the path of IT or programming?

I'll be honest, my CV is horrible for anything outside of medicine.  I feel trapped in this field, and need something to break out of it.  My goal is to get a job for any position that leads to IT and eventually computer programming, even if it pays minimum wage in order to change the direction of my CV.  I have a BS Microbiology w/ Honors; a MD with Honors.  Currently in an MPH.  

My goal is to finish FCC, and study for A+.  Problem is that application season for medical internships starts in September, and positions start in July.  My goal is to to be competent in either programming or IT to get a job before then.  So that way I don't have to do Medicine.  Any help or guide will be highly appreciated.

Thanks!"

I'll give it to you straight, because I'm sure my demographics and dynamics are common here

-I'm a twenty-two year old man who left college about halfway through (my funding was severed due to a strained familial relationship, and I was unwilling to take out student loans).

-I've been completely supported financially by a very generous family member. I live frugally and I'm unable to save for incidentals and unexpected ""life occurrences."" I expect that I'm wearing his patience and generosity thin, which is understandable.

-Until very recently, I was living in a depressed part of Washington state, and was unable to find so much as a night-shift custodial position (hell, even Vector stood me up for an interview).

-I've spent the interim learning copywriting and (largely unsuccessfully) marketing my own freelance business. More recently, I worked as an unpaid intern for an HR startup; I left because they were unwilling to pay me.

-My girlfriend and I (she's the one thing I've got going for me) have moved back to my Upper Midwestern (it starts with an M) home city in the hopes of securing decent jobs. We've been here a month and she just received her first offer today. I dislike that I'm unable to feel much happiness for her and am actively resentful. 

I've had one interview for an entry-level writing position that I thought went rather well, however I saw the job re-posted on Craigslist today, so I take it that they're not going to bother replying to my ""thank you"" email.

I have an interview for another writing position next week; we shall see.

-I'm living at home (for the moment) and it's been difficult not to fall back into the trappings of a stagnant and resentful teenager.

-I've been utterly depressed about my joblessness and have lost the self-approval to exercise and have gained a shit ton of weight. I'm just starting to become active again and have cut down on the self-pity pizza.


I've come to the unfortunate conclusion that a lot of my problems are not any ""other"" or situational, but simply me. I'm doing my best to crawl out of the hole. So far, I've managed to get worms on my boots.

I'm looking for an outside assessment of my situation, and any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you."

The HR said the best they could offer is 18$/hr during the 2 weeks of training. Tho they didn't specify if I could ask for a raise after that.


Is this too low? I had a year of internship before this, at another local company, but they at least paid me 20 per hour. So I'm thinking of negotiating with them, but still I need your advice on this.


One of the reason I got this rate might be because I'm a F-1 student? They said this is a contract-to-hire role and that they will process my H1B early next year so that this could become a permanent role.
What should I do?

----------
A lil more details about my background: 

My GPA is 3.77. I currently live in Dallas and had 1 year of internship experience doing mobile app development. The position I got is actually MEAN stack developer. The company specializes in eCommerce development, and one of the new platforms they recently added to the service list uses the MEAN stack technology targeting small to medium size business. They actually just launched this earlier this month.

I did tell them I had experience with Node+Express while building an API server serving a React front-page app for a senior project. And also quite some exposure to JavaScript while using Appcelerator framework during my internship. "

This thread is posted **the first Friday of every month**.

This month's primary topic (you can still post about other things) - **Salary sharing threads**. These have been controversial in the past. Some people find them useful to gather information so they know where they stand. Others feel that they're detrimental to the sub, that they implicitly put too much emphasis on money, or that they set unrealistic expectations for some, or that the information in them is simply not useful. The state of things now is that the mods will post one for each of a handful of categories (intern, new grad, experienced dev) a couple times a year.

Possible things to discuss - Should these be allowed/are they useful? Should the mods be the only ones posting them? How frequently, how many categories? What should be the cutoff line between ""new grad"" and ""experienced"" (currently 1 year)?

There are good parts to the job, but it's not the daily work I enjoy.  They reimburse my college tuition, offer training I've taken advantage of, and the insurance is fantastic.  I had the chance to study and contribute to several different network projects, and loved having time to review deeper aspects of it.  For example one project was about how to defend against caller id spoofing, so I got to go through how the call is setup/torn down, how signaling works, protocols, etc. to understand how everything works together.  

I know they have internship programs &amp; other positions available, but every time I approach managers about any different positions they just shrug and point me to the company job site- they only know about the call center(s), maybe retail store environments, nothing technical.

I have had a couple of job leads working for satellite installation that I'll be following up on, but how do I handle this with my current employer?  If I was working a different position, especially one that suits my degree, this would make me a very happy employee.  I actually do like the company and don't want to burn any bridges, but I'm starting to very seriously consider other options.

One morning one of the users walks up to my desk:

&gt;Me: No problem, can you work on your old one for the time being?

&gt;User: Yeah sure, would like to have this one because of specs though

&gt;Me: I'll try to fix it and let you know.

The user leaves the office and I try the usual tapping, software to fix them and power cycles but no luck, the 3 or 4 pixels keep shining brights on a black screen. Mind you these pixels were not grouped. After a while, my manager walks up to me.

&gt;Manager: don't worry, this is all covered by our full warranty/insurance we have, anything that happens to that thing is covered. Even the idiot who closed his laptop last year with a pen between the keyboard and the screen, they just fixed it.

So I called IBM and tried to report the laptop broken with the dead pixels, and of course....this specific thing does not fall under warranty or insurance. Turns out the pixels were not grouped close enough, even though it was super annoying shining bright it was not a defect according to IBM. 

So I hang up and start to tell my Manager:
&gt;Me: So, manager, this is not covered by any waranty, should I just give it back to the user

&gt;Manager: No give it to me.

So I proceed to give the notebook to him and then he opens it....


**SLAM!!**

He just smashed the screen on the corner of the table with such force that it proceeds to crack the entire screen.

He walks back to my desk, throws the notebook on it and with the most deadpan look in his eyes tells me:

Please help me, I'm in a time of great need, please be patient, I know it's a long post.  :)


My name is Frank, and I'm a rising senior studying marketing, and I would really love to have a fall 2016 internship relating to business/marketing at one of the largest sports media/broadcasting companies in the world. They are actually in my hometown, and I've interned there last fall but not in marketing, but in something unrelated to my major (tech services). 

At the time it was hard to network there, and I wasn't able to make most of the opportunity, which is really sad. 

I applied there every season so far, but no response from the hiring department, even though I feel I left that internship a year ago on a good note. 

This fall, I'm applying there again but in marketing or business. I don't have any corporate sports marketing experience, just that previous internship at the company. I have been working at a small construction firm on the marketing/business side. I also interned at a small event marketing company for a few weeks, but it was not a good experience for me. Besides those three irrelevant experiences, I have some relevant coursework and a couple of activities on my resume which could just slightly help. 


The Main Point: I'm super passionate about working there, I want to learn, and I would try my absolute best at the internship if I got it. So many other applicants have better experience than me, so how can I stand out from the rest, and at least give my self a shot at being looked at? 

I cannot imagine myself working anywhere else. I feel everyone writes on their resume that this is their ideal company, and they're ""passionate"" but is there anything I can write on my cover letter or resume which would help me get an internship there? 

I'm a friendly guy, who's eager to learn, and very driven, it's just been hard finding relevant experience to put on a resume, that's the only thing that hurts me. 


Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. I'm putting all my effort on this internship.

I graduated with a shitty GPA (2.9), due to dicking around a lot in school and not really knowing what I wanted to do. I leave my GPA off my resume, have gotten quite a few interview offers, and have never been asked about it. Last summer, I managed to land an internship at a top hedge fund because of connections. I did retail during the summer between my soph/jr years, and worked as a lab assistant in a pharmaceutical company during my fresh/soph year summer. I took some computer science courses, and consider myself to be pretty decent in Python and Excel (esp because my project at the hedge fund was done in Excel). I also started learning SQL on my own a couple months ago.

Right now, I've been applying to a lot of different types of jobs. Have gotten around a dozen interviews so far, but no offers. I think a big problem is, I don't really know what kind of career I want to get into.

I managed to find some helpful responses, but there are other matters I'd appreciate getting to feedback on.

I'm 25 and wrapping up getting my master's degree in applied mathematics and have gained an interest in becoming a data analyst or similarly titled professions, but have no real familiarity with data science courses. I've seen many data analyst positions available though often times they ask for several years experience of which I have none of at the moment. 

My plan is to learn Python, SQL, and familiarize myself with a more statistical approach to Excel, then look for internships prior to getting a job being that it doesn't look likely like I can obtain a job without some experience. I have taken three statistics courses as an undergraduate, though none of which were calculus-based (not sure how greatly this matters). I will be using a textbook to study on my own time that involves Python applied to data science to see how a programming language is used in this context. I'm also still debating whether or not I should learn R. Some people seem to say Python is better or just learning one of the two languages is really all thats necessary. 

This being my situation, I'm wondering if there are other things people might recommend I do or other suggestions that they may have that I've not included. Admittedly, I feel like I didn't get a jump on this quicker and that being 25 is a bit late to just be starting off. Also, thank you for taking the time to read this.

But I am also *very* passionate about traveling, and I want to start my career abroad. So a while after graduating I went to Brazil to find my first job there (already lived there 1 year during my studies and loved it), but I haven't found anything yet and my visa will expire soon.

The idea of going back to my country is a bit heart-breaking and I was preparing myself to it, but I got an offer for a job that might be interesting but I don't really feel it. (I'm more of a C/C++ guy, and the job is about managing a big system in Visual Basic, with some SQL.

So I think the best choice would be to refuse it and to find something better in Europe, but I'd like to have some inputs about it.

I'm going to try to keep this as brief as possible.

A friend I went to school with whom got a Bachelors in Political Science  and then a Masters in Criminal Justice.  She got the masters at around 26 or so.  

Great, but not so great.

Since then until now (Aged 31) she had (2) internships that pretty much dealt with NOTHING she went to school for besides the name on the door of the building. And they were 6-months each. 

She has put in like over a thousand applications all these years.  She has talked to recruiters, hired resume tweakers and the whole nine yards.  Only as of recent has she gotten a promising interview that's not dealing with her degree but pays well for someone who has a Masters and she's going through the long process with that, to potentially get hired.

She has no criminal record or even a traffic ticket.  She is a stunning looking woman, gpa was 3.9 I believe for her Masters.  She hasn't participated in any extra-curricular activities as far as I know while at university.  Her job market is Illinois.  And yes, she has applied to many paths outside of hers but literally no one bites. No call backs, no emails, nothing.  Ever...

I've given her all the advice I could give her from someone who has always been employed with no issue at all (Computer Science).

Could any of you provide any real world tips?  Advice?  Know how?  I will be e-mailing her this thread once it gets some traction."

I'm planning also to take at least CFA level 1 in-order to be fully prepared in terms of theory for financial field.
What is your thoughts?"

I just graduated college (in FL) with a public relations degree and knew I'd be spending the summer helping my grandfather in Illinois. A lot of free time ahead, so I approached a PR firm back in March inquiring about a internship.

The owner emailed me back within 12 hours and agreed, saying she’d even find place in their budget to pay me. We agreed to do a “trial run” by me writing an unpaid feature article. It would be published in a local feature magazine. I emailed her the article and even sent two follow-up emails. She went from emailing me back within the hour to never hearing from her again. She did not confirm she received the article let alone notify me if it would be published. 

In May I found out that she had indeed published my article. She made edits to the piece without running it by me, which violates the writer-editor relationship. The biggest issue was she did not properly credit me. We agreed that I would have a byline and instead she threw my name into the opening paragraph. In the journalism world, her edit names me as a source of information for the article, not the writer. Not to mention this was not what we agreed upon. 

I reached out to a former mentor for advice. He is an advertising professional and “called out” the woman on Twitter. She immediately emailed me – twice—that day. She begged me to keep the matter between us, blaming personal matters, like pregnancy complications, for her lack of communication.

I thoroughly explained why I was upset and asked her for $250 compensation and to rerun my article with the proper byline. She said she was not going to rerun the article, and would send the $250 when I sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  The NDA held me responsible not only for my own actions but those of my “friends, family members, and professional or educational associates.” There were multiple legal bindings I did not feel comfortable with, so I told her I would not be signing the agreement.

At this point she became less and less reasonable. Her responses took longer and she had yet to even apologize or acknowledge that she had done anything wrong. In attempt for her to take me seriously, I threatened to walk away from the deal and “go to the media” with our story. She's currently nominated for a local award and I politely mentioned that this award would make an excellent angle.

I heard back from her lawyer who politely threatened me with a defamation case if I went public with my story (side note: being a recent grad, I just took an extensive mass communications law class, I know my rights the defamation threat doesn't scare me). I asked him to reword the agreement and listed specific items I to change. He reworded one phrase, which I believe hurts me rather than helps. His last response was that the NDA as-is would be their final offer. I am VERY hesitant to go any further without professional legal advice. I know I have done absolutely nothing wrong so far, but the way they're treating me somehow makes HER seem like the victim

So what are my options? I'm not opposed to signing something, but definitely not what they've given me. 

I've been published 50+ times in print, online, etc. and I've NEVER had an editor simply drop me cold. It makes me suspicious that she's done this before...

Obviously her #1 priority is to protect her reputation. On one hand I'd like to ruin that by telling local media about what's happened. But on the other hand, I'd like to get some money out of this and never have to deal with it again.

Basically, after the first year of engineering school and experiencing how most engineering students live. Which is at a very high stress level where sleep, physical health, and personal relationships often suffer. I dialed it down to about 9-10 credits a semester. This way I am able to hold down a part time job, exercise regularly, keep my personal relationships together, and have uncompromised sleep. This works a lot better for me, its a more balanced and much healthier lifestyle, and my GPA is holding steady at around a 3.55

The thing is that my mother, don't seem understand that a STEM degree is a lot more work than the bullshit communications degree that she got thirty years ago. It's turned into a pretty consistent nagging.

I mean, my work life is going to be extremely long and there are far worse things than graduating at 23 with a good GPA and multiple internships under my belt. I'd rather take the extra year and a half, then go around stressed and feeling like shit all of the time. "

Though it isn't very famous since it's only 20 years old.  
  
My GPA, however, is at 2.4/4.3. I had serious trouble with math and procrastination, which was my fault. (For context, the average grade here is 2.7, which is a B-) 
  
I do however, maintain a keen interest in software engineering, learning what I can online. As a result, I've been lucky to have two internships under my belt.  
  
As a result of my GPA though, I've only been able to apply to startups since big companies tend to ask for transcripts and only hire 3.0+.  
  
I'm currently happy with the work environment at my summer internship, and I wouldn't mind working at a place like this for a while after graduation.  
  
My parents, however, in typical Asian fashion think I'm worthless unless I'm working at a Fortune 500 or something along those lines. They're also very keen on me getting a Master's in the US and finding a job there ASAP.  
  
Personally, given my bachelors' experience, my GPA, and my interest in learning self-paced online, I feel like I should spend a couple of years exploring CS topics on my own while gaining work experience before nailing down a few to study further with a masters'.  
  
My questions:  
  
1) Is my plan sound? Specifically, is there hope in being able to find at least an average masters' programme with that GPA few years down the line?  
  
2) What does career progression look like for people who've mostly worked at startups? I ask this because most people at startups I've worked at started their careers at or previously worked at big companies. Will I be missing out on a lot?

I've been thinking about moving to Canada for a while now, and I feel like now is the time to do it.
Ive been looking around on this sub and on http://www.cic.gc.ca/ and it seems a lot harder than I originally thought. I have always been hearing about french people going to Canada after they finish their studies, but from what I can tell it is not that simple. I did the eligibility test for the express entry and the other programs and I am apparently not eligible for anything, unless I find a job in Canada before applying. Is it really the only option or did I miss something?

I will in a few month have a engineering degree in computer science, I just need to finish my internship. The company in which I'm doing my internship is offering me a permanent contract afterwards, so going to Canada would make me refuse a job offer in France, which makes the decision quite a bit harder :p (even though it's wouldn't be that hard for me to find another job in France if I really needed to)

I have also read about the Working Holiday Visa, but from what I understand there is no way to stay after the visa expires, so I would have to go back to France (and Canada doesn't seem like a country I would want to leave :p)

Feel free to ask questions if I missed anything, but I'd greatly appreciate your help :)"

I've always had high aspirations for myself--I've always wanted to become a doctor. Due to financial circumstances, lack of proper immigration status, and an inability to get the prerequisite coursework, I chose to get a degree in political science hoping to pursue law school (this decision was made 2009-2011). 

My last year at UCLA (2014), I decided that law school debt and employment opportunities were out of kilter. Loans too high for expected employment. I graduated with a 3.6 (A-), which is not shabby but not too great. I floundered for a year, thinking that I'd take up medical school. But poor family and financial situation really stopped that goal in 2015 Fall. 

I only have work experience in min wage jobs. The one internship that I did start lasted two weeks when I realized I wanted to pursue something else. I was too immature to realize that I should've held on to it. Now it's a black mark on my resume. 

Meanwhile my peers are doing pretty well. It took them a while to find jobs, but they're in entry-level positions. They make enough where there lives are exciting. 

I don't have any passion anymore. I wanted to medicine or law and it made me want to study, want to achieve. I don't feel like working elsewhere...and I don't think any entry-level position would really hire me. I've always been shot down. 

How do I stop comparing myself to my peers? At this rate, the age  when I will most likely achieve financial independence will be early to mid-30s. What cripples me more is my lack of romantic relationships; my peers are getting married, but I can't find someone who finds me stable enough to really get serious with. 

I just needed to vent. Thanks reddit. "

Next year, I will focus on computational physics and try for an internship.

After my B.Tech in computer science, I plan to do my M.Tech in computational sciences. With this I will go for my PhD. I want to work for CERN or IceCube. So finally my questions arise.

Is this path fine till my PhD program?
Should I leave bioinformatics behind and only concentrate in computational physics?
Also should I spend some time on parallel and high performance computing?

I am 20 years old, and currently half way through my Junior year at a State University, dual majoring in Accounting and Finance. I transferred to this State School from Community College. I live near the Pittsburgh area.

Due to me transferring in from Community College (Some items didn't transfer the way I wanted them to) and deciding to dual major, I will have to earn 134 credits to earn both of my degrees (which also means me taking extra classes during the semester and a summer/winter class). One of the requirements for testing into the Certified Public Accounting Certification is that the applicant has 150 credits from an accredited college, as well as a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting. In order to reach this 150 credit requirement I will need 16 more credits. That is another semesters worth and totally doable for me. However I am unsure of how I should do this since I have two options. I am expecting to graduate in December of 2017 (I took summer classes last year) and do one of these two options (or another if you guys suggest something smarter) in the Spring of 2018.

1. Take easy classes and use my internship job (which I can convert into credits) to fill in the 16 credits. (I used this internship for 3 credits last semester, I should be able to suck out 12 more credit hours from this job and take two other easy classes to fill the requirement). This would be more profitable for me in the short-run as my internship is paid for so I could place the money into my student loans.

2. Minor in Computer Science OR Information Systems. This option would mean that I have Bachelors Degrees in Accounting and Finance as well as a Minor in Computer Science or Information Systems (muh STEM). I would only wish to do this if it meant better employment opportunities and salary in the long run. Doing either minor would take 18 credits, and would most likely kick my ass due to work load. So if it wouldn't help my job prospect in any way I do not wish to do it. Also if this is the better option, which minor should I take?

I have considered a Master's Degree in Accounting but after realizing I needed only 16 extra credits for the CPA exam I wish to take this other path instead. If worse came to worse I could go for a Masters Degree in the future and hopefully with aid from my workplace. I was also told that in more fields of Accounting than not CPA &gt; Masters.

My loan debt is expected to be ≤$20,000, all Federal so that shouldn't cause any issues either."

I've been thinking about posting this for a while. Probably going to be long, but I've got time.

The year was 2010. I had just graduated from a prestigious private high school with 3.8 GPA and a 32 ACT. 

I was admitted to the local state university honors program for biomedical engineering on full scholarship. Because of the excess funds, I was actually being paid to attend school.

I was madly in love with my very first girlfriend.

I began my freshmen year of college with the firm conviction that I was on the right path. 

Little did I know that the world was just waiting to shit profusely on my life. 

In December of that year just before finals, my phone rang and it changed my life.

It was my mom.

""Ring ring""

""Hello""

""7412, I need you to pick up your sister from school.""

""Mom, I'm 30 minutes away and I'm kind of in the middle of some...""

""7412, I NEED YOU TO GO GET YOUR SISTER AND MEET ME AT THE HOSPITAL. ITS DAD. HE'S HURT. ITS BAD.""

""... What? What happened? Is dad ok?""

""No time, just go get your sister and meet me at the hospital.""

Click

I remember siting there for a few moments trying to process what had just happened. Then I grabbed my keys and ran to my car.

The next hour or so is a blur I don't really remember. Got in the car, hauled ass to my sister's school. Told her what mom had said. Hauled ass to hospital.

When we got to the hospital, my mom was just sitting in the lobby crying. 

""Mom! WTF is going on? Where's dad.""

""He's in surgery... There was some kind of accident at work... I don't know...""

The next few days were the worst of my life. For the first 24 hours at the hospital, the only thing I knew was that my dad was is surgery and the doctors weren't sure if he was going to make it. The following details, I found out later.

My dad was a forklift operator. While driving, he ran over an uneven surface. The forklift tipped. Dad reached out with his hand to try and catch himself. The forklift cage crushed his arm.

Dad laid on the ground bleeding out until on his coworkers found him. Dad told him to go get help. The coworker... panicked. He just ran off. Didn't call 911. Didn't go get help. Just fucking took off.

Dad was able to get out his belt and use it as a turniquet. They found him passed out with the belt looped around his arm. His jaws were locked around the end.

They were able to save Dad's life... but not his hand.

His left arm was amputated from just above the wrist on down.

The next couple years were hard. 

Dad had horrible mood swings, was on god knows how many drugs for the constant pain, and had 100+ surgeries. 

I stopped caring about school. 

My grades tanked. 

Lost my scholarships.

Put on academic probation.

My girlfriend dumped me.

I had to pick up a job since my dad couldn't work. 

Because of the mood swings, my relationship with my father became incredibly strained. 

He hasn't been the same person since the accident. Who would have figured?

There's a lot more but I'd like to hurry up and get to the good stuff.

Lets just bullet point shit

Bad Stuff

* Academic probation twice

*  Dad disowned me

* Multiple attempts to get back with GF led to no good for anyone

* Sister attempted suicide

* Other bad shit

Good Stuff

* Landed an internship with a shitty company, for shitty pay, with shitty people

* Shitty internship led to awesome Co-op with pretty cool people

* Awesome Co-op led to better internship 

* Better internship led to several job offers before graduation

* Graduated college with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in May

* Accepted a job offer and starting working in June

* Made up with my Dad (So much more to this, but I doubt anyone wants to hear the sordid details)

* Sister is in a much better place mentally

* Dad is too

* I'm now engaged to an awesome woman

Moral of the story

Bad shit happens

Never give up

All the late nights in the library are worth it


Edit 7.3.16 

Thank you all for your kind words. I posted this hoping to encourage the lurkers out there that anything is possible if you work hard enough.

A low GPA is not the end of the world. 

I graduated with a 2.4 overall GPA.

I had three job offers the December before I graduated.

As best I can tell, the hierarchy of truly important things goes like this.

1. Are you personable? Can you talk to people and make them feel like you've been friends for years?

2. Do you have experience in a semi related field? 

3. Do you have ""Good Grades"" in a related degree.

Hopefully you can answer yes to all three. If not, two of three is usually sufficient. If you answered no to any of these, don't worry. They're all fixable. 

* You can learn to be personable. Just smiling and being friendly goes a long way towards getting people to like you. 

* Have you read How to Win Friends and Influence People? Read it

* You CAN get an internship no matter what. I got my first internship by being prepared. The summer between my 2nd and 3rd year of undergrad, I was in another state visiting family. It was the middle of June. I got an alert on my phone that there was job posting to my school's job board. I immediately checked the board. It was a manufacturing facility looking for engineering interns! I called the listed number and spoke with the HR rep for a few minutes. Sent him my resume. 

* I got that job for three reasons. 

1. I was prepared. I sent my resume in literally minutes after the job was posted.
2. 5 people had turned it down before they hired me because it was shitty pay in a shitty environment with a long commute. 
3. I was willing to do what other people wouldn't.

* That internship led to a co-op, a different internship, and a job offer

* My last internship, I was so broke that I moved to the location with just what would fit in my car. I slept on the ground of my rented ""house"" until I could afford an air mattress.

So while I graduated school with about 40k of debt instead of 0, I still graduated. I truly believe that if I can do it, so can you. 

I'm writing this for you. For the guy/girl that is barely passing. The person that is scraping by. You CAN do this. 

Know one thing. There is nothing in life you cannot do if you refuse to quit. Nothing.

Since this apartment is rent-controlled it is much, much cheaper than comparable apartments and it makes financial sense for me to keep paying rent here rather than finding a new apartment at the end of the co-op.

I had not even intended to inform the landlord of this right now, but another tenant of the building (an old friend of my mother's who cares about me a great deal) threw a little party to congratulate me. The landlord came around to do something and someone told him about my co-op and that it's in another state (this person meant no harm and thought the landlord would be happy for me). 

The landlord in turn asked if I expect to keep living here after that, and I said I did, but he said that if I am no longer staying in the apartment after 30 days he can consider it abandoned even if I have already paid rent and still have items inside. He told me that he's happy for me but that 'financially' he's forced to not allow me to keep the apartment in these circumstances.

I would appreciate any info/advice. I am hoping I can get legal help through my university but I am not sure how much help or what that will entail, so I would appreciate any knowledge anyone can offer. Thank you."

4r0qik,10,2016-07-03,CS Internship Question: Team not contributing equally to project workload. What can I do about this?,Blawdfire,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4r0qik/cs_internship_question_team_not_contributing/,"Hey all,

As the title said, I'm currently working on a small team of interns on database design and a web-based CRM app. Thus far the workload shared has been incredibly disproportionate - peaking last Wednesday when, after meeting to discuss our next steps and outline *specifically* what needed to be done for the rest of the week, I completed all but one or two of the tasks on our itemized list of ~15-20 while they played various games and chatted around.

Our chemistry as a team (on a personal level) is pretty solid and I hate to be the guy to kill the fun, so it's hard to take a stand and tell them to stop dicking around and actually contribute. What makes it harder is that some of them are openly accepting of just how little they do, meaning that even if I do take a stand it's entirely likely that nothing will change. I'm afraid that, if this continues, the project will fall short of our goals and that will reflect poorly on everyone involved.

I have a midterm review on Tuesday - a one-on-one with my manager. I'm thinking this is a strong opportunity to bring this issue up and hopefully get some sort of resolution kicked into gear. However, I really don't want to come across as a ""tattle-tale"", nor do I want it to appear as if I'm throwing my team under the bus.

Is talking it over with my manager the right decision here, or should I go directly through my team first?  Is there another option here that I should be considering?

Thanks in advance for any input, I really feel like I'm in a bind here."
4r0wzb,45,2016-07-03,surgery underway,rubiesintheskies,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4r0wzb/surgery_underway/,"I finished med school this past month and through some colleagues I have made my way into rounds, no time off for a vacation. Just the need to dive right into work. I've been interning in the OR for about two weeks now, working 36 hour shifts with 12 hours of rest in between each. After a while the lack of sleep, food, and sunlight start driving you to the brink of insanity which is why I thought nothing of the events that happened two nights ago. I attributed everything to a stressed out mind but I'm not sure if that's all there is to it anymore. 

The majority of the time the OR is a hustle and bustle of moving bodies with a constant flow of patients, hospital staff and gurneys coming in and out. Those days are the toughest, especially on your feet. There are other days where the pace seems to slow down and we get a breather. The doctors bring in residents from other specialties and we're off the hook from operating though we still need to make rounds. Then come the days of legend: Dead days. That's what the other residents call them. Once in a blue moon the operating rooms are empty and we have no scheduled surgeries just an occasional emergency but even that's rare since most emergencies usually need stitches and a tetanus shot. 

Two nights ago was one of those days. Everything stopped moving around 10:43 pm. The hospital had fallen into a sleepy lull. There were eight of us in total that night: 2 floor doctors, 2 nurses, 2 residents, and 2 interns. Most of us had been up for more than 18 hours at that point and were just begging for somebody to show up and help us fight the boredom that had taken residence in the first floor of the hospital. We all chatted for a while or checked our phones and if things really got boring we did some paperwork. By 12 Dr. Smith (with holding name for obvious reasons) said he'd had enough for today and if anything came up we should get him from the break room. We all nodded and watched him go out the doors into the hallway. Soon after the nurses followed saying they needed to go out for a smoke. ""You'll be fine without us for a few minutes right?"" ""Sure thing, have one for me too."" Jen, my intern companion had quit smoking a few months back and she'd always say that the hospital made her want to start again. 

Now it was down to us three to man the fort. Jen, Dr. Joe and me. 

Not more than fifteen minutes had passed when it started. Being the one closest to the door that lead to the operating rooms I heard it first. One of the swinging doors had opened. I looked away from my phone and towards the sound. ""Hey Jen, did you hear that?"" I asked. ""Huh?"" she said as she pulled out a headphone. ""What? Sorry."" ""Just now, there was a sound."" ""I didn't hear anything...obviously,"" she smirked and put her headphone back in. Dr. Joe was in the cubicle away from the desk and it seemed like he hadn't heard anything either. I shook it off and went to get a book out of my bag.

An ear splitting shriek filled the room, stopping me dead in my tracks. I looked back and saw Jen stand up straight and take both headphones out. ""I heard that one..."" she whispered. Dr. Joe came running out, ""What the hell?"" We all made our way to the doors that connected the room to the rest of the operating floor. ""What was that? Somebody messing around? Initiation week for us or something like that?"" I asked. ""Not that I know of..."" answered Dr. Joe. We made it to the other set of swinging doors and looked through the small windows into the next hallway. All clear. Dr. Joe pushed one of the doors open and stuck his head out, ""Anybody there? Anybody need assistance?"" There was no reply, just a thick silence that made my stomach lurch. He walked out of the room and now stood completely in the hallway where he stood frozen with a puzzled look on his face. Jen and I walked out as well and looked towards where he was facing. Operating room 4 had its lights on.

""PLEASE! STOP! PLEASE! IT HURTS! THE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! THE ANESTHESIA DIDN'T WORK! PLEASE STOP!""

Dr. Joe bolted towards the room rather quickly for a man his age. Jen and I took off after him, stopping just behind him as he threw open the door. Sure thing, the lights were on but there was nobody in sight. ""Stay outside. Look into the other rooms, carefully."" Jen took the first two while I walked back to number five. I pushed the door open and waited as the lights flicked on. Empty. I let out a relieved breath and went to check out room 3. Same thing. Dr. Joe was still looking into room 4, rubbing the bald spot on the back of his head. Jen walked up next to me. ""All clear on this end. Hey Doc, just...what was that?"" He shrugged his shoulders, ""Dunno, collective insanity? Let's just go back."" He turned around, closed the door behind him and waited until the lights turned off before walking back into the main room. With our nerves rattled we settled back down on the chairs at the nurse's station. 

From behind us came a child like whimper that made us all spin around. There she stood, no more than 5'3'', dark complexion, small build probably 100 lbs., dark hair matted to her head. She was wearing one of the hospital's robes, a little stained around the abdomen. ""It....hurts...I-I told them it didn't work but they just kept cutting..."" she whimpered. Jen and I sat in the chairs with our mouths hanging open. ""Um...what exactly happened?"" asked Dr. Joe, obviously the more composed one out of all of us. The young woman crumpled to the ground and began screaming. ""They wouldn't let me go! They kept hurting me! Please don't let them hurt me!"" Dr. Joe ran to her and gently helped her to her feet, ""Get me a bed ready!"" Jen set up a bed while the doctor and I moved the patient. We laid her on the bed and began to do a routine exploration while Dr. Joe asked her some basic questions to which he got no response. She had gone catatonic and just stared blankly at the ceiling. I had just finished hooking her up with an IV when I heard Jen gasp. I turned around and saw the expression on her face. She had lifted the robe just above the navel only to reveal a horridly sutured jagged, incision. I pulled down the robe and walked back to the nurse's station to call the cops. Dr. Joe ran out to get security and probably some help. Jen took a seat next to me and put her head in her hands. ""Just what is happening D?"" I shrugged and waited for the other end of  the line to be picked up. Looking over my shoulder to check on our patient I froze, letting the receiver fall from my hand. ""Shit..."" Jen turned to me and then turned around.

She was gone. The bed was empty, with absolutely no trace of where she had gone. I felt my blood run cold and my knees shake. Dr. Joe showed up with the nurses, Dr. Smith and security. He looked at the empty bed with disbelief and then looked at us. 

For the next two hours the hospital was on lockdown while police searched the building looking for the woman that fit our description. We told them everything that had happened that night and how she had just vanished. They came to the conclusion that we were overworked and probably just tired, there was nothing out of the ordinary. We tried to tell them there was no way we could have all imagined the exact same thing but they seemed to think otherwise. Come sunrise we were escorted out of the building and were told to go home.

It's been two days since and we've all made it back to the hospital...it's late. I just heard the door swing open.

In addition to class experience from labs, I have been actively working as an assistant to the System Admin for the computer science department.

I also was given the opportunity to intern at Sandia National Labs where I am currently working as a cyber intern developing virtual systems using Xen Server. This has given me the opportunity to apply my knowledge on  Windows Server administration, as well as learn on virtual networking via VyOS, and basic Exchange installation and configuration to setup mail servers.

What would career advice would this community provide for me? I am actively pursuing career to become a Jr Admin (to build my way up as a System Admin eventually). Am I pushing for a career that still above my expertise, and if so what job titles would you recommend I pursue?  Thanks for reading and any advice!!

I'm going to be a junior (CS major) this fall and have done ok in my programming classes so far, B's and I just got a C+ in my programs toughest course (head of the undergrad program was my professor, he told us straight up). To get to the point I feel like I am not prepared for a  technical interview. From what I understand most questions relate to data structures/algorithms which I have yet to take a course in (registered for it in the fall), so most of my knowledge is general logic and only about a year of experience with java/C. My question is what can I learn in the next three days in sort of a crash course style to improve my chances of passing the interview? It's not a huge deal if I don't get the position, but it certainly would help. P.S. I indicated on my resume that I have not taken that course yet, if that matters. Thanks."

I'd like to spend $500-$650, but I'd be willing to spend up to $800 if I find something that is worth the extra money. In the US.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 

Good battery life is definitely one of my criteria, as well as at least 8GB of RAM. My current mac is 6 years old and has 4 GB of RAM, which I find isn't enough. Storage space would be nice but not a huge requirement, as I will likely end up getting an external drive anyway.

* **How important is weight to you?**
 
Not important

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
 
Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 

At least 15.6''

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 

This is important. I'm about to enter my senior year in college as an Engineering major, and I currently am working an internship where I am using different CAD programs. I plan to keep this computer and this job for a long time, I'd like to be able to work from home with these programs after graduation, and continue using them through senior year. I will also require it for general school use and downloading hundreds of GBs of music and movies. Here are some of the programs I'd like to be able to run on my laptop, and simultaneously if possible:

AutoCAD MEP, Revit, AGi32

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 
Probably won't be doing much gaming on this computer

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 
Of course good input devices are always a plus, but no hard requirements here for me

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

Basically I want a good computer for school and business, I've been using a macbook for the past 6 years, it's held up nice but it's definitely time for an upgrade and now that I'm about to graduate college and start working, I need a reliable windows computer. I was looking at some Lenovos but had a hard time finding one in my budget that met my requirements. Found some Dell inspiron laptops too, but some of my friends advised me against getting a Dell computer, saying it will only hold up for 2 or 3 years. Any help in finding a good fit for me would be much appreciated. Thanks!"

I'm just starting the process of making a list of colleges to apply to in the fall. I'm female and Asian, and am a Georgia resident. I'm really interested in science, and will probably major in bio, chemical, or environmental engineering, though I'm not 100% sure yet. I have good stats, but average ECs.   

.


   Academics:   
   
4.0 UW GPA

1/~300 in a public high school

35 ACT (35 E, 36 M, 34 R, 34 S)

790 Chemistry SAT 2

Rigorous courses. Took almost all the AP sciences except Physics C and CompSci. 

.


ECs: 

Quiz Bowl (9th - 11th), Environmental Club (secretary), Beta Club (10th -11th), Tutoring (10th - 11th), Violin (~9 years, went to All-state, involved in my local youth orchestra), internships in science labs (9th and 10th), various regional awards. Will most likely be a National AP scholar by the beginning of senior year, if that matters.

.

Here's my list so far:

Reach: Cornell

Match: GA Tech (most likely)

Safety: UGA (automatic acceptance for valedictorians and salutatorians)


Yeah, I only have 3 schools :P. Financial aid is very important for me, since my mom switched careers a year ago, and my dad works an average paying research job. I have the Zell and HOPE scholarships if I stay in Georgia, and any OOS colleges should have good scholarships. I'm looking for colleges with good STEM programs, but with a friendly, liberal, non-cutthroat atmosphere. I know that my stats are very good, but I don't know if I can really aim for the super prestigious colleges, since my ECs aren't spectacular. Since I'm going into engineering, I don't think that matters too much, but I still want a college that will challenge me academically, and that will provide me with a lot of opportunities. I'd be completely happy if I go Tech, but I'm still looking to expand my college list.

Advice?,VerdantWinter,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/4r439d/im_depressed_and_feel_stuck_and_unable_to_do/,"I'm spending my summer at an internship in California away from friends, family, and loved ones. I've been struggling off-and-on with depression for the past 3-4 years, and was seeing a psychologist for most of the spring while I was at university in Boston, but obviously was not able to continue therapy while I'm away.

I was hoping that this summer would be, if not better, at least no worse than the spring. I was looking forward to the change of place, to not stressing about academic work, and to my internship (which, by all appearances, should be a really good thing). But, despite all of that, I'm feeling worse than I have since my first true depressive episode. I can't motivate myself to work, I have no ambition, I'm lonely, and even the usual things which serve to distract me (like video games, music, reading) don't hold any pleasure (i.e. anhedonia). I've tried making friends or romantic/sexual partners, but social anxiety makes that really difficult.

It seems clear that something needs to change, but I feel like I'm stuck and don't have any good options. At the end of the spring, my psychologist and I talked about the possibility of me talking to a psychiatrist and maybe starting some sort of medication, and if I still feel this way when I return to school in the fall, I suppose that will be something to try. 

It seems like I can't really make any effective moves towards benefiting my mental health now, though: it takes time to develop a relationship with a doctor, and I'm leaving at the end of August. If I were to start medication this summer, I would have to find a new doctor when I return to Boston, and that sounds like a lot of added risk and uncertainty when psychiatric medication is already somewhat hard to prescribe. 

So, here I am. I don't know what to do. Spending the next two months in this state sounds like hell, but it seems like I don't have any better options.

Any advice?"

Kinda. I'm a programmer and my job, from this month, is to support two interns in their summer holiday project.

There's a lot of people on this sub that either have an experience with internships as interns, or have an experience with management. Answers from both of you are appreciated a lot!

I've worked for my company for 2 years. Now I've got a job to coordinate a summer holiday project for two interns. They have to write some thingy from 0. They are talented, from good colleges and with good grades.

Anyway, I have many dilemmas and managed to express a bunch of a-bit-chaotic questions.

1) Should I involve in architecture planning, or let them do it?

Or maybe I should try to do it together with them? Wouldn't it feel like a classroom, since I know more about things, and have a clear vision of it already?

2) In general, how ""deep"" my involvement should be?

I heard that other people have big projects and they to them mostly alone. It's not how I imagine our intern project: I thought that I will coordinate it all the way, get continuous feedback etc.

It's a kind of project that's gonna be used pretty early, though. Maybe there's the difference?

3) How to give them negative feedback?

There's gonna be a negative feedback. Code review or ugly documentation. It's because they are interns on their first project, and also just because they are new, so they aren't adjusted to our ways of doing things. 

I mean, it's not always about code being ""bad"", sometimes it's about being ""different""; no need to do the same thing twice and differently both times. Let the logical duplication be a physical duplication. And I want this code base to not be very diverse from our other code bases (maybe it's a bad decision?).

How to do it, so that they won't feel encouraged?

4) Any general advice is welcome!

Those are also my career questions - it's a big opportunity for me to ""exercise"" and develop new skills, because it's my first time coordinating other people's work. I hope you don't mind this kind of question being posted here.

I know I'm asking general questions. If there's anything you can recommend me to read, like books or blogs - I would love it.

Cheers."

My question is somewhat elementary, but I am wondering what benefit this has? The only thing I can come up with is that more requests can process through the load balancer and the queue is reduced. However, does this reduce CPU load of the main system at all? I'm presume not. 

It brings me to the question of wondering what to even monitor to determine the need to scale up a new node in the cluster. The parent system or each individual container?

TLDR;
What is the benefit of horizontally scaling a node within a cluster and what's a good monitoring approach in doing so. "

Ever since I was a child I was extremely fascinated by space, the universe, consciousness. I was always good at math and loved computers, so I decided computer engineering was for me. I would get a job at NASA and it would be awesome!

For about three years I was a computer engineering major at an ivy. I had a 3.5 GPA and was doing well in my classes. I thought hardware was interesting, the math was tedious, but I as some of my friends were just bearing through it for the money and job prospects. I had several internships and even a job which changed my perspective. I was absolutely miserable and stuck at a computer coding all day, something I did not enjoy. I talked to others in the field. They were all very bright and kind and told me that more than likely I would get a job in software or in manufacturing as those were oversaturated. I may land a hardware gig, but NASA was out of the question. When asked if they liked their careers, they all said yes, it was very laid-back, they made good money.

I think that's when the reality really hit me. Here I was at a computer desk and where I would be stuck for the rest of my life completing projects for a company, basically as a human robot. This isn't meant to offend any one, but for any one that feels the same. I realized for the past three years I had been sitting in class just memorizing and regurgitating information and formulas and building robots with NASA in mind. Even if I had prospects of a career in NASA, what had I been *learning* for myself? I wasn't learning about the universe, I wasn't learning about existence, space, consciousness...these burning questions I've had since I was little. Unless I acted fast I was going to be stuck at a job I didn't find any fulfillment or passion in. I enrolled into the liberal arts college in my school and out of the engineering school. I am studying philosophy and cognitive science and I am happy. I aim to go into academia and never stop learning!

This thread has been extraordinarily helpful to me over the years. Thank you for the homework help, the support, the dank memes (jk). It's been a wild ride and I want to tell anyone else - do what you find interesting and makes you happy :). Find your passions, and if thats in engineering or not, I wish you all the best of luck!

My GPA is a 2.68. I don't have much to redeem it. My major GPA isn't much better. My GPA during last 2 years is pretty much the same. My grades in some of the relevant courses to my chosen specialization (computer architecture) C's. I could probably get good rec letters though.

A professor has given me the opportunity to do research related to computer architecture for him. I don't know how much guidance I will get. I'll have to give up an internship that will begin soon to do the research. That internship would help land a full time job for after I graduate in December. Research less so.

Would doing research now even help to get into a less selective grad school? I probably shouldn't bother with it if the answer is no or if I have to also work for a few years first.

The only things I have going for me are competitive programming experience, some personal software/hardware projects and an internship - Things that would help with getting a job but probably not for grad school."

I dropped out of college my first semester because I honestly was not ready for it. However I do not regret my time there.

I am currently working as an intent at a medical device firm and I am being trained on software validation testing while planning to attend community college. All my life everyone has always tried to tell me to find a job I love doing and it has made it a stressful two years trying to figure that out. However the other day I had a huge epiphany that I don't really care what career I work, I just care about the money. Even when money didnt matter to me as a kid all I wanted was more of it, it didn't matter how I got there. All I care about is a manager/boss that is cool/laid back but will still be on you and coworkers that I like. So far every job I have worked has had this environment and it is amazing. I know any job I choose to work I will advance rather swiftly I am just having a hard time figuring out which job I should go to school for. I would prefer to be in a white collar industry and something on the computer. Should I continue something with the software validation testing? The last intern they trained went on to work at SAS for 150k a year but I do not know what they were going to school for as well. I would prefer not to go to school but I know too many adults that only got so far without that piece of paper saying they graduated. Any suggestions would be amazing!

My last job I was the youngest person by 10 years and my manager sat me down 4 months in and told me by the end of this summer he was planning on promoting me ahead of all of them I just needed more experience in the field. 

Edit: Also looking for tips to better myself and get ahead. When I was in school I never went because the teachers I had always taught me how to pass their tests and didn't really teach me anything and it was a waste of time. I have a hard time finding things to be intellectually stimulating. I know I'm smart I just don't know what to do with my intelligence. I've always been athletic and I picked the one sport you really cant go professional in. Since I was always athletic and doing sports, I was naturally good at anything I started doing, but since I'm in the real world now and not doing sports, there is always a learning curve and I have a hard time starting anything because I am not immediately good at it.

I will be graduating a semester early and will be out of school by Fall 2018.

I've started looking at some graduate school programs and have read that the Spring application season is generally much more competitive due to the limited amount of spots available. However, I have been considering applying to some schools in the spring anyway in order to secure an acceptance early and not have to worry about applying to jobs as a fallback of not getting into any graduate schools in the fall. 

The worst case scenario for me would be to get only rejection letters in April and have wasted the spring semester, when instead I could have started working fulltime. If I received at least one acceptance in the fall, I could either take the offer and start in the spring or I could take two internships in the spring and summer comfortably knowing that I will have an offer afterwards.

With that in mind, I have 2 specific questions:

1) How much of a disadvantage will I be if I apply in the spring?

2) Would I be at a disadvantage if I got rejected for the spring semester and reapplied immediately for the fall?"

First of all, sorry for a throwaway, but my main reddit account being quite active and easily tied to my real life identity makes it not comfortable to ask career questions.

I'm coming to /r/ITCareerQuestions to ask for advice on getting into the fields of application/web applications security. I did read that one [Meta] thread about security everyone posts around here so no need to link me to it. The thread was helpful but I still have questions.

I'm not coming into IT with no experience, I've been working in the field for about 12 years and have accumulated what looks like a considerable amount of experience in various fields. I would like to try to assess what I do know:

* Formal education: B.Sc. in Computer Science;
* Real world experience in software development: have built several productivity applications in J2ME. Those were widely used, had to abandon them with the apparent death of J2ME; Went on to build mobile apps in C/C++. Unfortunately, Windows Mobile did not catch on as well so had to abandon these as well. More recently've built several apps in C++/QML for Blackberry 10 OS, now that the OS is dead as well, those are, once again, abandoned. I was not very smart in picking platforms!
* Real world experience with a small ISP: operating network equipment and building the physical network, we were providing the last mile both over Ethernet and 802.11 connections, operated our own AS and a set of Juniper equipment so that provided me with knowledge of networking. I would say I have good experience in the field.

* Experience operating a, once again, small web hosting providing service. What I've had built was a small LAMP hosting setup with a off-the-shelf hosting panel. I've also built a custom billing and order proccessing system in PHP which has automated our payment processing, hosting package creation and domain registration activities. Having a need to build such a system made me learn almost everything there is about the underlying technologies: web protocols, domain name system and so on. I would assess my knowledge in this domain (web technologies) as very good.

* Experience running a small web software shop: teamed up with a couple of friends and've built a couple dozens web projects, mostly in e-commerce using a usual combo of php, postgresql and the like. Since it was a very small enterprise I was responsible for both the backend and frontend development, so I have very good experience in these areas, frontend being html/css/js.

So, it is understandable that while working in the field I was hacked again and again, people around the world were bruteforcing my ssh, tried to use my customers' outdated Wordpress setups to root my servers and, after failing that, installed scripts to send out spam putting my addresses on blacklists. It both infuriated and fascinated me so I've started to learn. I've read books like Applied Cryptography and Secrets and Lies, sources like OWASP, subscribed to 2600 and Hacker News. I've realized that this is indeed my thing. So, about three years ago I've started doing whitehat bug bounties. I've discovered that I know enough applicable knowledge to do such work. Since then I've participated in a numerous bounties with apparent good results, discovering vulnerabilities ranging from boring CSRFs to more interesting remote code executions on well-known companies' web properties. It is both fun and well-paying, some of my write-ups got reposted on /r/netsec, Hacker News, whatnot and sparkled discussions. So I've decided to 'go pro' and do this full-time with a retirement package and health insurance. 

I'm writing all that to explain that I think that I understand the basics of how the things work so I know what to do to make them work more secure.

That's my background. Now, what can I expect with that? Unfortunately I don't have certs. I know I can pass CEH and feel like I can pass OCSP (I know it going to ruin my life for several months and destroy my self-confidence though), I have confirmed experience - hall of fames, published write ups, letters from companies confirming my whitehat work. 

I also feel that my experience is fragmented. Since I've picked up everything on the road here and there I'm afraid I may be suffering from Dunning–Kruger effect feeling that I know more that I know in reality. 

That brings me to an idea of applying for a junior-like position in Security. I have enough money saved to suffer a year of low salary if it helps me to get a hold in the area and improve my level of experience. 

So, where should I go from here? What should I look for and apply? What are the lowest-level positions which can bring me to full-time pentesting, application security jobs? Are there any internships in the area? How should I build my CV -- I don't have any experience of employment in the area, should I just link to my existing work?

Thanks!"

Hopefully this subreddit is as nice as the LSD one! Happy Fourth of July!!! (for fellow Americanos)

So here is my current life situation. I am 20 years old and basically haven't done anything the past 2 years since leaving college where I was not mentally ready. I got accepted to a private religious school (somehow my ACT got me in because it was high even though I had an extremely low gpa because my teachers very few teachers I had were actually mentally stimulating and did not enjoy that I did not let them talk to me like I was a teenager and instead tried to make them treat me as an adult (hence why I am friends now with my old coach and I can't make friends my own age, only adults.) 

I honestly really do not want to go back to college because I would prefer to be trained by a company as I feel that is the best way for me to learn and excel vs. being taught one thing in school and then being told at my job that that is completely wrong (this has happened to me before). However I do know that not having the wonderful piece of paper that is a diploma will keep me from advancing in a career like I know I will be able to (this has happened to my uncle who is so extremely successful and intelligent that he is one of the few people I idolize in those aspects ( I would love for him to mentor me but he lives several states away), he just chose the military vs. school a long time ago). 

In my family I have grown up always chasing money. Even when it did not matter to me, it is something I have always wanted. Just the aspect of it makes me happy. I even want to collect different types of silver bullion's just for fun. I have a fine taste in things that I just simply can not afford in life right now (ie. fine wines (thank you alcoholic genetics) cars, clothing, houses. To get to the main point...

I know at some point in my life I will own my own business because that is what I have grown up around. Both of my parents have owned their own business for most of my life and I have a pretty solid knowledge on what it takes and how to run it successfuly. This is one of the reasons why all of my former employers welcome me back with open arms and I am always considered for promotions extremely early, even when I don't fully know what I am doing. My work ethic also helps here because I am perfectly willing to work 18 hour work days 7 days a week as long as I know what I'm doing on said task and it is not stumping me due to lack of clear instructions ( I am not confident in the work I do if I do not have clear instructions or I am just learning what I am doing but I can pick things up extremely fast if it is thoroughly explained like I do not know the topic. Many employers talk to you like you already know the topic and this is extremely frustrating to handle because when I ask for them to dumb it down, every task after that they talk to me like I am retarded and they over ""dumb it down"" so to speak which makes me angry (my adderall for my ""off the charts ADD and ADHD makes me angry or ticked off easily with other people) and frustrated that I am being treated as a lesser person because I asked for help once.

I am currently an intern for a medical device firm that has me as a ""contractor"" and it pays me $12.00 an hour. They are currently training me to do software validation for something they are developing. I got this job because my mom and I are extremely close. We went through a lot together and had a rough come up to where we are in life now (she had me at 19 and had an abusive situation). We are finally a middle class family working our way up due to the fact that her business she owned was in the red and she dipped into family funds. (To put into perspective for my younger brothers (3 and 12), shes looking into land to build a house that is 400k) and my brothers have all the things they need to be successful in life and I am stuck playing catch up because I was a really bad child growing up due to my compulsion disorder. I honestly should be in jail right now. I didn't get diagnosed with my ADHD until I was almost 18 when a pretty bad incident happened in the family with me and I ran away from home to my psychiatrist and slept on his office doorstep (didn't even own a car) and forced my family to listen to me that I have no control over my actions. There is a little bit of backstory for you to understand me a little better. Back on the topic of the job, me and my mom are super close and she has helped me find opportunities before, which I really do appreciate considering this time last year in my life I was working 5 jobs at once during the week with no time off, but I have a hard time getting a job ""because of her"" even though she says that I didn't get the job because of her but because of myself. ( I have developed a lot of insecurities over the years that I have walled up and shoved in the back of my mind that I am working through but don't know how). I feel like I get the job because of her because she doesn't think I can make it on my own or that I'm actually not as smart as I think I am. With this job, I know I have it as a solid full time job for the next three months but I do not know the extent of it after that. There is a rumor that since I will know the software so well, that I will be the best candidate to travel around and sell it (which it will be very successful due to the potential I have noticed from it), but this is a rumor and I can not rely on my future/budgeting to move out (my step dad who I consider my real dad is lying to my mom because a shirt smelled like weed and he figures i'm too busy smoking weed to help out at home (I hadn't even smoked that day I was coming home from by third 15 hour work day in a row and only had 1 hour of sleep in the past two days. I rarely smoke to get smacked high, it helps me sleep with my insomnia and lets me relax due to how tense I get working all day/the work nightmares I have when I sleep). And now I am currently trying to save every dime I can get to move out because tensions are getting high due to the messages I saw between him and my mom + the fact that they don't enjoy the fact that I don't leave my room even though there is literally nothing to do outside of my room in this house besides constantly cleaning. I can work from my home and I sleep all the time (I really think I either have low testosterone or I am hitting pubertly late like my biological father as I want nothing more than to sleep and eat all day...or i'm extremely depressed still from failing to reach my one goal in highschool to win a state title (I took second to arguably the best guy in the state who dropped to my weight a week before regionals) which I hate that I might still be hung up on that right now and cant let go because I dont want to be ""that guy"" who cant move past highschool. So now I have decided to move out because I am struggling to get my life together living at home and I know moving out will force me to get my shit together and stop wasting time. I even recently gave up video games and I am about to give up drugs (except LSD so I can look at myself from another persons view) because all I think about is how I am not enjoying these activities anymore because I feel like I am wasting time that could be spent bettering myself. I actually hate every minute i'm not finding a way to better myself and put myself in a good position for life but I do not even know where to begin... 

Now my other job I work at a baseball stadium. Yes...I sell lemonade and snowcones professionally. The pay is actually amazing though considering I rarely make less than $15 dollars an hour and can reach upwards of $40 an hour. However this job is extremely inconsistent and keeps me from having an established schedule... But I love my bosses their who treat me as an adult and we throw business ideas back and forth at each other. They have even mentioned to me partnering with them down the road.

I don't know what to do since both of these jobs could potentially leave me jobless (or the internship so to speak) could give me reduced hours where I could no longer budget or live on my own.

I am extremely stressed out. I owe my parents 4k for my car/taxes, and I owe my private school 10k where I have to pay 330 a month. All I want in life is a job I can climb the ladder in while making good money. I am willing to learn anything hands on if I can avoid school, or be mentored like I currently am, I just want security and and a place that will help me grow to my full potential.  I'm extremely indecisive in my career and life commitment right now not because I cant find a job that will make me happy, but because I can't decide on what career will be the most profitable for me. I only care that I at least like my coworkers and whoever is in the position above me is actually intelligent/gives respect to get respect.

I know I have high expectations of other people and who they are, and I have the same for myself, I've just been procrastinating because honestly, I'm scared. I'm scared of being in debt. I'm scared of living up to what my whole family (extended) thinks I will be, and I want to be the most successful I can as a ""Fuck You"" to everyone who doubted me or talked me down in life. Someone Please help me.

I though my summer internship would help me gain some real world experience, but as it so happens, my internship is a dud. They do not want me there and say ""we do nothing here , there is nothing for us to teach you, relax and we'll send you your internship certificate""

So, as things stands now, I have no experience, my resume looks nothing like that of an mba student, and companies would start visiting my campus from september.

How can I get some experience?? I've tried various freelance/remote work sites and even they ask for experience( which is a bit understandable) for work as simple as data entry.

Any advice would be appreciable. Thanks

* Did Computer science engineering before mba
* Had a decent internship experience in undergrad as an android dev
* Entered mba after completing engineering and taking an year off to prepare for exam/learn japanese"

As far as I'm concerned it doesn't work full stop, I can't ever get it to load.  The line from the head IT guy is that it doesn't work with the office wifi because they did something with the domain controller, using the website address for a setting in some way, which makes the site inaccessible.  Outside the office it should be fine.  There must be an element of truth to this because this particular website is made with Wordpress and you can't log into the wordpress account on the office wifi, but you can elsewhere.  My main question is what have they done with the domain controller, how stupid was it, can it be fixed, etc. etc.?

Whenever I try to load the website from outside the office, I get met with a welcome page from IIS7.  I went on the aws account for the company's websites, and in the route53 section, the particular website in question is neither listed under hosted zones nor under registered domains.  I mentioned to the guy that maybe this had something to do with why the website wasn't working and he brushed me off with some talk about his domain controller mistake.  For what it's worth, downforeveryoneorjustme says that the site is up.  So my second question is, do you think the website not working has something to do with it not being listed under hosted zones?

Please help me not giving up.,darkest_hour_f,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4r7hfj/my_life_turned_into_a_nightmare_and_i_need_some/,"I'm trying my best to make this as short as possible, but I'm in serious need of advice because I'm close to a nervous breakdown. I'm a 31y old female from Europe who used to live in the US to go to grad school. Everything was fine, had good grades, work experience (part-time jobs, freelancing, interesting internships worldwide) and a huge zest for life. After graduating I moved back to my home country and landed my first full-time job from which I got fired unexpectedly after a couple of months. Wasn't eligible for unemployment benefits (because employed &lt; 1 year) and had to apply for social support. Couldn't find a new job for a few months and then got pretty sick. I couldn't put student loans on hold , so I had to move back in with my mom in order to be able to make the smaller payments. (She's amazing and a huge help, so I'm grateful for that)

I'm currently running from doctor to doctor, waiting times are a joke, so far they could (thank god!) rule out a brain tumor, MS and lyme. I got my blood checked but they only found a severe iron deficiency (which is getting treated) and very high inflammatory markers. I'm just a shadow of my former self with severe neurological failures that nobody can explain. I'm in therapy because I started to get depressed. My therapist says I only have a depressive episode that will go away once I'm back to a normal life.
The social support office is pressuring me and banks started to harass me because they want higher payments that I can't make. I'm waiting for an appointment with a debt adviser but things like that take forever. One particular bank is threatening me with garnishments and ruining my credit. I want to avoid bankruptcy at all costs because it takes so long in my country and ruins a lot of things like the ability to rent an apartment. Obviously, I can't live on my mom's couch forever.

On top of that I got dumped by my long-term boyfriend and found out that he has been lying and emotionally (probably also physically) cheating on me. He was verbally abusive a lot, so I guess I dodged a bullet. I can't deny that it hurts though. He apparently wanted out of the relationship for a long time and thought it's a good idea to act like an a**hole so I would eventually get the hint. Worst part was when they told me I had to go get a brain scan (because they suspected I had MS or a tumor) I asked him to come visit me (we were long distance) and he sad he can't because he's short on money and doesn't get a day off. He then fabricated a huge fight where he didn't talk to me and he later confessed that he took two weeks off from work to fly to freaking ASIA with two people he met on a travel buddy side.

I try my best not to lose hope, but I'm afraid that I will not get out of this situation without it ruining my future. I already have a gap in my résumé now. I feel like a complete loser, I'm scared every day and I hardly eat or sleep.

Any advice, any warm words, ideas.. I would truly appreciate them. Maybe you can share how you got out of a similar situation. Maybe you can tell me what I could or should do next.

Thank you and sorry for any mistakes, not a native speaker.

4r83vu,5,2016-07-04,Where to go? PhD(Computer vision) or a software engineering position (hopefully with Vision related work),kislayabhi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4r83vu/where_to_go_phdcomputer_vision_or_a_software/,"Hi

I am an international Masters student in CS. I did my BS in Electrical but got interested in Computer Vision in sophomore year.
Back then I used to work hard and got myself into GSoC'14 (Summers junior year) and GSoC'15 (Summers after senior year). Due to these, I was able to change my stream from EE to CS for my Masters program in Univ. of Minnesota. The day I came here, I joined our Robotics lab and worked for the Fall semester without any pay, just because I loved computer vision. The professor gave me RA for the spring(he liked my work, I think) and insisted on providing RA for the summers. But I tried interviewing for internship positions related to computer vision + machine learning for the summers. Somehow, I was always underconfident about these interviews . I eventually screwed up and thought maybe I don't want to go to industry. I provided these details to the professor who then told ""For a person, going to industry from school is easy but the opposite is very difficult"". As time was passing by and people were getting various internship positions (I hate the fact that people choose positions which are too monotonous just because it ""pays""), I again agreed to accept the RA for summers thinking, atlest I will be working in Computer Vision.

Now 1.5 months down the summers, presently I feel the urge from the surrounding to decide between a PhD or go for a good job. I think if I spend more time on deciding which way to go, I will end up in a murky situation. I say this since I still have 2 months left for the summers. I am good with the RA work and can spare some time for Data-structure &amp; Algorithmic interview preparation. (Last time, I was so underprepared that it showed on my face.)

The problem is goal setting. If I prepare for my interviews thinking that ""if some opportunity shows up, i should be able to grab it"", my preparation will have loopholes. 
To have a clear goal, I ultimately have to answer this ""PhD or Job?""

I know deciding whether to go for a PhD is a life decision.  I went over to some excellent articles over these present on the web:
1. http://www.cs.unc.edu/~azuma/hitch4.html
2. http://shouldigetaphd.com/
3. http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/25136762019/advice-to-prospective-grad-students
4. http://neurochambers.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/tough-love-insensitive-guide-to.html

I ended up understanding that, ---&gt; ""PhD is hard work. Only do it if you MEAN it.""
Sometimes, I see my fellow batchmates and envy them for having a clear goal in life. 
From this post, I hope I was able to propagate the fact that I love Research. But I do feel that the hunger for knowledge that I had in my undergraduate days has decreased. 

Currently I am working on both my RA and interview prep with my goal as ""A computer vision job which has research embedded "". This is too vague.

Any comments, suggestions on how should I use my time will be of great help.

Thanks!"

Thanks in advance for all your help. So as the title says I'm looking to major in cs and really like the idea of going to school in New York. I am a rising senior and I have stats that would be a match for NYU and I think make me at least a candidate for getting into Columbia (2260 sat 4.44 gpa at a good school and several leadership positions). When I visited last spring I could see myself enjoying both social scenes though I did see a large difference between the two. I am currently doing an applied math/cs internship at Hopkins over the summer and really enjoying that side of computer science, also my goal is to found a startup after college. I would not be receiving financial aid at either school so they are both equal in that sense. While Columbia is ranked somewhat higher in cs (19 vs 29 usnews) in looking at both programs NYU seemed to have a lot more to offer with their prestigious courant institute, courses in game design and mobile/web develpment (I'm not planning in seriously pursuing these fields but I still think it would be really fun to learn about), and four different startup incubators compared to Columbia's one. My question is, would it be ridiculous to pass up an opportunity to go to Columbia for NYU? Maybe NYU just does a better job selling their programs, but it just seems that everything else being equal NYUs computer science program has more to offer (for me specifically) despite its lower rank. Thanks for reading all this and I hope to hear your opinion!"

4radtu,6,2016-07-04,A few questions about jobs in Web Development,WebDevAllDay,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4radtu/a_few_questions_about_jobs_in_web_development/,"So quick background, I moved back to the states when I was 20 after living for 8 years in Europe. At the time I was living with a friend who worked in IT. He was attempting to make some extra cash by doing a website here and there. I was actually familiar with html + css since I wanted to build a better website then mangastream.com at the time. He was working in Wordpress and I easily picked up on how it works, within a few hours I was already better at it than he was. It ultimately led to him finding me a lot more jobs and that's how I sort of started working as a freelancer (if you can call it that). I worked entirely in Wordpress and Joomla my first 2 years. I eventually picked up Javascript since there were a lot of jobs related to that and would do any sort of job he could get me, from fixing minor issues, working in node.js back-end, databases, creating custom slideshows or other minor scripts. So for the next 3 years I used Javascript extensively, especially with single page apps. I should also mention this wasn't exactly full time since I didn't always have jobs, but I would still work over 40 hours a week since I'd work on my own projects and such. To be as honest as I can be since I want honest answers, here is what I am good at:

 * Vanilla JS (pretty much everything except canvas as I've never used that yet) but coding in JS comes really fast and easy for me.
 * Lua (created a fully fledged mobile app on iOS + Android)
 * Pretty extensive work in Node.js using third party API for storing the data properly and analyzing it thoroughly. Used MongoDB, Redis and a little MySQL.
 * Wordpress, Joomla. I've used PHP to edit wordpress quite a few times in the past, but I wouldn't say I am proficient or knowledgeable in it. I forgot to mention I am self taught in everything programming related and with the help of google I'd be able to figure out what I'd need to edit in PHP to get what I wanted.

Can't really think of anything else on the spot. I was debating if I should finish this course before applying to companies, [Senior Web Developer - Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/senior-web-developer-nanodegree--nd802), mostly hoping to finish it within 2 months, but not sure how much it would help? I figured adding some frameworks like Angular, React, Ember might help since I've heard a lot of top companies use them. I'm the type of person who spends his free time learning whatever I am currently using so I can become familiar with it much faster, but I obviously can't write something like that on my resume. Regardless, since I've never actually been hired before and my only interview was at Riot Games within a week of coming back to the states (which I failed miserably because I sucked at talking), my questions are:

 * Should I start and finish that course or any other before applying to a company?
 * Anything else I should do to best prepare myself?
 * Should I apply to internships first or go straight for a web developer job? 
 * How much starting pay would I be looking at? Do I get much less if I start as an intern (even if I get hired after the internship?)

Feel free to share anything else that would help me out and thanks in advance, I really appreciate it."

Let me give you the quick of where I am today. I went to school for Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology, it's a 2 year AAS that dealt to a small extent with circuitry, embedded engineering and a small amount of programming (make this for loop count, draw sprites on a screen, etc.).

I knew before this degree I wanted to be in the help desk, it was why I went to school but I got convinced that I should pursue programming and for a bit I enjoyed it. I took a year off school after my AAS to pursue a job in circuitry to discover that I didn't like it and subsequently went back to school to pursue a degree in computer science. Now here I am with $10K USD in student debt and 2 and a half years of school to go and 1 year into a programming internship and I've discovered... I do not like programming at all anymore.

I want to help people understand technology, I want to set up their smartphones and laptops, I want to help them teach others. I don't think a bachelors in computer science is a fit for me but I don't know where to start to get a job in IT. I'm so lost on how to start or where to start, I don't want to pursue another year of programming at $4K a semester because taking on that kind of debt for no reason is just plain silly.

Please help me."

the past four months of my life have been absolutely awful. I've struggled with depression my whole life, but a breakup with someone I really cared about and thought I could have a long relationship with triggered a severe depressive episode that I haven't been able to break out of. I've been more depressed than I have ever been in my life. I literally couldn't even get out of bed for the longest time (until I was prescribed Buproprion, which helped with being able to get out of bed, but unfortunately not with the depression itself.) I also started abusing my klonopin prescription and mixing it with alcohol frequently, leading to a tolerance and it no longer working for me. now my social anxiety is back and I'm no longer comfortable anywhere, feel like I can never say or do anything right in social situations, and am just completely uncomfortable in my own skin. Very few things make me happy anymore and I just don't see a light at the end of this tunnel. Even if I spoke to my psych about how I'm feeling, I still feel like I'm in way too deep and can't stand to keep living like this much longer, definitely not for the amount of time it would take to get on new meds and figure out new therapy methods/whatever.  

On top of this, I'm feeling immense pressure about school because I'm going to be a senior in college in the fall and in my program, there is a mandatory internship requirement and I also have to take a full course load and work to have money to live on on top of that. I constantly feel this pressure weighing on me literally every second. I don't sleep anymore. I'm so anxious about finding an internship because there's only three places in my town that are relevant to my career goals, and one already turned me down and the other I've already had experience with and don't think I could realistically spend the required 15 hours a week there. I'm having so much anxiety about this (because if my only other option turns me down or won't even interview me, I'm absolutely screwed) that I get physically sick.

As the depression and anxiety have worsened I've found myself thinking more and more of just fucking ending it. It's been four months, nothing has gotten better, and it would be the only way out of this pressure my school is putting on me (taking time off is not an option, my parents who cosign my loans adamantly do not support that and do not take me seriously when I try to convey how seriously bad I am feeling.) I just got back from a month of studying abroad and was hoping that would lead to a change of perspective for me, but it actually made things worse because the ""friend"" that I went abroad with turned out to be a very mean person to be in close quarters with, and made horrible comments about my daily anxiety and made me feel like nothing but a worthless burden to everyone around me. 

I have daily thoughts about killing myself in a specific way (that I apparently can't go into here, but is almost guaranteed to be successful). It's gotten to the point where I actually fantasize about it, and I've written multiple suicide notes. I'm at home with my family now, and would never kill myself here because I would never want my parents to find me, but when I go back to my apartment in about a week, I'm afraid I won't be able to stop myself. I just feel worthless, like nobody cares about me or would notice if I was gone, and that this is the only way out of the immense pressure being put on me that I can't handle. 

I don't even know why I wrote all that. I don't think anyone can help me. I just don't know what to do and deep down, I would like to live and see things in my life turn around, but they aren't and haven't been, and I can't keep living this way, so I am seeing this as the only option left. "

That happened to me. I have to use Caffe for my CS internship. That isn't the rant part. 

So you start learning the framework. Some parts of it are a bit complicated but slug through it. 

Some documentation is lacking, but you slug through that with trial and error. It is annoying, but I can work with that. I had worse. 


No No. The part that is frankly really annoying me is when you get a problem. A problem that shouldn't be mathematically possible. I check Google. No solution. I ask on SO, on the forums. I get a few responses, but not really a solution. 

I read the code ( which isn't really commented) to find the source of the error. I try everything my mind comes up with. I woke in the middle of the night to come try something. Nope. 

I tell myself, I better love forward a bit on things that I would have done if there was no error. The problem is that now I can't move forward with that part. So I can't do a thing but sit on my ass. Which is insanely frustrating when you are trying to impress the guys who gave you the internship. "

*So I'm a Intern at a company because of my school and I work in different sections of the company marketing ,logistic ,IT ,etc.*


*So one day I was doing my stuff on IT and the phone rang, I picked it up and started talking with a salesman for the company, he was having problems with his mouse so I tried to help him, the conversation went like this:*


&gt;So when did this start happening

&gt;Today when I started my laptop

&gt;Maybe it is damaged or something like that, but Ill try to see what's going on,could you give me your IP so I can enter your machine?

&gt;Oh yeah sure


*They can get their IP using a icon that exists on their computer in case something like this happens, I dint even think at the time how he gave me the IP without using a mouse, it completely slipped past my mind*


&gt;Hmm ok I'm in can you see the mouse moving?

&gt;Yes I can

&gt;So it's not a problem with the configuration of the machine but you should be able to move it, I can't understand why you cant, could you try moving it now that I'm in here?

&gt;Sure


*I can hear him trying to move the mouse icon around but nothing happens,so I stay for about 1 hour checking configurations to see if it is the computer and not the hardware, suddently I see his mouse moving on the screen*


&gt;Did you just move it?

&gt;Yes

&gt;How?

&gt;I used the mouse-pad


*You guys have to understand that no salesman uses a actual mouse on their computer they just can't because they have to use the computer in cars and such, so when he said mouse I tough mouse-pad and I explained that to him,and said that still his mouse should be working(he told me that it was brand new) then he says that it was really hard to put it in and it made a weird noise when it went in, so I got suspicious.*


&gt;I really don't know how to fix this sir, you have to send us your laptop and mouse so we can check what's going on

&gt;Ok I'll do that now Thank you


*The next day I got his computer and mouse, and I almost cried in tears, this guy took the mouse and tried to put it inside the goddamn Ethernet hole, he tried so hard that the piece went inside and the Usb of the mouse bent, so we had to send him a new computer and mouse and I had to call him and tell him the correct hole to put it in(No pun intended)*

I am an international Masters student in CS. I did my BS in Electrical but got interested in Computer Vision in sophomore year. Back then I used to work hard and got myself into GSoC'14 (Summers junior year) and GSoC'15 (Summers after senior year). Due to these, I was able to change my stream from EE to CS for my Masters program in Univ. of Minnesota. The day I came here, I joined our Robotics lab and worked for the Fall semester without any pay, just because I loved computer vision. The professor gave me RA for the spring(he liked my work, I think) and insisted on providing RA for the summers. But I tried interviewing for internship positions related to computer vision + machine learning for the summers. Somehow, I was always underconfident about these interviews . I eventually screwed up and thought maybe I don't want to go to industry. I provided these details to the professor who then told ""*For a person, going to industry from school is easy but the opposite is very difficult*"". As time was passing by and people were getting various internship positions (I hate the fact that people choose positions which are too monotonous just because it ""pays""), I again agreed to accept the RA for summers thinking, atlest I will be working in Computer Vision.

Now 1.5 months down the summers, presently I feel the urge from the surrounding to decide between a PhD or go for a good job. I think if I spend more time on deciding which way to go, I will end up in a murky situation. I say this since I still have 2 months left for the summers. I am good with the RA work and can spare some time for Data-structure &amp; Algorithmic interview preparation. (Last time, I was so underprepared that it showed on my face.)
The problem is goal setting. If I prepare for my interviews thinking that ""if some opportunity shows up, i should be able to grab it"", my preparation will have loopholes. To have a clear goal, I ultimately have to answer this ""PhD or Job?""

I know deciding whether to go for a PhD is a life decision. I went over to some excellent articles over these present on the web: 

* http://www.cs.unc.edu/~azuma/hitch4.html 
* http://shouldigetaphd.com/ 
* http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/25136762019/advice-to-prospective-grad-students 
* http://neurochambers.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/tough-love-insensitive-guide-to.html

I ended up understanding that, ---&gt; ""Ph.D. is hard work. Only do it if you MEAN it."" Sometimes, I see my fellow batchmates and envy them for having a clear goal in life. From this post, I hope I was able to propagate the fact that I love Research. But I do feel that the hunger for knowledge that I had in my undergraduate days has decreased.
Currently, I am working on both my RA and interview prep with my goal as ""A computer vision job which has research embedded "". This is too vague.
Any comments, suggestions on how should I use my time will be of great help.

Thanks!"

So I just recently graduated and have been working at my current position for about 8 months now. I started as an intern. I have been very happy at my current position as it is challenging and they are constantly sending me to training classes.

Several weeks ago, I was contacted by a recruiter at a company I have been dreaming of working for. I knew I'd eventually try applying for a job at this company but not this early in my career. I decided just to give it a shot. I pretty much knew I wouldn't get the job since it required 5-7 years of experience. Well a couple interviews later and it looks like I'm in the running to actually get this job.

My company has decided to send me to a huge conference in Vegas next week. So basically I'd have to pass up on the conference because it wouldn't feel right going to this conference then leaving the company in the following weeks.

I really don't know if I should take it if I am offered the job. This is my dream job and I wouldn't leave my current company for anything else. It is a 30% pay increase and basically all the benefits are better. It just doesn't feel right leaving the company so quickly after they have done so much for me. 

What do you all think?"

I want to do both because the money would help a lot but I'm not sure if doing both will be too much while being a full time student. I don't really know what goes into being a research assistant and not sure if I'll end up getting burnt out trying to work on both.

4rfhtm,14,2016-07-05,We are holding a potential POTUS candidate to a lower series of standards than an average government employee,Cymdai,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/4rfhtm/we_are_holding_a_potential_potus_candidate_to_a/,"I want to explain my outrage at this decision in a way that people who either don't follow politics/don't care enough to read up can understand.

**TL;DR: A simple explanation of security clearances and why Hilary should no longer be eligible to run for President.**

The President of the United States (the POTUS) is entrusted with one of the highest security clearances in the land. They will know more about covert military operations, stealth intelligence operations, surveillance operations, etc, than nearly anyone else in the world. Security clearances come in different varieties and values, ranging from basic reliability checks, to TS/SCI (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information), to all sorts of other agency-specific clearances. Numerous positions within the military, the army, and the Federal Government require some degree of trust to gain access to these clearances; positions ranging from the army, to police officers, to the CIA, etc. The testing and such is quite exhaustive, often including a year-long investigation by a personal investigator/team of investigators, polygraphs, background checks, etc. There are literally hundreds of ways to be disqualified or deemed ""ineligible"" for a security clearance, so it is not uncommon for a potential applicant to be rejected.

In the event that you breach that trust, there are consequences. Typically, to be serious enough to be investigated, you'd lose your security clearance. That doesn't mean you'll necessarily be fired (though, a demotion would be likely as a result of the loss of a security clearance) but the chances of you being re-granted security clearance would be substantially lower. There are jobs you wouldn't even suspect that require security clearances (file shredder, for example; a person whose job is to shred confidential files and make sure they are disposed of properly). Breaches aren't always intentional, either; simply failing to lock your computer while leaving it open in, say, a library (thus giving possible public access to confidential information) could count as a security breach.

Moving to the relevant topic of ""What does this mean that Hilary is not being charged by the FBI?"" to the world? There's a few conclusions to draw here.

1) Hilary has effectively demonstrated that it's perfectly acceptable for a person of prestige to supercede the integrity of security clearances in general.

2) There's a double standard for security clearances, as the FBI stated a normal person would likely face consequences.

3) The most supreme power in our land, a candidate for the position of the President of the United states, is allowed to be (at best) willfully negligent and ignorant of security protocols related to the handling, discussion, and transferring of sensitive information pertaining to matters of national security, and (at worst) allowed to circumvent the law where he/she sees fit.

For the record, I at no point suspected Hilary would end up in jail. The justice system has proven, repeatedly, that it simply cannot perform it's duty effectively when it comes to prosecuting powerful/wealthy people. This has been demonstrated repeatedly throughout history; one could simply examine the last decade worth of trials to investigate this for themselves. My outrage, however, comes from the fact that we are holding a person entrusted to make decisions on behalf of the entire country to a lower standard than your average government contract worker. Rest assured, had these actions been carried out by a file shredder, an army corporal, an FBI intern, etc, then there would be significant repercussions faced by that person. Yet we are affording the benefit of the doubt to a position, in my mind, that should be held to the highest standard in the country. If I, for example, show up to work late every day, then my colleagues may think ""My, he's a detriment to the team!"", whereas if Hilary Clinton were to leak classified documents, entire nations may think ""Is this really who they elected to be the President...?""

Furthermore, while the findings may not be prosecuted, charged, or anything of the like, at the very least, Hilary should be ineligible for any security clearances, period, moving forward. Perhaps it was just an honest mistake (even if I personally reject that notion), but feigning ignorance of the law does not work for your average citizen; as such, why should it work for a senior government official? If you were to walk into traffic court with a speeding ticket and go ""Oops, I didn't know I was going 63mph in a 45mph zone"", that does not excuse your negligence; you will still be held accountable for your action. Hilary has effectively stated ""Oops, I made a mistake."", except her mistake was carried out on a far grander stage with a far larger scope than your average speeding ticket. Pressing forward, as a result of her inability to gain a security clearance, she should no longer be eligible to run for POTUS, nor any additional branch of government that requires a security clearance of any kind. This does not restrict her from serving her country politically; it merely protects the integrity of our security protocols set in place by numerous government agencies.


With all that in mind, Hilary is now a candidate who has demonstrated themselves to be above the law, impervious to consequences for their actions. A leader who is not subject to the laws and regulations of the society which they govern is no different than a tyrant. Given that America has gone to war to dispose of said tyrants across the globe in the past, I cannot understand how anyone can look at Hilary Clinton and go ""She's the face of democracy, freedom, and equality."" when everything she stands for is being above and beyond the rules, regulations, and laws of society.

Good day."

My problem is, I can't decide what field I want to work in, or even what language I'd like to use most. I've done a couple summer internships at big software companies and that's given me the impression I don't want to work as a full time dev. Also, I've had experience with over a dozen languages and feel comfortable writing at least half of them, with ample time in the next year to bring any of them up to professional standard. I've also spent a lot of time working on reverse engineering tasks and doing loads of CTF's and I really enjoy that kind of work but wouldn't know where to begin moving in that direction.

I will finish this transitional program this fall and will be applying and hopefully being accepted into the Master's program starting spring 2017. My predicament is this, I currently have an internship working on an application development team. It pays well and my boss is hoping to turn it into a full-time position by the end of the year. They know I am pursing my Master's in CS and have said they are more than willing to work with me on a schedule while I am in school. However, when I met with a graduate advisor for the Master's program she talked about me applying to be a GTA. She said she thinks I would be a good candidate and theres about a $1000 monthly stipend and tuition is basically covered for the Master's. My biggest concern was graduating with a Master's degree and having essentially no work experience in this field so I was very happy to land this internship I have. Another thing is that while I am on an ""application development"" team it is mostly just maintaining existing applications or adding features or fixing something wrong in them. They hire outside contractors to come in and do most of the heavy lifting for new applications. I like what I am doing there so far and I am learning .NET since most of their applications are in that but I think long run I would rather be creating new software. Also, if I work full-time during the Master's this could extend my anticipated graduation by a year or so depending on how much I can handle. So, assuming everything goes perfect which could be a long shot but I want to be prepared, if I get an offer to be a GTA and an offer of a full-time position at my current company which do you guys think I should take?

I was a robotics instructor at 2 highschools and worked at our little after school program thing, within my first month 2 people quit, so I got more hours, around the third month another 2 quit and the owner sold the company to the current CEO, The CEO revised the pay system and made the company a non-profit. At the start of last month we had summer camps and stuff and I was scheduled to be lead instructor for almost all of them (2 a day). There was issues with the new pay system and the fact I was only going to be paid 11 dollars an hour for 4 hours of prep (it takes me about 11-12 hours for each camp, not counting travel and clean up at the facility) as a contractor (meaning I would not be taxed now but will get taxed at the end of the year) I resigned and was taken off the schedule immediately 

I first took that job because I had no other place to go and I did not want to stay will a dying company, it sounded really really cool, and I stayed a total of 4 months, at first I was barley breaking even with travel and stuff but now I was losing money and going into debt (i owe about $2000 in credit cards)

My coworkers were just amazed at what they were seeing, one even said that he had been working there for 10 years and never seen something that stupid.

I don't even know how he did it, like its not easy to rip a screen from a laptop, but oh well I called him and had a 20 minute talk explaining that what he did was completely insane and that we would send him a new laptop the next day

Undergrad is in Electronics &amp; Communication Engineering. 
I want to do my Masters in Computer Science - specializing in Computer Vision (and/or allied fields).

I have just one internship at a small company under my belt.
GPA is 8.48 on a 10 point scale. So 3.39 if we scale it down.
Hoping to get published in a journal before I start applying to grad school in September. Have some small projects that I will finish by then.
My Final year project will be in this field. I'm doing some Coursera courses on the side which are relevant to it.

Haven't written my GRE yet.


1. How competitive is my profile as an international student? (I'm from India) 
2. What do I do to bolster my profile?
3. Is interning for a year after undergrad, and then applying a good idea?
4. If I were to take up a job related to CS, but not related to my field of interest, would that be detrimental to my prospects? 

Thank you for your time."
4rhvsp,4,2016-07-06,Undergraduate Abroad or Stateside? Which is the better option for my goals?,PorcTree,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4rhvsp/undergraduate_abroad_or_stateside_which_is_the/,"Looking for some thoughts or advice. Here's the situation.

Real quick background - I'm a USAF vet using my GI bill to go to college. I'm looking to get my degree in Computer Science or a Software Development related field. I'm looking to hopefully get into the video game industry one day, and if that doesn't work out, I'll just use my degree where it's needed. 

I have two options in mind. 

Option 1: Go to San Diego, go to the community college there for a semester while applying to UCSD, hopefully get accepted to UCSD and get my undergraduate there (confident I'd be accepted). This is an option I'm thinking about because they seem to be a very reputable school, with what seems to be a great computer science program. San Diego also appears to have several video game companies in which I would hope to intern at, or try to get my foot in the door while going to college.  

Pros of this option - 

- Apparently 14th best university in the world - Does this really count for anything when it comes to finding work?

- Internships, possible network connections for field I want to work in

- Rigorous Computer Science degree program

- I feel like I Have a clearer vision of my future in this option

Cons:

- Classroom sizes. From what I understand many class sizes are 100+ people.

- Not being in Athens, Greece


Option 2:
I applied to the American College of Greece - Deree in Athens, and was accepted already. This College has an Information Technology - Software Development option as well as a IT - Digital Media Option, in which I would double major. The Program doesn't seem as rigorous as the UCSD program, and there aren't many video game companies in Greece. Those are the two primary concerns.

I should also mention that this school is regionally accredited in the northeast, so it's not much different than earning a degree in the northeast. You also earn UK credits, so you basically walk away with a degree good in the US and the UK.

Pros of this option:

- Athens, Greece. It's an amazing place regardless of the hate it gets from the media.

- Double majoring in Software Development and Digital Media

- International experience - I've read that earning a degree overseas can be beneficial in the eyes of potential employers. Any thoughts? 

- More life experience

- Smaller class sizes

- Earn credits for the US and the UK

Cons:

- Video game industry / lack of internship opportunities in that field

- The school is not well known in the US and I fear employers won't care that I have a degree from some place they have probably never heard of.

- Less rigorous course won't prepare me as well for my work (So I think)

Any thoughts on any of this? What do you guys think the best course of action would be?

Finances wouldn't be an issue in either area.

Side Note:
Is there someone in a Computer Science field that can chime in on the quality of courses. At least the subjects that are listed in the degree program at the Greek school? As in, are they similar to what I need to learn or are the classes garbage?

Thanks for any input!


Edit: Awesome advice guys, thanks for all the ideas. Hardly use reddit, but everyone is awesome on here."

I'm doing a year long IT internship that started in June and goes until I gradute next May. It's a well known company (not a tech company though) and I really really enjoy working here.

I am currently on the IT infrastructure team, but my manager knows that I am computer science and would like to write some code while I'm here. He and I have spoken to other managers so I will more than likely get to do some programming during my year at this company.

My question to you guys is: how can I turn this IT position into a full time developer position? I am on good terms with many of the previous interns here, some of which hold programming positions. Is there anything I could/should ask them? I've narrowed my future career options down to web development or software engineering. 

So how can I turn my IT intern role into a web dev/SWE position when I graduate? When should I start applying to these open positions, or any job after graduation? Should I start before 2017? 

Also, should I have a different portfolio for when I am applying to software dev. positions versus web dev. positions? Can I use my same personal website to the safe effect? Thanks."

I am a CS major about to be in a 4 + 1 path for getting a degree in Computer Science. I am a junior and I do great in school with about a 3.7 average. I am currently in an internship but I have come to realize that a fully iT job isn't for me and that I really enjoy the idea of law enforcement.

I live in the state of new york and the nypd is completely out of the question. I really want to stay in new york and not have to move across America like in a national branch such as FBI, NSA ect so I have been really thinking about state troopers. I have recently started working out again and I want to reach the minimum fitness goals for the State Troopers. 

My problem is that I am not sure when they are testing and that if I technically don't have a degree yet and I am under 21 that I won't get in. I know that people sometimes wait as much as 5 years for there name on the list,and I have about 3 years of schooling so I am not sure what to do.

Do I apply early right now when I am not in shape yet and talk with a recruiter or do I wait until I finish my degree.

Also what should I do if I have to wait for a long time, like as in a job to look into that is in the law enforcement field that isnt paying minimum wage.

Thank you in advance!"

I'm considering going into some type of engineering or computer science, I realize these schools are really competitive but I won't be heartbroken if I don't make it in. My original idea was to apply to reach schools and then if I don't make it into any of them, then go to community college, as my mom wants me to go to CC while my dad wants me to go straight to a 4 year. So that's my compromise.

Male. White. Upper-middle class town with great and competitive public schools. 

My #1 would be UC Berkeley, which also is most likely the one I have the least chance of getting into. 

[My grades from 9th-11th](http://i.imgur.com/BDBZWq0.png). I realize my C in AP Chem both semesters will not look good. The summer from 10th-11th I took a summer US history course to make room for my physics class. Received a 5 on AP Spanish 4, 3 AP English Language, 4 AP Chemistry, 5 AP Psychology. Senior year I will be taking Athletic PE, AP Computer Science, AP Calculus BC, AP Biology, AP Government/Econ, PLTW Intro to Engineering, and Sr English/Social Justice

**SAT**: 1870/2400 (Will be taken new one later this year but will actually be studying for once)
**SAT Subject tests Math II and Chemistry**: Hoping for 700+, already studying for it.
**ACT**: Also will be taking later this year. Realistically, a 30 but hoping for 32+. 

**W GPA**: 3.93
**UW GPA**: 3.73
**UC GPA**: 4.04

**Extracurriculars:**

* Football for 9 years - Captain in high school 9th, 10th, 11th, and most likely this year. 

* Volunteered 3 separate weekends over a year to building houses in Tijuana

* Volunteered spring break 2014 to fix up a church and run a vacation bible school

* Volunteered 2 weeks running a vacation bible school in my hometown (Not actually religious anymore, but figured this showed some leadership positions)

* Volunteered as a flag football coach for little kids for 10 Sundays and worked for money as one for a week

* Was chosen by the school's leadership program to participate (along with around 20 others) in a program that raises awareness for drunk driving for 3 days (basically a realistic simulation of what would happen if we, as students, had been killed by a drunk driver, with a video and graves around the school to make it more realistic)

* Peer Advocate (A club) - 12th grade

* Engineering Club - 12th grade

* Astronomy Club (With the city) 11th-12th grade

* Worked as a barista at a coffee shop for 8 months, 16 hrs a week

* Worked as a cashier for 5 months, 11 hours a week

* Worked alongside my dad on and off doing handyman jobs like moving furniture, installing fans/lights, nailing, sawing wood, etc for around 5 years

* And I guess my most unique one is working as a Beekeeper from March - Present. This is my friend's dad's company that he has been starting up and I have been apart of. We started off with a few dozen hives and will be expanding to around 1250 hives by next year and selling honey commercially sometime in the next month or two. I will be taking a sort of management position, leading a group of 4 and training them while my friends manage the other groups of 4. I have helped start/manage the social media page, take pictures/videos for the website and hopefully soon will be able to help with coding for both the website and the app we are developing to keep track of all the hives. 

* Internship during summer and possibly will continue doing for a couple of months learning C# and helping code for a robot that will climb up a field goal posted and record the football field. Also might help with developing the app for statistics and live feed during the football games and maybe with the servers. Hopefully this will be integrated into my very own school and many others sometime this year. The company is trying to compete with others like Hudl and Gamechanger.


Sorry if everything is a bit cluttered, I appreciate any sort of criticism/advice and will answer any question. Thanks

I'm heavily looking into the government's scholarship-for-service program (offers full tuition/stipend towards master's degree in exchange for 2 years of government employment post-grad) with the intent of furthering my InfoSec exposure before entering the work force. 

My question is, aside from the pay difference (is it that drastic?), what do typical federal cybersec jobs look like? Is there a major disadvantage to taking this route (master's + gov) to break into InfoSec as opposed to looking for work straight out of undergrad? I'm working on some CompTIA certs and independent projects right now and will try to intern in the Spring, but as of now I don't have much resume fodder so I doubt I'd be able to land a great job off the bat, especially in security. Hence leaning towards the SFS program. Thanks for the input!

Total budget and country of purchase: -
$800 (don't mind stretching it a little). United States.

Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply. 
-Best specifications, don't really like 2-in-1 laptops and I'll have a power source nearby at most times, so the battery life isn't going to make a huge difference.

How important is weight to you? -Not very, but I will be carrying to my place of internship travelling among huge crowds (in Bombay) and to my library at my University (I live on campus)

Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac. 
Windows

**Do you have a preferred screen size? 
14"" minimum - 15.6""

**Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. 
No heavy duty editing or anything of that sort but I will be playing the recently released games like Batman, GTA, Unchartered, FIFA, etc and those that are yet to come out, like Battlefield

If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want? 
I won't mind playing games on medium settings (or even low)

Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?
The input devices should just be usable (:p). No other such requirements.

Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion. -fill here, remove dashes-
My budget is around 800$, and an SSD would be awesome, if it fits the budget. I'd prefer a matte screen. I also have a 1TB external hard disk. I also wanted to know if I could put games in it and play the after connecting it. He'll buy it online during the Black Friday sale."

I have been working long hours at my internship, so I decided to treat myself and get an upgrade from my 3 year old gaming laptop. I freelance with a few photography studios and it would be nice to be able to use the pc for photoshop as well as gaming. The price on the case isn't listed in the table, but I plan to get it from amazon for $79.99.This brings the final total to $1095. This is my first build so I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions on anything. Thanks!"

I have been trying to find a BA job in my city for months, but there are only a handful of companies that keep BAs on staff. I am looking to relocate, but I can't find a company that is willing to give me shot. Relocating isn't an issue for me, and I'm not even asking for relocation assistance.

I'm working in a systems support job (not help desk, I provide first level troubleshooting for major system issues) to support myself, but now every HR person I interview with seems hesitant to hire me because I am not straight out of college nor currently working in a BA position.

In both my internship and my current role I have been tasked with more responsibilities than others in my position, but that does not seem to impress any recruiter enough for them to seriously consider me.

I want to decide on a path because it is about time to prepare for interviews.

I don't like web dev, QA, devops roles. I had internship in latter two and tried web dev on my own.

My favorite courses were computer architecture, operating systems, somewhat lower level ones. Now, they were also harder and I am not the brightest student but did good enough and enjoyed the challenge. I also am trying to delve into mobile dev and like it a lot more than web dev.

The problem is that my aspiration is to get away from cubicle farms one day. That means freelancing, being a digital nomad working remotely etc. That is impossible without several years of experience in real world and that is fine by me. I found that most remote workers actually do web dev mostly and I don't think that my disdain for it is going to help.

Hence, I'd have to choose between going into something like web dev/mobile to gain experience and then travel and work after a few years, or forget travelling and go for subject areas that interest me and be stuck in a cubicle.

That is the way I see it. Do you have any wise advice? I am young and stupid and know nothing about how real life works in IT world, especially with my aspirations."
4rn525,1,2016-07-07,Job Rejections,a_csulb,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4rn525/job_rejections/,"I am an international student pursuing my master's degree in computer science. Lately, I have faced many rejections with job offers and have put me in a very dark place. I have applied to many companies but wont receive an reply back. I also follow up on jobs but as usual they reply back saying the position has been filled up. To be honest I think I am an intelligent individual (not for the sake of saying it) and better than most individuals. I am happy for my friends who managed to secure jobs somewhere or the other but deep inside it makes me feel like a loser. I have done almost everything right from maintain a Github Repository to creating my own website which summarizes my projects. The main drawback I feel is that I don't have any notable work experience, just a couple of internships here and there. Since the last two months I have been actively seeking for internships but failed to find one. I don't have many friends to recommend me at their workplaces and even those who I thought would help me seemed to show no interest at all. All my friends look down upon me and taunt me whenever they can. It makes me feel very sad as I am on a loan and can't even manage to pull of my living expenses. My parents back in my home country try not to pressurize me and support me but I could feel that they are having a hard time supporting me now. It makes me feel sick to live like this. I just want an opportunity to talk to an employer in person and make him realize that I can be very hardworking and provide a valuable contribution to the company. I don't want to get rejected by a bot who filters my resume and rejects it every time. I am at that point of depression that I just want to talk to someone about my situation and couldn't think of a better place than reddit. Please help me recover from this situation. I am more than happy to share my projects with you people so that you can guide me. This is the last door that I am knocking before I give up. Thank you all for being patient and hearing me out.

4rncbn,1,2016-07-07,Need some advice to keep me on track with college,OriginalWF,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4rncbn/need_some_advice_to_keep_me_on_track_with_college/,"Hey folks, I'm relatively new here to reddit, and from what I've seen on this subreddit A LOT of people ask for advice on what major to choose, so I'm sorry that this is another one of those.

I bounced around a lot. When I first got into college, I started at a community college thinking I would be a police officer. After getting married, I decided I didn't want to endanger myself or my family with my career choice and switched to Business. After working as a tech at Staples, I realized I loved helping people and working with computers, so I switched to CS. After a semester of learning that I like the hardware side of things more, I switched to Computer Engineering. After a semester of realizing I really don't like coding, I switched to Electrical engineering, which is where I am now. 

Shortly after I switched to EE, I was offered an internship at the college I attend basically doing IT for the Civil Engineering. I really love this job. I get to help people and work with computers all day.

I was offered a full-time job at the university to do maintenance on servers and basically do what I've been doing for years but for more money. I have a child now and can't work fulltime while going to school, nor do I have the dedication to do so, so I turned it down. 

I seriously considered taking it though, as I would be comfortable doing this for the rest of my life. This stuff just clicks with me and I find it fun to do for hours on end. The problem I'm having is that I have no experience with EE, only stories from a few ME in my family. I don't know if I will like the profession, and there isn't anywhere near me I could shadow someone. 

My wife advises that I continue with school and graduate, and if I don't like EE, I will be overqualified for an IT job and could probably easily get one. My issue is that if I enjoy what I'm doing, why shouldn't I start working and get going early.

I know what I am giving up, as network engineers and the like make about 45-60k in my area, but I could work up to an IT manager which would net me about 100k depending on where I work. Whereas with EE I would start at about 80k and go up to around 120k.

I would like some discussion about what the ups and downs of each decision may be, as well as some stories if anyone out there is an EE. Thanks a lot in advance!

Sorry about the wall of text, I figured I needed to get the whole story and honestly this just felt good to write out.

tl;dr BS in EE or jump straight into work?"

4rqbdu,5,2016-07-07,Internship at an app startup wants to switch to PHP from Java even though I know nothing about PHP.,Cnyms,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4rqbdu/internship_at_an_app_startup_wants_to_switch_to/,"I'm currently an intern at an app startup and began developing the back end using Java (with Spring and Hibernate). I've been developing with Java for a few years now and it's what I'm learning in school as well. 


Just last week, the front end developers told me they want me to use PHP now and want me to use a framework called ""laravel"" simply because it's a very popular framework. The only problem with that is I've NEVER used PHP, I've been developing with Java for around 4 years now, and I've already done a lot of development in Java.


I tried to tell them I'd prefer to stick to Java but they insist this is a better path to take. My questions for all of you are:

 * Should I simply scrap my current work, learn PHP and go forth with their preference of PHP?

 * If not, how can I convince them to let me develop the back end using Java? 


I'm simply frustrated as I've already put a lot of effort into the Java back end and looking for some guidance on the situation. I do not mind learning a new language as I love broadening my knowledge as an aspiring developer. I'm simply not comfortable with PHP whatsoever, so attempting to develop using PHP in an enterprise application seems like a recipe for failure.

**EDIT -** This is a startup, so there's no infrastructure in place. We could choose any language to develop in but they're insisting on PHP after already letting me develop for around a month in Java."

4rqmqf,1,2016-07-07,I need help for moving out,Financiallylost01,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4rqmqf/i_need_help_for_moving_out/,"(X-post from personal finances) 

 Before I get started I would like to just ask that you guys dont just comment “move out” or “You're an adult , just move out “ as this is honestly the only advice I seem to get and I am already aware. I’ve been trying to move out for years. This advice only makes me feel worse about my situation.

I’m gonna be 24 in a week. I still live at home despite my attempts to move out. I really really really want to and it’s actually all I really think about. I often have dreams about it but I just cant make it happen. I need advice on how to do this. I’m becoming increasingly desperate to the point where my I feel hopeless and lost .
Now my situation is a little different because I live in New York City. You cannot rent an apartment for under 1k of monthly rent and that’s cheap. These are also in bad neighborhoods (Which I was born and raised in so I dont have a problem living in it for a year or two more). I want to move out of NYC , I hate it here and it’s my ultimate goal to move out but the problem is that I still havent finished college. I work in IT and my major is psychology . Yes I know it’ll probably be useless but I’ve put more then 4 years into my education and I dont want it to go to waste. I feel like having a B.A will be a good “fall back” job.

Now my passion isnt IT. I dont love it . The reason I went into it was so I could get a job to afford to move out . My passion is animals and although I wanted to be a vet, it’s just not possible for me to become one and I ended up getting kicked out of college because I kept trying to force myself to stay a biology major so I could apply to vet school. It was too late when I changed my major to psychology because I had already been on probation and then kicked out .

Heres my living situation :
 I live with my mother and 2 brothers in a small 2 bed room apartment. Before my dad and sister lived with us but my dad passed away and my sister got married and moved. I spent most of my life sharing a room with my brothers but my older brother (35) isnt mentally stable so I decided to move over to my mother's room when my father passed away. I’ve been sharing a bed with her for about 2 years since.
I’m currently working in as an IT intern for $10/hr I’ve been dismissed from college but have reapplied (there's like an %80 ill be let back in) for next semester. I am 15-17 credits away (not including classes I may have to take to raise my GPA over a 2.0 ) I have one IT certification that I got from a program that helps those in poverty find work in IT. They find me jobs that I otherwise wouldn't get on my own. I am working on two additional certifications (Which will be tough) I have an associates in liberal arts.

Heres what I will have when I’m ready to go
6-1 year of IT experience 7 months of customer service as a pet stylist 10k + in savings No debt A job that pays at least 15/hr or 30 k (I dont think I can make more ) An associates with 17 credits missing for a B.A in psychology

Heres what I want advice on
I keep seeing apartments want 30k-40k in salary to let you rent. How do poorer people rent then? I know I should get roommates but I’m having a hard time finding any as I dont have many girlfriends who are willing to move out . How can I even rent an apartment if I dont make at least 45k? Even low income apartments , given out via lottery, sometimes needs this much. I will be applying the the lesser ones though. Also do I need a full year of work to rent? I wont have that either so I wont have taxes to show , just pay stubs.
I have a boyfriend but the problem is that he is turning 21 next month (will be 21 when I move out) and I’ve explained to him the situation with time and time again. Although I can see he has had his doubts, he has offered to move in with me but I’ve rejected him because of these factors -He is young - He works a min wage paying job (well almost ,10/hr) - He wouldnt be able to work fulltime as he has applied to nursing school and I wouldnt want that load on him as his studies will be rigorous - He lives in a three story house with his family. His own room, free food, no bills paid, car. Wouldn't it be unfair to ask him to leave all this behind to work part time , have almost his whole check go into rent (I’ll cover all our other expenses ) while he studies?
I mean having him as my roommate will def help , he could pay half the rent and ill pay everything else which I think is possible if we budget correctly.

I really only want to stay in the city until I finish college ,then move away somewhere where the cost of living is cheaper . For now im desperate . I dont want to rent a room with strangers and I dont have much willing friends. I feel really trapped in the mess I’ve made of my life and I am ashamed . How can I afford to move out? How does anyone actually do this? Any advice for any part of my life is greatly appreciated"

My sneaking intuition is that I often use the old email address I used years back and got rejected with and maybe that login developed a 'low score', is this a realistic possibility?

Another problem is that without face-to-face recruitment, I doubt I will get a fair chance online. It's just too competitive for just one spot

4rtnj1,3,2016-07-08,The Bird Island Raptor,Hack_Shuck,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4rtnj1/the_bird_island_raptor/,"This didn’t happen to myself; it happened to my close friend Gillian about 12 years ago. I was previously aware of the bare bones of the story, but not all of the details, as she never liked to talk about it. However I recently told her about this subreddit and how awesome and addictive it is, and (don’t ask me how) I’ve persuaded her to spill the beans. She does not want me to reveal the exact location of the place where these events took place, as she knows a few people who still work around there; in her field of work, everyone sort of knows everyone else, and she doesn’t want to ruffle any feathers. So I will refer to this place as ‘Bird Island’.


She told me all of this last night over a bottle of wine, believe me I have never felt more in need of a drink in my life. I made notes and have tried to present her testimony as accurately as possible. Over to Gillian:


“When I was studying for a biology degree, specializing in ‘habitat diversity’, I had the opportunity to obtain some rare work experience conducting daily wildlife surveys on an uninhabited island off the coast of the UK. For a single week, in mid-August, I would take a boat out to Bird Island and spend most of the day counting the numbers of various species of birds which nested there, as well as collecting data on the breeding numbers of a particular species, known as the black guillemot, which had only recently re-established a breeding colony there, must to the excitement of ornithologists.


These surveys were undertaken literally every week of the year, six days a week, by a team of three professional conservationists who took turns visiting the island, but on that particular week, no-one was available. I jumped at the chance, as this entire field of work is insanely competitive, and anything of this nature looks great on your CV. I know of some great guys who have doctorates in biology and biodiversity and similar disciplines, and they are literally begging for work as unpaid interns just to gain some crucial experience.


So anyway, I accompanied one of the regular staff to Bird Island for three days, so he could show me the ropes. To be honest, he was quite an eccentric guy who made repeated clumsy attempts to hit on me, but I never felt uncomfortable in his presence, as he seemed pretty harmless, and I doubt he is linked to the strange events that followed. I just got the impression he was very lonely, and to be fair, it is lonely work. He taught me how to count large numbers of birds, which isn’t as tricky as it sounds, and of course to identify the different species on the island, including razorbills, kittiwakes and cormorants, which are also known as “shags”, which is hilarious if you are British and immature, like I am.


He told me the history of the island, which is classed as a ‘Special Protection Area’, which basically means that no-one is allowed to visit without a damn good reason. Nobody has lived there for over a thousand years. There used to be a monastery there but all that remains of it is a few scattered stones. Local legend has it that a terrible plague of rats devoured all of the monks food one winter, but they refused to leave the island, believing that God would provide for them. So every day they prayed for sustenance in their increasingly weakened states, but I guess God expects you to have a little bit more common sense than that, as every monk except one starved to death. Or so the story goes.


The rats returned about 100 years ago, accidentally reintroduced, probably due to Victorian sight-seers taking pleasure trips out to the Island. It is located about three miles from the mainland but only about 300 yards from a much larger, inhabited island, which would be my home for this unusual summer holiday job. Bird Island is less than half a mile long, and about 200 feet high at it’s highest point, with extremely steep sides which can only safely be scaled by the use of an ancient set of steps, allegedly carved by the monks over many centuries, which wind their way gradually up to an uneven grassy plateau. It’s similar to the island at the end of the most recent Star Wars film in that it is rugged, untamed and breathtaking.


There is no fresh water except rainwater, and nothing much ever grew there, food-wise. There is only one way to access the island and that is via a small wooden jetty built within a natural harbor. All around the rest of the island there is nothing but sheer cliff faces, and shallow sea-caves. Apart from the grass on top, the island is grayish-black, very craggy, and on literally every ledge and outcrop there sits a bird or two. So how do you count literally thousands of birds? By guessing, is the short answer. You sort of count the birds in an imaginary “block” in your head, and then extrapolate that figure over the whole island. I could go into more detail, but I will spare you that.


The other main part of my job was to play a recording of a black guillemots mating call into the entrance of every tunnel and cave on the top of the island, and wait to hear if there was a response. These babies were the real reason we were there. The rats had completely wiped them out very quickly a century ago by first stealing their eggs, and then when that supply ran out, by grabbing and devouring the birds themselves. The other species were decimated too, but managed to cling on in smaller numbers, until finally a couple of years before I came to Bird Island, the rats were systematically poisoned. And et voila, the black guillemots returned. But rats are great survivors, and so our job was to ensure that the bird numbers were increasing and breeding future colonies, free from predatory eyes.


The first time I approached the island by myself, in a little motor boat on very calm water, I felt a sense of anxiety due to the sheer isolation of the place. I remember deeply regretting my decision to accept the job, and my hands were shaking so badly that it took several attempts for me to tie the boat’s rope to a post on the jetty. But I shook off these feelings of unease as I began ascending the hundreds of stone steps, stopping several times to make my counts of the different bird species, at the vantage points which my associate had shown me. Despite him being a bit of a creep, I wished he was still there with me that day, especially when I reached the plateau to find a pathway trodden down in the long dry grass, snaking off into the distance, in an area which I was sure neither of us had walked through. But I dismissed this as my mistake, and besides, I couldn’t exactly abandon the job on day one just because of a bit of crushed grass.


My mood improved as I began the task of playing the bird calls on my little tape recorder, as I heard the distinctive response of a black guillemot from about half of the small cave entrances, a sure sign that they were nesting there in good numbers. It took me about five hours to check every cave and tunnel; some of these stretched all the way down to the ocean below, and were just about wide enough for a person to fit through. Or fall through. I had to watch my footing with great care. Another danger was a huge number of small potholes scattered about, hidden by the grass, which could have easily led to a broken ankle. I had no way to contact anyone from up there, as my only means of communication was an old-fashioned radio on the boat. If I didn’t return to the small hotel on the larger nearby island, the staff there would have eventually noticed my absence and sent help, but I still could have faced several hours alone and in pain.


Things went well for the first couple of days, and I soon fell in love with the place. I will never forget eating my sandwiches with my feet dangling over the edge of a 200-foot drop, with nothing ahead of me except the midday sun and several thousand miles of Atlantic ocean, with sea-birds circling and suddenly diving for fish. But soon my edginess began to creep back. Doubts began to surface about me having the island all to myself. On the third or fourth day, I dropped the practice of eating lunch with my back the island, as when I stood and turned around, I saw what looked like more trampled grass than one set of feet would have made. I called out “who’s there?” And immediately felt stupid when only five thousand cormorants answered.


I began to work faster, looking forward to Saturday, my last day of the job. But still I took great care to be as accurate as possible, as I take a huge pride in any work such as this. I had seen no evidence of rats so far, and found more black guillemot nests than expected, which was all cause for celebration. However, I was starting to find some strange discrepancies in my recorded notes, as some of the caves and narrow passageways had seemingly contained birds one day but not the next, which made no sense, unless they were perhaps becoming wise to my presence.


Things started to go badly wrong on the Friday. The sea became a little bit choppier, not so much to be dangerous but enough to put my nerves on edge. It had rained in the night, and the steps were treacherously slippery, with nothing much to hold onto as I climbed. The birds were not co-operating so much in my counts, constantly taking off, circling, and landing again in a different place, making any degree of accuracy impossible. To make things worse, the feelings I had of being watched seemed to magnify that day, and I felt jumpy and unsafe, constantly looking back over my shoulder. And when I reached the plateau I was greeted by a dead black guillemot, clearly left for me to find. I turned the bird over in my hand, it was beautiful and surprisingly heavy, it’s feathers soft and smooth. There were no bite-marks, no blood. I couldn’t say for sure, but thought the thing had been throttled to death.


I angrily cried out “If you have a problem with me, fine, but don’t take it out on a bird, you freak!” and this disturbance made several hundred birds of all kinds take to the air and begin to call out deafeningly. The pandemonium still hadn’t subsided when I left for the day, and I was in a terrible mood and unable to concentrate on my work. I could barely hear the calls from inside the caves and crevices, and they seemed to be far fewer in number than the previous day.


So Saturday came around at last, and it rained hard all day, but the sea wasn’t too bad. And I had gotten pretty good at handling the boat by then. As I tied the boat to the post on the jetty I felt good in spite of everything. I think I was buoyed by the thought that soon my experience here would be over, and I could get back to the mainland that night and sink a few pints of beer and reflect. The birds more cooperative that day as I counted them; in fact they seemed subdued, perhaps due to the bad weather. The steps were a nightmare again, but I took my time and great care, as I was determined not to rush that day and make a mess of everything. I was startled though to hear a commotion from up on the plateau, which consisted of the unmistakable sounds of many black guillemots, normally very quiet birds. I finished my counts for the final time, and as I placed my notebook away, I remember keeping the pen firmly gripped in my fist, in case I needed a weapon.


I approached the summit in a state of fear, and was not surprised to find another black guillemot lying on the ground, this one still flapping a wing as if only recently attacked. I could tell pretty quickly that both its wings had been broken. This cemented my resolve, though. Whatever was going on, I was going to finish the job I been sent there to do. And besides, I told myself, this could all just be a bunch of weird coincidences, combined with my mind playing tricks. Who wouldn’t be a little spooked, spending their first week on their own private island?


I made my way around the same dark cave entrances, playing the recording on my cassette player and hearing even less responses than previously. Hardly a surprise, I thought, if some jerk was indeed going around murdering all the birds. A few times, as I crouched down to listen, I thought I heard dull footsteps, near the top of the steps, but due to the sound of the increasingly heavy rain, I couldn’t be sure what I was hearing. When I was on the very far side of the island, near where I had sat and ate lunch on more carefree days, I thought I glimpsed something moving, then ducking down into the long grass as I stood up and stared in it’s direction. But by the time I had raised my binoculars, there was nothing to see. It had seemed big, maybe six feet tall, and very thin. But it could have been nothing. The lenses were already hazy from the rain, anyway. I might have seen it again a little later, but again I couldn’t be sure. I was cursing my luck to be so isolated and drenched on such a miserable rock. But soon I had finished recording my data, and i hurried back across the island, not taking as much care to avoid the holes in the rocky ground as I should have.


But as I passed one of the larger caves, not far from the steps which led down to the jetty, I was stopped in my tracks by the sound of a black guillemots mating call, more loud and clear than any I had heard before. It should only have made this call in response to the prompt either from my cassette or a potential mate. I leaned down, and listened carefully. This opening was maybe three feet across, and like all of these caves it was absolutely pitch dark inside. I slowly reached for my tape recorder, but before I pressed the ‘play’ button, I heard the call again. And again. And again.


Followed by a cough. A human cough.


I backed away, in a state of shock, and very nearly put my foot into a deep, nasty pothole. “Who is there?” I demanded, then repeated. There was nothing for a long time, then the call again, but different. Deeper, more masculine. I ran, taking no care at all with the steps but literally leaping down, several at a time. I looked back up the hill whenever I could, but the steps meandered so much that you couldn’t always see very far up. I had almost reached the jetty when I saw to my horror, over a cliff edge, that my little boat had been untied, and was bobbing in the sea about forty feet away from the island. I hurried to the end of the wooden platform and wasted no time in lowering myself into the freezing British sea. Even in the summertime, it is horrendous.


The boat was clearly accelerating away with each wave, but I have always been a strong swimmer and soon I managed to grab onto the loose rope which I was sure I had tied firmly to the post a few hours previously, and with a considerable struggle I clambered aboard and started the engine, emitting curse-words with every breath. I steered the boat around in an arc and was soon speeding away, with fury in my eyes. I scanned the top of the island for the final time, but saw nothing. No-one. I cannot begin to tell you how much easier my nights would have been ever since that wretched week, if I had just been given indisputable confirmation that some utter arsehole had been on that island with me. Instead I am left to endlessly replay the events in my head, to try to convince myself that I didn’t lose my mind. Though I rarely replay the voice from that cave. When I am awake, anyway.


What happened next? Nothing much. The police found no trace of anyone in their half-hour search of the island. I complained to my university, who had arranged the work experience on my behalf, but there wasn’t much that they could do beyond recommend that in future, all surveys on similar islands are conducted in pairs. However, I know for a fact that in the years since, female students have gone back there alone.


The environmental organisation which managed the island were very nice to me, but I sensed from the beginning that they didn’t believe my claims. Their logic was that no-one could have spent a week living on the island without leaving more and clearer signs of their presence, so if anyone had been there, it must have been local kids messing around. Even though the island is meant to be off-limits, they told me that they were aware of quite a few people sneaking onto it, and that unofficially, one of the reasons they conduct such regular surveys there was so that trespassers might thusly be discouraged. Great! So I was an unpaid security guard. They also suggested that perhaps I hadn’t tied the boat’s rope securely enough on that last day, or perhaps the rain had somehow loosened the knot, which seems ridiculous to me.


What’s especially unsettling is a thought which didn’t occur to me until much later: how did the creep know that Saturday was to be my last day on the island, and save his meanest tricks for that day? Had he been watching the other surveyors come and go, knowing that they always had Sundays off? And had he been waiting for a female to be there all alone?”"

Throwaway account because I don't really want to reveal information about myself. I recently got my CS degree. Have a 3.296 final GPA. Have trouble translating what exactly a CS degree qualifies me for. It's hard even getting companies to even respond and I don't know what to do. I feel comfortable with the idea of technical interviews, but I haven't been able to secure them. 

I had an internship in QA automation, but to be honest, I hated every second of doing it. I didn't push myself through school just to be put in a corner and fix broken tests in a department with high turnover. Said company was only hiring for these positions and the pay was really low for my area. Since then I had a remote contract doing swe/consulting but said client stopped responding/paying after hitting a major deliverable. 

Is it normal for a CS grad to have seemingly no stable prospects? 

Is there some secret to finding actual salaried positions? 


edit: Missed a word in the title. '6+ Months out from a CS degree' is what I meant to say.
This just feels like a big bait and switch to go from doing well in school(and leaving another career to pursue school), to teetering on poverty now due to unemployment and no means to even begin paying off loans. 

Sorry if this seems like a rant, it probably is.

Im a current student trying to apply to an internship I really want, luckily for me they're seeking to hire students for internships in pr, I don't have much experience in the field but I've studied it thoroughly and I've met all of their qualifications, the company is essentially asking for this:

-Cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher.
-Experience with MS Office, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook.
-Prior experience working in an office setting, including answering phones and emails.
-Social media proficiency.
-Experience in community engagement, corporate citizenship &amp; social responsibility, event planning, urban development, or social media/branding a plus

I'm in the process of trying to polish it up, I know the volunteering section looks kind of messy but I wanted them to know I've engaged with the community since that seems to be a of substantial importance to the position.
Thank you kind strangers of the reddit community in advice."

I've been searching since then for a ""real job"" without luck. I studied Communications focused on film and TV production. It was a state school, so the film/TV program was not of any renown, nor did it allow me to get hands-on experience with real, professional equipment. I had at first been searching for film and television production jobs, at big companies like ESPN and ABC, as well as production assistant jobs at local news channels. No such luck. I ended up working retail, spent a few months in LA working as a production assistant, and now I'm back working retail and trying to be a production assistant on the side. I'm living in a state (MA) where the film/TV industry is not very active so it's difficult to find jobs in that vein.

At this point, I'm trying to find a ""real job"" AKA a 9-5 M-F professional-type job that pays better than retail. Preferably, it'd be something still in-state or not far away as my girlfriend has another year left of college and I'd like to be close to her. The big problem I'm having though is finding the ""right"" job. The ones I have applied to I haven't even made it to the interview round. I'm struggling to find a job that I would be a good fit for that I can apply to. I wasn't able to take any internships in university as I was paying my way through by working in the off-semesters. What kind of jobs would be good for a Communications degree with no internship experience? What kind of industries and job titles should I be looking into and applying for? I'd love to take on an internship, though sadly they seem to be only for students. I'd love to work in media of some sort, but I'm keeping an open mind. Thanks for any and all help!"

I'm definitely learning a lot in the internship, but I'm wondering what I should learn in my free time, especially after the internship ends.

I want to get better at web development, so I was thinking about learning and doing more projects in React and getting really good at JavaScript (currently I'm not). To do this I would probably work on some full-stack web app projects. 

On the other hand, I'm much more interested in actual Computer Science over development - I'd prefer reading CLRS and studying machine learning/AI, and doing ML/neural network related projects. 

What does reddit think I should focus on this summer, and what would overall be better for my career (aspiring to be a high-ranking engineer at a startup)? Learning webdev and a lot of front end, or focusing on core CS concepts and ML (an area that I enjoy the most)?

4rxuzv,29,2016-07-08,[Internship/very long post..] I don't understand how my internship is going horribly and don't know how to improve the situation.,gallowboobthrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4rxuzv/internshipvery_long_post_i_dont_understand_how_my/,"[Sorry for the rant-ishness of the post]

tl;dr = Manager doesn't think I've achieved project MVP goals, even though I have. Stuck on project I feel is done. Manager gives vibe that he thinks I'm dumb.

Personally, no, I do not think the internship has been going badly. I was given an intern specific project to do with another department. I've achieved all the 'milestones' that were outlined in the MVP plan. I started out with no knowledge of what I was doing, and got no output the first 2.5 weeks. But I'm done way ahead of schedule. There were some stretch goals in the MVP, which we didn't think we would achieve during the internship. I started and finished all of those this afternoon after lunch. I feel like after all this time,  I know what I'm doing and I'm very comfortable with frameworks, and the codebase.

However, I think my manager thinks I'm an idiot. He is a really nice guy, and I respect his leadership, so it's not that I have any personal issue with him. He has never looked at my code, or commits (even commit messages). I think he was under the impression that the hardest part of the project could be done by using a library (it can't, there isn't a library that could do that). He mentioned 2.5 weeks ago that maybe it was time for me to get my modularized code into the framework. I told him I had done that more than a month before. I'm not sure now if believed me then.

I gave a mini-presentation to him and 10 other devs (apparently it's the halfway point of the project?). And I made the app really simple and straightforward to use. So I was done walking through the app in a couple of minutes.  He asked a number of questions about features in the app he thought should be there, and my answers were either 
1. I already have that feature, here let me show you, OR 
2. I have that feature built already, but it's not supposed to be shown in the UI, I'm waiting on the other department to provide analytics which would dynamically change the UI, but everything is set to go.

The questions other devs asked were all related to design decisions, which were all decided by my manager, and I basically just spend 15 mins defending his design and his reasoning. And some really weird moments where some devs suggested ""you know what would be really cool, if you could....."" and these were followed by me answering ""it already does that, i showed it to you, lemme show it again"", or ""that would not be possible, due to other department""

After the meeting, he mentioned that there were still milestones to achieve for the MVP, and mentioned all the things he had asked about (which I had already talked to him about and showed those were there already). I don't know how I could explain it any better to him. To be honest, I had been getting a weird vibe that there must be something I'm missing, but I asked my mentor(who's seen all my code) about milestones, and he said my app achieves all of them. I want to move on from this project and work on some production apps with them, but it doesn't look like I'm going to be allowed to move on from this project until I achieve those ""goals""...

I was extremely downcast after the mini-presentation, and I don't feel some of the good work I've done or progress I've made have been genuinely looked at by anyone other than my mentor.


Genuine question: How do improve interpersonal skills so that this kind of situation does not happen? I feel like this internship is fucked now anyways (in terms of chances of getting hired full time), so I'm just asking for future.

This is not the way I want it. I want good looking games to be able to look the way they are supposed to, even if I've got 20 reddit tabs and several other applications running in the background.

What do you recommend me doing? What is worth spending money on? Should I try to find another 5870, or just a new card? If so, what card? Should I buy something else? I'm not a very rich man of any kind, but some money might be worth spending.

My current build is:

To cool I use a Noctua somethingsomething big and quiet and a few smaller fans.
I use 2 modern 24"" monitors and run windows 7, 64bit.

I did some basic testing just now, by running black ops 3 (settings at lowest possible, still some lags) (first time playing! Not impressed):
The GPU got up to 83 celsius, and was said to have 96% activity. Its fan ran at 50% or close to it.
The CPU really bounced up and down from 20% to almost a 100. Temperature at 50-60 Celsius.
My RAM was at 5.75GB or more, out of the 6GB I've got.
No, the SSD is not full or almost there.
Worst thing is windows telling me every component is high end, just like when it was bought.

She is a single woman who's never been married and has never had kids. She owns (totally paid off) a 4 bedroom home in the suburbs of Longmont, CO. She's been renting out the 3 rooms she doesn't use to people who want to stay long term and people who are just here for weekends for concerts, festivals, conventions, etc. Her fee ranges from $30 per night to $49 per night (depending on how much business there is). However, her primary tenants are those who rent for about 3 months (usually for a summer internship). She has an Airbnb listing which is used to make the initial payment. I personally asked her to let me pay for a full 3 months on Airbnb right away since it was available and I had no intention of hopping around all summer while I worked full time. However, she insisted on me simply paying for one month. I agreed because she seemed like she knew what she was talking about when she said that, ""perhaps you should do a trial month and see how you like it."" So I only paid the first month via Airbnb. When it was time to pay for another month, she asked me to pay cash so she could, ""avoid Uncle Sam."" So at this point, I realized that I was already in her trap. She's clearly trying to pocket as much as possible by not paying taxes. This week, she gave me a 1 month notice. She is kicking me out. I work full time, I come home, watch netflix on my laptop, then sleep. I have zero presence here. And just so you know, the place is actually super gross and she micro-manages her tenants and does not allow them to have any privacy... so for $900 per month, I've been without privacy and living in a place similar to Section 8 housing in terms of cleanliness/spatial quality. I've woken up in the middle of the night with bugs crawling on me multiple times (this is one of many examples of the lack of cleanliness here). I'm definitely going to report this. Many people who have passed through have expressed their disdain. We aren't even allowed to do our own laundry because the laundry room is located in such a way that you'd have to pass through her personal space. So if she's allowed to literally go through our dirty laundry in order to preserve her privacy, why does she have a rule stating that we should leave our doors open when we leave the house so she knows we aren't home? That's just sketchy. I've come home to find many of my things rearranged and various sticky notes saying that she wants certain windows open and saying that when I brush my teeth, I should turn on the the hot and cold water at the same time. Of course, none of this was listed on Airbnb. She just put all the good stuff on there and then when we arrive, like a new born with no clue about the fresh environment around us, she lays on these rules before we have time to truly assess the situation and know what's actually going on. So how does she have 5 stars on Airbnb? Well, let me tell you about how she approaches her tenants (including myself) saying that we should both give each other 5 stars. This woman's ability to manipulate others is the only thing that's 5 stars about her. So that's my rant. Yes, I've reported the inaccuracy of her listing to Airbnb. Now, I'm here wondering how I would go about reporting this. Perhaps the fire department would do something about how she's managed to create a physical embodiment of a fire hazard. Perhaps the city and their tenancy laws have rules about renting your spaces and the number of people you rent out to and reporting that on taxes. And finally, speaking of taxes, since she's making around $5,000 per month of pure profit from these renters (that's about $60,000 per year....higher than the average american income) I'm sure the IRS would deem this worthy of their time. I want to make sure I report this in the most efficient, most successful way possible. Any advice on how to start? I definitely want to get this right the first time around."

I was wondering if anyone can offer me any advice? Basically, I messed up during high school. I did not care to learn, and my parents were fine with me getting horrible grades. I never got into trouble or anything like that. School was just the last thing that was on my mind.

Since I have been out of high school I have worked a few different jobs, but I always felt like I was wasting my time. I finally had the realization that my life was going nowhere, and I needed to figure out something quickly. I decided to start taking online courses from my community college when was 24. I have completed 2 years of general education courses and electives so far. The biggest thing that is holding me back right now is math. I started at the very bottom. I just finished college algebra in the spring, and I am doing trigonometry over the summer. I will finally be able to get into CS classes this fall (college algebra was a pre-requisite). Starting over in math has been a tremendous help though. Math was always my worst subject in high school, and my overall grade from last semester was a 99%.

Sometimes I feel discouraged because I have such a long ways to go before graduating college. I might be 29 or 30 by the time I am done. Is anyone going to take me seriously when I am looking for a job? I see people on here that are way younger than me getting insane job offers. I would love to have a great career working for a big company someday, but I think I'd be perfectly happy with getting an average job.

What can I do while I am in school to give me an edge? I am trying to get the most out of every single class I take, especially math. I have been trying to teach myself as much as I can, but it is hard knowing what to learn. I am building a website to demonstrate my abilities and host my projects. I am keeping my gpa at a 4.0 right now, and I'm hoping that this will help me get an internship next summer.

Personal Backstory: I'm a millennial in my early 20's and I work in HealthIT for a very large company. I initially started on the Systems Administration team as a intern and was lucky enough to get hired on as a FTE. I have been a FTE for 2 years now and I love my job. Especially the people on my team.

Cloud Teams Backstory: The cloud team was initially brought in because the company wanted to do HCM (Human Capital Management) as all the good HCM products were cloud only, but that project has never taken off as it has been delayed for over a year. They had another large project to push all of our administrative staff to O365, exchange was configured for a hybrid mode and our MDM has been configured to work with it and our governance committee had initially approved the O365 cost, but now they have backed out while not officially saying no.

Company Politics: We are public and used to love CapEx and hate OpEx, we don't do charge backs so currently if a team requests a server they wait about 1-1.5 weeks and they never see a bill for it even if it is a physical server that barely gets used. Whipe the cloud team will be doing charge backs to the correct department and they plan on letting existing teams do alot of the Systems management. We can all tell we are about to get bought as well as our stock has depreciated over the past year when we made a very large acquisition.

Earlier this week I was approached by our company's cloud team to come and join them, I have worked with one of them several times and I enjoy working with them on some smaller scale projects. Though I haven't been previously involved in any of their larger projects like O365 etc. They approached me because of my ability to grasp concepts and my PowerShell scripting skills which are some of the best at the company. 

When I asked what the job would entail I was told that they are not interested in IaaS but more SaaS, specifically with integrating SaaS services in with a product called Okta we bought but failed to make work yet. They have successfully pushed our company's website based on SiteCore to AWS and it is much better than it was when it was hosted on premise.


I am going to be meeting with the cloud team manager here next week to discuss some of the finer points of the job but my current thoughts on it right now like this. In my current position I do entirely on premise work and i almost never have the chance to make anything redundant even though we have a true data center owned by the company and a tier 3 Colo that we use for our DR site. Our operations VP had mandated that our DR site is warm and not active active even though we have a 1Gb WAN circuit and a 10Gb PtP circuit between the sites. I also currently have to work with aged technology due to our current operations VP, we have no distribution layer, our core at the DC is a pair of 6500s and our server access layer is 2960G closest switches without dual power supplies. I also am banned from working with blades or even Hyper Converged as the operations VP micro manages about everything.


I have mentioned what the cloud teams vision is earlier in this post, but my personal opinions are with the current state of the company it seems a bit Rocky but I feel like it would be a move in the right direction considering where I am in my career. As well as some of the larger companies have big cloud initiatives as the future seems to be going to large auto scaling systems.


TLDR; Got approached by our companies cloud team, I think I know what I should do but I want some more opinions from people who are more experienced and it been in the same boat as me.


Also yes this is my Systems throwaway account.

Edit: Added some more information about the cloud team and the financials."

Now, I am currently stuck in suspense. At the beginning of this summer (around June 10th) I was sent an email from Intel that said along the lines that they were ""impressed with my coursework and academic experience"" and stated that ""[they] have the following internship that matches your qualifications"" and gave me a detailed overview of the Internship. Great! I was brewing with excitement and sent back the appropriate response (they asked a few questions about start times, locations, etc.) and then they sent me an email stating that I would be contacted by a hiring manager soon to follow up on the selection process. I waited. Fast forward to last week, I was sent another email from Intel, and they sent me another internship opportunity that was almost identical to the first, but at a different location and sooner time (which was great and what I wanted). Same thing again. However, I am still waiting on that first follow up...

**tl;dr: Got sent a potential internship possibility, waited for nearly a month, got sent another internship possibility, unsure about wait times for hiring managers contact**

... and so right now, I am lost. Does that second email imply that they are restarting the selection process for me? Do hiring managers typically take a long time to get back to prospective interns? How would they contact me? I am worried that I may have missed something and will miss the opportunity to intern at a very reputable company. This is my first *potential* internship possibility, and I just finished my first year of college (19 years old, upcoming Sophomore).

Unfortunately the city I live in has hardly any tech companies, and the next big city is two hours away. The local classifieds don't really have any software jobs available either. I also feel like I may not have the best networking opportunities here.

Should I consider transferring schools because of this? I love the city I'm in and my school has a decent CS program, but if I can't land a job/internship here while I'm still in school then would transferring be a good idea? 

I am planning on moving once I graduate. "

As a female college student who will be on the search for software engineering jobs in a few years, this question feels especially relevant to me.

How are women treated in terms of hiring decisions for internships and jobs in your company? Do they really have an ""advantage"" due to being less represented? Have you heard/seen others consider them to be less capable? Is gender not taken into consideration at all, or are they treated differently in any way, and if so, how?

Thanks to anyone who decides to answer!"

However, it's not just about the money. I have never really been taken seriously my whole life., I want to feel like I have a voice. I want to feel like I'm making a difference. I have a very deep core desire for the world around me to make sense. I constantly look at what things are, and what they could be. 

For example, my company is shifting their core technology stack to a much more manageable platform. I raised this exact same concern with the exact same solution three years earlier as an intern and was completely ignored by the leadership, and was even told that I should pipe down and not challenge the status quo. Three years later, a new senior VP is hired, and he brings up the same thing I said, and all of a sudden everyone is totally on board. 

I want to be an executive. I want to be a CIO/CTO. I want to be able to bring my forward looking ideas under consideration and not merely be brushed off as a junior app developer. This is my end goal. I am restless trying to figure out how to achieve it. I don't want to climb the ladder and not deserve it though. I want to put in the work. I want to be that good. I just don't know how where to start to begin to realize this ambition.

I am a rising Senior.

Cost is not really a factor to be perfectly honest, and I would prefer the private route than the public one. California, of course, has one of the best public university systems in the world so it is a great fallback plan for me.

**Intended Major:** Either Economics/Business or Political Science

**Academics:** My GPA is 3.56 UW/3.83W (3.25 Freshman year, 3.5 Sophomore year, 3.92 Junior year - health issues brought me down in Freshman year that my counselor/teachers will probably mention). 

I took mostly all honors courses my Freshman and Sophomore years (no APs allowed first two years) and took 4 weighted classes (maximum allowed) my Junior year. I will take 3 weighted classes next year.

I have taken the SAT once and got a 2170 (770M, 730CR, 670W). I also scored 1500 on the PSAT, so National Merit is likely. As for Subject Tests, I got a 790 in Korean and I am awaiting results for US History which I took in June. I will take Literature and possibly World in the fall.

**Extracurriculars: (probably strongest part of application)** I have participated in DECA since freshman year and have won (1st place) at the state level twice. I have qualified for the International level twice as well, and placed 2nd and 8th there. I also participated in National History Day (Documentary) and was a Regional Champion twice and 2nd place at States. I have been a part of my school newspaper (nationally accredited), where I have held the positions of Advertising Manager and Web Editor. Also related to journalism, I  interned for Stanford's newspaper for two years. I interned for my local State Senator for two years (doing voter analysis, data collection, etc), and gained 180+ volunteer hours. My last internship was (probably the most impressive one) at a Sand Hill venture capital firm. I also did one year of Public Forum debate (third place at a low-level tournament - not that impressive, I know), and one year of Junior State of America. Lastly, I have been a varsity member of the golf team since my Freshman year.

That being said, please chance me for Notre Dame (both College of Arts and Sciences and Mendoza), Emory (both Atlanta and Oxford), Boston College (College of Arts and Sciences), and Claremont McKenna.

I will (likely) be applying Early Decision to Emory (Atlanta) or Restrictive Early Action to Notre Dame and Boston College.

My test scores, course rigor, ECs, recs, and essays are fine, but my Freshman and Sophomore year GPA hold me back (largely due to health problems that led to missing quite a bit of school).

My top 3 schools are Notre Dame, Boston College, and Emory. I visited and fell in love with all 3, and would gladly attend any of them. That being said, Notre Dame is probably my #1 choice.

Would I have a better chance of getting in through REA to Notre Dame/Boston College, or ED1 to Emory (Atlanta)?

This has been a long time coming. I'm within commuting distance to NYC (live in Long Island) so I know opportunities are plentiful. My mind is open to any type of dev work, but I have realistic expectations. I'm a lifelong PC/Tech enthusiast, been programming as a hobby for a few years. I've got a lot to set me apart from other recent grads, but I'm not sure how to present it all. In no particular order:

* A recent bachelors in computer information systems - a self paced online degree from an accredited state university that I banged out in 6 months in my spare time. (not sure if that'll be seen positively or negatively) More of an IT degree, but it contains some software development and its probably enough to not get my resume immediately tossed.

* 10+ years as a medical laboratory professional, working with a team, high pressure/responsibility, literally making life and death decisions, not just minding machines. I'm not some punk kid straight out of school (no offense guys), a software dev job is like a step down in responsibility because no one will die if I screw up. 

* A variety of trivial to relatively complex personal projects in languages such as C#, VB and Python. 

* One notable project is a program that automated a ton of the rote tasks in my day job, saving me a solid hour or two every day. Completely self conceived and created. It's a several hundred line script written in autohotkey that scans the screen and acts appropriately, automatically carrying out the dozens of little rules and exceptions that all my colleagues have to manually do (if they even remember). It's my dirty little secret, but its a unique solution to a real problem. Its impossible to demonstrate outside the context of our internal system though.

* A self-coded portfolio site in progress to display prior and future projects (my next goal after finishing the BS this month)

* Some collaboration with a professional dev (personal friend) on the most ambitious project 

* Two other BS degrees, one in psychology, the other Cytotechnology

* A genuine passion for programming - I already have a solid career. I'm applying cause I want to, not because I have to. 

* If they'll take my word for it, I'm a very quick learner and highly adaptable. I'm primarily switching because I want a new challenge and I'm completely confident in my ability to figure stuff out. Throw me in the deep end and I'll learn to swim. 

I know employers will stop reading a resume or cover letter if they're not sold in the first few sentences. The number one thing they are all looking for is experience and I don't even have an internship under my belt. I know all of these qualities are meaningful, but if you were me, in what order would you present them? "

I graduated from a masters degree in Computer Science at the end of last year. I then started interning at a small company since January of this year. It's been 6 months now, and feel confident with taking my coding skills to the next level. The company I work for is a Microsoft stack based shop. I am asking the company to convert my internship to a full-time position. If they do that, I will have to stick with them for a year. The pay is very less, but there is not much work pressure except for during release dates, which is fine with me. I am not OK with the pay though. I have student debt to clear.  

Like most people, my dream job is to work for hot companies like google, fb, airbnb, uber etc. And of course to get into them I must have an awesome resume.

Should I invest my time in writing a personal project, and then start practicing coding questions or should I start practicing coding questions right away? It should take me about 6 months to practice all questions on leetcode or interviewbit. It might take me a month to write a personal project. The career-fair at my college would be at the beginning of September and February next year. 

Does having a personal project have any advantage over professional experience?

4s82je,43,2016-07-10,[CA] Update on unpaid internship and small start up company.,akarinrin,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4s82je/ca_update_on_unpaid_internship_and_small_start_up/,"[See this post for context.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4rxmsc/ca_became_a_virtual_intern_at_a_small_start_up/) - **TL;DR for that post:** *my internship at a small start up online company consists of only unpaid interns and not employees. I could negotiate wages or file a complaint with the DLSE.* 

I emailed the CEO on July 8th to negotiate wages since I felt that I was being treated like an employee, rather than reporting to the DLSE. I presented my case fairly and in a non-threatening manner. My plan was, if he did not respond within 24 hours, I would email the other interns to let them know that I planned to pursue legal action that they could opt-in to, asking them to contact me.

The night of 7/9 after hearing nothing, I sent out that email, and he was ""alerted"" by an intern that the email was sent (he claimed to not have been at the computer), and this prompted him to call me. When we spoke on the phone, I learned a lot of disturbing things. 

* I negotiated for pay, and then if that weren't possible, a small signing bonus of $500. His response was the company does not have enough profits to pay any of its employees, and that is why everyone is an unpaid intern. I suggested as low as $200, but he resisted.

* Everyone else such as those on the board (Chief Marketing Officer, etc) is a shareholder (equity?). 

* He tried to justify not paying interns by saying he was a small start up company. All of the company's profits go straight into marketing. 

* A majority of the interns ARE getting college credit, but from what I see, they still displace regular employees, which is the problem.

* Towards the end, he agreed that I was overqualified for the job and should pursue employment elsewhere where my skills could be utilized. BUT, I was welcome to come back to the company and he would let me know when funding was available because he really wanted me on the team.

A former intern later that evening sent me an email wishing to disclose what he knew, and we communicated on the phone. He told me that:

* He was basically in charge of translating, marketing and networking in a specific foreign country. 

* While he was an intern, towards the end of the internship he was asked to stay with the company for longer. He refused to do so unless he would be compensated, and that he had to negotiate intensely before the CEO relented and paid him. 

* After a certain period of time, the CEO claimed they had run out of money and wouldn't be able to pay, so this intern left the company because he didn't feel it was going to be successful. 

* He had no direct supervisors besides a VP in marketing, and he worked with another unpaid interns. 

* He did receive college credit for his time there. 

* The CEO tried to lure him into staying with a false promise of pay again in the future by saying something along the lines of, ""If the company is successful, you will be successful."" 

* The CEO likes to hire lots of international interns, and the intern said he felt that perhaps this was done because they wouldn't be familiar with the law. 

* Lastly, he had received an email shortly after the CEO called me that basically slandered my whole intentions and went something along these lines: 

*""I have forsaken my own family finances in order to keep the business afloat.* 

*“I hope you are not tainted by the unhappiness of one individual who did not think to call me to convey her concern, but decided to blast an email to all of the interns.”*

*“Please take this as a lesson to surround yourself with positive people.”*

**UPDATE 7/11:** Another intern got in touch with me and stated the following. 

* The company has a $500000 budget plan for when they receive their venture funding. In that budget proposal, they only made room to pay 6 employees. The remaining interns would have to stay interns. 

* He said he knew that the developers were unpaid interns, doing the work by themselves. 

* He currently works there, and feels that he replaces the role of an employee. 

**UPDATE 7/12:** A third intern emailed me today. This is what they had to say:

* The CEO did this weekly video contest for the website's video library, and promised a prize for the winner. Nobody ever received any prizes. They said that on their contract, creating videos was not a part of it, and that this stressed them out especially during exam periods. They frequently reminded the CEO that they were too busy for it.

* They were unpaid, and in charge of recruiting MORE unpaid interns from another certain country. 

~~**New question**: Should I pursue a class action law suit? What are my chances?~~

Looks like I'm planning to file a suit. Wish me luck!"
4s8adk,1,2016-07-10,where to begin with starting a power systems animation tool similar to physics ones?,ladyee,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/4s8adk/where_to_begin_with_starting_a_power_systems/,"Hi everyone! 

TL;DR at the bottom of the text wall. *THANK YOU ahead of time since this is a lot of text!!!!*

I could really use some help and direction for work on an interactive learning tool (similar to physics ones, but about power system dynamics), and I am not sure where to begin. I have read the FAQ in webdev and web_design and have gotten some ideas of where to go, but am still a bit unsure. I think this can be done with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and without a web server (??) because all it needs to do is take some inputs and provide moving dots on graphs.  


For background, this is a [potential] assignment for an intern working for me this summer. He has a bit of experience with python, (no HTML/CSS/JS), but has shown to be a quick learner. In terms of my ability to help him, I’m proficient in python, but have no experience with HTML/CSS/JS or anything web related (at all)…and the last GUI I developed was for an MP3 player with java…12 years ago.  So, I’m not a lot of help, but I’d be excited to learn and work with him if you guys think this may be possible. Also, I’ve discussed with him, and he is quite interested in the idea because it’s something he could have ownership over in a way that is uncommon for interns.  The rest of this explains more of what I’m looking for requirements-wise.

As a part of my work designing a stability analysis tool for use in the control center at a utility, I also have to figure out how to train the operators and engineers who will be using it. I’m working on gathering materials so I will have a sort of tutorial. As I was putting together a ""guinea pig"" presentation for some of my colleagues, I realized that it would be useful to have an interactive visualization kind of like what they do in physics forums.  If anyone is interested or if it’s helpful to know, the animation would be a take on the equal area criterion and power angle graph (I did check and nothing like this exists for this concept).  I have an example of a physics interactive animation that sort of is the gist of what I’m going for here:


http://www.physicsclassroom.com/Physics-Interactives/Momentum-and-Collisions/Collision-Carts/Collision-Carts-Interactive



Basically, I would like for the user to be able to have a few fields where they can input variables for the swing equation to determine how the graph should be drawn and then use a small dot to show how the system oscillates as it returns to a new operating point. Originally, I had thought to have the variables be individual text editable boxes, but it may be interesting for learning purposes to have them be scalable markers like what the above animation does for car speed? As the animation plays, a little dot will move up and down some upside down parabolas to represent what the system power is doing and what the angle spread between busses is. Anyway, I’m not sure what is easier/harder to do here, so I wanted to say either would be okay if that affects any advice.

I would really appreciate any feedback on what could be done here. I don’t want to give my intern an undo amount of work, but I really like the idea (as does he) that this is a project he could have total ownership over and would be SUPER helpful in the long run. I have other non-bull shit jobs for him to do this summer, but I just thought this was a cool idea. He and I will meet and I’ll show him the thread responses as well to get this all started if it seems like it can be done.


**TL;DR:**  *Advice needed on whether my smart intern (some python skills, no HTML/CSS/JS knowledge -- but quite interested in this project) could put together an interactive visualization tool similar to the physics one linked above, but about power systems. I am decent w/ python, but have never done anything web related (he knows this and is still game). Can it be done in 4 weeks? And if so, where should he (and I) start?*"

What should I do?,bacondev,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4s9btg/my_dream_company_asked_for_my_academic_transcript/,"I am majoring in computer science and mathematics, which require fairly demanding curricula. I'm supposed to graduate in Spring 2017.

My dream employer emailed me a few months ago and asked for my résumé and academic transcript presumably for consideration for an internship. But I never bothered responding because I wasn't comfortable sharing my transcript. My transcript is now *slightly* better than it was then but it's still atrocious, mostly because I wasn't even diagnosed until a year and a half ago.

A lot has happened to me within the past few months and I want to move away and start a new life. Late Friday afternoon, they called me, emailed me (again), and sent me a message on LinkedIn. They seem almost as interested in me as I am in them. To work for them would be the perfect reason to move away. So I figure that I might as well furnish my transcript. My expectations are low but my hopes are high.

My question is how I should submit the transcript. Should I explain what I've explained in this post and hope that they're understanding? Should I simply stress that my résumé is more indicative of my capabilities (which it definitely is)? Or should I not saying anything at all (unless asked)?

**TL;DR**: My dream employer wants to see my battle-scarred academic transcript but I'm not sure whether or not I should send an explanation with it."

I've already landed an internship this summer (about to be a junior) so I have work experience and I'll have a few cool projects under my github by the end of the summer. 

edit: I also forgot to say I'm not quite sure what role I want to play as a programmer yet. I've been working a lot of web apps and desktops with javascript, creating the client side UI for the company's platform and will be moving on to server side stuff soon.

4saaau,2,2016-07-11,Interning and renting abroad,maxbaconism,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4saaau/interning_and_renting_abroad/,"I'm a uni student who's been doing an Software Engineering internship in my home country for a numer of weeks.

For next summer, I plan on applying for as many internship positions abroad as I can as well as writing speculative letters to foreign companies.

What concerns me is, say I get accepted to intern at a company that's located abroad, what am I going to do with the renting situtation? Landlords always want 12-month contracts, 10-month if you are fairly lucky. You can image I don't want to pay for 10 months if I'll be staying a maximum of 4. I know one can find places for short term renting, but the options are so few and not always there(that's my impression after having looked for a flat for the next scholastic year in the UK). I can't depend on that.

I know a friend who has uni friends abroad who stay in their accommodation during the summer. Should I look for internships in companies of their location or is there something about renting I'm missing? I'm located in EU country, looking into other EU countries."

I've been programming since early highschool/ late middle school. Although I'm self taught I have skills in C#, JavaScript, HTML/Asp.net, CSS, Sql, and Java. I have had an internship before and my reference will confirm my skills. 
I started an internship under contract for a stipend for 5 weeks. I worked 30 hours a week and the pay per hour ended up being less than 7$ an hour. My company is a hardware startup at which I was the only real programmer. I wrote them an android app almost completely from scratch (another person on the team got some of the basic functions setup). It was a pretty complex one as well since it had to interface with their hardware via Bluetooth which also required some data manipulation based on strange physics properties that I hardly understand. Surprisingly, I got all the functionality and design done. My last week ended before I could hook them together and complete the app. 
Now they want to rehire me for a few more weeks this summer. I did all this 5 week high quality work for low pay as resume padding and for experience. They want to pay me 13$ an hour for 24 hours a week with 4 days of labor which includes one day of me working at home per week. I'm not sure if that's negotiable. I think I should get higher pay. Partially because I think I'm worth more. I also know coders in the area who get paid ~16$ an hour. It's in the city as well so gas costs 6-8$ a day to and fro (my parents drive me so they pay that bill). I love the area because there are a lot of startups in the building and that's what I aspire to do. At the same time, I could just sit at home and get a job on my campus or get a job somewhere else where the net income to our family would be better. I'm not sure exactly how this works with startups. Is there reason to believe I would get a raise in the near future? Future opportunities etc. 
TLDR: I like the area where I work. The work is kinda meh. I also believe I might be underpaid. Does it make sense to continue?
Edit. I'm sorry for the block of text but I'm on mobile
UPDATE: I tried negotiating but they can't go any higher than that so I'll be free for the rest of the summer and work on campus at the front desk of my dorm during the school year. It won't be high paying but it will be closer and more fun. Next summer I'll get another internship. "

4sb6fo,5,2016-07-11,BS in Electrical Engineering. Will I be able to obtain a junior network engineer position with CCNA?,anonetwork,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4sb6fo/bs_in_electrical_engineering_will_i_be_able_to/,"Hello, everyone.


I graduated from a university with bachelor of science in electrical engineering in December of 2015. I have been looking for jobs in the field, and, long story short, I came to realize that I don't really like what EE job market has to offer. 

Anyways, I had a privilege of talking to a family friend's dad who happens to be a network engineer a few days ago, and told me that I should consider it as a career option. And... it seemed really cool! I really liked that it's a constantly evolving field where I can always learn something new. I also liked that I can be more hands on to create something that works, rather than validate/test some silicon chip or hardware for rest of my life.

I have 1.5 year experience in operating and maintaining surveillance cameras and its network within my school campus.

I also have 9 month internship experience with a startup company that had a lot of electrical engineering aspects, but I also had the following IT-ish experience.

- Create FTP server of apt-mirror repository for Ubuntu OS.

- Scripts for facilitating tests and setup using python, bash, and Powershell

- Helped to deploy Maas (Machine as a service) for one of our 'server' boards.

- Exposure to AWS and VMware

- International business trip for a week to represent my company.

I also have some school courses related to ""network engineering"" such as Data Networks (layered networks, multiple access systems, and data link protocols.), computer architecture, computer interfacing... etc...

I am planning to spend the next 2-3 months studying the CCNA. Do you think it's realistic for me to expect a junior network engineer position after I get my CCNA certification? If not, then what kind of career path should I expect?

I am currently residing in San Francisco Bay area and my GPA is slightly below 3.0.

The last ""job"" I held was a summer internship right before my final year. I haven't had any interviews since then (about 2.5 years).

I've been pretty anti-social for most of my life. I made a few ""close"" friends in high school, but haven't maintained contact with them and it's probably been at least 5 years since I last spoke to them. I made only one or two friends in college, but the closest we've ever gotten was just discussing about homework and related hobbies - we never did anything beyond that. Never went to parties or even drank a single beer. I never spoke up in class or went to my professor for extra help... so my professional network is pretty much non-existent.

There are plenty of jobs available in CS, but all I've been doing is applying on job board sites to a select few - jobs that I feel, as an entry-level programmer, would be able to do (usually requiring 0-2 years of experience).

Because my resume has a lot of ""buzzwords"", I get contacted by a fair number of recruiters by email and phone each week. A lot of their ""positions"" are either out of my comfort zone of experience, or too far away, and so I don't bother responding to them by email if that's the case. However, even if the job does fit what I'm looking for, I don't respond to them at all if it was by phone.

Basically, I'm missing a lot of opportunities because SA keeps me constantly worried about what they might ask during a phone (yuck!) screen or in an interview, and how I'd screw myself over by saying something that makes me look like an idiot.

I've also read that only about 15% of people find jobs through job boards and 70% do it through networking... but my SA has prevented from establishing a significant network.

At this rate, I'm still going to be jobless after 2 years, which will signal even worse red flags to employers than now.

How do you guys handle job seeking and networking?"

4scm9c,19,2016-07-11,"I graduated from college 2 months ago and I'm having a lot of trouble landing a job in my field; I feel defeated, frustrated, and desperate.",Goofy117,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4scm9c/i_graduated_from_college_2_months_ago_and_im/,"I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree. I majored in Public Relations and minored in English Writing.

I started applying for jobs and internships a few months before graduation came around. Nothing came of it and so I kept applying to as many PR boutiques and marketing/advertising firms as I could find in my area. Very few got back to me. One of them brought me in for an interview but I guess they ended up choosing another candidate. It has been two months since I graduated and I have done no work at all related to my field. The only job I've had so far was a test scorer position I got through a temp agency. The entire time I was at the job I did nothing but search online for positions and emailing my resume and other materials to businesses and their recruiters. No luck at all.

I got fed up with waiting for emails and so I went downtown and visited with as many of these places as I could to introduce myself in person. Most of these places would not even let me get past the front desk, where the secretaries would do nothing for me other than say ""go online and look for jobs there"". I did manage to get some contact information for a few of these places' recruiters but they simply do not reply to my emails. At all. And I have sent more than one. One woman I talked to seemed very interested in me and my resume. She told me to email her within a week to give her time to look over my materials and she would let me know if I looked good for a spot on her team. I did so, twice, and nothing. I never heard from her again. Not even a ""I'm sorry but your qualifications do not meet our standards.""

I have gone though dozens and dozens of PR/Marketing/Advertising/Communications companies here in Downtown Minneapolis. I honestly feel like I have gone through them all. I am at a complete loss and I do not know what to do now.

I realize that these places I send emails to do not owe me a thing. They do not have to reply to me just to tell me that I do not meet their qualifications. I get that. But it still feels shitty to be stonewalled by damn near every single fucking company in the city. Especially the woman who I talked about earlier. She ASKED me to email her. I did and not one reply from her at all.

Now I'm doing nothing but sitting here waiting for the temp agencies I have signed up for to give me a call and offer me another spot doing menial work for some obscure company that has nothing to do with what I studied for. Of course I check LinkedIn and Indeed and Monster and even fucking Craigslist every single damn day hoping against hope that something pops up but 99% of the postings ask for people with either years and years of experience or want interns to work for free, to which I say fuck that, not out of pride but out or necessity.

I do not want to tell you guys a sob story and share my life with you all here but suffice to say that I need to start working somewhere steady ASAP. I was lucky enough to get through college with a full scholarship and I know this already puts me ahead of most graduates.... hell, most PEOPLE. But this does not change how I feel at the moment.

Is it because my resume, experience, and skills are not as good as I thought they were? I have worked for Medtronic, US Bancorp, U.S. Commodities, Volunteers of America, Mall of America corporate, and lots of other office jobs. Not too mention the 6+ summers I spent in the hell that is retail jobs. I'm bilingual. My GPA is good, not great but nothing to sneeze at either. I know Adobe, Microsoft Office, SEO, social media sites of all kinds, and many many computer programs. I get results and my resume, personal webpage, LinkedIn page, and references all attest to that. I got a full scholarship to a private university and those don't just get handed out willy nilly (is that how you spell that phrase?). I know my worth as an employee and a professional.

Or am I just striking out and having bad luck? I could wait until next year to apply for internships once more but, again, I cannot wait that long.

I need to work, for my finances, my sanity, my family, and my self confidence.

Thanks for reading."

Sorry for the hiatus, long weekend. And recalling these events has been both easier and harder than I had thought. So please, bear with me.


The strange event where I seemed to go from crossing my bedroom to crossing the backyard was not isolated to that first night. For the next three nights the pattern continued: as the sun went down my anxiety and restlessness would increase, culminating in a sudden fugue where I would go from my bedroom or pacing my hall or making hot chocolate, to suddenly standing or walking across my back yard. To me the events seemed instantaneous, but it turns out each event had me missing a significant chunk of time. 


Twenty minutes disappeared that first night. The next night, eleven minutes had. Then fourteen, then nine. 


You might wonder why I didn’t leave the house or call the doctor about these occurrences. The truth of the matter is, I don’t know why I didn’t. The doctor never occurred to me. I wondered if I was going crazy, of course, or if there was some medical issue wrong with my brain, but the actual connection from ‘something might be wrong with my health’ to ‘call a doctor’ simply refused to form in my conscious mind. 


The same with leaving the house. In the light of day, the house was fine. I actually quite liked it, and it was astonishingly easy to- if not ‘forget’ these events were occurring, to at least forget their oddity, if that makes sense. 


Simply put, during nights in this house I was not myself. There is no other way to describe it. During the light of day they were as distant to me as if they were happening to someone across the country, or on another planet. 


After three or four nights, however, exhaustion won out, and I realized I had to at least talk to someone about this. Carla wouldn’t be back for two more days, and this wasn’t exactly something that chatting about over long distance lines would do justice. 


I had no family to speak of at the time, other than the dogs. No friends other than a few scattered back in California and I strongly suspected any of them would seek to have me committed if I started talking about my strange nocturnal wanderings.


That fourth day I managed to leave the house, finding a diner in town. I was doodling on a napkin while waiting for my food. Just circles and smiley faces and cartoon dogs- or so I thought before a voice asked me if I was an artist.


A man was seated on the stool beside me. I hadn’t noticed him sit down. For all I knew, he’d been sitting there since I came in. He appeared to be my age, in a button shirt but no tie, and wearing jeans. He looked at me with kind interest which spoke volumes about him, because I was certain I was quite a sight by then- rumpled clothes, barely brushed hair, raccoon eyes from lack of sleep. 


Thinking he was teasing me because of my smiley faces I gave a fake chuckle and played along. “Yeah, I’ll be the next Van Gogh with my doodles.”


He gave me an odd look, but smiled. “You might be,” he said. “That’s very good. That’s Sutton House, isn’t it?”


I looked down at my napkin and stared. For a moment, I could see those cute cartoon dogs and pointless smileys I had been sketching. Then I blinked and they were gone. Covering almost all my napkin was an astonishingly lifelike drawing of that house in the woods- oak tree and all.


I stared at it, feeling as if I was floating away in my own head. I must have repeated the name because he nodded and tapped the picture. 


“Yeah, Sutton House. In the woods off 41st. I used to throw rocks at the windows down there when I was a kid.”


The last thing I wanted this stranger to know was that I was apparently going mad- though the worse secret seemed to be that I was aware of it just then and yet apathetic toward it. “Yeah, that’s it,” I said. “Sorry, I’m a little distracted.”


“It’s all right,” he said, and introduced himself as Travis. 


“Mary,” I said in return. Clinging to the social graces seemed to help ground me a little.


“So you’ve been to Sutton House?” he asked. “Creepy place.”


“Yes,” I told him. “I live just up the path.”


Then he said, “Oh, you bought the daughter’s house?” and I just froze.


“Daughter’s house?”


“Yeah, Sutton’s daughter? Her husband built that house for her, and they moved there after they got married. Before she went insane and disappeared, anyway.”


As he said that, suddenly my mind cleared and everything that was going on came into focus. For the first time since that first black-out, I was suddenly very aware that something seriously wrong was happening to me. With that awareness came fear. It must have shown on my face because he suddenly looked concerned.


“Are you ok?”


“I thought all his children died,” I heard myself say. “Smallpox…?”


“Not the way I heard it,” he said. “All the younger kids did, but his eldest daughter had already married and moved out when they got sick.”


Sutton’s daughter had lived in my house. That was all I could think of. Sutton’s daughter had lived in *my* house…and she’d gone insane. 


I didn’t want to be there in that diner any more. I suddenly wanted…no, needed…answers. For the first time in days my mind was clear. The only place I could think of that might have them was the town’s small library.


I made my excuses- I don’t even remember what they were- and tried not to run as I left the diner. The library was just across the street, and for the next four or five hours I devoured everything I could find on Sutton House.


Here’s a quick rundown of what I discovered:


Sutton House was built by Heinrich Sutton shortly after he and his wife had immigrated through Ellis Island over a hundred years ago. It started as a small cabin, but they expanded on it as their family grew. They immigrated with eight children- in the end, they had fifteen.


The youngest of the fifteen was only a few months old when Mrs. Sutton caught pneumonia. She died ten miles away in the new hospital two weeks later. A few days after that, the newborn also died- this time, the culprit was smallpox.


The disease swept through the family and soon every child still at the house was sickened. They were quarantined and that was when Heinrich started to claim he heard voices telling him how to build his house, so that his children would not leave him.


His eldest daughter was no longer at the house when her mother died- she had married at age fifteen. Her husband had built her a house near her parents’ place. That was the house I lived in now, or the beginning of it. The girl was close with her family and her father’s madness frightened her. She was prevented from going to help him and her siblings by the quarantine and by her father’s increasing violence and ravings.


Shortly after the last child in the house died from the smallpox, Heinrich hung himself on the big oak tree out front. At some indeterminable point anywhere from a few months to a few years later, the eldest girl reportedly left town and her husband and went back to live with an aunt in Germany.


As I was trying to find out more about this eldest girl, the librarian directed me to a book she warned me not to take seriously. It was one of those books about the paranormal and urban legends, and it mentioned Sutton House and some of its history. Then it went on to talk about the older daughter. What it said I normally would not have considered as real, if it weren’t for what was happening to me. It seemed like one of those usual urban legends that just kind of grow up over time and become part of a town’s lore, but really have no basis in fact.


According to this book, after Heinrich hung himself and the house lay abandoned, the husband told his friends that his wife was starting to bother him. He told them that he would wake up repeatedly in the night to find she had left the house to go to her father’s abandoned one. Many times, he had to go after her to bring her home and each time, she was standing in front of the house, staring at it. She would give no explanation and despite his demands she stop doing so, her nightly excursions continued.


Then, the daughter disappeared. It was the husband’s claim that she went back to an aunt in Germany but persistent rumor said that the husband had actually locked her in her father’s old abandoned house, keeping her there as a prisoner for many years, before murdering her and boarding up her body in a closet. 


It was the daughter- whose name was Maria- who had worn the path between the houses with her night-time journeys. It was Maria who followed some impulse to go out night after night to visit the house where her family had died. 


But it was *me* who kept ‘waking up’ to find myself standing in the backyard, or walking toward that path in the middle of the night. And it was me who was scared to death.


Carla was back two days later, and of course she had to come see me in my new house before she even went home herself. She took one look at me and assumed something horrible had happened to one of the dogs. I suppose I looked like shit. I certainly felt like it.


I told her that Joe was asleep under the dining room table and refused to budge, and that Nell was barking at the old stone wall in the back of my house as she’d been doing pretty much non-stop for two days now- ever since I’d come home from the library.


I’d come home meaning to get the dogs and take them to a motel- I had not wanted to spend another night in that damn house. But Joe absolutely refused to move and he was much too big for me to drag or carry. Nell had started barking at that wall and all but screamed as if I were skinning her alive each time I tried to draw her away from it. By the time I realized it was useless trying to get the dogs out of there, I was sunk in that apathetic, anxious fog yet again. 


Trapped.


Part of me was shocked that the neighbors hadn’t called the cops on Nell’s non-stop barking, but none of them had so much as looked over my fence to see what the noise was about. I was starting to wonder if they even heard it.


I took Carla into the kitchen, made her a cup of coffee, and told her the whole damn story. I didn’t even care if she believed me or not. I had to sick it up, like it was a poison that was stuck inside me. Maybe it was the only way I could think of to ask for help getting me out of the trap I’d found myself in. A lot was hazy in those days and it was hard to think.


Carla did end up helping me get out of the trap, but not the way I or even she intended.


Nell barked through the whole story, which Carla listened to with shock. When I finished she asked just how long it was that I had gone without sleep, and if I had gone to a doctor about my sleepwalking.


When I reminded her what had happened with Sutton’s daughter she interrupted me by suggesting I was just under too much stress with the move, and that the dogs could sense it and that’s why they were acting weird.


It was too much. This was the only shot I had at getting out of this trap I couldn’t seem to save myself from and Carla didn’t believe me. I couldn’t blame her, but she was my only hope and I could see that salvation flitting away from me. 


I’m ashamed to admit it, but I started to cry. That seemed to alarm her a little bit, and after she calmed me down a little she said, “Ok, so let’s go see it then.”


“See what?” I asked. 


“See the house, Sutton’s place,” she said. “Honey, that house is creeping you out so much you aren’t sleeping. You’re spooked silly. We’re going to go down to that house and I’m going to show you it’s nothing more than a big empty ruin, ok?”


That was the last thing I wanted to do, but at the same time it was all I wanted to do. It was as if there was a low current between that house and me and when she said she wanted to go see it, that current was switched up to maddening levels, pulling everything about me in that direction.   When she stood up to go I all but sprang up from my chair to follow her.


Nell’s voice sounded hoarse when we got into the back yard. The dish of food and water I’d set out for was untouched. 


Every time I’d tried to draw her away she’d freaked out and started screaming, but the moment Carla approached her Nell abruptly stopped barking as if a wire had been cut. She whipped around and looked at us as if she’d never seen us before, then bolted into the house. Feeling separated from my own body, I carefully shut and latched the door behind her.


I did feel better as we headed through the gap and down the path. My mind felt like it was clearing again, the trap of apathy around me starting to melt away. The further we went the better I felt, but when we reached the clearing and caught sight of the house again, all that snuffed out and vanished. Terror filled me and I grabbed Carla’s hand and begged her to go back.


But once Carla got it in her head to do something she did it- she was as stubborn as an old mule. And she was determined to show me that Sutton House was just an old ruin and there wasn’t anything to fear about it. 


She had a grip on my hand and tried to pull me across the clearing but I was in such a state of terror I refused to move. It felt like a hundred eyes were watching me, like the sky was pressing down, like unseen monsters were surrounding me. I was in the grip of a full-on panic attack and I could neither help it nor stop it. I had never before been so afraid in my life.


Carla clearly couldn’t feel it herself- she was trying to be firm but gentle, and I could see the exasperation and concern growing on her face. Finally, probably in worry that she was going to cause me harm, she stopped trying to pull me into the clearing.


“It’s ok, you stay here then,” she said. “But I’m going to show you there’s nothing to be afraid of.”


The boarded up windows seemed to gape blindly at us, as if the house itself were seeing us somehow. Carla started across the clearing and I wasn’t able to hold myself upright. I fell down to my knees. I can still feel the faint damp of the grass soaking into the knees of my jeans.


She kept repeating that there was nothing to be afraid of, while at the same time the very air around me seemed lit with unseen hostility and violence and oppressiveness so thick I could hardly breathe- but she remained unaffected.


She was about two thirds of the way across the clearing when she looked over her shoulder at me that last time and insisted that ‘there’s nothing to be scared of! It’s going to be all right-“


And that was it. She was gone.


 Just as quick as a light switching off, right in the middle of the wide open grass and still forty feet from the house, she vanished. 
I ran back home.


The apathy had cleared away enough that once I reached home I had enough presence of mind left to know I had to do something. My first impulse was to call the police, but I also knew that would be a bad idea. What were the police going to do? The moment I started talking about this and told them my best friend had literally disappeared in front of my eyes, they’d be committing me. That would help neither me nor Carla.


Joe was still asleep and Nell had stopped barking, and I knew if I stayed in the house that mind fog would come back. I needed to stay as clear as I could. I was still terrified but the blind panic had gone away. Doing little more than making sure the dogs couldn’t get out of the house I went out again and got into my car. 


At first I just drove into town, trying to get distance between me and the house. I went to the library because that was the only place so far that had given any answers. It wasn’t really answers I needed now, but help.


Sitting in my locked car outside the library I forced myself to think.


I couldn’t call the cops. I needed to find someone that would believe me and have the resources needed to find Carla and get her back safely- if Carla could still be found. 


Hmm. Someone who would not only believe me but be able to act. Where was I going to find this mythological rainbow unicorn of a person?


I broke down again then, at least for a moment, before I suddenly remembered.


For a brief period during the end of High School I had a friend who had been big into those paranormal ‘ghost hunting’ shows. I knew those shows were probably bunk but…weren’t their people who seriously studied this kind of thing? 


Massachusetts had more than one acclaimed university, surely one of them had a professor or something that was at least open minded about this sort of thing. They may not be able to help me, but they might be able to put me in touch with someone who could.


I went into the library to look up contact info and ended up calling easily a dozen departments at three or four universities. I gave them a roundabout story, pretending to be a journalism student doing research so that no one would actually hang up on me. Finally, I was given a name and a number to call to get a hold of a ‘group who does that sort of thing as a semi-serious hobby.’


I won’t tell you which university this group called ‘home’- suffice it to say that just about everyone would know the name if they heard it. I’m changing the names of everyone involved in this- I don’t want the ones that are left harassed any more than I want to be harassed myself.


The man I finally got hold of, I’ll call ‘Jacob’. Jacob had been at the University for six years but not as a student. He was the unofficial spokesperson of what were affectionately called the ‘University Alum Weirdos’.  There was an official name of course but I won’t share that here- it’d be too easy to look up.


They dealt with things that more conventional psychologists and scientists wouldn’t touch, such as psychic phenomenon, out of body experiences, reincarnation, near death experiences, thoughtgraphy, and various unexplained happenings. 


He told me all this later of course, not on that first call. I was still a bit too distracted on that call with my own ‘unexplained happening’.


He didn’t make fun of me when I told him Carla vanished right in front of me. He took it very seriously, but was sure to ask if there was any natural reason it could have happened- a sinkhole, for example. I told him there was no sinkhole. I was frantic at the time but even I couldn’t have missed a sinkhole appearing large enough to swallow a human being. Besides, Carla had just vanished- she hadn’t dropped downward.


He told me that it wasn’t the first time something like that had happened. He told me about a man in Gallatin Tennessee who had vanished in front of five witnesses, in broad day light. Just poof!


I told him a bit more about what was going on and he said that he would talk to his department head and arrange a trip down to see me and Sutton House. This nearly threw me into hysterics again. 

Carla was missing and I couldn’t go back to that house, not if I wanted to maintain a clear mind. To me, his words meant it could be days or even weeks before they would arrive. By then I’d be mad or dead myself, I had no doubt.


I told him this and refused to hang up until he could assure me when they would be there. He put me on hold for quite a while, but when he got back on he was able to reassure me they could be there by morning of the next day. 


One more night in the house. I couldn’t leave the dogs alone and locked up all night, after all. If I tried to get them out to go to a hotel I had no doubt they’d resist me again, and no doubt the apathy would take hold again if I just spent a few minutes there trying. If I left them there alone anything might happen to them. 

If I went back…anything might happen to *me.* 


Just talking to Jacob made me feel better, however. Someone was coming. Maybe I could get the dogs out, but if I couldn’t, I could down enough coffee to make even a sloth run laps.


You may be thinking I was nuts to go back, that you wouldn’t have done the same, and who cares what happened to the dogs? The thing is, the dogs were all I had, and I was responsible for them. More, I can’t describe to you what having that numbing apathy felt like- nor can I describe to you what the lack of it felt like. I will try, however.


When I was in the house it was as if a wet towel were wrapped around my thoughts. I couldn’t think, I couldn’t care, I couldn’t concentrate. I felt like an observer going through certain actions- controlling them from a distance or separated from them completely. 


When I was away, outside the house, my mind cleared up and I realized that what was going on at the house was in no way normal or healthy, but at the same time it kind of got- smaller. Like remembering a nightmare you had a week ago in the middle of a bright and clear day. I kept thinking ‘ok, what happened is strange but it couldn’t have been that strange, I’m just tired is what it is, it’s not that bad. I’m making a mountain out of a molehill’ and a lot of stuff like that. I knew I needed help but I also overinflated my ability to handle things on my own for ‘just a bit longer’. 


So I went back to the house with a game plan in mind. I’d lock all the doors, make myself enough coffee to kill a grown man, turn the TV up full volume and just stay focused on something until the next morning when help would arrive.


Looking back I can see how stupid going back was and how it could have gone very wrong. The dogs would have been fine for a night- at most I would have come home to some accidents on the rug. 


I’m very lucky that things didn’t go wrong that night. Almost as soon as I got back that apathy and restless anxiety started in again. I made my coffee and went through my routine and paced the house, listening to the TV blaring as I tried to drown out my own disconcertion. I kept telling myself help was coming but I no longer really cared if it was. I knew Carla was missing but it seemed unimportant. 


Nell whined and paced with me but didn’t bother scratching the door, which was good. And I didn’t have a moment where I blacked out and found myself in the yard, which was better. Maybe taking Carla had satisfied…whatever this was…for the time being?


Dawn finally came and just after nine am, so did help.


They came in a beaten up old van with squeaky hinges. I came out on the front porch to meet them. It was freezing outside but I barely felt it.


The first one out was a lanky man with an easy smile who introduced himself as Jacob, the one I’d talked to on the phone. Besides Jacob there were three others- two he introduced as Dan and Lucy and described as departmental interns. The third he introduced as Candace. 


Candace, I was told, was a psychic who occasionally worked with the police department on violent crimes. She certainly didn’t look to me like I pictured a psychic would; instead, she looked like someone who should be *in* prison instead of helping to put people there. She was thickly patterned with tattoos, and what hair she had was bright green.


She was wearing a windbreaker. After Jacob introduced us Dan asked Candace if she felt anything.


She gave him a look that reminded me of a look my mother used to get when I’d done something adorable but incredibly stupid, and said ‘Yes. I feel cold.’


I invited them in. Nell was out back barking again. Hearing her, I suddenly remembered I had let her out before coming to the front door. I went to make coffee and Candace asked if she could just wander about the house a moment. 


The others followed me into the kitchen. Lucy asked if the barking was my dog. I told her yes, that was Nell and she was probably barking at the wall. I told them the last time she’d done it she’d gone two days straight.


They went to the back door and looked out the window next to it. Jacob asked if the dog had been standing in the same place the last time. I said yes. Dan and Lucy asked if they could go and take some pictures outside in the back, and I said yes to that too. Every time they asked me something I just said yes- I didn’t care what they did or what they said.


I gave Jacob some coffee and I’m pretty sure he asked me more questions. I was aware of little but how he was looking more and more concerned every time I answered. He told me later I just kept answering in monotone, and looked like I hadn’t slept in years. 


Then Candace came back in and suggested we go and talk in the back yard. Despite the cold we went. Dan and Lucy were still wandering about taking pictures and we sat down out there. Candace said she wanted to talk but for the first twenty minutes or so all we did was chat about unimportant things like the weather and how I liked town, while we watched the dog bark and the photos being shot. 


As I write this, I’ve just realized what Candace was doing. The longer I was outside the house the better and clearer I felt. I think she knew this, and I think she took me outside and gave me time to clear my head a bit before she said anything important. 


I didn’t put that together before now; back then I was just grateful help was there and that the cold air was making it easier to stay awake and focus.


She started the serious talk rather abruptly. We’d been quiet a moment, watching the dog, when she suddenly turned to me and said ‘there are two spirits in your house. A man and a woman. Both are pretty weak, but one is really restless. I think that’s the female spirit. The man is frustrated and angry. I think he was abusive in life.”


Before I could say anything Jacob pulled out some folders from a small leather satchel he was carrying and nodded. “I think that’s Maria Sutton and her husband. It’d fit in with the research I pulled about them.”


“Maria’s the one that wore the path,” I said. “She kept visiting the house at night, and it made her husband angry.”


Candace looked at me just then, and it was the kind of look that feels like it goes right through your skin and xrays your brain. 


“Mary, I think what you’re feeling is Maria’s restlessness and her desire to go to that house. Jacob says you told him you pace at night? You feel restless, and occasionally you have episodes of missing time and find yourself out in the back, heading toward that path?”


I nodded, feeling sick. “I want it to stop, I told her. If Maria wants to go to that house so badly she can go, but I want her to leave me out of it.”


Candace told me that Maria’s spirit and that of her husband were both pretty weak. I suppose she said that to make me feel better but it only made me feel worse. If they were weak but still able to affect me as horribly as they were doing so, what would a strong spirit do to me?


“Ok. Let’s see if we can figure out what the dog is barking at,” she said. We headed toward Nell. Like before, as soon as we got close she stopped barking. Instead of bolting into the house again this time, instead she ran toward the rock wall and began digging at it again, like she had the first time. Jacob told Dan to take some pictures of the wall where Nell was digging- he had something that Jacob called a Kirlian camera, and he specifically wanted pictures taken with that one. As he took shots, Candace went over and put her hands on the wall and closed her eyes. 


“He threw her here,” she said after a moment. “He was tired of her going out at night and having to fetch her back. That last time he caught her before she got through the gate. He threw her against this wall and beat her. She was afraid he was going to kill her.”


“Did he?” Jacob asked.


“Not here,” Candace said. “I can just feel the beating here. She dropped something.”


She touched her neck, the motion like an old lady seeking to touch a cross or something on a chain around her neck. Then she crouched down and fished in the cracks of the stone wall near where Nell was digging. She peeled some moss aside and after a moment, she pulled out an old chain. On the end was a little pentagram.


I knew what a pentagram was, and to me it meant something Satanic, something always used in those demon movies. I said as much, and Candace shook her head. 


“It’s actually an old symbol of protection. Maria probably wore it for comfort. I sense many owners- likely it was handed down through her family. It’s been blessed a couple of times.”


She handed it to me. At first I didn’t want to take it- it was grimy and no matter what they said, to me pentagrams meant evil. The moment it was in my hand, however, I felt…better. Clear minded again, almost relieved. 


Then Dan asked when they could go down and see the house in the clearing, and my relief disappeared again.


“I’m not going,” I told them. “You all can go but I’m staying here.”


There wasn’t a protest. Jacob and Candace seemed to understand and sympathize, and Dan didn’t seem to care who went as long as he got to go.


Just at that moment, Nell suddenly whirled around and ran into the house, as if something in the woods had suddenly startled her or frightened her. The reaction was so pronounced that Dan and Lucy immediately took shots of the trees and the gap in the wall. 
I felt cold again, afraid…but this time the fear was behind me, in the house with the two dogs. The idea of staying there alone suddenly scared me much more than the path and Sutton House did. 


I decided I was going along after all. 


Dan and Lucy lead the way, with Jacob and Candace dawdling along beside me. Being on the path again made me feel better, like it had before, but I still was not eager to be near Sutton House again. I just hoped they’d be able to find where Carla went, or that something would happen to prove that I wasn’t crazy- that something supernatural really was going on.


I was both hopeful and terrified that once we reached the house something would happen. I never considered that something would happen before we were even in sight of it.

I just transferred from a CC to a 4-year school and I'm starting to put out some feelers regarding internships. As I'm searching I found out that my dad knows one of the hiring managers at a very large engineering firm, and mentioned to him that I'm looking for an internship for next summer. The friend said to go ahead and email him my resume. 

So my question is this: the company hasn't posted any info for next years internships yet. Should I include in the email/on my resume what kind of job I'm looking for? I'm most interested in structural, but I won't turn up my nose at pretty much anything; I guess I want to indicate my interest in structural without limiting my chances at other openings they may have. Also, should I include a cover letter?

I've never applied for a job through a connection like this so I'm not sure what the etiquette is. 

Thanks for the help!"

I see positions offering $100K/yr and I meet every qualification except having had done the job before full time like they want and its driving me nuts, even the most ""entry level"" positions want two to four years experience which is contradictory to the concept of ""entry level"".

I tried asking acquaintances but the only people I know who are in the field are telling me ""helpful"" stuff like:

* I should offer to work for free for two years in return for ""Experience"" (wtf?)

* I should spend thousands of dollars on multiple certifications when he got his job without any at all

* I go to school 4 years for IT (when i'm already self taught and have the skills to be a jr sysadmin)

One of them also told me that using linux in a business enviornment is illegal and I could go to jail for doing it (wow!)

Their eyes glaze over when I start talking about anything technically advanced (like SELinux vs AppArmor, or advanced virtualization security like IOMMU's) but they always insist that they know more than me.

I have done consulting work, and I have had a few (paid) internships but they just use me for grunt work and teach me nothing at all then get angry when I correct them on a serious mistake (eg: using the domain admin account to join an employees personal computer to a domain, having one word dictionary passwords for administrator accounts and the like) and then a few months later they fire me and replace me with two or three unpaid interns. One even insisted I lie to their supervisor and claim that I learned plenty from them. (I am an honest person so I refused to do this)

I'm gonna get my RHCE to start for certs but that still isn't going to get me my two years so sometimes I start to figure why bother at all.

Deblasio is full of shit when he says that there is a tech worker shortage.

I feel like I'm stuck in a rut that I'm never going to get out of and I just really needed to vent about it.

Has anyone here been in this position before? What did you do to get out of it?"

Today my boss flipped out again that I didn't remember every single word she said (of which I'm pretty sure I did but I'm afraid to say ""you're wrong""). She does this to multiple people. What am I supposed to do? I do not want to toast a reference letter since it's an internship, but it's getting a bit ridiculous. I've never had this problem with any of my previous jobs before and in a previous programming job I was completely fine. I'm beginning to think that it's not me this time around since she is saying it to multiple people.

I am afraid to bring this up in case she gets even more upset with me and I ruin a reference. This is my internship, and I don't want a full 12 months to be potentially ruined since I'm assuming my next actual job will want reference letters.

Today I was told in front of everyone that I can't remember simple things (which is not the case) and I just sat there and apologized to her. The only thoughts on my mind are that I must appease until my time is up so I can move onto greener pastures.

How do I deal with this situation? I feel so chained, it's extremely depressing... I really need some advice.

So now that I'm job hunting because I'm staying in the city I do want to put my iOS development internship position at Airbnb/Spotify/Uber but worried that people will see intern and immediately reject me even though I have 2-ish years professional experience as a non-intern/mid-level developer at a no name small company. 

Also, I still haven't graduated and I am going to take a leave of absence and finish online at a university that is ABET accredited and everything once I'm settled in so I'm trying to figure out how to put that on my resume...

4sf0he,3,2016-07-11,Not sure if this new job is just weird or these are serious red flags.,goatsnboots,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4sf0he/not_sure_if_this_new_job_is_just_weird_or_these/,"Sorry for the length - I'm including everything in case it's relevant.

I applied for a summer internship at the beginning of April. My current job is tolerable, so I wasn't job searching too hard, and I'm moving out of the country at the end of August, so I stopped my job search at the beginning of June. CompanyX sent me an email early last week asking me what times I was available for an interview. There was no acknowledgement of the time gone by (at that point about three months). I responded that I was no longer job searching and wished them luck with their intern search. They responded saying that this internship would turn into a full-time job. I replied saying I was moving. They responded saying the job could be done remotely. So, okay, that's pretty enticing. I set up an interview for Wednesday. 

Side note: I lost my phone a couple of weeks ago. I need to buy a new phone/plan when I move anyway, so I figured Skype and email would work just fine until then. I let the guy know that I didn't have a phone and that I'd only be available via email.

I arrived at 9am for the interview on Wednesday. The guy wasn't there. Turns out he tried to call my old number that was on my resumé (that I sent him in April) to tell me he would be 30 mins late. So I waited for 30 mins - I don't have a problem with this; there's no way this could have been prevented. When he showed up, he said that my phone number wasn't working, and I reminded him that I currently don't have a phone. 

The interview was two hours long and was mostly him telling me about the company. He had asked me to bring in some of my work (I'm in marketing, so I brought in some marketing plans I had done previously). He looked through everything before asking me where the pictures were. I was a little confused, and clarified that I was in marketing not advertising specifically, and he said that was fine. Then he asked me how long it would take me to build his company's website. I was confused and explained that I'm not a web developer. He got kind of upset and acted like I'd wasted his time. Web development, as far as I know, was not on the original job listing, so I have no idea where that came from.

The interview concluded and he asked me to make a marketing plan and present it to everyone at the company on Monday (earlier today) - there are only five or six people at this company, so that sounded fine. I'm getting paid for my time, so I agreed to send him a copy of the plan by Sunday evening and meet again Monday.

I arrived at 9am today. He wasn't there, and his office manager and everyone else had no idea who I was or why I was there. His office manager agreed to call him on my behalf (again, no phone), and when I spoke to him on the phone, he said that he thought I had ghosted him and was no longer interested in the position. Apparently he hadn't gotten my email yesterday afternoon with the plan I made. Anyway, I waited until 10am for him to arrive. 

When he showed up, he said that he expected me to disappear due to my ""unprofessional behavior."" He listed the fact that I have no web development skills, that I didn't take notes during our two-hour interview, that I don't have a phone, that I didn't email him the plan as promised (I went on to show him proof that I sent it), and that I don't have a car (I live in a city with an excellent public transportation system, and driving is not at all a part of this job). 

I went on to do my little presentation for just him and the office manager. Having a job that I could do remotely would be amazing - I am going to be super tight on money when I move - but this feels like a really crummy way to start a business relationship. I'm really torn between waiting it out to see if it gets better or bowing out now. Help.

4sf1dt,8,2016-07-11,I'm having a really bad time at my internship and am wondering if life is going to feel like this forever.,canireddit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4sf1dt/im_having_a_really_bad_time_at_my_internship_and/,"I'm interning at a large, corporate company in the Seattle area as a software development intern. I feel really frustrated and stressed and am wondering what my best course of action is. The company I'm at is known to hire interns full time at the end of the internship. If I do get an offer (which I doubt at this point, as I don't think I'm doing too hot) would it be a bad career move to turn it down? Should I find a place to work where I'm happier? I'll be graduating next March so I'll need to decide soon.

My biggest problem with the internship is my manager. He's very stern and multiple times a day says ""make sure you implement x"" when I haven't even wrapped my mind around how I'm going to do all the other things he's assigned me. Every time he assigns me something he speaks as if it's second nature to me, even though I've told him several times that I've never done integration tests, MVC development, etc. The first version of my product is due in three weeks and I'm really nervous about the idea of not getting done in time. I also just don't connect with my manager on a personal level and all of our interactions are tense and awkward. I want to like him, and I want to do well enough for him to like me, but I don't get the feeling he does at all. I don't think I dislike the company I work for as much as I dislike working on this team.

Speaking to other interns, everyone seems to be having a really good time. They have laid back managers and helpful, enthusiastic mentors. They also say they're in the same boat of feeling overwhelmed, but they appear to have much more manageable projects with clearer objectives. I don't really see other interns very often as my team works on a floor that's secluded from other dev teams. There's one person on my team I get along with pretty well, but everyone else is a lot older and reserved. I don't think I've seen my mentor smile more than twice during the entire 4+ weeks I've been here.

Everything here just feels so soulless. It's a complete contrast to college labs where everyone is joking around while helping each other solve problems. Is the real world really just like this? 9-5 drag, not having people to talk about Game of Thrones with, bosses that are hard to be friends with? Is CS just not the right path for me? Am I not cut out for this?

4sf3r0,93,2016-07-12,[Train wreck] My internship environment was so poorly run that it got me fired,itinternterror,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4sf3r0/train_wreck_my_internship_environment_was_so/,"As of today I no longer have an internship at a dysfunctional company. Two weeks ago it was discovered that a finance app we use had been breached on my start date, and the investigation concluded today. What I got was that about an hour before I arrived on my first day, my account, which had a username in the format of first initial + last name and a password of ""password"" when I first arrived, was used to access one of our web servers, which they then used to move across the network and into our finance servers. Given that I overheard the full time staff talking about a ""third domain admin"" and a ""golden ticket"", it sounds like the attacker attained persistent access. I was given a standard talk about how I'm responsible for what happens on my account and then escorted out of the building. I'm not facing any criminal charges at this time, though they did mention I could be facing 160 years in prison if they decided to press charges. I will have enough money to last until classes resume, though it will be a little tight.

My last two weeks there were anything but smooth. I found out that the reason we were seeing so many login attempts on our main domain admin account was because a scheduled task on a server performing some work for another department ran as our second domain admin account, but as part of the script it open up IE6 and log in to a web page on our internal services server as our primary domain admin account, making it look like the problem was on our internal services server.

I also learned from the full time staff that said second domain admin account has a password shared by every user, including contractors and interns, in another department, and is basically never changed. It's a huge thorn in their side, but they haven't been able to reign in its access because that department has an in with upper management. 

There wasn't an actual crisis until last Monday when the NIC on one of their VM hosts (that is the sole host in a mission critical cluster) failed. All IT staff, including me, were called in to try to fix it. Their support does not cover holidays, so after several attempts to revive the problem NIC we had to shut down a host on another cluster and take its NIC to replace the bad one, and they won't be able to easily replace the bad NIC because the mission critical host is the only one with a service contract. 

Finally, on Friday the finance app that got breached went down completely. The IT staff actually couldn't even restart it because it didn't have enough memory to stop the service. Even restarting the server didn't fix it, as the app immediately gobbled up all of the server's memory. We were interrupted by a helpdesk call that wasn't from finance, and, given how little I was trusted, I was given that to handle. The user had gotten a fake antivirus popup, and I tried to get her to shut down, which, after trying to explain where on her screen the start menu is or where the windows key is on her keyboard for 10 minutes, I actually had to walk out to her desk in another building to shut down her virtual desktop. I got back just as one of the full time staff came out of the server room. They apparently had to restore the database from a backup, and finance would have to manually redo anything that happened since the backup was made.

I also had one other humorous thing happen: the senior sysadmin who left found my post and asked me for a more detailed account, which I gave her. She apologized for leaving me with a bomb that was about to explode, but I really can't blame her.

(And one last thing: I'm she, not he)"

My girlfriend jokes with me because she always says yes and never argues against my path because she always knows it will change. 

Ever since I was about 14, I was set on becoming a computer programmer. Shortly after getting to college and choosing CS as my major, I lost interest even with straight As. Shortly thereafter I switched my major to Urban Planning, then switched it again to Linguistics, then to Business, then to the ""Consumer &amp; Community Studies major with an emphasis in Financial Planning"" program, and as of late I have dropped the emphasis to expedite my graduation date. 

I am currently completing an internship within a financial planning firm and have discovered that it's completely not for me. However, despite all of this major changing, I have still managed to graduate college 1 year early (this coming spring) so I have decided to just stick it out with my Consumer &amp; Communities studies degree. 

I have lots of start-up ideas (30+) but I have absolutely no knowledge or resources to start them and sometimes no motivation either. Also, like I said before, my desire to pursue a specific idea changes daily. Along similar lines, I have also been compiling a list of social research projects that I'd like to do but just like my start-up ideas, ""I have absolutely no knowledge or resources to start them and sometimes no motivation either.""

Some of my interests include minimalism, frugality, personal finance, languages, and traveling. Some of my favorite non-major related courses were design thinking, intro accounting, entrepreneurship, and social science research methods. 

I've already received extremely strong hints and almost an even casual offer to stay at my current firm full-time after graduation but it's definitely not what I'm interested in pursing. As graduation approaches, I feel more and more lost and nervous. I'd greatly appreciate anybody's input whatsoever, I'm open to anything at this point. Thank you very much! :)

Budget is around 650$, will probably order it from Amazon US or from Bestbuy.

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
2 in 1 form is my main priority. I would like to easily fold it and use it a a tablet when required, so would prefer sturdy laptops, so that its doesn't get damaged in a couple of months

* **How important is weight to you?**
Somewhat important, considering I would like to use it as a tablet frequently.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
 Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
Between 13.3 to 15.6 inches

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
 I will be using it only for college and internship works.

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 N/A

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 Build quality should be reliable, optical drive is not necessary

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
I will be using it for light work, but want it to be reliable nonetheless. It will be used for browsing, might read comics/Pdf, may need to use Microsoft Office. So, it doesn't need to be of the highest config, but would prefer that it would atleast be an i5 and should have atleast 8Gb of RAM. SSD is preferable"

I'm still in college, graduating for my bachelor in roughly a year. Planning to do a master afterwards. 

I'm not that happy with my position, talks with the shareholders/bosses don't help me along. They want to utilize me to a maximum, but I don't feel like they offer me a lot of reasons to stay.

Pros to stay:

-The program is my program, it's my baby and it's awesome to see people actually want to buy it. 

-I'm the only employee so all technical decision are made by me. 

-Very flexible hours, working from home is no problem. Salary is ok, not great.

-Interesting niche market that seems like a good place to make carreer. 

Cons:

-I feel like I'm not learning too much from developing on my own. I know what I should do better, but lack of time, shifting requirements and lack of discipline cause huge technical debt. Working for a bigger company should increase my knowledge and discipline. 

-After graduation I'm not going to get a salary plus benefits that are expected in the market.

-I need to shift my carreer decisions around what makes the boss happy (master in city were the company is located etc). 

-The fun is slowly wearing off. I'm not that happy going into work. 


I'm I being an entitled prick for wanting to leave? The company will probably be disbanded when I leave, they are not going to find someone willing to go through my code, fixing all technical debt while keeping money from customers flowing in. Therefore leaving feels like a dick move. Long term I think it's better for my carreer though. Sure, there's lots of opportunity in a startup if I dedicate years to it, but in the end I don't have shares, earn a ok salary and only will have earned the ""pride"" of the company going big around my program.

I'm lost, been doubting this issue for months now and not getting closer to an answer. My boss only offers peptalks, no actual reasons to take my concerns away.

I owe it all to this sub and your plethora of knowledge. Now I can actually save up to pay for university with minimal loans which means I can actually go get a bachelor's degree. 

Thank you so much and may Messer's blessing be upon you all. "

The job was for a software engineer position for a company located in India and it is a remote job. The pay was set at $25/hour, 40 hours/week. The whole interview was weird and it felt rushed. I say this because right after the interview, the HR rep said it would take about 4 minutes for the ""head"" department to decide whether I was a good fit. 4 minutes passed and she said the job was mine. The actual interview was just 10 questions that I had to answer  Plus I don't have any industry experience and I'm about to start my 4th year at a state college. Shouldn't an actual Software Engineer interview me for the position, this lady copy/pasted all her responses. I was close to accepting the job offer, but then asked for more time to think about it. I applied for the job post on internships.com, it was a virtual internship. My current job is at a retail store. I'm just feeling apprehensive. Any suggestions? 

The 10 questions:
(1) What type of jobs have you had?
(2) How did you get your previous jobs?
(3) What were your main responsibilities? Achievements?
(4) Are you currently employed?
(5) Are you willing to work flexible or long hours?
(6) When would you be available to start?
(7) Are you seeking employment in a company of a certain size? Why? (How long do you intend working for this company?

4sjm54,231,2016-07-12,TIFU by spending the past three years working on my own indie game,jslavi,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4sjm54/tifu_by_spending_the_past_three_years_working_on/,"Like most TIFUs this didn't actually happen today, but instead has been an ongoing tragedy for the past 3 years. 

The story begins five years ago when after playing around with Unity in 2011-2012 I produced an absolute shit game that somehow blew up and made me a few thousand dollars. For the 16 year old me, that was a ton of money – especially considering I made it all while doing something I really liked to do. It got into my head that if I were to make another less shit game, I would make absolutely incredible amount of cash. Plus, I thought I already knew how to make games (as I now had a bit of experience) so the second one wouldn't even take a couple years (on and off, around jobs and such) like the first.




So for the past two summers, I ended up spending about 3-4 months of 8 hour days on this new game. I worked on it after 8 hour days of a different job two summers ago. Then I decided to not get a job last summer to work on the game and go backpacking. Ended up torturing myself to get it done as I thought I'd stumbled upon the greatest puzzle game idea of all time. It didn't quite get finished last summer, but I thought I was so close so I worked on it during my winter break as well. So for that entire month instead of relaxing in the least, I spent at least 6 hours every day of the time finishing the game. Again, I thought I was super close to finishing and that I'd have it done by the time I'd get back to school. Well, this wasn't the case, of course, and when the stress of school set back in again, I put development on hold and decided that I would finally finish it off this summer and opt to not get any sort of real computer science internship again.


So about a month into this summer it was finished! I was hyped, finally I'd have a solid income. I finally posted the store page on Steam and I'd get three or four emails a day from youtubers asking me for press copies! I couldn't believe it! Finally all this work had paid off! Then a day came when I got an email from TotalBiscuit, I was over the moon, this game could not possibly be anything other than a success! I sent keys on keys on keys, was getting almost hyper waiting the release day.


Well, it finally was released and how many purchases were made you might ask? Less than 50. How many videos came out that day? About 2.


So now, almost a week later, I've come to realize that the success I had been fantasizing about for the past two years will not happen. 


Somehow I've got to tell all my friends that this thing they'd been hearing about for ages, that I'd spent about 8 months of 8 hour days on made me about 50 cents an hour. Somehow I've got to find a way to pay back my friend who loaned me a few hundred to make the game. And then I've got to convince myself that I'm not a complete failure.


I knew game development was hard to succeed with, but I thought that if you made a good, polished game you'd still make some money (and I suppose this is true, if some &gt; 0). What didn't occur to me until recently is that literally EVERY aspect of a game needs to be new and different for a game to have a chance at being successful. It is not enough to innovate a new mechanic or art style or marketing method, one needs to innovate in ALL of these directions to make solid splash – to be noteworthy as Alexander Bruce puts it. I was also stupid enough to get caught up in my own reality distortion field and opt not to put out free demos early on in development because I didn't want anyone to take my idea.


NOTE TO WANNABE INDIE DEVELOPERS:

To anyone out there who was considering becoming a game developer, don't be stupid about it like me. Post demos, post gifs, work in equal proportion to the feedback you get. Don't believe that you have a better idea about what people like than they do. 

TLDR: Spent 3 years and $2k making a silly computer game no one cares about, got to figure out how to pay bills and be happy about it."

So I recently accepted a 6-month co-op/internship with a company in my area and I have come into a bit of a bind. I like the company so far, but a few things have come up that are making me want to leave earlier than the norm (3 months).

1) Most importantly, my college adviser recently informed me that one of the classes I would need for graduating will overlap with my internship. I did not know this when I accepted the offer. If I don't take this class next quarter, I will graduate at least a year later than if I leave work to take it.

2) I was recently looking through our company network and found the offer letter given to the other intern that was hired right after me. This intern is coming into his sophomore year while I am going into my senior year. My manager clearly expressed to me that the work the other intern would be doing would be a fair bit easier than what I was tasked with (since he had no analysis or higher-level course background). This intern has maybe done half of the work I have in approximately the same amount of time (no fault of his since I have worked in industry before) and spends most of his time watching training videos. The offer letter revealed that we are being paid the exact same rate, and with my lengthy commute and need to pay rent to stay in the area, I am effectively not being compensated as well... In addition to this, this intern was only hired for two months. I don't want to sound entitled here, but I feel like I'm being kind of undervalued due to the fact that I've already had internships (which have paid more) and team experience in the past.

3) I was recently admitted into an option program (controls engineering) that I am very interested in. Much more interested in than the work that I am currently doing. If I do end up staying in the internship, I would be unable to do this program at all before graduating, since the order of classes is fixed.

4) The company just does not seem like a good fit for me. The people are nice, but the work is not what I would like to do for a career.

I really don't know what to do here guys. I signed up for a 6-month gig, but it was at-will, so I am technically allowed to quit whenever I want. That said, I don't want to tell my manager that I'm leaving the day of and screw over my team. On the other hand, I don't want to tell them now and be stuck with managers that are mad at me for the rest of my internship. Would I be in the wrong if I left for the reasons listed above?"
4sksfk,0,2016-07-12,"Crush on a Girl for Two Years, Don't Know What to Do",aah-whatever,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/4sksfk/crush_on_a_girl_for_two_years_dont_know_what_to_do/,"Hey. I'm gonna be honest this is the first thing I've ever posted on reddit. I don't even know what I really want; vent, rant, cry, seek sympathy. I guess some advice would be nice but I don't know. I guess I just want new ears to hear me bitch about stuff since I'm sure my other friends are sick of this. This'll probably be long, so I'm sorry. 


So i just finished my sophomore year as a film major at a college in New York City, and I've had this horrible, intense crush on a girl (lets call her Genny (short for Genevieve cause I like that name but don't like typing it)) for two years. We were in the same film major dorm for freshman year. I met her during welcome week and kind of just sort of fell for her. She's really pretty, warm, and incredibly sweet (on the surface at least). She has all the sex appeal of a puppy with blonde hair. We've been doing the same clubs for those two years, and have been fairly good friends. We've gotten lunch and dinner several times, been in several of the same classes, and been generally friendly. Now, she's pretty universally considered attractive. There are plenty of other guys who hit on her, flirt with her, and it tears me up inside to see it happen. I don't know how receptive to these advances she has been (my guess is not really, since she's pretty innocent, considering she's in college), but it still ruins me to see all these more confident men hit on her (especially since there really aren't all that suave about it. our College is kind of filled with those guys who are afraid to be forward (as anna kendrick would say, Genny is ""hottest-girl-in-your-improv-class hot"")). 


Now, being the social moron that I am, I have not confessed my true feelings for her. I understand that that would probably be very off-putting to her, but sometimes I feel that I just need to treat it like a bandaid and pull it off. But I'm probably not gonna do that since it would probably make it too awkward to continue the clubs we're in, and those are pretty much the only times I'm ever social at all.


I have asked her out a few times, but she is super flakey. One time, on a saturday, she actually asked me out to ""din din"" (like I said, sex appeal of a puppy) that monday, and of course I said ""yes"". But on Monday, I found out via snapchat that she was with her roommate to see a show in Manhattan. She didn't even acknowledge it the next day at the club, and I had to bring it up via text message. She didn't even apologize. 


I tried to ask her out to a screening of some oscar movie a couple months later, and she said yes at the time, only to withdraw later in the week, citing a busy shooting schedule for a TV project she was working on. But she sent me a series of five texts pleading to go the next weekend, swearing to not bail out. So I accepted, and lo and behold, she cancelled again, citing the TV show. It pretty much destroyed me, and I resolved to try not interact with her that much afterwards cause Im awkward as fuck and don't know how to deal with that. 


I've gone back and forth on whether or not she shares my feelings. There are the above incidents, of course, but she's also been incredibly caring and friendly to me, always stopping to talk when we see each other. She's been a shoulder to lean on in the past when my depression and anxiety really showed up (she's been the cause of most of it but I haven't told her that). She always says hi in class, is super playful around me, has sat next to me and put her head on my shoulder in the past. She even asked me to be her valentine last year ( i didn't really do anything because I didn't know how serious she was, but in hindsight I think she was pretty sincere). 


So, yeah, I don't know what to do. If I could I would list every interaction we've ever had together and get you guys to analyze it, but that'd be way to draining for me. Last time I had any sort of conversation with her, she texted we should get together some time over the summer. a couple of days later she sent me a snapchat of her dog in her dress. a couple of days ago my anxiety about her resurfaced because she moved into an apartment in the city (I live in NYC btw) working at an internship that is way better than mine. So yeah. 


I don't know what to do. I'm still as infatuated with her as ever, but I've been demoralized by our last couple of encounters (the standing up of me by her, to be exact). I don't know. Does she like me back? like me only as a friend? merely just put up with me? Should I contact her again? tell her my feelings? its really been tearing me up these past two years. 


TL;DR: Intense crush on a really nice girl, getting mixed signals, it's eating me up.


Sorry this is so long. Please be as honest as possible. Do I still have a shot? should I get in touch with her? Should I just try and forget it, accept it as an impossible pipe dream? If that's the case, do you have any advice on how to move on from such an intense crush? 


sincerely,
confused heart"

I had to move across the country for this internship and I had a lot of trouble finding housing for the summer. I ended up staying with a friend of a friend for the first month while I waited for my first paycheck to be able to start renting a room.

My housing situation and not having a car has meant that my arrival time at work has been a bit varied. I kept the people in my lab updated about my situation and was told that as long as I showed up before 9am, I would be okay. I have complied with this with the exception of two times when my scheduled ride cancelled last minute and I had to request an uber. Both time I showed up around 9:45 (and I called as soon as I realized I would be late). Now I am in a stable housing position with a consistent ride and everything should be okay.

The trouble is that my mentor, (also supervisor) was not around for the first few weeks of my internship and was not a part of the initial conversation when I explained my situation and was given permission to arrive at 9am. I thought she had been informed about all of this but I learned only last week that she hadn't been told much of anything (or at least, that's what she says). The first week she was here, I consistently showed up before 9am, and then the second week was when I had the two instances when I showed up after 9am. She called me into my office and stressed the importance of showing up on time. I apologized and assured her that I would be on time in the future.

And now we come to this week. My ride overslept yesterday morning and I had to call and wake him up. I called my lab to let them know I would be late and showed up at 9:30am. Then last night I was up sick all night with a stomach bug and still felt horrible this morning and would definitely not have been able to work today. I emailed my mentor from my phone and apologized for not being able to come and explained I was sick. She thanked me for letting her know and said that she hopes I feel better. But this afternoon, I got a call from one of the other interns to let me know that our mentor was talking openly about firing me if I keep ""pulling stunts like this"". 

I don't know what to do or how to prove to my mentor that I'm not a slacker. I have tried to go above and beyond with my work, making sure reports and presentations have been high quality, and working through lunch occasionally when there was a lot to do. I have stayed till 5:30pm everyday and been the last one in the lab and locked up every time. This isn't my first internship and so I know how to find work-related activities and side projects to keep me busy during slow days (organizing supply closet, updating inventory, etc all with approval from lab personnel).

I have never had an experience with an employer who has such a negative opinion of me. From what I can tell, the only thing that I have done that has warranted this is showing up late. And I have done everything that I can to fix that.

I am planning on meeting with her tomorrow to talk about all of this (I won't let her know I was tipped off by the other intern) but I don't know how to repair the damage that's been done. If the quality of my work isn't enough to convince her, I'm not sure what is. And while I'd like to be able to promise that I'll show up at 8:30am on the dot, I can't get a ride in that early and the bus system would either get me to work at 7am (before anyone else is there) or 9:45am. And there isn't much I can do if my ride is late like he was this week (the only time he has done this).

I know that there are things I could have done earlier like getting a loan from my parents to get better housing sooner or paying more for a location with a better bus route but I can't change those things now. I would really appreciate any advice you have for my meeting with my mentor. "

I'm a math major (applied &amp; computational) and just finished my junior year of college. I'm currently doing an internship at an IT company and honestly, it sucks for several reasons:
1. I am not very fond of programming, I like it when I combine it with other factors (like math modeling) but right now I'm coding all day long and I'm not into it at all.
2. There is no interactions with other people. I am extroverted and I need lots of communication - meetings, presentations, etc. However, I'm in an office for developers that is physically separated from the HQ.

This is really stressing me out and I have a month left (it was supposed to be for 3 months). I feel like if I continue with it I'm going to be burnt out before returning for senior year. I have two questions :

1. Should I or should I not quit now? It is obviously not acceptable but how unacceptable is this and how is this going to affect my resume / job search in the future?
2. I realized I don't want a job where I just sit at an office every single day. I've always assumed that is what I would be doing after graduation, but this experience made me realize that that's not going to happen. I've redirected my career search to consulting or government positions. Do you think this is a good idea? If not, what are other fields as a math major that I can go into that is dynamic?

4smg78,509,2016-07-13,"Recently graduated, my advice to Computer Science majors",sfst4i45fwe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4smg78/recently_graduated_my_advice_to_computer_science/,"This sub-reddit has helped me tremendously when it came to making the right decisions while in school. I just want to share what worked for me and give back a little.

**Do I have to go to a top tier school?**  
Not necessarily,  but make sure to go to one that is near a tech hub. Universities that are near tech hubs attract employers. I'm talking San Francisco, Seattle, Santa Monica, New York... Employers like to hire locally, and a lot of them want fresh grads so they go to the nearby universities. My education cost me less than 20k and was not the best school, but I was lucky enough to have a lot of tech companies show up at the career fairs. That being said, if you have the funds and the grades, absolutely go to top tier schools - as all the big tech companies will send recruiters there regardless of location. 

**What should I focus my time on?**  
Do not take Data Structures and Algorithms courses for granted. I went through a LOT of interviews, and that was the one topic that employers seem to care about more than anything else. Interviewing is a numbers game, you never know exactly what they will ask, so your best bet is to learn what is most likely to be asked. Could some guy toss an assembly question? Sure, but highly unlikely. Will you be asked to print every permutation of 'abcd' or some sorting problem? Much more likely. Take those courses seriously, and start doing programming questions asap. Consider the programming interviews to be your equivalent of a law school bar exam. Get a book, learn the crap out of every problem. Then do it again. Redo problems so you retain what you learn. Asides from that, work on programming projects, internships. Get work experience.

**Grades vs Projects**  
Maintain a 3.0+ GPA so you do not get weeded out, then focus on projects. I was never asked any questions about my grades or GPA - however I was constantly asked about my experiences with extra curricular programming projects. Every. Single. Interview was about my projects. Not only do projects fill up your resume, but projects give you the programming experience you need to have stories. Stories asked by an interviewer like: ""Tell me about a time you had to do X,Y,Z and how did you do it?"" or ""Tell me about a time when someone did something and there was a conflict how did you handle it blablabla"". No projects means no stories, no stories means you will not appear experienced to the interviewer. I did not have an internship under my bag, but I had tons of projects, an active github account, and people who benefited from my projects and could vouch for it. These stories are extremely difficult to make up on the spot, but easy once you have a few projects under your belt. The difference between my first round of interviews 1.5 years ago and the second round 4 months ago was that I now had stories - like the time I spent 4 hours on some bug, or when I helped solve a problem in some clever way, or what the strengths and weaknesses of a language I used were... I'm rambling. But you get the idea.

**Where can I find those so-called ""projects""?**  
Asides from personal projects, take a look at Electrical, Mechanical, Computer Engineering departments. A lot of them have group projects, sometimes funded by a company, and managed by faculty. At my school there were a handful of them to choose from, ranging from robotics, race-cars, brain-wave scans, to shoe box sized cube satellites. Don't forget to join the computer science clubs. There is a major shortage of programmers willing to work for free... the projects are there you just have to ask around.

**How many interviews did you fail until you got a job.**  
Let me preface this by saying that I was picky. I could have accepted a job early and settled - but I did not. I had a Google interview, and Google motivated me to study my ass off for 3 months. I failed it. I failed Amazon, Epic, M.S., and tons of others. I accidentally said ""shit"" at my M.S. interview. I took things personally. I got mad at the constant coding homework problems. I gave up on great job offers due to location - hoping I did not make a mistake for months. Speaking of mistakes, I basically made every mistake in the book. But in the end I found a company I liked, and by then I had enough experience failing that I did not care. After a while you realize that there is always another company, another interview. At that interview I cracked a few jokes, forgot to do my hair, nailed every programming problem, got the offer 2 days later. Just like soccer, reading, or playing piano, interviewing is a skill. You learn from your mistakes, you learn what to say and what not to say. Eventually you will realize that those guys interviewing you have not been studying interviewing questions for the last 4 months. You will realize you are probably smarter than them in that department and they just happen to know the answer so they sound smart. Practice makes perfect.

Anyways, just my 2 cents. I hope this helps somebody out there.

TL;DR: Projects &gt; Grades. Location matters.


EDIT: I just want to point out that this is what worked for me. I highly recommend work experience as an intern as well. While I did not necessarily go the path of being an intern, I don't want this post to come off as ""Projects &gt; Internships"". IMO they are both extremely important and should be pursued while in school."

My first internship in IT starts this Monday. It's for a medium-sized company, and really one of the only things I know about it right now is that it's mostly help desk type stuff. What should I expect as a computer science student going into this kind of job? I'll likely be there for at least the next year or so, turning part time during the school year.

It's an online program that, per the curriculum, seems to be a decent education for someone who is interested in working as an embedded hardware engineer or something of that nature. But Devry is very expensive and I've heard bad things about them. I recommended that he go to ASU and pursue a real Electrical Engineering degree. The curriculum, as far as I know, is similar to what Devry is offering but more in-depth with cooler projects. Not to mention that I think ASU looks better on a resume, especially since he would like to intern at Intel...which apparently hires a lot of people from ASU.

ASU would be around $10,000 cheaper than Devry. Both are expensive, but he's committed to paying off the student loans as quickly as possible once he graduates. I'm trying to position him for success, and I think ASU is the better option for him. He likes to work with his hands and he is interested in electronics. He likes the concept of writing code for hardware, especially things like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

I was wondering if Devry really is that bad, and if ASU is much better. For the cost and for the future opportunities of having either on the resume. Does it matter where he goes, as long as he does side projects and learns a lot on his own and markets himself well? Would companies like Intel see Devry on a resume and throw it in the trash? 

Would be very grateful to anyone who has any experience at either Devry or ASU, and especially with their online programs and post-graduation success."

**Back story:** I'm looking to apply for a big name game company internship for next summer and they suggest to provide a portfolio of completed projects' source code, code snippets, classes, etc (anything to do with code really in Java, C, C++, and/or C#). They don't say what they're looking for specifically, they just want to know if applicants have a basic understanding of how to code and how to use that knowledge to make games. *This is really just me writing out my plan for my application but feel free to use this for yourself as well.* 

-  *personal*\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
- Currently I'm working on a big project myself that I hope to have done by the end of august so that and it's source code will definitely be included in my own portfolio.
- *everything else*\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- 
- a section of **Utility classes** such as a level/scene manager, music managers, object pooling, texture optimizing, save management, Input controls, etc. This is one of the most important sections even if it's engine-specific. These tools will be used by designers to make the game itself so they need to be well documented and easy to use. 
- Several examples of **MVC classes** for all kinds of character/vehicle movement, health, world interactions. All the things you'd expect to see in games.
- **Custom Physics Classes**, doesn't have to be anything too impressive, just to show a wider range of talents. *Most* game don't need impressive physics engines like air friction or wind speed but it's good to show that you can do some of that. 
- Simple (at least) **UI controllers**, even if it's specific to one game engine. A lot of times you (or designers) will find it useful to implement quick UI elements to test features.
- A set of **super/sub classes** of a game play element just to show your understanding of all of the basic programming concepts. An example of this could be a unit class &gt; archers | warriors | healers or something simple like that. Object Oriented Programming is a MUST in game dev. 
- Some code to handle **online game play** is always nice, even if it barely scratches the surface. 
- Show that you can handle **player management** with save data, profiles, and basic statistics. 
- For a few classes, its a good idea to rewrite them in **different languages** that you know to showcase your flexibility. 

When people look at your code they will be looking for: 
- How easy is it to read/understand/maintain
- How elegant is it? could it have been done a much easier way? 
- Does it have any obvious bugs

If I forgot anything on this list feel free to comment your ideas, I may add them to the list (with credit). "

However, this summer I got an accounting internship to find out if it's really what I want to do...and I absolutely hate it. It's been a month and I have to drag myself here every morning. So I think it could be a good time to take a hard look at a career shift. Here are my thoughts in the past 48 hours.


-Just because I don't like accounting doesn't mean I'm completely ruling out working in the business world. Project Management and Consulting are on my radar

-I like technology and would possibly be interested in Information Systems

-I really love the environment and feel like adding that passion to my work would help me identify with it and get a lot more job satisfaction

-I'm not sure if a shift toward an environmental career would manifest itself as ""still a business major with a focus on sustainability"" or ""complete 180 to environmental studies/environmental education"". I think the latter sounds incredibly fun but would probably take a fifth year of school and definitely be harder to find a job


-One more thing to keep in mind is I have (and plan on having) a pretty vibrant life outside of work: being outdoors, hiking and biking and going on trips with friends, so maybe I should just look for a job I don't hate rather than one I love?

**Big Questions**


Should I stick out my internship for another month and a half even if I feel like it's not taking me anywhere?

What other steps can I take to cement a better idea of my career direction?

Thank you for the help!

New York Code and Design academy has a few part time courses that pique my interest, but I'm not sure if one will make me a stronger candidate for jobs than others. In and around NYC, specifically. Realistically, I can only hope to get an internship or apprenticeship, as I've been self taught for eleven months now. 


I've been briefly familiarized with the Backbone framework and I'm pretty competent with OO JS, so I figured Angular would be a no-brainer for front-end work. To boot, I've been studying and writing in Javascript nonstop since January. But is this highly-sought skill already fulfilled by very talented developers looking for work?  
(no page available atm)


Then there's iOS development 101, which seems like a lot of fun and might figure into an internship next Summer. I applied and almost landed one with a small company near me. The owner told me to apply again next year, so if it's realistic that I will have a hard time finding work as a self-taught front-end JS developer, maybe it would make more sense to shift my focus and wait until I'm more qualified.

4souti,63,2016-07-13,Diagnosed at 35 - suddenly my whole life makes sense,chrysalistic,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4souti/diagnosed_at_35_suddenly_my_whole_life_makes_sense/,"I was recently diagnosed as ADHD - Inattentive type. I have been seeing a CBT therapist for a couple of years for depression and anxiety and in an especially low point recently, I sought out a psychiatrist. I laid out my whole life for her and she asked the magic words, ""Has anyone ever considered you might have ADD?"" It was like a lightbulb went off!

I was an athlete in HS, so I was able to keep myself pretty much together because I had strict schedules (and super strict parents), routine exercise, and deadlines to meet. I was a good student, even if I did put things off until the last minute.

In college, I was really on my own for the first time and I did ""OK"" for the first couple of years, but then my procrastination and disorganization got the better of me and I fell a year behind. Then I had a senior project to do and I never finished. To this day, I'm 4 credits shy of my bachelor's.

I worked in my field for a while (going on the merit of internships and the name of the college I attended). But I hated the busy work side of things and quit before I got fired. Then I decided to return to school. I found a grad program that accepted me despite the lack of a true BS, and struggled through and eventually graduated (mix a surprise pregnancy in there and it was challenging to say the least). I'm sure I actually made it though because it was a subject I loved and my moments of hyperfocus saved me.

Then, in my infinite wisdom, I thought it would be a brilliant idea to go into business for myself. That was almost 5 years ago, and I've managed to practically drive my business into the ground because I just can't get my shit together. I'm so deep in debt, I'll never dig my way out. I have stacks and stacks of work that I know I *need* to get done, and I just can't seem to do it. I am flaky and forget to return calls and emails. My depression makes me feel awful and I hate marketing to sell my business. My anxiety because of all of this is crippling.

I'm going to keep seeing my CBT therapist and I've started Prozac recently for the depression/anxiety and in a little while when we see how I'm doing with that, the psychiatrist wants to address the ADHD.

tl;dr - I'm 35 years old with a string of educational/professional failures behind me and now I realize it's because I've had undiagnosed ADHD my whole adult life."

&gt; Dear Sir or Madam, 
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; As a recent graduate with a degree in political science and a focus on international relations, I would like to express my interest in the security and defense policy internship at the [orginization], as advertised on [job site]. I am currently pursuing a career in the field of international policy research and am highly interested in many of the topics covered by [the orginizations's] Security and Defense Policy team, including NATO expansion, Eastern Europe, and transatlantic relations. I believe that this opportunity would provide me with exceptional experience and knowledge to further serve personal aspirations in the field. 
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; My academic studies have provided me with an interest and a strong foundation of knowledge on key international security topics. My international relations curriculum extensively covered issues such as humanitarian intervention, terrorism, ethnic conflict, and defense policy. In addition to my regular coursework, I spent a semester studying peace and conflict at [program], based in Belgrade, Serbia. The coursework of this semester covered in depth issues affecting regional and international security, such as the effects of international intervention, ethnic nationalism, and post-conflict reconstruction. Additionally, I conducting a month long independent study on religious identity in Kosovo, and its effects on extremism in the region. Overall, my coursework fostered both personal and career interests, and developed my ability to research, analyze, and communicate effectively.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, my prior internship experiences have developed professional skills which I believe would serve this position well. At [orginization], in Prishtina, Kosovo, my primary responsibility was to assist with organization-wide research projects, which included topics in security policy such as extremism and the use of violence by local political parties. Additionally, I conducted day to day administrative tasks, such completing grant applications, data input, and monitoring news sources relevant to the organization’s mission. At the same time, I interned for [local news publication], where I contributed original articles for the magazine and was responsible for editing and publishing English language content for the website. In balancing these two positions while also navigating the challenges of living abroad, I strengthened my capacity to manage time and balance a large number and variety of deadline sensitive, detail oriented tasks. Prior to my experience in Kosovo, I also spent a summer interning at [orginization], where I contributed to projects on disaster relief policy and corruption in law enforcement. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that my academic, personal, and professional experiences come together to make me &gt;a strong candidate for this position. Thank you for reviewing my application.

4sqci7,37,2016-07-13,"Recently graduated from a bootcamp, here's is what I learned.",Iyace,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4sqci7/recently_graduated_from_a_bootcamp_heres_is_what/,"So, this is in reference to the other cool dude who decided to share his experiences as a recent graduate. I am also a recent graduate, but I went to a bootcamp. I've seen lots of questions like ""CS degree or bootcamp?"" and everything, so I figured I'd lend my opinions as a someone who walked the walk and is current on the job hunt.

**Should I go to a bootcamp or get a cs degree?**

   I think this question is almost impossible to answer unless you provide some very deep personal background. There's a couple of things I'd like to dispel, however.

   The first is that a cs degree is the same price as bootcamp tuition, and you'll be more hire-able, so you should go with a cs degree. People who say this don't understand opportunity cost. Sure, even if they're the same cost, you're forgoing possibly 3.5 years ( 1.5 if its a masters program or some such ) of wages getting a CS degree. That sort of argument doesn't hold much merit.

   The second is that bootcamp graduates aren't hire-able within 3 months, and the statistics aren't true. I can't speak to the aggregate data over the industry as a whole, but my personal experience with the two cohorts above me leads me to believe that you're definitely hire-able. Almost all of the cohort that graduated when I started ( 95% ) are gainfully employed as software developers.

   And the third is that a bootcamp graduate is just as prepared to enter the workforce as a CS degree holder. I don't believe this is true for reasons I'll go into below.

**What's the difference between a bootcamp graduate and a CS graduate?**

   There's a lot, actually. Bootcamp graduates actually learn a lot of the things that interns pick up in their internships. We learn the tools of the grade, and how to use them. E2E testing, build tools, frameworks, RESTful APIs, how teh interwebz werks... etc. We learn all of the same things that make us able to be productive in the workplace.

   What we don't learn are the core fundamentals. This is far more applicable in enterprise-level software than it is at small start ups. You can push a lot of bootcamp grads deep on core concepts like distributed systems, embedded systems, and hardware related stuff that we have no idea about ( unless our background is technical ). These concepts become more important when you're dealing with larger systems, which is why I believe you don't see a lot of bootcamp grads get hired at bigger firms.

   There's also this notion that bootcamp grads are more prepared for the workforce, because CS grads have no hands on experience. I think this is false, because you're equating two different things. You're equating the best and most proactive of the bootcamps grads against the least proactive of the CS grads. This isn't a fair comparison, as CS grads with internships have just as much industry knowledge as a bootcamp grad, PLUS a solid core of fundamentals. As bootcamp grads, we don't need to put down other people who worked just as hard as we did because their path was more academic, and we generally don't even have a right to do so.

**Why did I choose a bootcamp?**

   My background is in economics, with a focus on the quantitative route ( econometrics ). I got interested in programming as hobby first, and developing software sort of ignited my passion. So I was left with the choice of going back to school for 2 years, or jumping into an accelerated program to propel my career. I also own a house and bills.

   That being said, I don't recommend bootcamps for everyone. I wouldn't even recommend them to the majority of people. I don't think everyone can become a software developer, because I don't think everyone really wants to be a software developer. I chose the bootcamp route because I really wanted to be a software developer, and was willing to risk a lot of things in my life to get there.

**What was bootcamp like?**

   It was really hard. I went to MakerSquare in Santa Monica, and I really do recommend it to anyone who is seriously considering a bootcamp and has prepared themselves for one. Entry is relatively difficult, as you're given a series of algorithmic questions and asked to solve them using conventional algorithms. This is a weeding out process, so that MKS can find the best candidates.

   Once in, I got a lot of pre-curriculum to prepare me for the kind of material I'd be in for. A lot of it was more advanced concepts like recursion, etc. Fortunately, the first week or so was dedicated to some core CS concepts like data structures (BSTs, Graphs, etc ) and algorithms. Everything after that was such a blur of technology. We learned front-end, then back-end, and learned how to tie it all together. The senior portion was dedicated to using our new knowledge to build three applications from scratch. I don't regret any part of my decision to join MKS, in retrospect.

**What's the job search like?**

   It's hard. No one is knocking down doors to get me into theirs. There's a lot of HR rejections, no one calling me back or following up. The great thing about my bootcamp is that they prepared me well so that when someone does take a chance and gets on the phone with me, I can speak to everything I've done. All throughout the program, we were given a daily interview question to solve, as well as whiteboarding sessions towards the end of the program. The last interview I had (earlier today) was one of the most comfortable and confident interviewing experiences I've ever had, because of how prepared my bootcamp made me.

**So, I want to go to a bootcamp, how should I prepare?**

   Get clear on your fundamentals and why you want to be a software engineer. Are you always the smartest dude in the room and don't like feeling dumb? You're going to feel very dumb in a bootcamp. Do you like free time? You won't have any in your bootcamp.

   If you're willing to give up on everything to get a career in software engineering, however, I would recommend it. So start by getting into the nolife mindset right now. Crack open a CS fundamentals book, and start learning about software. This is going to be a lifelong learning experience for you, so start today. Focus on algorithms and data structures, and pick up a high-level language like JavaScript to practice with. When you're ready, go apply!

I should give a bit of backstory, long story short I have seen, experienced, and been exposed to the worst things that life possibly has to offer. Think of the worst thing you can ever image and multiply it by 1000x. I have terryfing levels of ptsd. I can honestly say that going to war and killing people and returning to society with the ptsd that combat veterans have is fucking nothing at all. I would literally give a right arm to be able to go to war and come back with that baggage if it meant my past experiences would go away.

A few months ago, I woke up hours late to my minimum wage job. I went to the gas station to buy orange juice to mix with vodka. As I was leaving the gas station, a large group of bikers with ""combat ptsd veteran"" shirts rode up behind and then next to me. One of them came right up to the side of my car and rode wheel-to-wheel with me. He matched his front wheel with my left front drivers side tire and hugged my car so close I thought he would crash into me. As I approached work, I put my blinker on, had to merge, and they backed off and let me lead them. I could see them smile at me as I led them, so I down shifted and floored it to signal I was down with them. They must have seen me get the orange juice or something idk. I was the leader of a biker group of combat ptsd veterans.

Anyway, I had went to a career fair at verizon through the community college I can no longer afford. I stepped so far out of my comfort zone to be there, I even surprised myself. I was a wolf amongst sheep. I had everyone laughing, they all got a kick out of me, and the most high-up senior manager in the room was matching my body language on the other side of the table. This was it for me; I had found success, and could finally get out of my nightmare house.

While I was applying online for the job after networking with them, my mom called the cops on me and said I was yelling and a threat to myself or others. This could not be proven or disproven. My mom has munchausen syndrome by proxy, and has drugged, starved, neglected, and abused me physically and psychologically my entire life. I cannot even begin to describe the fucking terrifying things she has done to me; she wants to have a special needs child that she can throw around at church and get sympathy for. 

The cops came with a mobile crisis team to talk to me. I talked to them, they left, I finished the application. The next day, she called the cops again for the same reason. Because she called twice in two days, the police had to arrest me for disorderly conduct. I spent 10 days in jail, which traumatized and dehuminized me even more than I had been.

While I was wrongfullying incarcerated, I got the job at verizon. 30k a year plus commission, and 8k tuition assistance?!?! I had made it!!!! I could finally get the fuck away from my nightmare house and I could actually pay for college!!! This job was everything I have ever wanted and more. And that is why she had me arrested, remember she has munchausen syndrome by proxy.

So, I got the job while I was in jail. And they had to withdraw the position because I wasn't responding to the emails. They emailed me five times, the last of which was a notification stating they had to withdraw the position.

I have since re-applied, dozens of times, and am no longer qualified.

I am now living in my deadbeat dad's apartment, unemployed and at the mercy of his outbursts. I cannot take anymore abuse in  my life. And I have to live with him again because I'm just not going back to my mom. He is the most vile, disgusting, abusive alcoholic drug addict you would ever meet. This place is a shithole and I have to deal with his nasty abuse every day now. I cannot take this anymore. I'm living out of state from my school that I can no longer afford. Even if I get abother minimum wage job I cant enroll in school in time and couldn't pay for it anyway so I'm going to have to take maybe a year off after doing exceptionally well my most recent semester. I will not make it, after everything I've been through, I need a real job NOW RIGHT NOW or I will not make it.

I have so much ambition, I know what I am intellectually capable of. I am a literal genius. 

I cannot have another opportunity like the one verizon offered without an internship or career fair at the community college I can no longer pay for and now live an hour drive away from.

The city I live in has train tracks and trains go through it every night. I am going to lay on the tracks in the very near future and just end it. I cannot live with my dad as much as I can't live with my mom. I can't live on my own because minimum wage does not pay bills let alone tuition.

What I need most in this life right now is a career with upward mobility and advancement potential. I will work so fucking hard you would not believe.

That is the only way out of this. Either a ""real job"" falls onto my lap, or a train will. I have no other options.

I am about to be homeless, I'm planning on getting whatever job I can take so I can buy a car and live out of it. Living out of a car would finally provide me with the sense of privacy and personal space I have not had my entire life. I just want to be alone. No one has ever respected my privacy or personal space so I'm going to live out of a car. Ive been looking at an acura rsx type s with low miles because it's a really nice car and lasts forever and I could actually afford it with minimum wage. My dream car is a 1995 Nissan 240sx s14.5 or a boosted evo. That's kindof the only reason I'm still alive, I like cars and want to thru-hike the Appalachian trail while I'm still young. I don't have a chance of hiking without money saved though so that's gone.

If anyone has been through something similar to me and walks to talk about it please do. I have applied to dozens and dozens of office jobs and can't even get an interview. What do I do. How do I make it out of this. I have the mind of a millionaire, I know what im capable of. Please help me

Edit - I cannot join the military because I have crohns disease and am automatically disqualified from serving"

My first two years were in computer science, my third year I switched to a more business Information Systems major but only took some business gen eds.  Then I came back to CS and have 1 more year left.

Most of my classes have been in the C++ language with some very minor PHP, CSS, HTML and MySQL.  I also have taken an assembly course as its a requirement at my university.  

I'm in a bit of a predicament though as I feel as though I haven't retained as much information as I probably should have.  I feel as though I cannot discuss CS topics and I don't really have anything interesting to tell about my experiences so far.  I had an internship this past Spring but I had to cut it short because I was no longer going to be a full time student.

I've had a few interviews at the beginning of the summer but no luck.  

In the fall I'm scheduled to take a .net class at my 4 year college as well as a computer architecture required class.

I was thinking of taking some courses at my local community college (which actually has more CS classes and more diverse ones at that than my current 4 year state school).  

They have a few different certificate programs where it is strictly CS courses and can be finished in 9 months time.  I was either thinking of doing the web developer one or the applications programmer one which is C++ and Java.  I'm guessing that is more of my personal preference rather than anything.

But onto my major question: Would this be a smart move?  I feel as though I'm not comfortable enough or experienced enough as I should be for going through my 3 years of computer science.  I'm not one to come up with interesting projects on my own though and would have no idea where to start, so I thought maybe a few more classes under my belt could lead me to develop some more worthwhile projects to discuss in future interviews as well as help me become a better programmer in general.

Let me know what you guys think.




TLDR:  Graduating in May 2017 (3 years CS under my belt) not feeling to confident in my abilities, should I supplement with some extra CS courses at local Community College?"

Already I have learned a fair amount of C from schoolwork, and my current internship as a data scientist involved learning SQL. My question is what language I should move onto next? My library of PDFs is very extensive with multiple textbooks covering C++, Java, Regex, Unix, Python, R, LaTeX, Ruby&amp;Rails. I was thinking that if I wanted to expand on data science as potential career than languages like Python and R would be extremely beneficial, but I'm open to input from the /r/learnprogramming community as they might have a different point-of-view and be more knowledgeable on the topic. Personally I think learning Unix and Regex would be useful but, to be honest, I don't really have any idea what I am talking about. If you have time please explain what you think would be the best course of action going forward about the question. Thank you!

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? Between high-ultra settings. I'd like to get at least 60 fps and most likely will go 1080p with my monitors. 


**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**
I would like to pick up two decent monitors and keep the total build below 1250$. I can get windows 10 from university for free, and already own a keyboard, mouse, headset, etc.

I've already decided I'm staying in this city and not going back. It's the end of my third week and I really want to stay at the place I'm interning since it's a top company. 

I expressed my interests in my first week and the manager said we could talk in a month. I ended up applying to a bunch of places while also getting hit up by recruiters and now I have 5 new opportunities (whether it's a phone call, coding exercise, coffee...) that I am trying to juggle. 

The phone calls are definitely easier for me since I can just take a lunch and talk to the person who calls me. However there's a guy who wants to meet me in person and I'm assuming some of these 5 leads will turn into some sort of face to face. 

Thing is though my top pick is the company I'm interning at but I don't wanna miss out on the other ones either in case I don't get an offer at my first pick. 

How can I juggle this?"

My internship started in early June. After the first week of training and orientation, my manager gave me an assignment, and directed me to one or two employees to help me along. He didn't give me any deadlines.

For about two weeks I made steady progress, but then as I entered into territory of the project which required a more intimate knowledge of how the company's development platform and API's work, I began having to frequently ask those one or two employees or my manager for guidance. Now, they provided me the information I needed, but I usually had to wait an hour or two sometimes for them to get a free slot in their schedule to talk with me.

After a week and a half of slow progress, it came time for my midsummer review. My manager told me that he thought I was picking everything up well and learning a lot, but told me that he thought I'd be finished my project by now. I was a little surprised since this was the first time he had ever mentioned the timing of the project to me. I asked him what he suggests I do and he told me to put in some overtime and asks questions whenever they come up, the hopefully I'd be able to finish the project by mid-next week.

That was on Monday. Early on last week he did daily code reviews with me where he'd try to give me a little more guidance on what to do, but after a couple of days he had another employee do it with me instead. Since the review I've started putting in about two hours of overtime every day, and I've been messaging or emailing my manager with questions as soon as they arise, but it takes him even longer to get back to me about these correspondences than before the review.

I get that most employees are busy and they don't really care what non-time sensitive project the intern is working on, but I feel afraid that it's going to reflect poorly upon me if I don't finish this project soon, which is seeming harder and harder to accomplish.

Anyone have any experience or suggestions on why to do?"

I have just graduated college with an engineering degree but since I avoided trying to get internships/interviews, I am left with no experience on my resume and no job. I’m 22 years old and have had no friends to hang out with since I was about 13 years old and I think it has to do me with being afraid of confronting people and thinking I’m going to be laughed at and ridiculed for just being a loner and not having friends basically.


My parents are breathing down my neck expecting me to get a job and I just don’t see it happening since I have no experience and have very little contacts in the industry. So I know I am basically going to have to ask around and go to networking events where I have to sell myself which is very awkward for me. I know what I have to do yet I keep delaying this because I am so worried about how people are going to think of me. First of all, I know I will get ridiculed because people who know my college know that there is ample opportunity to get internships and jobs after college that its actually rare that you don’t have any experience after graduating. They are going to wonder what I did all my 4 years at college and the only thing I can point to is my shyness and Social anxiety hampering my thought process and motivation to be more social and network with my peers.  So I’ve decided that I don’t want to settle for this life of living at home and working at part time jobs with a depressed attitude, I want to change that and go out and find people who can help me get the job I deserve after toiling for 4 years for that degree. 


So I already know I’m going to force myself to go talk to people, I just want something that will make it a little easier and I know for sure that it shouldn’t be this hard and it’s not this hard to talk to people for others. I’m like sweating and heart racing nervous for other stuff my peers do so calmly and non-chalantly. I’ve never been diagnosed or talked to any medical professional about my mental thoughts on this, only my mom pretty much. So basically I’m hoping to go to my general family doctor and tell him what I’m feeling about my Social Anxiety and hoping he will just prescribe me some medication right on the spot and have me on my way. Basically I make this post to ask you guys if this is a sound idea and if I should go through with it.

I have been working dutifully as a QA software tester intern for 15 months at an MNC. I have recently graduated and I'm looking for full time.

I talked with managers and there weren't any open full time positions for a good while. I am doing the same job as any full time employee for less money, it's been alright while university lasted but it just won't do it anymore.

I've been job hunting and I have already passed the final interviews at another company for a System Administrator position and I'm awaiting the decision on whether they are going to hire me.

The twist is, the management at my current workplace had a change of heart and they reached out to me with the possibility of a full time employment in the near future.

I am very curious to try out new things in IT and I don't see myself in 3-4 years time enjoying my current job. Job hunting has been an eye opening experience for me, I am still searching where my passion is at in IT.

My dilemma is the following:
- The company heavily relies on interns (who can quit anytime).
- There is an enormous project, that has been in planning for months and if anyone leaves, it will hurt the project
- There aren't any available people that can take over my job and I'd have to train a replacement. The project is a month away and requires experienced testers.

If I quit my job, I may be jobless for a while, but I don't know how to break it to my manager. Contractually I'm not obliged to stay, but I would be leaving in a time of need. I believe the company is at fault for making our department like a house of cards (too many interns), but I am also friends with the managers and colleagues and I don't want to leave a bad reputation by leaving now.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?

extra info: I can legally work as an intern until 1st August, the soonest date I will hear if I have been hired at the other company is after 25th July"

It's obviously not everyone, and part of why I love my current job is that presently we have nobody like this in our area at all which makes the entire environment great.

I see it on here as well. 

I think it comes with people who have a job others don't understand and underestimate what it takes to get stuff done. It's just not appropriate behavior though. Even if someone is a jerk to you, you have to take the high road and keep in control. "

This is exactly what I want to do for the rest of my life. 


All of that being said, the thought of going back to school this fall to learn ""software development foundations"" and ""data structures and algorithms"" sounds like the most boring thing in the world. I don't want to stop making things, I don't want to lose my drive for CS in the semantics of computing as a science. What I think I really want is to work software development as a trade. 


All of this being said, dropping out of school is just too scary of an idea. I love the idea of working full time software development without having to deal with tests and homework at the same time. It is difficult to work on personal projects and be a student at the same time because I need to maintain a very high GPA to avoid any more loans. I am worried that I will be shooting myself in the foot really hard down the road if I were to quit now. 


I don't want to take on any more debt. I don't want to learn what makes a language Turing complete. I don't care to learn any more about parallel processing in CUDA. I just want to make software that people love to use and I want to start making it ASAP. 


Did anyone else go through this while you were in school? Did you stay in school? What do you do today? Sorry for this dump of information I am just really self conflicted right now and need somewhere to talk about this."

I just found this sub and I'm not sure if I'm doing this right. I apologize if I'm not. 

Anyways, this has been a hard year for my girlfriend and I. We met at a conservative Bible school together and fell in love. She is my reason for everything I do. 

While there, I was studying to be a Pastor. I loved learning, mostly independently, and I loved teaching others something new and interesting. I had a real passion for the religion as well. However, I always had an issue with how conservative the culture and beliefs were.

After 3 years of classes, I started an internship at the perfect church for me. It was very liberal and encouraged me to expand my beliefs. I felt challenged and encouraged. I asked the pastor for a job and got hired. The money was awful, and I very quickly discovered that the Pastor and I did not work well on a professional level. I got completely burnt out and my partner and I left the church after sticking it out for a year.

Around the same time we were experiencing personal stress related to our families (being disowned, etc.) for our changing beliefs and the fact that we moved in together. We lost a lot of family and friends from leaving our faith tradition and it has left me feeling very empty.

When I started the job, I had also made the decision to leave my university. I transferred to a state school that was much cheaper and attended by mostly people returning to school. I loved the maturity of the people I was in class with. However, I have not once felt challenged by the coursework or engaged by my classes. I have been really struggling to balance school with the stress of home and work.

Now I work driving for Lyft part time (even after expenses it pays better than the church did), have failed several classes, and can't seem to get myself out of bed most days. I have so much debt from working towards a mostly useless degree that I'm not sure I want anymore. 

I think I need to take some time off school while I figure out what I want. Im a little over a year from finishing, but I can hardly go another day. I love problem solving and I love helping people through hard situations. I am a good listener and I enjoy teaching, just not kids. I also really love the feeling of being my own boss and would strongly consider self employment.I still have a passion for the Bible even though I don't still believe in it's literal interpretation; or God for that matter. I'm just not sure what to do next.

Any advice?"

Dear Sir or Madam,

Online Marketing is my passion. Since you are looking for an Intern who is motivated to show flexibility in adapting new trends and someone who is smart and passionate about finding the new status Quo, I would like to apply for the Internship position advertised at your Homepage.

In Summer 2015 I graduated from the Wiesbaden Business School as a Bachelor of Science. Because of these studies, I’ve learned a lot about marketing and because of my Internship at the Zurich Company in Wiesbaden, I was able to enhance these skills. 

I am a very ambitious person and to improve the quality of my work constantly I use every day to learn something new. Besides creativity my characteristics are the attention to detail, as well as persistence and the accuracy with which I work.
 
My last employers were able to benefit from these skills as well. Because of my outstanding performance at my Internship, the Zurich Insurance Company took me over as a working student. 

Since October 2015, I work self employed as an Online Marketing Manager and as a Web designer. Because of this work, I was able to learn and gain experience with the creation, the adaption and the optimization of a website as well as with On-Page optimization, Keyword Planning, Content Management and Social Media Marketing. 

For my next career step, I would like to become a part of razorfish and I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the position and my candidacy with you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because I wasn't employed since August 2015, I mention in my CV that I was self-employed since October 2015. The part of my CV looks like this:

Since Oct 2015
self-employed as a Marketing Manager &amp; Web Designer, International 
*Keyword Planning
*On-Page Optimization (HTML5 &amp; CSS3) 
*Content Management 
*Social Media Marketing

What you think about this?
 

Many thanks for any Help!!!"
4sykc4,1,2016-07-15,"So many directions to take my learning in, looking for some advice",Grycen,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/4sykc4/so_many_directions_to_take_my_learning_in_looking/,"Hey everyone, I've been a lurker in this subreddit for a while, and the community and resources here have been massively helpful. I find myself at a bit of a crossroads with my learning, though, and searching through previous posts and the various FAQs and Wikis hasn't provided the kind of clarity I'm looking for, so I figured it was time to put myself out there a bit and get some more personalized feedback/suggestions. 


So, this is where I'm at/been: 

I'm a CS student, with about a year left in school and had been programming for a while before then. I dabbled in game development here and there, with my CS102 final project being a text-based ""game"" (quotations because it frankly wasn't very fun, mostly there to demonstrate my knowledge of OOP, language's data structures, etc.) I made in C++. Shortly after I finally dove into game development with Unity using all kinds of resources (Ben Tristam's course was the first thing that really kicked off my learning there) and got increasingly better at it, then started picking up some Unreal. 

At the moment I have two jobs, one for a non-game dev software company where I intern mainly doing CI/CD/DevOps work, mostly in Python, as well as a contract with a local game developer where I am a programmer on two different projects, one in Unity and one in Unreal. The great thing about this setup is that I'm getting great, continuous experience and answered the burning question I had for a while on whether I'd be happier pursuing a career in game development over other subsets of software engineering - definitely the former, I still enjoy software development in general, games are just a type of problem I enjoy solving a loooooot more (plus there's the enjoyment of making an artistic product, but I'm digressing).


This leads me to where I'm going and where I'm looking for some input. Now, disclaimer: I know no one can tell me what to do exactly and that's not what I'm looking for. I suppose it could be anything from a ""this is what I did, and what I'd have done different/the same"" or ""this is what I'd do and why"" or ""I think you'd find x valuable given you said you want y"" - whatever enlightenment you feel like sharing. :)

At this point I know I'll continue to grow my Unity/Unreal experience, which is fantastic, I enjoy working with those engines and learning their nuances. Aside from the consistent experience I'm getting with my second job, I am also joining game jams with friends and the like to continue skilling up and expanding my portfolio. That being said, other than the example of the text-based game I built for a project back when I was starting out, I've done very little coding a game from scratch (there was a couple of other games in Python when I was learning the language, but nothing nearly as complex as that first project even). 

I know I really want to, ultimately, build my own engine. Not necessarily for anything other than the knowledge of doing it and as portfolio work. I also worry that I may have ""skipped some steps"" by never having done anything with a library like SDL/SFML, and I still very much feel like an apprentice in the craft of programming, and I think my understanding of the fundamentals will become much more robust by doing some of the work that the game engines handle for me.


What I'm looking for advice in is where to go next. I am aware of several books and resources on the topics above, like Jason Gregory's Game Engine Architecture and Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero, and some others that are more in the ""recommended classics"" for programmers in general, like Code Complete. I also have some others that focus on vector/game math. I don't know that I'm at the level where something like Code Complete or Game Coding Complete would be as beneficial/advisable, and I'm not sure if it makes sense to kind of ""work my way"" into working on an engine by doing stuff with libraries like SDL/SFML.

What I know is that I need to get better intuitive understanding of lower-level programming/architecture, memory management, good algorithm design, 3D math, etc. and just good software development practices in general. I fully understand it's a matter of just getting more practice, I just have trouble deciding where to go next.


Wow - I wrote more than I expected to, so I hope I didn't bore you all away. I'm definitely thankful for all the valuable insights I've picked up from this community's activity in the past, and hopeful some of you can throw in your 2 cents for an apprentice looking for some guidance. Thanks a lot for just taking the time to read this (and, if you felt so compelled, respond)! :)"

As exchange Student with a J-1 Visa, if you find yourself an internship and your University agrees it matches your Major, you can extend your Visa for your internship for a maximum of the time you have been here for studies.

As I am from Germany I have a bunch of questions how to proceed with this in the United States.


Let me say a few words about me:

I am a graduate Student in Computer Science with the main focus on Computer Graphics and Image Processing. 
I currently have an average GPA of 3.5.
I finished my undergraduate studies in Computer Science with an average GPA of 3.0, and my Bachelor Thesis (yes, in Germany we need to write a Thesis to finish your undergraduate studies) got graded with GPA 4.0. I also wrote a research paper on the Topic of my Bachelor Thesis that actually got published to am (small) Computer graphics Conference in Europe. (http://wscg.zcu.cz/WSCG2015/CSRN-2501.pdf, ""Adaptive depth bias for soft shadows"" if you're interested)
I think my CV Looks pretty good on the ""soft skills"" side, as I did a lot of volunteer work as a volunteer youth leader.

Of course preferably I'd like to get an good internship for computer graphics at a big company. My dream internship would be at Nvidea I think. But I would also take more ""general computer science"" internships, if I can't find anything for computer graphics.


So, now all the questions I have:

1. Overall, how easy or hard will it be to find a good internship and at least an internship respectively.
2. I am studying as exchange Student at CalPoly until late March 2017, so the internship should begin in April. When should I start applying? Directly when I arrive in September, or would this be to early?
3. What is the best way to apply? Search for offered internships online and apply for them, send applications on my on initiative to companies without specific offerings, or drop of my resume at a Career Fair at CalPoly?
4. What salary can I expect?

So, thanks a lot in advance for your help!

I got a graphic design internship (I am qualified for a full time position).  Took the internship with the understanding that I would be replacing the lead GD while she was out on Maternity leave, at which time my title was to change as well as my pay. 

Neither of these happened (even upon reminder), my co-workers pretended to be my supervisors to get me to do their work, they have been verbally abusive/harassing me for 3 months now, they take credit for my work, etc.

The last 2 months of my 6 month stint at this company, the main GD is to be back in the office part time. She came back 2 days ago and, consequently, the company took my computer away, gave it to her, and now i am working on a tiny dell laptop but I am still expected to produce the same level/amount of work. I work 50+ hours/week but get paid for only 40 ($15/hr).

MY QUESTION: I want to quit so badly (I have wanted to for some time now)! Will the in-house experience I would have gained from the full 6 month internship be completely lost because of a voluntary quit two months before completion? I don't think I can keep this up any more--too many insults, too many injuries.

I have 3+ years freelance experience, I have more software/program experience than everyone in my department (including the main GD) but this is my first in-house experience. in the time the GD has been out, I have completed more than 100 projects, quickly and efficiently ( I think my portfolio has benefited more than enough at this point). 

I want(need!) to quit but I don't want all this torture to have been for nothing."

I am kind of concerned about being able to find a job when I graduate.

I keep hearing people saying that embedded is super hot right now that if you do embedded there are plenty of jobs and that you will get a job for sure. HOWEVER, everyone in embedded (or almost everyone) I see getting jobs after graduating , they end up getting jobs in software engineering stuff, pretty much like if they had done CS. Some of them have told me that the most useful classes that helped them get those jobs were the non majors CS courses such as CSE 373 CSE 374 etc, and of course, reading books of coding interviews and practicing for them. So pretty much doing stuff on their own and not too related to embedded is what helped them land in those positions.

Yes I am good at programming and I have taken those non major CS courses, but haven't been so lucky getting internships in the software engineering area. My EE classes don't really help that much in preparing for those interviews, either.

So my question is, for anyone who may have experience on this: what should I spend my time on this upcoming quarters: Should I completely focus my time on my embedded systems classes, and hopefully I will be able to get a job in embedded? OR should I instead study hard for coding interviews , since it is more likely I will get a job in that area rather than embedded?

Deciding between consulting and software engineering for a career,AnonymousJimmy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4t100z/currently_a_rising_junior_in_college_deciding/,"Hi guys - I'm currently a rising junior in college. I'm studying computer science in engineering but my school is notorious for churning out consultants. (I think there is some statistic from our career office that 60% of graduates from my school go into consulting at least once within 10 years of graduating).

I see the appeals of both - but I'm not sure which I should be looking into for recruitment season next year. Most likely whichever one I choose for my junior internship will be the one I will look for a job in. I'm really stuck between deciding which to look into - or if given offers from both industries, which one to accept.

I do not consider myself a great coder. I have done well in my cs classes (3.9 major GPA, 3.7 overall) and I am at a top 15 university, but I do not have any personal projects. The CS department at my school is also fairly lackluster. I know very little about new technologies or even fundamentals of how computers/programming works. I feel like I just did what it took to get through my classes without actually developing a thorough understanding of everything. I'm currently doing a software dev internship at a large fortune 100 company but I honestly feel kind of out of place. They do not give me work and I do not feel confident asking for work or difficult assignments. When other cs interns talk about tech related stuff - I'm not sure what they are really talking about and so it is difficult for me to get into the conversation. It makes me feel very out of place.

That being said, I know that consulting is something I feel like I am much more suited to doing. I love working with people, and I love solving problems. I just don't know if that fast-paced lifestyle is suited for me either. That being said - I'm not sure which industry to prep for or go into next year.

I'm studying computer science in engineering but my school is notorious for churning out consultants. (I think there is some statistic from our career office that 60% of graduates from my school go into consulting at least once within 10 years of graduating).

I see the appeals of both - but I'm not sure which I should be looking into for recruitment season next year. Most likely whichever one I choose for my junior internship will be the one I will look for a job in. I'm really stuck between deciding which to look into - or if given offers from both industries, which one to accept.

I do not consider myself a great coder. I have done well in my cs classes (3.9 major GPA, 3.7 overall) and I am at a top 15 university, but I do not have any personal projects. The CS department at my school is also fairly lackluster. I know very little about new technologies or even fundamentals of how computers/programming works. I feel like I just did what it took to get through my classes without actually developing a thorough understanding of everything. I'm currently doing a software dev internship at a large fortune 100 company but I honestly feel kind of out of place. They do not give me work and I do not feel confident asking for work or difficult assignments. When other cs interns talk about tech related stuff - I'm not sure what they are really talking about and so it is difficult for me to get into the conversation. It makes me feel very out of place.

That being said, I know that consulting is something I feel like I am much more suited to doing. I love working with people, and I love solving problems. I just don't know if that fast-paced lifestyle is suited for me either. I'm not sure which industry to prep for or go into next year. I know the salaries are comparable (with probably more benefits going into CS if I am able to lockdown a great offer, which I'm very skeptical of being able to do because I honestly feel so out of place in the CS world).

Prior to college I had never programmed in my life. I would say I now have a decent ability to code in Java, a basic ability in Python, and a basic ability in Linux. 

I live in the Hillsboro / Beaverton area of Oregon, so companies such as Intel, Solarworld, Oracle, and more are in the area. I go to college in Ohio and am dual majoring in Computer Engineering and Computer Science.

I'm wondering what would be some projects that I could work on that would make me stand out as an intern? Whether it be advanced Java coding or learning C/C++, I'd be up for the challenge.

And for anyone wondering what my coursework/grades are like: Discrete Structures and their Algorithms, Computer Science I (Intro to Java), Computer Science II (Intermediate Java), Intro to Operating Systems Concepts and Usage, and other non-CS classes. 3.9 GPA Cumulative.

Next year my classes (first semester at least) are: Computer Organization, Digital System Design, and other non-CS classes."

Before I get in to my main question / rant, I'll provide a little background.

The vast majority of my work has been in back-end projects with a bit of distributed systems. I've worked predominantly in Java and gained exposure to some heavy duty frameworks like Spring and Hibernate (Although I feel like a complete noob trying to use them without stackoverflow), and build tools like Maven. 

I mostly enjoy working with Java, I've found I've really liked working with statically typed, compiled languages. It's not the sexy option by any stretch, but I can definitely appreciate the power behind it.

In addition to Java, I've also found myself working with Ruby for implementing bits of automation and (rarely) delving in to rails applications. Even less often I've had to write Perl scripts for for some low level scripting. 

Now, on to my question.

Recently, I've experienced a fair bit of anxiety trying to bridge my work experience with personal projects and learning. Over the last year I've picked up books on Python, Scala, Haskell and Javascript. I've dabbled in web frameworks, concurrency frameworks, and other tools. The problem is, I just can't pick a path!

Every time I sit down to learn a language or framework, my mind starts wandering - my friends working at other exciting companies tell me about all of the fresh and innovative things they've encountered, and I start experiencing a real fear of missing out. Sites like HN constantly highlight all the cutting edge work being done outside of the Java monolith (Go, Rust, etc), and I wonder if I'm missing out on ""better"" ways to solve the problems I face in my own projects.

I realize that this isn't an uncommon feeling, however it's been incredibly frustrating to feel like my personal development has been stifled by my own ""grass is always greener"" mentality.

I'd like to break down this post in to two questions - the psychological (How've you guys dealt with your own framework or language chasing?), and the practical (Given my background and the things I enjoy, what could be a practical use of my time?). 

Anyways, thanks for reading!

I'm a rising senior in mathematical economics and I'm planning to go on to a master's/bridge program in computer science before continuing on to a PhD in artificial intelligence. I'm a career switcher and my current internship has little to do with CS, just a little bit of statistics and Excel and game theory. However, my internship has an opportunity for me to help them with website development if I learn Ruby on Rails. I am new to programming, and I already know some of the basic syntax of Ruby and can write basic number crunching programs, but that's it. And we don't have an in-house developer, so I'd basically be looking at the existing code and maybe adding some things to it on my own.

Basically I have two choices: I can study Ruby intensely for the next four weeks, program a few things, and be able to tell graduate schools in my applications that I have been interested in computer science for a long time and did programming at my internship. After this summer, I'm guessing I'll have little use for Ruby on Rails and start learning Python and R because that is what is used in machine learning.

The other choice is that I just start learning Python or R immediately, get as much experience with them as possible in the next year or so, so that I lose the opportunity to put real world coding experience on my resume, but have more complete understanding of the most important programming languages and hopefully have more independent projects under my belt.

Which is better for maximizing my chances of being accepted into good graduate programs? Anything else to consider?

My current internship I have been with them for over 6+ months now and they intend to keep me and have expressed interest in offering a full-time position.

Now for the actual question, I was told that the company will pay for certifications in order to broaden my knowledge base and possibly help out my work more. I work at a small business under a small IT team of 4. I mostly just work under the senior system admin. We are a Windows environment and work primarily with server 2012 R2.

I was thinking of going the MCSA 710-712 and following it up with one of their SQL database administration ones.

Any thoughts on this? My senior sys admin told me the MCSA would be good for me but that he is not knowledgable on certs as he hasn't held one in over 15+ years (he's an older gentleman).

Thanks in advance

EDIT: Hate to sidetrack but I was also wondering if there are any Arizona based system admins here and would care to give information regarding salaries here?

While this has made me pick up bits and pieces of a whole lot of regional languages, I can't say I speak any language but English with any degree of fluency(not proud of it)

I currently go to a college in TN and most people here lose out so much just because of their inability to speak coherent English. I am not just talking about trivial shit like getting girls or inter college debates or being in a band or something like that; I am talking brilliant programmers missing out on internships simply because they stutter and stammer and don't get their point across in English. 

During the initial few months in college I used to feel shitty because most people would get hostile simply because of the fact that I used to start speaking in English almost impulsively. But you stick around for too long and people drop judgements they made right off the bat. And now I understand that their knee jerk reaction to a prick coming to them and talking in English is less about aversion than insecurity. 

Just last week I got an intern with a product company while two other guys who suck at english but know their stuff 10 times more than I do did not even make it to the final round of interviews. From what I see in my college the only people who speak good enough English seem to be from capital cities like Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai, etc. I'm really starting to feel that the most crucial thing to get ahead in this country is to be an eloquent speaker of english."

Also I just can't stand one of the directors (let's call him A) who is the kind of person that can't own up to his mistake. Quick story: I'm in charge of preparing a pnl report every day and A is the one who proofreads it before letting me send it out to the higher bosses. That day A decided to add one sentence to the email (he came over and typed it at my workstation) and told me to send it, but it turned out to be grammatically incorrect. The higher boss replied with rage over the careless usage of grammar so I sent him an apology. At this moment A slid over and offered to correct my apology email. The next day during a team meeting he suggested I send the email to him first going first so that he could correct my grammar. Apart from this incident, I'm not so happy with how he treats tech support people in the BO either.
This is my first time working in a bank, so my thinking is perhaps myopic but I hate every second of my job right now. I'm just not the kind of person who can work 14 hours straight and get along well with a supercilious boss. Do you think it's a good idea to turn in the resignation letter after only 3 weeks?

I have no internships under my belt, and almost no projects to show outside of those done in class. I have no work experience, whatsoever, even in unrelated fields.

When I was taking classes, I had only a slight interest in the topics covered, except for web development, which was covered very briefly. Since there were no electives at my college that went more in depth on the subject, I started to do some learning outside of the classroom through freecodecamp and codecademy.

Since my graduation in June, I have yet to hear from any places that I've applied to (started applying since the summer of the previous year). A small part of me is ok with this because the jobs that applied to, specifically software engineering, don't interest me as much as web development.

I graduated my CS program in May. I actually got a considerable amount of interest in February and March when I started applying for jobs, probably 5 or so places contacting me to set up interviews without applying for that many. Maybe 30-40 total?

Like an idiot, I told them all I changed my mind and wanted to focus on academics, because at the time I was having a bit of a nervous breakdown thinking I wouldn't be able to graduate (I ended up with a 3.5 for the semester, it was worrying for nothing).

I've recently started applying again. I'm sure I will get more interviews. The problem is, I'm a bad programmer. I have no internship experience, I'm 27 years old (started school late because of social anxiety and inability to decide what I wanted to do). No personal projects. I don't hate programming itself by any means, but the idea of dedicating my spare time toward learning how to write Android apps makes me absolutely overwhelmed and miserable. I realize this puts me at a huge disadvantage to a lot of people who actually have a passion for programming. Which is why I'm wondering whether to get out of the field now.

My school's CS program *sucks*. I got a 3.6 cumulative GPA despite the fact that I probably deserved to fail my Theory of Algorithms, calculus and discrete structures courses. The programming courses I mainly was actually decent in. But algorithms and data structures altogether? It's mostly like Chinese to me. I mean I know what a stack, queue, arraylist etc are and how to implement them but other stuff I'm not nearly as good with.

I can already see myself getting to my first technical interview, absolutely panicking and just humiliating myself when I can't get up and do some easy problems. 

So basically, what I am here to ask is: Is it worth it to even pursue CS further? Should I try to get a junior job somewhere and, assuming I get one, just try to get better with experience? Or am I so bad that I really should focus my efforts elsewhere, on a non-programming jobs?

If you do recommend avoiding CS jobs, where would you recommend I look? What places might be interested in a CS grad not really good at CS (I have good general computer skills and knowledge, my two year job during school was basically helpdesk).

Also, please be honest. Not looking to be handled with kid gloves, looking for advice that will help me decide a path from here. Thanks.

Currently, I have a Samsung SSD that's been sitting in my old laptop. It's only seen about a year of use, so I think it should do fine.

As for the rest of the build, I can get the processor, motherboard, ram, and power supply at my local Micro Center for just under $400, and I'm planning on ordering the case off of Amazon, and the graphics card straight from EVGA. Altogether, it should come out to just about $700, right on budget.

Primary motivation for the case and mobo was size. I'd like a rig that I can have on my desk at uni without taking up too much space and which allows for portability when travelling between home and school. Also, the on-board WiFi is definitely a plus, since I'm not sure where the ethernet jacks will be in my apartment this year. 

As far as the CPU, RAM, and PSU, these seem to be popular among the budget builders these days. I may end up upgrading to an i7 depending on where my research stuff goes, but I'll cross that bridge later. I don't see myself overclocking in the near future, so the 6500 seemed the best option. RAM is RAM, and the Crucial sticks seem cheap yet reputable. The PSU was mainly chosen for its availability at Micro Center, so any testimonials or better recommendations are very welcome. 

Lastly, for the GPU, I think the 970 should suit my needs (despite 3.5/4). I'm planning on playing mostly older titles (Dishonored, Skyrim, Bioshock 1/2/Infinite), plenty of 2Ds and indies (Undertale, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Meatboy, Bastion, etc.), and emulation of systems up to GameCube. I do have a 4K monitor, so higher-res gaming is a possibility. I'm thinking I'll utilize EVGA's Step-Up program to upgrade to a 1070 when I have more money saved up (and when they're in stock.)"

I'm hoping someone will have experience with this kind of situation and can guide me, because I'm utterly lost and desperate.  
  
  
So I am a relatively new hire doing software development for a big bank. With size comes bureaucracy, and speaking with some of the other new hires who had done an internship here before, they said that things move at a snail's pace with the bureaucracy.   
  
I have a muscular condition that causes pain in my entire upper body if I am typing at a computer for too long. Laptops are especially awful because my shoulders are hunched, my wrists are angled up, my neck is bent downwards, and I don't get much back support because I'm leaning forward. My condition is managed and made better through an ergonomic setup including a keyboard, monitor, and mouse. I read the qualifications of disability in the US, and my condition does not meet those qualifications even if I wanted to voluntarily declare disability to my workplace. I don't want to have to disclose my condition. I have a friend with a similar condition in a similar field of work who says that her company will provide her with whatever ergonomic peripherals she asks for, no questions asked.   
  
  
So, I talked to my manager about getting peripherals. Because I (and the other new hires) are in a training period, we don't have permanent desks, and thus cannot get peripherals. I'm stuck on this terrible tiny laptop. It's been a week and I'm already feeling pretty bad pain to the point where my productivity has significantly declined. It's not to the point where I'm behind on training, but I'm very stressed about that scenario, which is making my pain worse all around.   
   
  
I told my situation to a few of my fellow hires who had been interns previously, and they told me to talk to HR. Problem is, I have no idea what to say. I don't have any sort of script. All I know is that I need to make them realize how urgent my situation is, without making them think I'm a liability. I'm not dumb. The days I had no pain I was blitzing through the training with flying colors. I know I will be an asset to the company.   

  
Options I have considered: bringing my personal keyboard and mouse. Unfortunately, I have to walk a long time for my commute (~20 minutes one way) and having a super heavy backpack triggers my back pain. In other words, I'm out before I can even begin work, and the whole day is unproductive.  

Talking to my manager again. Well, I don't have another script for that, so I don't know what else I could try saying differently.   
  
  
Please ask me any questions that would help you help me. I probably should have posted this on a throwaway, but I don't even care anymore. Please can someone with experience help..."

As the title suggests, I have recently purchased and moved into a new home. The home itself is wonderful, it's a two bed one bath townhouse with a giant backyard. Aside from the tedious moving process, I really have no complaints, other than this strange stack of letters. Before I continue any further, I'm inserting a trigger warning. Turn back now if you're sensitive to graphic violence or self harm. I won't blame you, I myself had a hard enough time typing this letter out. 

Anyways, back to the story. When I arrived at the house it was fully furnished, with everything but a bed. This didn't concern me at all upon first glance; after all, who am I to turn down free stuff?! 
I didn't find the letters until just last week. They were stashed in the very back of a cabinet in the kitchen, each sealed in a yellowing Envelope, hastily scrawled handwriting across the center of each one. Of course I opened them. I don't know what I expected, love letters? Coupons? Recipes? Photos? Maybe even cash? But what i found..... 
I wish I would have just put them back. 

Below is the first letter, transcribed in its entirety. I apologize for any spelling or grammar errors, as I'm typing this on a phone keyboard. (My computer is still in a box).

The handwriting on the envelope reads- ""November"" 

Here's what's written inside: 
""Dear Emily,
I keep having these weird dreams where my teeth fall out. 

Normally it starts with me in our apartment, (you know the one we stayed at together in Paris while I finished up my internship) and I'll wake up and then I'll go to the bathroom and I'll be standing there in my boxers and I'll get my tooth brush and then for a split second I'll see the flash in the mirror. I keep going, even though I know what's going to happen, every time, the minute I open my mouth they wobble, hang, fall. Into the sink. One by one by one. Or worse I'll touch them and they rot away in y hands, turning to dust. And then the pain. The pain Emily, stabbing, prodding, washing over me in waves.

These days I wake up screaming a lot.

Emily. Emily. Emily. Emily Emily Emily Emily. Instead of counting sheep I say your name. 
Emily, do ghosts still get lonely? 
Do you get lonely?
If you could see me now- and maybe you can, who knows, I wonder what you'd say. 

Emily I haven't slept in three weeks and I haven't eaten in two days and I'm afraid any minute now the earth will split open and swallow me whole. 
If I drop off the face of the earth right now I don't think anyone would notice. I don't think anyone would care. I'm afraid people will forget me. 
I'm so afraid that ill just stop existing, because no one notices me anymore. Just another unshaven face in the crowd. 
...
Is this what dying feels like?
...
Sometimes I have dreams where I'm driving to your house and the perfect song is playing on the radio and the weather is amazing, and the air always smells like cherries and those snicker doodle cookies you'd always bake me. Then suddenly I'm driving faster and faster as the clouds grow because everything inside me just snaps for some reason and I'm making hair pin turns and driving faster than ever now, running over curbs and through red lights because some part of me knows you won't be there. And then suddenly I'm standing in the doorway and you're walking around again, your auburn hair in the light and for a minute I  think it's real. Every time Emily. Every time. But then you walk right through me, and go about your daily life again, running around cooking and cleaning and painting and I'm following you and trying to touch you and hold you and tell you I'm sorry but you can't see me and you can't hear me and then I wake up and It's me there, alone. Again. A living, breathing, ghost. 
I just vanish. 
I keep having dreams where I rip off every one of my fingernails just to make sure I'm alive. 
It's passive suicide.

People keep telling me ""You're handling all this so well!""- it's funny, I've really never been worse. 

It's subconscious guilt.
Emily I feel like I take and take and take and never give enough and it's FUCKING WITH ME. 
It's existential...
Fuck it. 
It's not fair, Emily. 
It's not fair.
I'm sorry I'm telling you all of this. 
I love you. Goodnight. 
-N""

And that's all there is. I don't know what I should do, should I burn these letters? Put them back where I found them? Share the rest with the Internet?  I'm not sure if this is some sick prank.... Or.... I just don't know. Anyways, thanks for reading this far. My phone battery is going fast, but I'll try and update soon. 

Update- I typed out another letter, expect more soon

Long story short, I used to be a researcher in the Neuroscience field. I'm looking to go into software development now, for Android or otherwise.

Here is what I've already done:

1) Familiarized myself with C++ through the C++ Programming book by Malik, everything up to 


- Arrays and Strings


- Structs


- Class and Data Abstraction


- Inheritance


- Pointers, Virtual Functions, Abstract Classes


- Overloading


- Exception Handling


- Recursion


- Vectors

2) Familiarize myself with Java, everything up to 


- Arrays and ArrayList


- Wrapper classes


- Inheritance

3) Found an internship as a Game Programmer working with C#

Soon, I'm looking to:


1) use the internship to learn different stages of project development in teams, since I will be given a project to work in groups.


2) venture into Data Structures in Java after I'm more familiar with the language.


3) work on some Android apps when I have free time

Am I currently on the right path? How far am I away from an entry-level position as a developer?"
4t91qw,1,2016-07-17,$1000ish budget; dual boot Windows 10 and some Linux distro - mostly programming but some gaming. Prefer larger screen.,EulersMeth,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/4t91qw/1000ish_budget_dual_boot_windows_10_and_some/,"**Short**: I will have about $1000 and maybe a bit more in disposable income after this summer. I've been using a really nice Macbook at my internship and I'm thinking my aging slowing Asus K55N won't cut it for me anymore. I do not need ""the best"" graphics, when I play games I am solely interested in gameplay. I played Starcraft 2 on low/medium back when I had a desktop rig because it was easier to click on things without the high-graphics effects. I'll probably be playing Overwatch and Rocket League when I'm playing anything at all. If GameCube emulation (Dolphin) is even possible in this budget that'd be cool but if not, I can survive with N64 emulation too (which can be done on like $60 laptops so let's focus on Overwatch). I really liked the nice screen I have this summer but I don't want to go Macbook - anything 15"" should be fine.

**Total budget and country of purchase**: $1000-1500, USA


**Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** I need something that's basically guaranteed to be able to dual boot without me being very sad and breaking everything. Will probably spend 80% of my time in Linux but I'll be in Windows enough for it to matter. I mostly use my laptop plugged in as well, but a non-2 hour battery life would be cool.

**How important is weight to you?** Not at all

**Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac**. Windows 10 AND Linux, probably Ubuntu but maybe Debian.

**Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 15.4ish would be stellar. Bigger screen = more room for activities.

**Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** - Overwatch is about as intensive as I'd want, and again, not super into pretty graphics. Will be using Atom/Eclipse/Chrome/Firefox fairly extensively but I may fool around with Android Studio as well. Basically, I need lots of RAM ;) (Oh, I use Vim too, but that runs on a toaster.)

**If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**
-Overwatch, preferably 60 FPS and settings can be low-med, it's fine

**Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)** 
Longterm reliability - Keyboard is an ABSOLUTE MUST. I really like Thinkpad keyboards and to be completely honest I type really well on my Asus K55N right now. I don't know much about keyboards to be honest but if you look up that model, I want that kind of keyboard (numpad isn't necessarily required though). SSD would be cool. HDMI output is required for Netflix and Chill with the SO, and I'd like a couple USB ports as well. The more the merrier.

EDIT: Also I don't want a touch screen. Don't need one."

Advice is extremely appreciated!,penguinmandude,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4tare8/feeling_very_guilty_about_wanting_to_quit_an/,"I'm currently in the summer between my freshman and sophomore years (I'm young I know, but I feel like I've learned a decent amount from various courses and stuff online throughout the last 4-5 years) and have been working for an early stage startup.  In May I didn't really have anything lined up job wise for the summer and when the founder came to me I joined, because, well, I didn't have anything to lose and I thought the idea was promising.  I was 'hired' (never officially, never signed any formal paperwork) and started developing the service with the only other dev.  

All is well for a while, the pay is low and well below minimum wage (I've received roughly $600 total from the time I started to now), but I was getting some experience I could put on a CV and had quite a bit of freedom on how it should work/look/etc.  We got a few thousand in grants from certain places and have received good feedback from our potential customers so I thought we were headed in a positive direction.  BUT, the more we get done, the more I realized why the idea hasn't been done before and why it's probably destined to fail.  It requires exceptional security (which 100% shouldn't be handled by a couple of college students) and we'd need probably a bunch of expensive lawyers to set up the legal framework for it, it requires a lot of reaching out to customers (essentially sales), there's many other competitors in the same general field (though we do give more than they do for less $), and it's simply too complicated and there are too many variables that users can provide for it to be streamlined in any way (which is essentially our selling point).  

Once I realized these things, I started getting bored of the work (mainly just web dev stuff with older kinda boring and not very 'cutting edge' frameworks) and I started dreading having to code this stuff up.  Anyways, I've started learning some stuff I'm actually interested in (angular 2, node.js, database stuff) and I've recently started a little personal project that I think is pretty cool, which is allowing me to use some of the stuff I'm learning, and would be something I could show off to future employees.  

At this point, I kind of want to be done with the whole thing and release all the time I'm spending on it for things that I can actually learn something from and have fun doing.  The founder has started talking about all the stuff needing to be done by November/December/etc. which I really don't want to do as I want to focus on my studies, have fun (I'm in college, I want to have time to party and hang out with friends without fear of missing non-school related deadlines), do some extra-curricular stuff, continue working on personal projects, and learning new/improving my various CS skills out of class.  

I just feel really guilty for wanting to quit.  I'm the only other dev and if I leave, the 'company' will basically be over unless they find someone else who will work for very little money doing the same stuff as me.  The founder is 100% in on this, has no other job, and a lot of expectations from his family/friends/etc. for it to succeed, so if I leave, I feel like I would destroy him and his dreams.  I also want him to be able to give me a good reference for any internships or whatever I might get into coming up, and I'm very afraid that if I leave, he won't write me one.

I would REALLY appreciate any advice you guys could provide me on what to do.  I should probably stay in for the others in the company, but I feel like it's not the best for me.  I just don't know what to do.  Thank you so so much!!!"

Here's the deal - I'm several years into a PhD program, but certain that academia is not the career for me. With an eye towards getting some industry experience, I took this summer off from research to do a data science internship at a small tech company. The experience has been great - the work has been challenging and engaging, I have a ton of respect for the company leadership, and the other people on my team are super smart and I fit in well with them. The company is also well funded and growing quickly.
Recently, the CEO approached me to let me know that they're planning on hiring a full-time employee to take over the work I've been doing over the summer, and oh by the way we really like you and would love to have you full time.

If I go back to research, it would probably take me about a year and a half to finish the degree. If I left now, I would leave with a MS. Basically, the PhD has been a personal goal for a long time, but this opportunity is pretty close to being a perfect first full-time job.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? If so - do you think you made the right choice? Also happy to hear other perspectives.

ETA a few other potentially important pieces of information:

* The grant that supports me will run out before I can defend. It is likely that I'll be able to find another source of funding, but it's never a sure thing.

* My PhD advisor recently moved from the university where I'm a student to a different university out of state. I'm lucky enough to have work that relatively easy to do remotely, so he didn't force me to move with him. But there is some concern about his level of engagement with my project now that he's in a different place.

* There are personal reasons that make me lean toward leaving. I've been in school a long time, and I'm starting to get tired of having both no money and no free time. Also, I've definitely reached the point where I feel like I need a new challenge.

Edit 2: To everyone who took the time to comment - thank you so much for your thoughtful responses. I got way more of them than I expected, and I've read them all carefully. Ultimately it's still a really tough decision."

4tc2f0,43,2016-07-17,Working at Northwestern Mutual (wall of text),nugrape,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4tc2f0/working_at_northwestern_mutual_wall_of_text/,"I've seen a few posts asking about working as a financial rep at Northwestern Mutual, so I thought I'd write about my experience there. Since they recruit new reps on college campuses, maybe this will be useful to one or two people. Technically it's not a finance job, but my guess is that people will search for it (as I did).

Of all the wirehouse firms, two have more kool-aid than any others: Edward Jones and Northwestern Mutual. I've heard stories about Edward Jones, but I can only speak to NWM.

The recruiters are incentivized to bring you on board, of course, so they'll tell you about all the money you can make (which is true, in theory), and since they've already drank the kool-aid or they wouldn't be there, they will be very excited about NWM. If you're a prospective intern, they'll show you literature about how it's one of the best internships in the nation. If you're thinking about going to law school, they'll tell you how law school is saturated whereas the financial services industry has a lot of people on the verge of retirement (this is true). You might be skeptical, but you also might be able to make a lot of money helping people which is a win-win, so you might check it out further. It's at least worth googling, and it actually doesn't look too bad when you search online! Now you're actually kind of excited.

The management team or ""coaches"" and all are very likeable people. The first person you'll interview with will most likely be very attractive, and she'll ask some very light questions about yourself. She'll tell you about how NWM is one of the top-rated companies out there with the highest financial strength ratings available (also true), and you'll think it's a pretty good company! Eventually she'll ask about who you know, but let's not get into that too much. She's trained to gauge your personality, and as long as you aren't a completely wet blanket, you'll be qualified to move on to the next round of the interview process. (If you're really special, they'll give you a gift card to a mediocre restaurant once you start.)

Soon enough, you'll meet with one of the most affable people you've ever met. He will meet all the expectations that first interviewer set up. He's also incentivized to hire you, but he'll make it seem like they don't just hire anybody - and they don't...technically - and even though he'll tell you this business isn't for everybody, you'll realize that this business is for you. This is the guy that will train you, and he said that as long as you do what he says, you'll have a great life. People just make this business too hard. Once you pass the extensive background check (and believe me it's thorough), study for and pass your Life &amp; Health exam, you're good to go!

You've already put a lot of work into this thing by the time ""basics day"" rolls around. This is when you actually begin to learn how to sell. They'll have scripts - language that you'll have to memorize, and a time-tested strategy based on a scientific method. All you have to do is do it. More importantly, they'll show you that in just your first three months working there, you can make up to $64,000 just for helping people! Not bad!!

During the training period, which lasts about a week, you'll learn more about this great company, directly from the people who have succeeded there in your area. They'll all seem very happy. They'll tell you all their secrets. Eventually, you'll build a list of at least 100 people that you know in the area - friends, family, and other people with money. You'll learn how to talk on the phone and convince people to meet with you - even if they object (up to three times). You'll use these new tactics to convince people you know who are ""centers of influence"" to meet with you and let you pick through their network so you can help all of their friends with this great new career you've started. At the end of the meeting, you'll even be able to help the ""center of influence""!!

Once you start working, you'll be persuaded but not forced to take a ""joint-work partner"" with you. Joint-work partners are the people who showed you their secrets during training, plus others in the office who have years of experience and are really, really good at what they do. You'll have to split commissions with them, but ""it's better to get 50% of something than 100% of nothing."" There will even be one or two in your office who are Gods to everyone that trained you (except for some of the people who have been there for a while and who will tell you all sorts of bad things about these legends...after all, you should be doing joint work with this guy, not that guy, if you want to close business, and anyway this guy is nice...you'll thank him for helping you).

You'll spend the next three months doing lots of joint work, calling everyone you know trying to get meetings with all the people you love and care about. Some of them won't meet with you, even though you're just trying to help them. You'll get pissed at them, and you won't talk to them (and they won't talk to you). But you'll meet with a lot of your friends and family, and you'll sit there with a shit-eating grin, agreeing with everything your joint-work partner says (and he'll do ALL of the talking), because you're creating a financial plan for them! You're HELPING them! And not only that, but you're making money by giving them access to the single most important, wonderful product of the modern world: Northwestern Mutual's Permanent Life Insurance.

Now, you may have intelligent friends and family who have done some research, or read some Dave Ramsey, and they know that whole life insurance/permanent life insurance is a bad idea. Stay calm. Agree with them. Most permanent life insurance really is dogshit. But NWM whole life is fucking beautiful. You've been trained to know this. You've even checked it out, and it's really, really good. They have graphs and shit. They all own it. You might even buy some, too! The world is an uncertain, uncertain void, and no one knows where the market goes, right? And you'll know all about how the dividend of NWM whole life fucks the ass out of any other investment product...tax-free!!

Fast-forward another six months...

You've blown through most of your friends, family, old high school buddies, and all the people whose numbers they gave to you. The ones you haven't met with yet won't return your calls. You haven't spoken to them in a long time, and maybe your career is slowing down a bit. Maybe one person who is still relatively new to the firm (like you) is doing a great job, but you're in a rut right now. You've noticed that the really likeable coaches and managers aren't giving you as much attention anymore, but hey - if you fail it's your own fault. Didn't you read the handbook? You haven't had 150 new meetings in the last six months, and in order to stay (statistically speaking) you have to have 300 new meetings by the time your first year is up. They'll let you stay even if you get 250, but, man that's a lot of work. Plus, you've had a few really big cases, and even with some of the people getting rated on their medical exam who were interested at first, but found the premiums to be just too expensive, you know you have to keep seeing people, seeing people, seeing people...

Nine months in now, and you've slowed way down. No one said this job was easy. You know that. You're also kind of frustrated, because you still don't really understand the nuances of the products that well. Most of the ongoing training sessions are still just about how to sell, not about what it actually is you're selling. You don't want to give 50% of your money to the joint-work partners, so you've been doing more cases on your own, and you just can't close as much business. Some of the reps you came up with are already gone, and maybe you miss them. They were good dudes. The ones that are still there, struggling just like you, have the same concerns you have. Why don't they teach us more technical knowledge about these policies? They said I'd learn through joint work, but I still haven't learned enough. And some of the joint work partners make mistakes! It's a whole company based on the game of telephone, and by the time the information gets filtered down to you, it's not really true. And the dividend on that whole life isn't actually a rate of return like you thought...it's largely just a return of premiums with 2% growth instead of 6% growth like you assumed based on how they explained it.

You've been there a year now. It's time for your quarterly reviews with the Managing Partner who is never around. He calls you on the phone to go over your numbers (you were supposed to meet in person, but he left the office for the day). He tells you it's time to move on. You started strong, but now you haven't closed much business. This just isn't the right career for you. He wants you to be successful, but it just isn't going to be here. You had to borrow money from your parents to pay your rent and all the premiums on your expensive life insurance policies - they told you that there's statistics that prove NWM reps who have big policies themselves sell big policies. You're angry, but it's okay - Mass Mutual contacted you through LinkedIn, and they want you to join their firm. You've been told by your coach that Mass Mutual sucks, and your non-compete clause won't let you take your clients with you, but at least they don't have a non-compete and they even give you leads and people to call. That's good, right?

Note: this career path isn't all bad. If you play your cards right, you can end up at a good, fee-only firm that doesn't rip off their clients. If you're at NWM, or if you really want to do this, focus on getting your Series 7 &amp; 66 instead of your Series 6 &amp; 63 like they recommend, and then leave. It's a lot more work, but you'll be more marketable. And even though it may be hard to resist, and everyone else is doing it, don't sell people things they don't need. Term insurance is just fine. Have them open a Roth IRA instead of selling them permanent insurance that is difficult to get out of. Or maybe you'll be one of the few people who actually makes it work at NWM. I don't know how you'll sleep at night knowing that you're giving the people you know and love (and the people they know and love) an overpriced product with high commissions. But then again, if you make it that far you're probably either a sociopath, willfully ignorant, or you just don't care. When I quit after getting a job at a good independent firm, the joint-work partners I worked with (who got to keep all the clients) were concerned about one thing and one thing only: ""can I still call that [insert high net worth position here] we tried to make a client together?""

4tc8xt,6,2016-07-17,[Ohio] Did some work for lady in university and now she is trying to sue me. HELP PLS!,awaisted,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4tc8xt/ohio_did_some_work_for_lady_in_university_and_now/,"I recently graduated with with a bachelors in mechanical engineering. 

During my final few years I worked with a lady to help her get some ""drawings"" of her idea for a patent. She said that she could pay me under the table since I was an **international student**. I was VERY poor and just wanted some money to pay rent bills etc. She paid me very little but I did quite a lot of changes to the model so it added up. I used a student version of a CAD software through school, made the 3D model and drawings and gave her the PDFs.

A couple months later she told me that her provisional patent got approved and she worked with me again to get a physical 3D printed model.I helped her with everything and even put engineering detail into the design (standard threads ect.) which I had learned through my internships. 

This model got her consideration with a couple of companies to buy her provisional patent but she waited for a better offer. She eventually tried to start her own company to start manufacturing this product. By this time she had gotten her product moved to a ""full patent"" (I wasn't involved in legal stuff I only got involved when she contacted me). Apparently she got picked by a university program which offers to do pro bono patent filing.

So she got in touch with me after another couple of months (few weeks ago) and wanted me to help her convert the 3D files into a different format so a ""manufacturing company"" could quote the product. I said that I would do that for her if she could get my name as the engineer on the patent since I had put in the hours to figure out the tolerances, standards, and clearances. She said she would talk to her lawyer but needed the files. So I converted the files and sent them to her via email and said that she didn't have to pay me. I just wanted to be associated as the engineer behind the patent and I had no financial investment or interest.

The day after she received the files she texted me saying that she paid me for those files and they are her property. And I need to turn them over or she will sue me. She was paranoid that I would try steal her company. I tried to make it clear I wanted to financial role in her ""company"" but she wasn't understanding. Then I decided I will just turn the files over (she was clearly dicking me over but whatever I want nothing to do with this) and we planned that I would e-mail it to her and organize them in folders of three file types. 

The next day she messaged me again saying the latest files I sent her (the ones I did for free) didn't work and the manufacturer couldn't open it. I told her I'm sorry they didn't work I don't know whats wrong but I just want to send you the files and get out of this mess. She kept threatening to sue me and now she claims I am stealing her ""intellectual property"" even though I did all the work for it. So I sent her the three formats we agreed on and she just got them today. 

She just messaged me again saying that the USB was bent and it wouldn't work. She wanted me to mail her the USB so its not my fault how it arrived. I had put the files in the USB and now she is threatening me for destruction of her intellectual property. She keeps threatening to sue me and I don't really know what to do anymore. I don't want to waste money on a lawyer but she wants to get them involved. I don't know if she has the money finance that but she keeps threatening me. I dont know if she is serious but she has completely gone off the rails. 

I said I am not dealing with her anymore. The lawyer can call me because she is being very difficult. She claims I signed a contract which I don't remember and she said she is not going to share it with me. 

As far as I am concerned it happened in three steps:

1. She paid me for PDFs of the drawings (to get a provisional patent)
2. She paid me for the actual 3D model (to get a patent)
3. She got a different format to get a quote which I was never paid for.

I don't see where I would have to hand over the full engineering data of the model (which include the dimensions and the editing capabilities). Only thing to keep in mind I am an international student who got paid under the table to do this.

**TLDR** Helped a lady get a design patented and now she is trying to sue me to get all my CAD files. Am I legally obligated to return those files?"
4tc9rl,1,2016-07-17,Dirty old man,AnthoZero,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4tc9rl/dirty_old_man/,"Ok, 

My Grandfather is a poltician and he worked for my city, he got me a job in one of the city departments after he retired as an intern. 

I've been working there for a couple weeks, and I've been having a good time, I don't really do anything (city jobs). 

I don't have my own computer, so I have to share a computer with a guy, let's call him Joe. Joe is usually on the road doing work, so I used his computer a lot. 

The past couple days I've been in his car with him helping him write some things down that we find that need to be fixed, but most of the time we're driving around doing nothing, he'll buy me a coffee and he'll tell me stories about his sons and stuff. 

It slowly got awkward when he started telling me really personal stories, and it went overboard when we drove passed this young girl, maybe 12 or 13, and he said ""Wow, some of these girls are so hot, I'd love to tap that. I'm such a dirty old man"". 

I sat there and said nothing for the rest of the ride, and I felt so uncomfortable. Later, he asked where I was going to lunch and I told him, I had plans to meet with my friend but he invited himself and drove me. I had to text my friend to not show because it wouldn't have been good because he's racist and islamaphobic, and she is Muslim. 

The day ended and I was so happy. 

The next day I tried to avoid him at all costs, seriously all costs. I heard him coming into my office (my boss is on vacation for a week so I get it) and I hid under the desk. The rest of the day I hid in my friends office. 

Later that day, Joes partner came in and handed me his cellphone. It was Joe. He asked me if he wanted to pick me up, so I lied about having a lot of work and I had no time. He said then we can do it on Monday. 

He makes me so uncomfortable and I honestly don't think I can't be near him again. How can I avoid him without hurting any feelings or ruining my reputation?"

I'm going to be a senior in college next year with a major in math and minors in stats and cs. I have a 3.9 gpa at a large state school and I've done 2 internships including my current one. I've used java and c in classes and VBA at work.

Both of my internships have been actuarial (insurance pricing) and I've slowly realized that this isn't what I want to do when I graduate. I've tried two different industries which were health and life but my favorite parts of the internships have been when I'm coding in VBA (ugh...) to automate projects or performing analysis on large data sets with sql/R. I really would like to do that sort of work with like minded people since most actuaries seem to hate coding but I know almost nothing about the jobs that are out there since I had this epiphany so late in my college career. Due to this late change I have also never interviewed for any sort of programming role so I'm not certain how qualified or unqualified I actually am. I've done very well in all of my cs and math classes but I can't be sure how well success in the classroom transfers to the job market.

Does anyone know which sort of jobs would be a good fit for someone like me? I've been looking into data science but most of those positions are seeking phd graduates and most programming roles seem to want a lot more coding experience than I have."

I don't have any specific questions, I'm just looking for general advice for my first real interview.

--BACKSTORY--

So from Nov. 2014 - July 2016 I worked at a local online university. A family friend of mine basically gave me the job without having to really interview at all. It was my first programming job and I didn't have a whole lot of knowledge going into it, but everyone there was nice and helped my find my footing. So as time went on I went from just making visios for the web flow, to working on the UI, then the business logic, and finally messed around with SQL and the database at the start of 2016. It was going great and I had learned a lot, however they still were paying me minimum wage, which is $10/hr in CA. I was okay with this when I first started as I was still learning and it was more of an internship rather than a full time job. Though as time went on and I became more of a full stack developer I had requested an increase in pay. Nothing ever came of it and towards the middle of this month, July 2016, the company laid off essentially the entire team, 3 developers, the sr. developer/manager, and the head of our infrastructure.

-- CURRENT SITUATION --

So now that you know the backstory I can explain my current situation. I've been applying to just about every place that was looking for .Net developers where I met the requirements, basically 2yrs of .net development. No real interviews just a few small phone conversations that never went anywhere. Until this last weekend where I got a call from a company I applied at. My conversation with the lady I talked to told me how she had received 150+ applications and only picked one other person and myself. She also asked me how much I was looking to be paid, and since I live at home and don't have any real bills other than paying for my car insurance and gas, I had been asking for $20/hr which is 2x as much as I was previously making. She then told me how the position they were looking to fill was 70k - 100k a year, which is a hell of a lot more than I was previously making. This is what really caused me to post on here.

Since I was being paid $10/hr previously, I felt like $20/hr was fair for my work and now that I know they're looking to pay 70k/yr it's got me questioning my own value. I don't feel like I'm that great of a developer with only 2yrs of experience to be making that much money. This has caused me to be very panicked and worried about the interview I have because I feel like they'll think I'm a fraud and not know what I'm doing and embarrassed myself. Does anyone have any advice as to how I can get over this fear of feeling like a fraud? Also does anyone know what I should expect in this interview, because it'll be my first real developer interview.

Thank you so much, and sorry this was so drawn out.

TL;DR: Old job was paying me $10/hr and caused me to only value myself $20/hr. Conversation with a new company informed me that they're looking to pay 70k - 100k/yr, and I'm now freaking out about them thinking I'm a fraud. Any advice on how to overcome this and what to expect in the interview?"

So as I describe the project, I might end up making the front end part (which is very innovative in itself) sound too simple, and the back end more interesting. I'm great at underplaying my work...

Also, the audience will be a mix of people who know what the project is about, and who have no idea who I am. But all of them have more dev experience than I do. 

What's the general approach to this kind of presentation? 

In what order do I proceed? Like, intro to the project, high level description? Walk through the code? (like literally show the code?) Jokes/Ice breaker? Demo of app. I'm pretty lost.

I am currently working at a Big Four company in LA as a Security Consultant. I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona as a CIS major. 

This school itself as a CIS degree has a great reputation in Cyber Security and a lot of grads become very marketable after graduating through internships, CCDC, and clubs.

I am happy about what I did so far in my career, as I know that Cyber Security isn't an easy field to break into, and I managed to get in without going through the years of being at a help desk or technician.

So at this point, I'm wondering how I can advance my career and (not to sound greedy or cocky) maximize the money I can earn. I am making a decent living as a single male, but where do I go from here? Should I work on getting my Masters in CIS so that more opportunities open up, or get my CISSP?

Any knowledge would be very helpful :). Thank you cscareerquestions!"

Been a longtime lurker and am starting to consider getting out of the US. I've been out of school for a year working in Seattle as a firmware engineer and I figured I'd need another 2 years or so to have enough experience under my belt (maybe more?)

Which countries would be looking for firmware engineers? Should I start looking into more high-level software skills that would be more applicable? Right now I'm working mostly on microcontrollers and writing in C. But I'm willing to spend the next couple of years to add more to my skill set if that would help.

I'm an outdoorsman so I'd love to be in a place where I could escape into the wilderness on the weekends. Also would like a better work-life balance than in the US (more vacation time would be great).

After reading a fair number of posts, it seems as though Scandinavia isn't looking for foreign workers, Estonia is looking for high-level software devs, NZ and AUS don't have big engineering markets, and the UK, Switzerland, and Germany would be my best bets. I lived in Switzerland for 6 months working as a medical device intern, but ran into a lot of obstacles (homeless for 1 month, xenophobia, etc), so I'm not sure if it would be a great fit (beautiful country though).

Another thought is to switch careers entirely, but I want to see if I can use my current experience before resorting to that.

Any advice would be great! Thanks

I've finished my intro classes and a data structures class, and am going to be taking a machine learning course in the fall. I have just began some work on my personal website (HTML, CSS JavaScript/jQuery), I'm working on an Android app (Java, PHP, SQL), I'm attempting to learn iOS dev and a few other languages/implementations of code/getting my lingo down, and I'm studying internship questions for next summer already. 

I feel like I'm doing a lot. I spend like 3-4 hours a day doing CS-related stuff on weekdays and like 5-6 or more on weekends. Yet, I see posts on here of other undergrads with their 5 Android/iOS apps, 7 web apps, 100 contributions, and what feels like an incomprehensible amount of research. 

I'm trying as best I can to do whatever I can to get a solid internship going into my junior year. I love CS, and especially love working on my Android app (which is really as personal a project as it gets, it's pretty messy). I just don't know how everyone else seems to do so much more, and this worries me when it comes to internships/careers. 

Where do you people make the time to do all of this stuff? 

EDIT: Short note - I just wanted to ensure everyone here knows this is not intended to be a rant. I am actually genuinely curious how people here have cultivated all of the knowledge they have. It's seriously impressive. I assumed the answer would largely be ""lots and lots of work"" which I understand, but I figured I'd ask if there were any other methods. Thanks! "

I've recently acquired an associates degree in Network Security. Supplementing the degree I have, I'm also doing a part time internship as a desk-side technician. By the way it looks, the company at which I'm currently interning has no intention of hiring me as they don't have any positions that need filled, as I have already inquired. By the time the internship is over, I'll have close to about a years worth experience under my belt. So my question is does anyone more experienced have some advice as to what the next best step to take is? I know in the realm of IT there are varying opinions on school/certification and vice versa, as well as how much experience is required in order to meet your personal goals. I personally have found that employers in this field are placing more emphasis on experience and certification as opposed to a bachelors or masters degree on a piece of paper that ""says you can"". 

The courses I've taken in my field of study, just to name few:

CCNA 1-4 and Security 
Linux Administration I and II 
Microsoft Server 2012 R2 Courses 1-3 
Ethical Hacking I and II
VMware Virtualization I and II

Some of the certs I'm currently working on obtaining are LPIC, CCNA, and MCSA. I've been told by my professors that those certifications would be good to obtain because they would help me reach my end goal to become a Systems Administrator as well as make me more employable with less education. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!

The people here answer my questions in a very respectful, non sugar coating, but still helpful way and it's immensely helpful. Sorry if I ask too much and seem needy ._.

Anyway, I have a dilemma that pertains to my near future plans. So basically I have two decisions to make. My boss at my internship wants me to work full time instead of the part time I work now. It pays 16 an hour and the money sounds really nice (I live at home, mother is VERY supportive, I pay rent but the number is VERY reasonable, I can save, ""easy life(not really but trying to give as much info as possible)"" Working full time would net me a nice boost to my paycheck.

The thing is I want to go back to school to obtain my bachelors degree and full time work and school is something I KNOW I can't handle. Thus I kind of want to stay part time so that I can take even 2-3 classes a semester and obtain my degree while gaining more IT intern/help desk experience.

I don't know which option is the best for me and both my immediate and extended futures. Advice?

PS: Are there any IT jobs that pay well and are strictly 9-5 with non mandatory, extremely minimal time over that?"

I can't do an internship because of ageism (this country is no silicon valley), but my age is still OK for a regular job. The problem is, companies here require the experience up-front because they don't want to spend any money training new devs, no matter how promising they might look. So my only chance is to learn by myself, as I've done in the past for every technology I've worked with.

Do you think it is feasible to spend a few months studying and coding samples and exercises? Or is this something you need to learn in-house, due to expensive server licenses/tools?


I was thinking on buying the most important books on modern JavaEE and maybe do some online courses.  But apparently for JavaEE the information is too spread and often outdated. What should I learn to be knowledgeable in both modern and well-stablished standards? 

Should I go for .NET instead? At first glance it looks like it would be less stuff to study, and information is more concentrated and up to date."

I wake up constantly, I feel like my sleep is very shallow.

The situation is like this since 2 weeks already. Of course I'm extremely unproductive at work, even talking to team members is hard for me (my English is not very fluent), not to mention writing code.
I started taking medication few days ago (Zolpidem) which makes things a bit better, but there's a risk I will get addicted.

So my options are:

1. Resign and go back home, which would be a terrible experience for me, and would prevent me from doing other things like studying abroad etc.

2. Continue the internship despite being completely unproductive, also possibly damaging my health.

3. Anything else?

I'm not going to sugar coat this. There are good people but also bad people everywhere and there are a lot of them in CS.
They are the ones that are pretentious, mean, rude, sexist, and more and the best policy is to ignore them. Don't associate with them because you become more like them and that's when you give them power. I graduated last year and I honestly never want to meet certain people in this department again. I had to watch my girl friends get picked on in classes and harrassed, my male friends accused of harrassment, and my male and female friends shit on for not getting to work at the so called 'good internships'. sexism is thriving but so is straight up being an ass. the department NEEDS to address this. It got so bad to a point where a large number of my friends and myself did not want to spend time in Siebel anymore because it just doesn't feel like a safe place.

There are so many good people but the bad ones are so loud. recently, acm has become a specific hotbed of people like this. There is a vocal minority of people that do things just to look cool in front of others but don't actually do anything themselves except for a couple truly amazing individuals. There are good and bad eggs but the bad eggs tend to flock to ACM from what I have seen. They cheated, spread rumors, talk themselves up, and talk shit about their friensd just to bring people around them down when we should be trying to do everything to build each other up. based on what i heard from a friend that stuck with ACM, some even got banned from their office by the department for going too overboard. i've seen a lot of people fall into this crowd and become similar types of people and that makes me sad. I'm ashamed to call those people Illini when there are so many good people in the department ....

Just look at HackIllinois for example.... They supposedly made a huge mess and didn't clean it up but I remember walking down the halls and seeing a couple diligent members of ACM/Hackillinois cleaning until the early hours of the morning....
Yeah, don't get me wrong there's a bunch of jerks and mean people in ACM and in the CS department in general but please just don't pay mind to them and make them aware that their attitudes are unwarranted, unwanted, and intolerable.

Bullying is defined by the recipient, not the speaker!!!!!! The people around you determine what is ok behavior and if they ask you to stop, you stop immediately. Telling someone to 'stop being a little bitch' or anything of the sort is not conducive to the community. That's too often just used as an excuse for people to justify bullying. you don't udnerstand anyone else so don't pretend that you have the right to talk down to them. 

Be kind to one another because it costs nothing to you but means everything to everyone else.

But then again who am I to talk, i'm old and already graduated...

Last January, I took a leave of absence from a top-10 law school after finishing my third semester. After a lot of contemplation, I’m giving serious consideration toward getting a Ph.D. in political science – specifically focusing in comparative politics.  My basic question is this: should I complete my legal education before pursuing it? Below are specifics about my situation: 

In college, I graduated with a 4.0 GPA, both in my majors (political science and history) and cumulatively. I did internships in federal and state government. I got some limited research experience by doing a senior thesis, but my relatively little-known college didn’t provide opportunities for faculty research assistantships, presenting at conferences, or even a very strong methodology resource. During my senior year, I was torn between pursuing my PhD or getting a law degree. Ultimately – and somewhat shamefully – I regretfully chose what I thought would be the more practical, if slightly less altruistic, option. (Regardless, I took the GRE, but without studying, I got a 164 on the math and verbal sections. I plan on taking it again, this time with some proper preparation.) 

After 2.5 semesters of law school, I concluded the experience wasn’t for me, as I don’t want to work in a legal or even quasi-legal position in the long-term. Then, when a serious medical event compromised my final exam period, the school refused to reschedule my exams, and my previously adequate GPA (~3.3ish) is now about a 3.0. If I had stayed a fourth semester, I would’ve additionally acquired my first student loan debt, as my scholarship amounts diminish each year.  At that point, I would’ve had to start paying tuition, and would’ve ended up with ~$25K in debt, poor to middling grades, no career, and a degree that doesn’t line up with any academic interests. So, having no debt, it was at this point I decided to take a leave of absence. By that point, being in law school had made me anxious, paranoid, and sick – all without any benefit or upside. I have no intent on drawing upon my legal education in selecting a PhD specialization. While my law school does encourage JD/PhD programs, there is a vast disparity in the ranking between them. The JD is a top 10, but the PhD is roughly top 40. I’d like to see, if possible, whether or not I am in a position to do any better. 

Here’s the thing – since I regret not pursuing a PhD, I’m willing to do nearly anything to get into a good grad school – including finishing my law degree and waiting to apply for the PhD in 2017 if it’d help my chances. Right after leaving law school, I got a stopgap position in local government that pays enough to cover any law school debt should I return. Thus, my concerns about returning to law school are not so much financially motivated – but academically. Given the very tight curve in law school coursework, I can probably only pull up my law school GPA to a 3.2 or maybe a 3.3. Although, I could take some classes with the university’s political science department and try to focus my legal coursework on international law or policy matters. I don’t have to be concerned about letters of recommendation, as I have three very supportive professors from college who I’ve worked with on my senior thesis who are happy to write them. 

In sum, I’m concerned about the impact my legal education – finished or unfinished – would have on my PhD application. Ignoring issues of dissertation topics/specializations for now, would it be help my chances to finish my law degree (or would it hurt my chances if I didn’t finish)? Could my law school GPA have a negative impact, even if my undergrad political science GPA is comparatively higher? Would even completing the law degree somehow cause PhD admissions committees to view my application with skepticism? If anyone could provide any sort of insight as to how I should go forward, I’d be very appreciative. Thanks in advance. "

I am looking to combine a few interests together and I think now is the time to start looking. I don't really know where to look and would like some pointers. 

I am currently a Level 1 Tech/Help desk and have been for about a year. I took this as an internship and it developed into full time position. The pay hasn't increased with the responsibility and time escalation, and there isn't too much room for advancement in the near future. I can move about 30 minutes and make double my current hourly pay, but Help Desk isn't really where I see myself forever so I am looking for ideas. I don't mind the work, but it isn't...engaging? 

I have an undergrad in Mathematics/Stats and about 2 semesters of Grad School(CS) under my belt. Unfortunately, I dropped school for work as I couldn't justify more debt when my job was helping my stay somewhat afloat.Both were demanding more of my attention than I thought I could handle. I regret leaving school as I really enjoyed my programming courses and was looking forward to some of the other courses ahead, but I accept the choice I made. 

Anyways, with a Math background, interest in programming with *some* knowledge of Java/JavaScript, and experience in IT ; are there any careers that kind of combine those? I have thought about DBAs but I don't know much about that field. I have setup a lunch with a DBA soon to learn more, but it keeps getting pushed back (very understandably). 

tl;dr: I like working in IT, but would like to leave help desk if possible. I have a math background and like the programming courses I took in college. Any way to combine these? Thanks!"

A bit of background. I currently study Industrial Civil Engineering with emphasis in Computer Science here in Chile. Its basically computer engineering with a different name.

I would like to do my internship abroad, hopefully in the bay area but if not anywhere else is welcomed.

Do any of you have a set on information on where and how do I have to apply since I will probably need a visa? I know bigger companies tend to give more of these visas since its easier for them, but I want to have a full idea.

Also, my idea is to do the internship starting july 2017, when should I apply then? Do companies offer internships starting that date?

Finally, what set of skills should I have as a minimum? Because of college I have worked with languages such as C, C sharp, python, RoR, SQL, and java. I also know how to use Git. But aside from the typical college projects I have none. College here is very demanding and we barely have time for side projects.

 
Thanks everyone and all comments are welcomed, specially if you have any stories/experiences doing your internship abroad.  "

I'm a 20 year old college student, I might be a bit late to the game for seriously wanting to get into the industry, but everybody's gotta start somewhere. I go to UCLA, and I'll be graduating in 2 - 2.5 years with a B.A. in Economics and a B.S. in Cognitive Science, with an emphasis in Computing (the department has a program where you can do most-to-all of the classes the major requires in the engineering school). I'm thinking of also picking up a minor in Digital Humanities to get access to more design classes. 

I'm somewhat of a socialite, and I'm studying in London at the moment, so I've been walking into local offices (Google, Glasscanvas, Brain labs, Jagex, Bam construction, etc.) to try and meet young people in the industry and get a feel for what skills they have and how they got there. I've made some headway, and I've got a running spreadsheet at the moment with programs/skills I should get some sort of mastery with. So I've got longterm goals to learn a lot of things, but more relevant to me at the moment is what I need to get my first internship, something I'm hoping to have by this fall/winter. 

I've digressed a bit, but my main question is, **where should I start?**

I've been learning C++ in school for a little over a year, so I've got a pretty decent understanding of basic algorithms, data structures, and writing, developing, and debugging code. I've also got some experience using Java, Python, Swift2, and mySQL. I am obviously continuing studies, so I will naturally improve and learn more, but I want to pick up something on my own as well.

I wish to take graduate level courses part time and online. I will graduate with likely a 3.2 GPA.

I'm at a crossroads in my life.  My current job has reached a dead end and isn't very intellectually stimulating to me.  The pay isn't bad but I am just not driven towards what my manager's plan for me is.  Unfortunately my current bachelors major is not very applicable for many other jobs so I likely would not be able to spring to a different industry and expect the same pay.  I'm already barely scraping by and my pay is above average in the US (Yay california).

Recently with the advice of a friend I took to learning to program.  I've finished an intro class at a local Junior college and really enjoyed it.  I finally got to feel like I was using my brain after not experiencing that since joining the workforce.  It's something I would like to pursue and was thinking of getting a second bachelors in CS.

Do you think it's worth it to go for the second bachelors? My parents are able to help me a bit financially so I wouldn't need to take out loans.  For anyone who has done a second bachelors how long did it take you?  Do you feel like it's worth it?  There are a lot of tech companies nearby that offer a lot of internships and I'm far enough from the bay area where the competition isn't nearly as fierce.

I am eager to get into a job and working, but I am worried that if I start now then I will never return to do a Master's.  However, the fees and living costs in London make my Master's almost financially infeasible, since I have not received any additional funding.  The internship is not particularly well paid, but will at least cover my living costs for the 6 months - and I will get solid work experience while improving my French (I only speak English fluently).  I am also looking to defer my Master's and do both, but this option is looking increasingly unlikely.  If I did the internship, I would be looking to apply to Master's courses and jobs for after the placement - since I do not want to work in the European location for longer than 6 months.

Do you think she'll eventually cheat on me?,TonTrapper,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4tmbh7/my_girlfriend_has_a_history_of_guys_flirting_with/,"My girlfriend has a history of letting guys flirt with her. The first time it happened was at this internship we had. There was this older co-worker who kept flirting with her (he got physical at most times) and she just brushed him off. She never even bothered to tell him that she had a boyfriend at all.

We're on an LDR now and a few months ago, I felt this weird, sinking feeling in my gut. There's this guy who keeps commenting on her posts and stalking her (CREEPY IKR). He even takes pictures of her without her consent and tweets them, ALSO without her consent. So I snooped into her Facebook account (the first time I actually did this. She does it to me usually) and found the conversation she had with him. 

Turns out he was sending her kiss emojis (a lot of them) and has been calling himself her ""Mr. Perfect Boyfriend."" Although this time, she did acknowledge that she has a boyfriend, he still continued to mess around with her and she just blatantly let him. When I confronted her about him (without me telling that I sneaked into her account), she just brushed it off, got mad, and told me he was just a weird asshole. 

Next time I checked her account, she deleted the conversation. I believe that this is a sign of cheating -- *emotional* cheating, at the least.

Just now, she told me that she'll always keep wanting attention from others and that mine won't be enough.

What do you guys think?"

I am a student from India, graduated from an IT degree from a mid-tier college here. I regret wasting these past 4 years of my degree, not trying to improve myself as a programmer while others in my class have netted great great jobs and are far better than me. I do not have any personal projects apart from coursework. The only good project in my coursework was some QR Code scanning Android App and a Small VR Demo in Unity, both of then not share-able on Github because they are not that of good quality.


I stumbled upon this subreddit a few months ago. I always lived in a bubble where I thought I was a decent programmer, but now it has become evident to me where I lie. Everyday I come to this sub, I see threads where people share their personal project ideas, their resume. Their projects are so so good and they have done a few internships, I just cant help but be discouraged about myself. Where do I stand really? 'I am close to 22 and these people at high school in America are so much better, where the fuck do i even stand'.


I will be coming to the States for graduate school soon, and when I see LinkedIn profiles of many other people who have moved to USA for graduate school, I get even more discouraged. These guys have done awesome projects and published papers, maybe being a bubble and being so introverted and reserved didnt help me in college.

In short, I am literally the embodiment of the CS Graduate Meme you see circulating on 4chan. 

People tell me, my parents try to motivate me saying, 22 isn't too late, you can still improve, but theres this huge mental block I have in my mind which is really getting hard for me to beat. I just came to know about books like CtCI and PIE only just recently, one can only imagine what a reality check I had, how far behind I am in this rat race.


I want a decent job, I really love software development. I am currently interning right now at a place where I am not doing much, but the projects involved are really good, this is the first time I am looking at production level code, I am struggling a bit to understand. Typing this right now has really helped me, I have not been able to sleep properly at night due to this. The cycle of unproductive days and sleep isnt helping either, apart from the 'showing up' at my current internship work I am doing.

How can I improve in 2 years while I am in the states? Am I only kidding myself? Even if I give it my all will I get there? ... all these questions scrape the corners of my brain.

I am sorry for this rant but it has been plaguing my life for a long time and I wanted to share this with people who are in the same field as me or be a speaker for those who have been struggling the same way. I love you guys and what you have achieved and like you, I love computer science that is why I managed to maintain a decent GPA of 3.6 and but I cant help but put myself down compared to you guys.

TL;DR: I am 22 yr old IT grad from India, literally shit at programming, want to improve to get a good job after my masters, mental block because I cant stop comparing myself to others and cribbing about the past.

I finished school at just before turning 17 in 2012 (not left, finished) and had no clue what I wanted to do with myself being so young. I got into college but left after a couple of months since I was so overwhelmed. I decided to take a year off in 2013 and figure out what I wanted to do. I did some volunteer work over 2013 and 2014 but got nowhere finding an actual job. 

In 2014, at 19, I decided to retake my country's (Ireland) final exam year. I tried finding a part-time job but because my schedule was so packed and the importance of the year (employers thinking I wouldn't prioritize them), I got nowhere. I had to leave halfway through the year in January 2015 because my grandfather fell ill and my mother needed another source of income in the house even if it was just a €100 weekly welfare payment. 

I saved up for a while and in May 2015 I did a short barista training course thinking it would help me find work. I applied to a lot of coffee shops but initially got nowhere. Last September I also started a 1 year college course in software development to get into university for computer science. That December my luck finally changed. I got a part-time job in a coffee shop near my college. It closed two months later and the manager ignored my calls to ask for a reference and my tax cert.

In February I was back to the drawing board. I graduated my course at the top of my class in early May and it looks like I'll be accepted into the top computer science course in the country as a result. I continued looking for part-time work with no success. I got two interviews between losing my job and now. One for a tech consultancy that I noped out of after the interview (turned out to be really sketchy) and a coffee shop that I didn't get. 

I've been applying almost everywhere I can. I turned 21 last Thursday and I'm getting seriously depressed now. I have absolutely nothing to do and the longer I'm out of work the more difficult it gets. Even positions that supposedly require no experience ignore me. I've even tried lying to a couple of places to no avail. I know that's wrong but I'm that desperate. It's not even about the experience and the job anymore. I just want something to do. I've mostly been applying for retail positions since they're the most common part-time ones but most of them want at least two years experience (I see the words experience essential a lot). The local convenience store has been hiring kids with less work ethic than a spoon over me since I started my job search over two years ago. I tried having my aunt pull some strings with her colleagues (she managed a department store concession) and that didn't work. I honestly feel like giving up. I'm just so...tired of it. 

I will note that I did find an unpaid internship in IT today that's willing to accept part-time. They cover expenses and it does seem like great experience but given my family situation at the moment and going to university soon, I don't know if I could afford to work for free for up to 6 months. 

TL;DR - Just turned 21. Been searching for a job for over two years. Got one but the place closed soon after. Now I'm back to square one and the experience I have apparently isn't enough. "

I run triathlons too, and will join a rowing crew this fall (I erg already).

Schools I will be applying to as of now: 
Reach: Princeton (Connection), Columbia (Kinda-Connection), Stanford (Applying to a not-very-well-known 6-yr dual program), Cornell, Northwestern (Kinda-Connection) 
Match: USC, UCLA, UMich Ann-Arbor, UT Austin, UVA, UIUC 
Safeties: UNC Chapel Hill (Kinda a match too), UC Boulder, Texas A&amp;M (Auto-Admit through class percentile and ACT/SAT scores).

Thanks for the help!

PS: I'm applying to all of my reach schools as a Music major only, with the exception of Northwestern (doing both there), and also UVA, as those schools you don't declare your major until later. (I'll say I want to do CS as a minor)."
4torpz,2,2016-07-19,Profile Review T25 for the Fall of 2017,MBAadmit,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/4torpz/profile_review_t25_for_the_fall_of_2017/,"Hey guys I am looking for a little bit of help as I am considering applying to MBA programs this fall. Right now I am more or less curious to see how high I can go. If I can't get the programs I am most interested in and feel like I am selling myself short, I could potentially hold off for one more year. However, I feel I can contribute to an MBA program sooner than later. The question really is how realistic am I being and how high can I go? 

Work experience:

- 1 1/2 years: Internship at a regional insurance company. I was able to network and create my own job within the company. They had never hired an intern before. I convinced them I could add value and they gave me a shot. After holding the internship for more than a year in college they've hired at least one intern per year since then. 

- 1/2 years: Financial Analyst Internship at a fortune 100 company. To add some context it is one of the biggest aerospace companies on the fortune 500 list. 

- 1 1/3 year: Big 4 Public Accounting. This was my first job outside of college  Before moving onto my next role I was able to senior a benefit plan with 3 staff under me.

- 1/2 year (current): Senior Analyst at a fortune 500 company. I work a lot of their P&amp;L's and do a lot of presentations with management. At the time of starting the MBA I would be close to 2 years in this role. 

Extra curricular activity:

- Vice President of my college's accounting club 

- I volunteer at multiple places that deal with underprivileged youth education 

- Led a team to the finals of a business ethics case competition at a major university 

- 4 years of intramural sports

Undergrad school/major:

- Bachelors in Accounting with a 3.7 GPA from a mid-sized private university

Other education/coursework/certifications:

- I am a CPA 

Race/nationality:

- 24 year old / White / Male 

GMAT Score:

-740

Goal of MBA:

-Big Picture: Every chance I've been able to be a leader I've cherished and enjoyed the opportunity. Although I've gotten a taste of leadership at a young age I want to put myself in a spot where I can really learn a lot more about myself as a leader and teacher so I can take that next step and really drive results in a positive, fun, and creative way. 

-More Specific: I want to be able to make the career transition from accounting and finance to the consulting side and then a few years down the road go off an do my own thing. I want to work with or found a non-profit that targets children who may not have access to the education your or I did. These kids need to understand that growing up may be a struggle, but education can be their road to prosperity if they're given the correct resources. 

Target schools:

-I am looking primarily at the top 25, ideally I want top 15. Darden and Ross are two programs I have my kept my eye on. I've also been doing some research on UCLA. Are these legitimate options? Should I focus on reaching for a few schools higher, or maybe I am just dreaming with these three to begin with. 

Thanks for the help in advance. "
4totns,2,2016-07-19,Been looking for my first job for months part 2,aggressiveplayer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4totns/been_looking_for_my_first_job_for_months_part_2/,"Hey all. So I've made steady progress each week working on my side project and learning some new technology. For those of you that don't know about my current situation, you can read about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4p27q6/took_a_break_and_have_been_looking_for_a_job_for/). Now, I have a couple of questions given the situation I'm in. 

1. **Do I continue working on my side project, or do I practice algorithms and data structures, or both?** I feel like currently algorithms and data structures are somewhat of a tossup for me. Depending on the question, I might be able to  work out a good solution for it, or I might not be able to. But I think for the most part I can't write completely bugless code on whiteboard in one sweep. I usually make mistakes and I sometimes get confused or stumped in the process of writing code because new details emerge that I haven't thought about when I write it out.

2. **Is it okay if I still apply to software engineering internships given my circumstances (graduated, haven't found a job, had previous software engineering internship experiences)? What do I tell recruiters if they ask me why I'm applying for an internship rather than a full time position? Also, if an internship states that they usually want people who are about to graduate or something of that sort and I've already graduated should I apply to those anyway?**

3. I ask the above because from my personal experiences it has generally be easier to get an internship. For my previous internships which I got offers from, they asked fairly easy algorithm questions, and I think they weighed more on my passion (previous personal projects) than seeing if I could solve algorithm problems. Internships also didn't hand out all these coding challenges on HackerRank and things of those sorts (which I usually fail because of the time limit and how you need 100% correctness and are usually somewhat difficult), although some companies did back then when I applied. Nowadays this seems to be a standard. The algorithm question that I was asked was probably just to check and make sure I knew how to code at all. This is also why I'm debating whether I should work on algorithms or my personal side project, because maybe I can get lucky with a company and they're looking for someone with more passion rather than focusing so much on problem solving abilities. So this leads me to my last question, **how comfortable should I have to be with algorithms and data structures?** I guess I'm really just trying to ask **what would make the best use of my time: working on my side project and learning new relevant technologies that companies want or data structures and algorithms)?**

4. I've noticed for the past 2 weeks there hasn't been many new jobs, and this is especially true for software eng. internships where there has been virtually none at all. **When will new openings start picking up again and when is the best time for me to apply?**

Sorry for the long post. I applaud you for reading this far and I appreciate any advice you can give me because I really don't want to be jobless any longer."

Did around 6 years of Taekwondo. I don't think I'll put this since I quit before middle school.

Tried out in Science Fair. Highest I've ever got to was 3rd place in school and honorable mention in regionals.

I was in fencing club for 1-2 years.

Probably won't be a semifinalist for national merit :(

I did nothing over the summer except going to a week-long music camp.

I like making video games. I've never finished making a single game, however.

**Schools:** (Computer Science Major and maybe composition as either minor or double major)

Carnegie Mellon (This is the only college I know that has the best comp sci AND music programs), MIT, Stanford, UT Austin, Georgia Tech. I would really like to expand this list with more colleges with good comp sci programs that aren't reach schools. Any suggestions?

4tovol,76,2016-07-19,Freshman Please Be Prepared to Fail,Th3HoopMan,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/4tovol/freshman_please_be_prepared_to_fail/,"TLDR: Everybody here fails something at some point. THWg.

So every year this subreddit gets freshman making posts about 6 months before they even set foot on campus looking for advice, which is fine, but every year it's seems like a lot of the advice given goes through one ear and out the other. That's fine, a lot of stuff you need to learn on your own anyways, but there's one thing I really need you guys to do. Be prepared to fail. I can't stress this enough. The reason I'm making this post is because we as a campus are trying to help students with stress and depression, and failing at things for the first time really can hurt.

Now I'm not saying you will fail, I'm just saying be prepared. I hear FASET leaders, teachers, students say this every year and it still hits a lot of you like a sack of bricks. We understand you were valedictorian, you were class president, you're ""technically a junior"" by credits, that's cool, but Tech is beast and it will take you time to tamenit. 

I'm not going to go into extreme detail. Just know that failing isn't the end of the world, but please learn and don't make the same mistakes. Don't be afraid to ask for help. I'm going into my 4th year, currently working a summer internship, getting paid pretty well to do so, and I asks my manager questions every day, and I'm becoming a better software engineer because of it. Please reach out to your Professors, TA's, peers, or whoever for help if you're struggling with classes. If you're looking for the magical answer to start performing better in a certain class, this is it.

Don't be discouraged to be active. If you don't get into a certain organization that you saw on Tech Walkway, try another. There are plenty of awesome groups that welcome in new members each semester, and a lot of times you may fall in love with a group you never expected to.

When the career fair comes around, don't be angry if you don't get an internship because you don't have enough experience. Take that as a call to action to obtain more experience.

For those of you who took time to read this please heed my advice. Be prepared to fail. And if that time does come, don't beat yourself up over it. It's happened to all of us. Learn from these upcoming experiences and make yourself a stronger person through them. Can't wait to have you guys on campus in a few weeks.

4tp5pt,3,2016-07-19,Education- India and America,indian_in_texas,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4tp5pt/education_india_and_america/,"I am an undergraduate student a large university in Texas. I did 14 years of schooling in a CBSE affiliated school in India. Having spent a considerable amount of time in America, I thought it would be interesting for some folks here to read about a comparison of the educational system in India and in America. I'll post the things that I like better in America in this post, and if there is any kind of interest, I'll post about things which I liked better in India.

* Classes
My university has one of the best CS programs in the world, so my views might be colored slightly by that. However, I have many friends in all kinds of universities in India- from IITs and Delhi University to Indian colleges people would likely not recognize here. Similarly, I have friends in places like Stanford to American colleges that people won't recognize here.
The point is this- the American colleges are *better*. Not just the 'ivies', not just the Stanfords of the world. Even if you go to a place like ASU, which is very easy to get into, you would probably end up getting a better education than most colleges in India. I feel like this comes down to basically two things- American colleges having a lot more resources, and the respect given to professors in America. India is lacking severely in both these fields.
* Opportunities
Getting the same opportunities that one gets in America in India would require one to have much, *much*, ***much*** more intellect. This summer, I was able to score an internship through which I will be earning more per day than an intern at Infosys will earn in a month. Earning this sort of money working is simply not possible in India as a college student. More than that, there are ~easy~ opportunities to work with professors and organizations. There are thousands of events one can attend for self growth. There are thousands of student organizations that one can join to give oneself an advantage. For example, I will be an officer at a machine learning club next semester, and we will be doing things that actual data science experts do at their job, not just hold events like ""data science quiz"".
* Personal Space
There is a lot of respect for a ""personal bubble""- which is not just a physical but also a mental boundary around a person. So, you wouldn't squeeze 5 people in a place for 3. You wouldn't ask someone how much they earn. You wouldn't try giving relationship advice to someone you have just met. You wouldn't give people ""birthday bumps"". I know that a lot of such Indianisms are glorified and cherished by some here, but once you get used to people having respect for your personal space, it is kinda hard to go back.

These were just some things of the top of my head. If anyone wants to know anything about the differences between the Indian and American education system, feel free to comment and I'll answer it."
4tpc9u,22,2016-07-20,I am not able to sleep ( xpost /r/cscareerquestions ),epicboar,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4tpc9u/i_am_not_able_to_sleep_xpost_rcscareerquestions/,"I want to pour a lot over here, as a person who wants to be a great developer and as someone who loves computer science. I am a student from India, graduated from an IT degree from a mid-tier college here. I regret wasting these past 4 years of my degree, not trying to improve myself as a programmer while others in my class have netted great great jobs and are far better than me. I do not have any personal projects apart from coursework. The only good project in my coursework was some QR Code scanning Android App and a Small VR Demo in Unity, both of then not share-able on Github because they are not that of good quality.

I stumbled upon this subreddit a few months ago. I always lived in a bubble where I thought I was a decent programmer, but now it has become evident to me where I lie. Everyday I come to this sub, I see threads where people share their personal project ideas, their resume. Their projects are so so good and they have done a few internships, I just cant help but be discouraged about myself. Where do I stand really? 'I am close to 22 and these people at high school in America are so much better, where the fuck do i even stand'.

I will be coming to the States for graduate school soon, and when I see LinkedIn profiles of many other people who have moved to USA for graduate school, I get even more discouraged. These guys have done awesome projects and published papers, maybe being a bubble and being so introverted and reserved didnt help me in college.

In short, I am literally the embodiment of the CS Graduate Meme you see circulating on 4chan. 

People tell me, my parents try to motivate me saying, 22 isn't too late, you can still improve, but theres this huge mental block I have in my mind which is really getting hard for me to beat. I just came to know about books like CtCI and PIE only just recently, one can only imagine what a reality check I had, how far behind I am in this rat race.

I want a decent job, I really love software development. I am currently interning right now at a place where I am not doing much, but the projects involved are really good, this is the first time I am looking at production level code, I am struggling a bit to understand. Typing this right now has really helped me, I have not been able to sleep properly at night due to this. The cycle of unproductive days and sleep isnt helping either, apart from the 'showing up' at my current internship work I am doing.

How can I improve in 2 years while I am in the states? Am I only kidding myself? Even if I give it my all will I get there? ... all these questions scrape the corners of my brain.

I am sorry for this rant but it has been plaguing my life for a long time and I wanted to share this with people who are in the same field as me or be a speaker for those who have been struggling the same way. I love you guys and what you have achieved and like you, I love computer science that is why I managed to maintain a decent GPA of 3.6 and but I cant help but put myself down compared to you guys.

TL;DR: I am 22 yr old IT grad from India, literally shit at programming, want to improve to get a good job after my masters, mental block because I cant stop comparing myself to others and cribbing about the past."

I led my FIRST programming team last year (we made it to the world competition) so I have some Java experience and have done some image processing stuff. On my own I've learned some basic web development, Python, and Haskell stuff, but I haven't really done any major projects. I see a lot of the kids applying to these schools have gone to hackathons, built apps that win awards, and have internships, while I haven't even taken a CS class yet.

What I'm worried about is the fact that if I've received internship offer from a company multiple times, and I turn them down every year, it'll look bad and will hurt my future chances of working there.

i.e. Apply for internship every year for 3 years, every time they accept me, I decline. Does that look bad?

Can I get blacklisted for this stuff?"

My first two years were as a CS major, third year I switched to Operations Management &amp; Information Systems, fourth year back to CS and now on my final year of CS.

My third year I felt like I forgot everything I had done in the previous two years.  My fourth year I managed to get an A in my data structures &amp; algorithms class, but I feel like I didn't retain much... Also had a 5 month internship doing .net development over the spring semester, as well an A in my assembler class.

In the fall I'm taking computer architecture and a .net class.

I haven't really done anything outside of the classroom and my one internship.  I also don't really know what my favorite portion of CS is or what I want to go down as my career path.

Is there a list of essential things that I should know like the back of my hand to help stand out to the various companies at my career fair, even if I'm not exactly sure what I'm after yet?  Something I can practice everyday until I get to the fair?  I know it's not a whole lot of time but would there be anything in particular I should focus on?

TLDR:  Career fair in October, what should I be focusing on / practicing until then to have the best odds across multiple aspects of CS as I'm not sure what I want to do yet?"

I have a few friends and I have my family and I have a boyfriend, but I don't have anyone to talk to anymore. I feel like everyone is getting sick of my complaining. I feel like no one will ever understand how awful I feel constantly.

I have so much to say that I am not really sure where to start. I just want to talk to someone and get it out. I am 20 currently. I was a self harmer for many years in high school and early college. I have not cut myself in about 8 months, but honestly the only reason I haven't is because I don't want my boyfriend to call a hospital or something if he sees it. I haven't told anyone this, but I think about cutting literally every day. I fantasize about doing it again. I don't think I will, but I just think about it a lot.

 I just hate myself so much, I can't even explain it. I know I have friends and family who love me, but I feel like such a burden to them. Like they would be better off if I just disappeared. I work at a restaurant right now as a waitress, and I honestly believe everyone at my job hates me and it sucks the life out of me every fucking time I go into work. I am not exaggerating when I say that literally all of the other server are friends and go out together after work. I am the only one who isn't invited. They specifically never ask me. I have overheard them talking bad about me before. Saying that I'm annoying and no one likes working with me and that I should shut the fuck up. I try to be nice to people. I have only had a direct conflict with maybe one person there before, but I don't complain and I do my job. I have worked there for 4 years and during that time haven't made one friend. At this point, I honestly believe that it isn't them: its me. I am annoying. I talk too much about things no one cares about. I have a very loud voice and its so hard for me to control my volume sometimes and I know its annoying and I try so hard. Just this past Sunday a group of servers and hosts were gossiping up at the host stand and when I walked up there, they all just stopped talking, you know like people do when they are talking about you. I pretended I just went up there to grab some napkins and walked into the back to do my sidework. Later on I heard one of the girls who was at the host stand tell another girl who wasn't there that they thought I overheard them. I didn't, but that confirmed they were talking about me. It makes me want to die. I am so serious when I say that. It makes me hate myself so fucking much.

I know what everyone is thinking, ""why don't you just quit,"" and I honestly am thinking about doing it. But I am really worried about finding a new job that will accommodate my hours. I go to school full time and I am on an academic team at school that I end up traveling around the country a lot for (as in I sometimes have to take 3 weekends in a row off of work to travel). The one thing I like about my current job is the managers are nice and always give me the days off I ask for without giving me shit about it. I doubt any other job would accommodate that schedule and honestly being on that team is so important to me. Its one of the few things I feel confident doing and that I look forward to. I don't want to give it up. I don't know, this restaurant job is the only job I have really ever had other than volunteer jobs and internships. Would other places that are minimum wage typically let me take that many days off? Is this job my only option?  I just am not sure what to do.

I feel like a failure at almost everything, not just my job. I feel like no matter what I do with my family, my boyfriend and my friends, like I always fuck up and get someone mad at me. 

I also am worried about my future. I have always been a very sensitive and emotional person. I cry really easily at everything. When I get embarrassed, I cry. When I get angry, I cry. When I get flustered, I cry. When I get frustrated I cry. I have tried so hard to keep it under control, but I am so bad at it. I really want to go to law school some day, but I have had so many people tell me they don't think I have the personality for it or I'm not cut out for it. I interned in a public defenders office this past summer and I love the internship and working with people and helping them with legal issues and learning about the law, but what if everyone else is right? I just feel like so many people look down at me and don't respect me because of how emotional I am and it really hurts. 

I hate myself so much. I hate myself more than I've ever hated a person before. I hate the way I look, how loud my voice is, how easily I cry, how I can never seem to find the line between asserting myself and being a bitch, how I have a really hard time not speaking my mind, how no matter where I go and how nice I try to be, I always end up being that one girl that everyone thinks is annoying and talks too much. 

I feel like I'm drowning constantly.

I know no one will read this whole thing, but it feels good to get out, even if it is on a throwaway. "

I have approximately one more year until my inactive clearance turns into an expired one. I just recently learned that a lot of software engineering positions in the defense industry list *active* clearance as a basic qualification. I want to keep those opportunities open to me.

From what I have gathered on this sub, most companies prefer to take on upperclassmen for their intern positions; however, I will lose this clearance before I even begin my 2nd year if I don't take on a position that requires it. My coding experience is (relatively) very limited. I've recreated hangman, I've solved 34 problems on project Euler, and now I'm working on a fractal art generator. I only worked in java. In regards to school, I'll be starting at a [tier-2 school](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1fqe1i/which_universities_do_the_big_tech_companies/cad1r90) this fall, and before that I went to CC.

If anyone here interned, as a freshman, in the defense industry or perhaps in a gov't position that required a clearance, please let me know what you did to land the internship. "

I will be graduating with a Math degree in December. I Have finished the JHU Data Science Specialization on Coursera and also in Process to finish the Big Data Specialization on Coursera.
After completion, I was thinking of doing the NanoDegrees From Udacity Both in ML and Data Analysis.
I have worked on One project involving data mining so far. And ofcourse the Coursera Capstones which have thier own Projects.
I hope to finish one more project in the following semester and the others being from online courses.
But, as i look online for jobs and entry level positions in th field. There are very few. Or none at all. They all Require a Masters or Ph.D. and also require Experience.
I have an internship in a training lab at my university where I teach Excell and R and Python. I have also thought CMS level 1 and 2. These labs are basically for the campus faculty, staff, Students, and the Community.
But I worry that these will not be enough to get me an entry level position at companies.
And hence I am considering a MIDS from Berkely online. Here to inquire if it is worth the fees or should I check some other schools also."

I was waiting for the 480 after markets and 1060 benchmarks, but I recently picked up a rather good deal on the Radeon R9 Fury and it changed up my build quite a bit. I think I am ready to pull the trigger on the rest of my parts, but I want to make sure that nothing will be bottle necking my performance before doing so.


**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

I play video games about as much I work or go to school. So quite a bit. I plan to use this PC to play, stream and maybe record games for the most part. Games include League of Legends, Rust, Fallout, and a little CSGO. 

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for?**

 I will most likely be playing at 1080p, but most likely go for a 144 Hz monitor. Above 60FPS when I am not streaming, around 60 or as close to as possible while streaming. It would be nice to play on ultra graphics settings as much as possible.
Replace this text with your answer.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

I am a college student, and still have monitors to buy. So keeping it around where its at, ($1000 maximum) would be much appreciated.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

I am currently in China for an internship, but I am purchasing my parts from the US and will have them sitting on my desk when I arrive :)

4tr7gs,1,2016-07-20,2 Departments 1 Internship,Helpmyfriendzach,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4tr7gs/2_departments_1_internship/,"Hey all 

Background:
 Last November got an internship/Co op program where I would work part time during the school year and full time during breaks(summer, winter). The company that I work for originally was looking for 2 different interns, but hired me and split my time between departments. Which I spend 25 to 30 hours a week during the school year. 

Before accepting the position I was working at a place where I was the only engineering person. (small manufacturing company).  Where I was on salery (29kish/yr), detail that doesn't really matter but I feel that is note worthy, but i  was working in the mornings going to school, then working at night from home. It was a lot and there was a lot of harassment that I don't want to go into. But the experience I was getting was great. During school it was way to much for me, to the point where my GPA was around a 2.3ish. So I quit to work for this new Company,to cut down my work load from 50hrs/week to 25 to 30 at first. My overall GPA is around a 2.6ish,but if my classes go well this final 2 semester I should hit the 3.0 mark. 

New Company issues:
When I was in the discussion process of accepting the internship, both of the managers who would be my bosses said that I would be mostly working on project to gain experience. 

Boss A has not given me a single project or anything that I could put on my resume. Everything is data entry, no thought process literally looking at a piece of paper of what the employees did. Type it into the program and out pops a number. Boss A is also the head of the Industrial Engineering department (2 other people and me) , I am an IE major. I hate my time with the boss, even when I suggest projects I could look into instantly gets denied. The work I do is constant work that has a due date each week for pay roll. 

Boss B is great, she gives my projects where I am learning the machines, the process, and a lot of other things to do with my major. Boss B is the head of the business side of things and I am working with her to adjust the costing of the processes. The projects I have been doing do not really have any sort of due date. 

Issue:
This semester due to time limitations I will only be able to work 15 hours a week. I have the feeling that they will cut out the time with boss b completely, because it usually will take me the full 15 hours to do all the work with boss a. I do not want to work for boss a the full time during school. I do not gain anything on my resume from working with him, and I generally hate the work. 

Is there any way I can word it to ask my bosses to only work with one boss during the school year and not the other? The work and departments do not overlap at all. 

Thank you reddit."

Me: did you log off your computer?

Cowowrker: I closed it when I left yesterday, and I logged in.

Me: You click the start menu and select ""log off""

CW: Then what happens?

Me: It logs you off then you need to sign in

CW: So I hit the start menu again?

Me: No. I'll just show you.

So we walk back her computer and on they way she tells me that my email was too confusing and nobody understood what I meant by logging off (even though several people told me moments after it went out they logged out and in and it worked for them). So at her computer she shuts down

Me: Oh you didn't need to do that, but it will log you off, so it'll just take a bit longer.

She logs back in then asks if they just need to click Start and log off, and she logs herself out again.

Me: Yes but you didn't need to do that, you logged off when you shut down

CW: Okay I'll tell everyone to do that.

I'd normally not care if she couldn't figure it out, since she comes to me with a lot of questions, but her acting like just because she can't understand means it's confusing to everyone bothers me more than it should."

First, some background about me. I recently graduated from a Computer Science bachelor's program, but I think I have relatively good experience for a fresh graduate. My previous encounters with bioinformatics are: an internship with the department of Computational Science and Engineering at QCRI (which opened my eyes to the field), and my senior project was about feature selection for microarray datasets. After those two projects, I was excited about continuing in that track and pursuing a career in bioinformatics, but I'm kinda lost and need some advice.

1- Is there a chance that I can get a job in something related to bioinformatics, given that I never studied it in my university?
2- Where should I go? do you know a company, research facility, or a research team in a university who might accept me?
3- I also want to have a master's degree (or even a PhD), can you recommend a university with a good bioinformatics program?

I recently started taking bioinformatics courses on coursera (about to finish bioinformatics 1), and I got some books I knew from this subreddit to read afterwards.

I hope someone will help me with this, and thanks in advance.

I’m currently a software engineer intern at a small company. Everything is going smoothly and my co-workers are nice people. I had a meeting mid-season report meeting about my performance basically he said I have great technical skills and I do good work. 

However, my “communication and team work” skills could need more work. I interpret that is being social and having small talk.
I tried to improve those skills over the week, but found out that it just isn’t “me.” I simply don’t really care about how your dog, your new bathroom model, or what new restaurant you are going. I rather not fake being someone I’m not. 

I have no problem communicating or being social with people when we’re actually working together. I just don’t seek it outside the confines of work.

At the moment, I’ve finished my intern project, fixed all of the bugs my mentor gave to me, and just “trying to be productive.”  I decided that I just don’t fit in with the company’s culture. It’s one big room with desks that all face each other. I can hear all the conversation’s (personal and work), and It constantly distracts me. I tried using headphones, but my boss doesn’t allow me to use it cause it makes me look unapproachable. 

I’m just wondering if this will be a problem in the future.  I’m a very open person and have no problem discussing anything. Can a person like me thrive in tech. If so, what kind of companies should I be looking for?

What do you experienced developers/tech professionals think? Are there any other programs that you know of that train you in tech before you start?

I'm about to enter my senior year as a CS/Econ double major. I've been fortunate enough to have two very solid internships in software development, and I have a couple of small independent projects I've worked on.

I live on the east coast in NJ, and my internship this summer is in NYC's financial district. I really love new york, and want to live in the area right when I graduate. Cost of living is, of course, astronomical and I want to make sure I'm making what I think I'm worth. I work for a bank now, and based on recent grads I've talked to who have accepted full time offers after the internship, it looks like (provided I receive an offer of course) it would be ~75k and a 15k signing bonus. I'm not sure if there's any annual cash bonus.

This seems like a low offer to me. I'm not saying I'd be able to get a job at Google making six figures right off the bat, but my goal was to make closer to 85k or 90k starting, especially if I want to live close to NY in say Jersey City. Looking at salaries/companies on Glassdoor this seems attainable with my resume.

So my question is, for any grads who now have jobs in NYC, what salary would be considered ""good"" for an entry level position if you want to live in the area? Am I right in thinking 75 is on the lower end?

I'm working with a guy I've known for a long while who just got a PhD in CS, one of the damn smartest people I've ever met. 
I've been trying to figure out mostly how to make another service we're working with transform and communicate the RDF to Solr. I just spent the last three weeks reading everything I could find on Solr, building a Lucene analyzer for it and testing it against our instance. I'd never worked with Solr, Lucene, Maven or any other major Java framework before and haven't used the language in over three years, so I was feeling pretty good about myself as an incoming senior in college with very little actual dev experience having figured this all out relatively quickly (by my standards anyways). 
Until today. The PhD I'm working with pushed a big chunk of code that did everything I wanted to, and more. My code is basically scrap now, all of it. I may be able to parlay some of it into a more bulletproof version of what he added, but I doubt that. Before this, I had another big chunk of my work eviscerated late June - early July (it was an ontology). None of what I wrote was bad, it was all just superseded.
I don't know how I should feel right now. I know I feel gutted, I put so much damn work into this including overtime hours to make sure it was ready for a demo we're trying to build by early August. I realistically don't have much time left in my internship, and I felt like this was my chance to do something meaningful. Instead I just feel kind of empty now.
Has anyone here had something like this happen to them? How do you bounce back from this?


EDIT: So point of clarification, this is a kind of collaboration between my school and where I'm working. Our school's side is trusted to handle the application (e.g. me and this other guy) so the coordination was ultimately down to us. The blame for what wound up happening is strictly between the two of us, and I feel like I share a good chunk of that. The other guy has been kind of off the radar the past couple days (starting a new job somewhere) so that probably led to most of the confusion. We really should have been talking more over the weekend than we were. I'm kind of over it, it just sucks to see most of my work shelved, ostensibly for reasons we could have avoided very easily."

The biggest client was $corp, a giant company with offices across the country. On this occasion we were gearing up for their first digital all-hands meeting -- the CEO, CIO, and CTO of their company were going to have a ""town hall"" meeting live via webcast and we were handling the platform, including registration, tracking participation, etc.

To make things easier we had already set up a portal on their website at a subdomain: video.$corp.com. We'd worked well with their web masters and network people to make sure it worked on their corporate network and across the internet for those working at home.

This event was a big deal; it was a public company that was undergoing a restructure, and this was the Chiefs' chance to explain how it all works. We knew that they had sent out the live URL to several press outlets the night before.

The event starts and the QA guys are watching it and everything is fine. They start talking and it's crystal clear.

Thing is, there are only about a dozen people watching it, including our four QA guys and myself. We had anticipated 4000 to 5000 people, but were peaking at maybe 16, tops.
My company's CEO, $bigBoss -- who, it should be known, barely knew how to send a text -- comes screaming into my office going completely bonkers.

""ThatOtherMonster, we're down. Nobody can see the broadcast!""

I point to my monitor where it's playing and say, ""you mean this one? It's working.""

""No it's not! I just got my ass chewed out by their CTO. All of their clicks are redirecting to Disney! We've been hacked!""

What!? That made no sense.

So I go down the hall to find the web dudes. This entire time the CEO is following me around shouting about how I assured him we tested, did a dress rehearsal, that the servers could take it, everything, and that if I didn't get it working now that I'm fired.

So I'm talking to the web guys and they have no idea what's going on. We can get to the portal remotely. The guys in the east coast NOC see everything fine, too. We check all over the country and it works. We realize that only the people at the company and its remote locations are having this problem -- and those are all the people who are supposed to watch.

So I call up the network/IT guys at $corp and ask if they're having a problem. After all, we had tested it out the day before and an hour prior to the start of the town hall.

""It's fine here,"" he says. ""I'm watching it through my firewall. We have no idea why the users are having trouble.""

Now we're even more confused: Their techs can watch it, we can watch it, but regular users can't? We spend a few minutes going over everything, from soup to nuts.

Then my phone rings and it's the same $corp IT guy.

""We figured it out, you sent us the wrong URL,"" he says.

""What!? What URL? It's right at the video.$corp.com subdomain, right where it's always been.""

""Well, someone at your company named $bigBoss sent an email to our CEO talking about how excited he was to finally get this live stuff off the ground. He reminded them that they could watch it at $corp.video.com at 3PM yesterday.""

""I don't get it. So?"" And then it hit me. Our portal is at **video.$corp.com**... The CEO messed it up. **$corp.video.com** (or, really, [whatever].Video.com) is owned by Disney.

I say into the phone, ""Oh my god. Thank you."" I hang up.

I walk into $bigBoss's office, where he's yelling at my $upervisor about how he's going to fire me and then kick my ass.

""We figured out what's wrong. You're not going to like it.""

""Tell me about it later. Just fix it now!""

""We can't. It's working fine. The problem is that you emailed the CEO of $corp and included the wrong link to the broadcast, which he then forwarded to everyone in the company and all the press outlets. The link you sent them redirects to Disney. Their entire company is clicking on a link that takes them to Disney.""

I see my $upervisor turn red. He made sure this worked as hard as I did. He's also part owner of the company, so he lays into the CEO right there.

The CEO shuts him up and tells me -- and this is the best part -- to ""redirect that link now! Make it point to our stream!""

I thought my $upervisor was going to deck him. ""We can't redirect from a URL we don't own. We don't own video.com, Disney does. You messed up by sending out the wrong link. We spent six months getting everything on video.$corp.com working and you messed it up with a shitty marketing email.""
""Why didn't someone catch this before!?"" the CEO yelled.

""How would we catch it!? You didn't clear it with anyone. You just did it. Because you're an idiot. The only way to fix this is for you to email the $corp CEO again with the right link and hope that it's not too late for him to send it out.""

""We can't just, I don't know, hack the URL? Change it from Disney?""

""You want us to hack into the DNS records of a multibillion dollar corporation that could eat us for breakfast, hijack their rightfully owned domain name, and redirect it like a shining beacon of guilt to our client's website because you have no idea how your technology company works?"" I ask. (Or something to that effect.)

""Well, can't we just change how the links work to get it right?""

""You want us to somehow change how the internet fundamentally works because you went against protocol and had an unauthorized tech conversation with your client? No We can't do anything. You have to do what I just said. Or we lose this contract, period,"" $upervisor tells him.

$bigBoss kicks us out of his office, closes the door, and writes the email. About two minutes later it shows up in my inbox as a ""draft"". $supervisor and I check it out, fix the typos, double check the URLs, and send it on its merry way.

Somehow $supervisor got on the horn with $corp's CIO and explained that the CEO's intern that was writing the email as dictated by $bigBoss but messed it up, and that had been fired (which was all made up bullshit) and saved the contract. The rest of the town hall went perfectly.

That was the last time we let the CEO get involved in any event at all. He wasn't a bad guy, just an idiot who knew how to raise capital and hire smarter people than him.

4ttxwx,1,2016-07-20,Which Job To Pick,silkworm_supernova,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4ttxwx/which_job_to_pick/,"I escaped from my homeland after job market didn´t recovered from recession. Not to mention endemic corruption of political structures that penetrated so deeply into lives of ordinary people that it became almost impossible to get a job unless you are a member of political parties. If you avoid that (like I did) than a strange roller-coaster of all sorts of shitty behaviors comes right at you. I literary escaped suffering from what I like to call - unemployment PTSP (a state of worthlessness with absolutely no confidence, plus the traumas of seriously underpaid previous jobs with mobbing elements). Everyone from the South Europe shout out to you, you´ll understand.

I tried my luck in Western Europe where my degree and skills are obviously more appreciated. Plus the fact I am cheaper worker. So I got one nice graduate job right away. After the contract had been finished I moved to bigger city and applied for other vacancies. 

It happened to be that I passed trough all the interview/assessment rounds for two jobs I am very interested in. Don´t want to go in too many details, but it seems that I have good chances for getting both.

I found myself in a situation in which I have never been before. 

I feel completely clueless and don´t know how to make a good decision. I know this decision is responsibility of my own, but maybe some experiences and guidance wouldn´t be bad.

Oh yeah, just a couple of details. 

1.) So one job is corporate in tremendous IT company. I would actually work on interesting things and be paid very well. The minus is the high stress level I will have to deal with. I had some serious medical issues in my homeland that doctors believe are consequence of my incompetence to deal with stress (they couldn´t find any other cause). 
2.)The other job, in small company, is paid less. However, it seems that it is not that stressful and it is also interesting. 

My actual dilemma is that I am questioning weather I am repeating mistakes from my past where all the choices were made in favor of career/competitive spirit/prestige (college and some internships after) and none of my choices was made to be merciful towards my health and actual happiness. 

The first company would look excellent on my CV, the job is pretty decent - but I don´t know would this make me happy and healthy. Will I be able to deal with difficult situations/people on a proper way. If I choose it - am I doing it just because of others, to brag about my shiny new workplace?  The other company could give me a decent job with more peace but less challenges. However, challenges will probably grow with the growth of company and maybe my responsibilities, while in the corporate company I may be stuck in one position for longer period.

As it seems I´ll get the final decision for the second company within the few days. And for the corporate it might take them two more weeks (the process already lasts for months). 

If I turn down the second one and get the rejection for the first one - I lose both.

Maybe to go back in my jobless homeland... :D

I am so dramatic and full of shit. :) Nevertheless, humans help!

4tu7n0,11,2016-07-20,"Need help with my path, possibly help with depression",thelyjeong,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4tu7n0/need_help_with_my_path_possibly_help_with/,"So I've recently turned 22 and haven't gotten a degree yet.

So here's the gist of my education and backstory:

Throughout my childhood I guess I was strong academically but due to focusing on school only I believe I dropped alot of hobbies and interests to focus only on the grades. 

During highschool was when I started to notice that people genuinely had other interests aside from school. I didn't mind that while I focused on my subjects, scoring high in attempts to get into my university of choice with a sort of goal for a healthcare career (Pharmacy, physiotherapy). From being one of the top students I neglected a lot of the social aspects in my entire life, my only real friends are from highschool. While I did study at the huge university for about a year and a half I let major anxiety, depression and rejection hit. I didn't properly address this, instead I complained that the school, major in general science wasn't for me. Stopped that school, immediately wanting to transfer out.

Come the next semester I actually applied to another school to study in computer science; Something I knew nothing about but wanted to find a job right away. After about two years studying that and a very odd and different internship I realized my issues with anxiety and depression run too deep that I was always in some rush to get out of school and find a job. In retrospect I think this rush makes me neglect true learning as I barely learn the materials for the tests and homework.

Anyways while studying computer science a bit I have also come to speculate I won't do well in the field to get any other type of job if I have no interest in the field, leading to not applying the work ethic.

I guess I'm pretty far into my education with an average GPA but low work ethic, scraping by with the bear minimum of work. Main thing I learned in college is the importance of initiation, networking and value of working hard in something you enjoy.

From here I'm thinking that I have generally no interest in anything and have not approached learning correctly. Also from CS I'm not very strong in programming or learning because I probably don't have the patience or detail to debug, practice, or build anything on my own.

From here I'm thinking alot of my issues is a bit of what I want out of a career, but also some personal issues to deal with. Now I'm having major indecision of what to do, coming back in the summer term for CS classes that I have probably cannot handle because of my piss poor skills in understanding the material, poor study habits, and poor skills to implement assignments.

Ofcourse there isn't a way out, I don't believe I can fake it through my current education to get a degree in computer science. Now I'm thinking back to my strengths and values, I still want to do something quantitative, but hoping I can somehow find something I'm passionate about to not let anxiety get in the way. This genuine interest could bring more motivation to study and practice, leading to good performance and work ethic.

I'm sorry if this was written poorly. Anyways thanks for reading reddit

4tupf2,3,2016-07-20,Is this the time to exit the Project or Stay?,dusty_archer,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4tupf2/is_this_the_time_to_exit_the_project_or_stay/,"Hello everyone, I want to read some of your thoughts regarding my situation.

Last year I had a job (my first job related to my career, computer systems engineering) after an internship in a small company in my city. I really never liked to be there and I was having a really tough year (university, family, personal problems, etc,) and by September I could not stand being there and decided to quit without having secured any job. Of course before leaving I sent my resume to some other (and bigger) companies but future was uncertain at the time. 

A month later one of this big companies offered me a job (as a web and mobile developer) and they interviewed me, but I didn't get the job. One week later the same company called me again for a different project (as an application support engineer) and I accepted because I thought that I could stay there some time and then move to some better project.

In this new job everything looked pretty well in the beginning. I am a contractor and I work for a company ""A"" through company ""B"". What I do is just run some database queries, look for files and assist users. That is not what I want to do and this doesn't makes me happy at all. I really feel like I'm wasting my talent, i know I can do more than just support stuff.

Now that I wrote all that stuff, the issue here is that my current project will have budget cuts, thus some members will have to leave. My leader told me that I could be one of those who could leave, but my manager doesn't want me to leave because I've been a really good resource. Also he asked me if I wanted to stay and if I was committed to the project almost saying that they don't want me to leave.

So, I see this as an opportunity to go and look for the job I want (as a developer and stop being a support guy) but at the same time I feel like is wrong to leave, I mean I could say ""I volunteer as tribute"" but they expect me to stay, they really want me there but that job is not my thing. This is one of this questions about what to do. What I want or what I should? I have like 9 months there and they spent 3 of them teaching me how to do stuff.
I have talked to my friends about this and almost everyone says ""leave and do what you want, what makes you happy"". But also I see myself and I feel weak, unprepared for something new, I just finished my career like 6 months ago. Also If I decide not to ""volunteer"" I think it will be harder to leave since I'll be more commited and will have more responsabilities that i really don't want.

So basically I'm unsure if I should ""volunteer as tribute"" and wait for what the future holds (could be better or could be worse) or just stay in a safe job (until it drives me crazy).

Finally, sorry if my english is not ok, it's not my native language.

Thanks everyone."

First off, THANK YOU FOR THIS AMAZING COMMUNITY!  Seriously, its an amazing resource.  Ok, so heres the deal i just accepted an unpaid internship for 30 days.  The company has meh reviews on glassdoor.  The guy in the interview didn't ask me any algorithm questions, but then, no one has during my job search thus far.  He just went through the technologies he's come across while working there and asked me about my experience with them.  He looked at my resume at the end and said... well, I can't hire you on as a developer with this resume unfortunately.  he said that i could be an amazing hacker/coder but that it doesn't matter because i don't have any way to show that.  He didn't even look at my website, my github or anything, just my resume.  So he said he'd be willing to take me on unpaid for 30 days and if that went well, he's hire me on.  I accepted because i've wanted to program for my entire life and after doing sales and tech support and just basically going no where with my life, I jumped at my first real opportunity to really prove myself.  I'm 27.  Some facts about me to better assess the situation.

I just graduated from a code bootcamp in SF.   My experience is with ruby on rails, ruby, javascript, html/css of course.  I also know react native oddly enough.  I've made a decoupled app and a ruby on rails backend API using react native and submitted it to the iphone app store. In addition to my recent experience at a bootcamp I've worked at a major webhosting company doing tech support, so I have a lot of web technologies understood and down.  *I just haven't used them professionally*.  I know MySQL and Mongo.  My projects are on my website.  

I'm in phoenix arizona so the pay here is about 25/30k less/yr than it is in SF.  I've been applying on craigslist and had recruiters contacting companies for me for almost two months now and have had 4 interviews.  Two of which were just HR type prescreening interviews.  One of which I described above.  The other I haven't heard back from and its been about a week and a half.  It was for a PHP developer doing laravel work.  He didn't even ask me about any type of coding algorithms or anything.  He seemed like he was unimpressed the entire time and it was mostly the startup owner talking.  I did probably 5% of the talking.  I actually interrupted the owner because he just went on and on about how awesome the company was... I totally get being proud but I have to show you a bit about myself for you to know if you want to hire me, right? 

So /r/webdev my question is, did I get taken advantage of?  I feel like I'm in this weird space where I'm not getting interviews for the positions that i'd want, so I'm jumping at the opportunity to have some real work experience on my resume.  I'm worried the interviewer may have sensed that and took advantage of it.  I really need money at this point but I can hold out for a bit longer, especially if it leads me to the path of having a nice job doing something I've always wanted to do (programming).  I was about to take a tech support role that i'd likely get an offer for simply because I needed the money but am now doing this.  What does everyone think?"

Things have been really tough for me over the past year. I'm on the verge of breaking every day. Don't worry, nothing suicidal. I just need some advice/support from people who are dealing with similar issues.

I met my wife during our freshman year of college while on a camping trip with our friends. I was immediately struck by the fact that she was beautiful, smart, and fucking lightning quick with a retort. I was an engineering student with an internship at one of our local military bases. I'd been accepted to a 4 year university and was planning on going there after finishing the pre-engineering program at my local state college.

High school was no problem for me. I didn't even have to study. After I met her, I started struggling academically and began to fail, putting my state sponsored academic scholarship in jeopardy. The science was getting over my head. I thought it was too tough for me. Coupled with the fact that I had a new girl who was occupying ALL of my thoughts, it was too much. (I hope you guys realize I don't blame any of this on her)

At this point, I'm 20. I decided to change my major to business. I figured I could handle that. How hard could it be? I also decided to go to a different university. (Many of you can probably guess it's the same university that my wife had left for the semester before. My parents say me down and told me that if I decided to go through with the change, they wouldn't help me move or support me financially when I got there. (Poor little white boy, I know) That didn't matter to me. They were true to their word though. I had to get a full time job as soon as I got there. Big mistake. Next thing you know, I was working 40+ hours a week (sometimes my shifts were from 9am-11:30pm) and still trying to keep up with a school career and an increasingly serious relationship. With all of my savings, I bought her an engagement ring, went and talked to her parents, and proposed. I assured her we would be finishing college before we got married to start our lives off right. We set a date and started planning.

Grades in business began to drop. I began to fail, which put me on academic probation and I lost my scholarship. Another major change? Sure. Communications/PR was sure to be the right for for me.

At this point, I'm 24 and as the next few semesters went on, my grades got worse. I got kicked out of my university. It was a (very small) wake up call. I went before the academic board and plead my case. It was the scariest thing I'd ever done. Very humbling. ""We"" decided I should quit and focus on school. I was readmitted and starting making As and Bs. The wedding date was near and, in what I can only assume is an act of faith in me when I hadn't shown any reason to have it, she agreed to become my wife. 

We moved in together. She had already graduated and started working. I finished my degree with nothing lower than a B after getting kicked out. We moved back to our hometown to search for jobs. Public sector jobs in this city are non existent. No one told us college students the job market would be so saturated that a lot of us would have to take minimum wage jobs right out of college in order to survive. I was a teller.

I'm 25 when the wife gets pregnant with our son. We had no clue how to be parents. Hell, I didn't know this then, but I didn't even know how to be an adult. I stayed at the bank and my wife had to work right up until the day before our son was delivered in order to maximize her leave after the baby arrived. (Don't get me started on paid family/medical leave) My son is born and things don't change. Stuck at a bank teller job making nothing.

Wife gets pregnant with #2. (We didn't figure out what was causing it until after the second one popped up) At this point, I know I need to start making more money and consider a career change. What something really easy I could start doing very soon? Teaching. In the state of FL, all you have to do is pass a certification test to start teaching any grade/subject. Middle school science? I'm all over that shit. How sad is it that I considered a teacher's salary a step in the right direction? 

When my wife has our daughter, I sign on my benefits website and add my daughter as a dependent but since it was during open enrollment, I also had to add her manually to the insurance policy. (all things I'd never done before and didn't ask for help with) Guess what I didn't do. No insurance for my daughter. Medical debt adds a new layer of fuckery to the entire relationship. Everything just sort of stagnates until October 27, 2016. 5 days after my 33 birthday.

I'll pause and tell you that she had been telling me I needed to be better and make/do more this entire time. There were so many issues (her ring, our house) that led to October 2015. All of them similar issues though. Just me not doing what I should have done from the beginning. You know, when I actually type this shit out, it's even more apparent how clueless I was.

In October she told me she didn't think she loved me anymore. She told me that I had put her in a position she never thought she would be and she didn't think she wanted to be married to me anymore. She thought someone else would be able to give her the things she wanted and I would never change. It felt like all of the life had been pulled out of me. How can she not see how much I love her and our family. It's clear now I wasn't showing her the way she needed to be shown. I convinced her to go to counseling and guess what our therapist caught on the second appointment. I got diagnosed in February.

I've been on meds (Adderall) since then and things have improved with regards to my work ethic, but we stopped going to counseling. My wife didn't like it. She's very angry and resentful right now. Understandably. The problem is she won't stop being angry and resentful. I finally (took nearly a year) had to come to the realization that if she was going to find someone else, it was her choice and I had to let it happen. I started to see I was going to have to start doing better for me first.

A couple of weeks ago, I applied to a state university's college of engineering. That's right, it's like 15 years ago all over again. This time I know it isn't too hard though. This time I know I'll be an engineer within 3 years. (I already have a lot of the prereqs done since it was my original major) My salary will be tripled. Maybe more.

Here's the issue: I have to start back to work at my teaching job in a few weeks. I'd like to find a job working at night and hopefully it won't be too difficult to keep contributing what equates to a teacher's salary on that kind of job while going to school during the day. 

My wife is done supporting me emotionally. At least every other day she tells me she's done with me and wants out to be free to find someone else. She won't pull the trigger though. When stress occurs, I hear it. When things are okay, I hear, ""I love you."" I can't express how much I love this woman. I don't want it to end, but it's causing me to worry about how she feels constantly.

I know if I quit my job, she will be gone forever. I know if I don't get my ass in gear, she will be gone forever. I really want to be an engineer. I've discovered a love for science while teaching it and my medication has allowed me to learn so much more than I could before. I'm literally a new person, but because of so many screw ups in the past, she can't see it. What do I do?

I know it was long so feel free to ask for clarification on any issue. I'm not proud, so I'll clear it up.

TL;DR A string of bad decisions have left me in a dead end job with my marriage hanging on by a thread. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. How do I get to it?

Edit: Words and I also don't want people reading the comments and think I am in any way saying my wife has caused these issues. My complaint is that she isn't letting them die either by leaving or deciding to forgive."

I am passionate about computers and technology in general, hence my decision on taking soft eng. I am passionate about it and is my primary hobby. I am constantly programming, always working on something. I love gaining knowledge. I started off freelancing when I was in high school, worked on few small projects for clients. 

When I was in 2nd year, I was programming in class one day, just doing my own thing. One of the classmate saw me working everyday, he invited me go to a hackathon with him, didn't win but it was a fun and educational experience. He is really good with networking with people, he has lots of connections with various people. So he asked me if I want to work on contracts with him; as a mean of opportunity I said yes and he got us our first contract together. We would split the pay 50/50. 

The contract was with the dean of the university, who had a client looking to create a huge software. So ended up signing the contract. Now he is also in the same program as I, soft eng, so I thought it will be fun working with other developer because all my previous contracts were independent. So the project started at the start of the school year in sept 2015. I have lots of experience, so I had no problem starting off by myself. We would have meeting with the client every 2 week with progress. 

I also had 6 courses first semester and 6 courses second semester. The contract was for the year. I worked on it every single day, during class, after class, before class, basically whenever I was free/had time, I was working. Few weeks went by, my colleague didn't really do anything. He would show up for the meeting, all was fine. I just continued working by myself. He never contributed anything to the development. Months went by, I still kept working. School started to get hectic, assignments, projects, exams, tests, papers + I had to work on the contract. I started pulling all nighter every other day working. I started sleeping 2-3 hours a day. 

I am a hard working person, I dedicate all my effort into the work, doesn't matter what type of work it is. I have worked in various field, even did labour jobs for few summer. It started to affect my school but it didn't bother me much because I was never good at school. I was constantly self-teaching myself from the internet, all the technical aspect. During meetings, he would pretend that we did equal work, so he would be like ""we worked on this feature last week, it was tedious but we pulled it off"", stuff like that, so the clients were always under the impression that we both were working on the system. The school year was coming to an end, and so was the contract. We were little behind because I was the ONLY one working on it, but the clients really liked the work and decided to hire us as interns for the summer of 2016. 

In the meantime, he also brought in another project. Which would be working in a startup. Again I said yes because I wanted experience. Started working on that at the start of the summer while still going to internship (8AM-5PM). Again for this project also, I was working by myself but he gave the impression to everybody else that he is also working on it and that we are working on it together. So I would go to work on that after I come back from work, as soon as I got home. I worked till late night, from 7 PM - 1 AM/2AM/3AM even pulling all nighter. 

Now the dean that I was working with for the year also had a project of his own that wanted developers so he asked us after the contract period to work on that. We took it, again only me working on it. I also had various people wanting me to work with them on their ideas and projects. 

So at internship, we go to work everyday. Its a private company, so there are only 3 employee working including myself and my colleague. The client had 4 projects that he wanted us to work on for the summer, along with the project that was ongoing the entire year. Again I was the only one doing all the work. Every time the boss delegate the tasks, he would just send me those tasks to complete so the boss still thought that we both were working. He is also getting the same pay as me and I feel like he's getting paid for doing nothing while I put in all the work. 

It has been 3 months at internship and the startup. He hasn't done single development work but everyone still thinks that we both are working. I am the type of people who doesn't like to brag so I never say anything. He always pretends that he did lots of work and that he is tired by the end of the day, whereas here I am sleep deprived working almost 20 hours a day. I have a lot of experience, so working on these projects are not an issue for me. 

I am a silent person, so I don't talk a lot. I just do my own thing. I am starting to hate my workplace, because I have to constantly work on my tasks and his so he can show my boss what he did for the day. I don't mind the work itself, because its something I am passionate about, have experience and am good at it. I don't talk about my feelings to anyone because I don't really have someone close that I can freely talk to about this. I don't go out anymore because I don't have time. I am constantly working 7 days a week just so I can get the work done on time and meet the deadlines. The entire summer I would go to work, come back and spend the rest of the day working from my room. 

I now have a month left till end of summer and internship and I can't take it anymore. I am not the type of person to just go out and tell the boss the truth because that would expose him in front of everyone. I also feel obligated to keep working and not say anything because he was the one initially that found work for me. I also get a lot of high pay job offers but I can't take it because I still have to finish school.  I don't know what to do. I am constantly tried, feel like zombie but still perform my best to meet the deadlines. 

Also during school year we decided to team up for projects and labs, but even those I was the ONLY one working on it.  

I am sorry for my long post but I felt like I needed to vent. Any advice would be appreciated."
4txvms,4,2016-07-21,"Never been so confused, should I take the job offer?",herpinator69,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4txvms/never_been_so_confused_should_i_take_the_job_offer/,"I am a computer science senior that graduates next month. So much has happened in the past two months that I am confused to which path I should take in life. Two months ago I got a scholarship and funding to attend graduate school. Sadly, most of the graduate school deadlines had passed and I could not apply to the places I wanted to go but, my school made an exception. It’s not a great school but, it is an accredited state school that I wouldn’t mind going back for my Masters. My plan was to get my Masters in a year and a half and continue practicing algorithms in order to interview at the big four. However, I got an internship this summer at a big oil company and now I am confused. 
At first, I was in it for the money since they were offering 7k a month as an intern. However, the more I am here, the more I am starting too like it but, I still have some doubts in my mind.

**The pros of working at this large company.**

* Pay is good, 80k+ starting in Houston where cost of living is low. It is a lot better than many other people from my graduating class who are making around 60k.

* Great benefits, everyone seems happy and there is a great life to work balance. Many people here have stayed with the company for a long time.

* Although it’s not the best city, I like living in big cities and it’s close to home. 

* I am working with a team that I like, but they do let you move around if you wish.

**The cons of working at the company.**

* Wasting my graduate school scholarship. It lasts until I turn 25, so I have five years to decide but, I feel like I won’t go back in the future. I don’t mind graduate school, I enjoyed taking courses as an undergrad.

* I feel like I will be stuck here, never get to work for my “dream” companies over at the big four. I got calls from two of them last month asking to interview (I’m surprised since I am not from a “good” school). However, I would have failed the interviews and told them I would contact them in a few months when I am prepared. I have been doing a lot of top coder, CTCI and was planning on taking a lot of AI/algorithm courses next semester.

My boss wants me to stay full time starting next month since they are looking for someone to add to the team. My recruiter and boss have been asking me what I want to do. However, I’m not sure if I should accept the offer, I feel like I shouldn’t waste the opportunity. What if I am not good enough to get into the big four or I don’t like it there and I want to come back? I wouldn’t mind going back to graduate school either, even if I stayed in the company I would get a 10k+ raise with a graduate degree.

Graduate school or job at big company? WHAT DO I DO!!!

Can anyone shed any light?

4txys0,6,2016-07-21,How hard is it to actually get an internship/job in San Francisco?,themooseexperience,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4txys0/how_hard_is_it_to_actually_get_an_internshipjob/,"So I'm still going into my sophomore year undergrad, but if there is one thing I love more than CS it's the Bay Area. Every time I have been there (I have family there) it has just... I don't want to get sappy, but it's somewhat ""called to me."" I know that's where I want to live. 

Let's say, for all intents and purposes, I'm a ""very good candidate"" by graduation. Top 20 CS program, some few side projects and a few internships, etc etc. Not a rockstar, but very good. How intense is the job hunt really in San Francisco? I know that obviously it is kind of the center for tech right now, but with that I feel like comes a lot of companies that are looking for employees. So, for those of you working in SF, how was your job search? 

Alternatively, I'm going to start applying to those internships I hope to have by graduation soon. I would LOVE to intern in San Francisco, but go to school in Wisconsin... Is there any sense in applying to / inquiring about internships in SF? Anyone have any experience with that?

I have a 3.3 unweighted GPA after Junior year, around a 3.6 weighted I think. I'm expecting to score a 1400 at least the next time I take the SAT.

Some extracurriculars I participate in are Robotics club, Rocketry Club, Bike Team, and I play music around my city along with being in orchestra. I also work as a services intern managing data flow at a local healthcare IT company. 

With these academics and extracurriculars, can I safely plan on attending University of Michigan? My ideal goal for college is to get a dual/double degree in Computer Sciences and Jazz Studies.

If I should turn to another subreddit to ask, please redirect me.

I really don't know how to find a part time IT job during school time. Most places want full time employees.

EDIT: I also have the possibility of doing some unpaid work. I would do it, but I've been told that employers sometimes won't count that experience because there's no proof (like a W2) of you working there."
4tyh6p,156,2016-07-21,The Other Mother,Lisichki,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4tyh6p/the_other_mother/,"There's no doubt my daughter saved my life. Like a red, wet, little angel she came screaming into the world; and she saved me. 

Alright, I might not be dead by now, (I'm only 38, after all) but my self-destructive tendencies would certainly have lead me somewhere...else, darker. Or, left me in that warehouse, unknown and unloved, maybe to die or simply, horrifically, be forgotten. 

You see, Casey, my girl, she came into the life in a less than...usual situation. You don't end up in a disused warehouse ragged and wrecked, with a bundle of damp baby in your arms and a knife in your hand, recently sacrificed umbilical cord trailing away from her, without having made some, er, unwise life decisions.

It was just one of the ways she saved me, the circumstances of her birth. Being a baby-off-the-books, as it were, made things a little complicated legally— more so than they already were. I had no money (that much should be evident by now, my 26 years had not been spent exactly productively) so the hiring of a lawyer was out of the question, as was going straight to the hospital or police—I had just found her, to have her ripped away from me into the arms of ""authority"" and ""legality"" would certainly have killed me. 

So, I took it into my own hands. After heading to my flat's resident ""Grandma"" (Gramgram Dorothy, rest her soul, such a kind woman) I had Casey clean, safe and wrapped up warm, perfectly healthy despite her less than pristine entrance. I had my various injuries cleaned, but I was mostly just exhausted. And then I went to work. It was draining. I had very little help; I looked after Casey most of the time and studied the rest of it. I hit the books at every opportunity and, relatively quickly, had the necessary knowledge to make Casey a fully fledged paper person-birth certificate and all, with my name proudly displayed. The only other name. 

I must admit, I didn't transform immediately. We still needed money, then more than ever — formula and diapers, school trips and text books, they add up! So I was still...less than saintly, but I came clean as soon as I got my first internship (unpaid) and supported us by doing odd-jobs around the office.

My drive clearly paid off. You can look at us now; Casey has started upper school— private, thank you very much, none of that common crap that I grew up on— and I am currently the strongest candidate for partner in the entire law firm. None of the others have my hunger, my reason. I should be head partner by the time Casey goes to college.

I specialise in family law, close to my heart, for obvious reasons; I do a lot of pro bono work for disadvantaged girls, girls who could do great things if only society would look through their criminal past. 
This morning, Tim (my colleague) handed me a case ""built for me"". Tracey Wilson, 34, a runaway youth turned florist. Had a baby at the blossoming age of 22, but, with the street world of drugs and crime whirling in her head, lost the baby.
No, the child didn't die; the mother lost her. Weak and wretched, pathetically she had been unable (or unwilling) to keep the girl form being taken form her.
The woman had hired a private detective—when she finally had the money— to help her track down the child that had become a phantom, another's reality. Now, though nebulous, the detective has some information to go on and Tracey is seeking legal help in the hope of the day she sees the girl that never was, in the hope of taking her.

Now, I swallow thickly as I read her file once more. This is impossibly hard. The photograph (presumably included to garner sympathy) echoes back to me through the years. Sure, her eyes are more sunken, her hair limper and her face more worn (a contrast to my full features and fresh skin, in spite of the age difference), but I can remember the reflection of our situation. I can see, from above, the pathetic wretch on the floor of that stale warehouse, young face wracked with pain and tired delirium. I can see that bundle of bloody rags cupped to her belly; I can see the flash of the bone handled knife my Grandad gave me for Christmas, can see the glint as it cuts the tentative cord of blood. I can hear her feeble screams as she looses; looses blood, looses a life.

I feel vaguely sick. I look at the gap-toothed grin of Casey, beaming out at me from her frame on my desk. The grin that's been the glory of my life for 12 years.

I look back at the file in my hands. I don't know how I'm going to do this— but I have to take this case."

It was a run of the mill development job... using agile development, they were assigned tickets and used java programming skills to fix all problems and create solutions to make a program that ran on google play devices. Pretty cool stuff. I pretty much saw that and knew I wanted to be in java development. 

Now that I'm graduated and started working my first job, I'm having some weird thoughts. My job works with the Java language and creating software for the recording industry(titles, land deeds, etc.). I don't know exactly if this is what I want to be doing. The line of work seems boring but I feel I could gain a lot of experience with databases and SQL working this job. But the content is just soooo boring to me. I am still in the training phase. 

If I want to continue being a Java developer, should I tough it out? Or continue to go through the training so I can see A. If I like this job more and/or B.

4tzgjs,2,2016-07-21,Seeing a trend of low-paying jobs. Culture fit problem with companies that pay decently?,lowpayjobber,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4tzgjs/seeing_a_trend_of_lowpaying_jobs_culture_fit/,"I live in the midwest, and locally, new grads here typically get $55k-$65k a year to start in software engineering. I never took any internships, started with $12/hr eight years ago, and most recently I made $50k annualized as a contractor with no benefits. Word out there says that, because juniors typically make $55k, I should be pushing at least $90k because of my experience. 

Right now I have one offer lined up, but it's only $30/hr, again as a contractor. Even though they don't pay benefits either, the employer finds it hard to consider bumping me it up to even $35/hr. It's weird that I am not seeing the salary perks that most software engineers are enjoying.

I'm not a frequent job hopper, but I do end up spending time unemployed in between jobs, usually due to sudden company layoffs. When I get offers they're always low paying ones that don't offer any sort of additional compensation beyond contract work or a stipend. 

So basically I have gone over 7 years without saving any retirement funds, and without health insurance. How do I get the bigger, fortune-500-ish companies to blow up my phone to give me those great comp packages and all that jazz? I'm starting to think it could be a culture fit problem, since I have never worked at any place with more than 100 employees."

I've been self taught for the last year, and since my resume isn't terribly impressive, and this is the only real CS job bite I've gotten in the last three months of looking. It's a pay cut, but possibly the opportunity to learn different technologies of the company... maybe. I've tried asking the recruiter what exactly is a reports developer, and I haven't gotten any hard answers, yet. Just ""HTML and JavaScript"" From what I've looked up online, i see there might be SQL needed, which i have zero experience.  I have an interest in QA and automation testing, just haven't pursued it.

So my question is:

1) should i bite and be grateful for the opportunity, take the pay cut from my current non-CS position and view it as an internship, gaining experience [i can take the salary hit, its only a minor consideration]


2) will I be pigeonholed as a ""reports developer"" and have to make this my career? Is this a good launching point to JAVA / RUBY / flavor of the month language. Or what other careers might I be able to look forward to using this as a start?


3) how painful will this be not having any experience in this sort of position at first? i'm very adaptive to change, but I'm sure i'm going to feel really dumb for the first few weeks. I've been repeatedly told this is an entry-level position and room to move up if i'm coach-able.

I recently found this sub and it scared me a little bit to be honest. It seems like I have not made best decision regarding career. I worked part-time QA job while at university and now have an internship at a big bank in London. They are not using in-demand tech though(Perl) so it is a bit disheartening to me. Also, I am envious of finding out the money US, Australian companies pay to developers and was thinking to seek fortune there. However, I am not a hot rockstar engineer like a lot of people in this sub reporting being paid that much, so was considering to maximize opportunities in Europe.

I admit that as a new grad, my concern of pay should be secondary to the experience and growth provided by the company. I was looking at most popular software companies like Google, Amazon but honestly, at the moment, could not hack their interviews if my life depended on it. The questions seem hard and from this sub, I found resources like CTCI &amp; EPL books as a source of practice. I looked at some Leetcode problems and can hardly solve any medium/hard problems.

What steps can I take, besides preparing for technical interviews to maximize my chances of pay/experience at a company? For pay, Switzerland or Germany seems better options. One is more expensive but pays more than UK and the other pays less but cost of living is also a lot less than, say London. Regarding experience, the former seems to have mostly banks and companies like Google, whose interviews I cannot hack atm(and not sure if I could in the future) and Germany with tons of less known companies. I am also considering going back to my home country(central Europe) because it is not bad to work in IT there but I and my parents spent a lot of money to study in UK and I need to maximize my pay in order to repay them. I would prefer to not stay in UK though because I am tired of it + Brexit uncertainty."

So I am currently a International Business student and I have to do my internship in about 2 months. I have got two job offers; one at one of the biggest corporations in the world, and one at a small/medium sized company in the home country of my girlfriend.

Some background info:
We met (in RL, not online) and have been together for almost half a year now. We met in a country where we were both studying for half a year (exchange). We separated our ways but decided to try this from LD. We were looking into opportunities for me to live/work in her country, so I started looking for internships there. I found one, had a job interview and got an offer.

The other job offer is in my home country. So, far away from her (±12 flying).

Now I have to make a life-changing decision.. Go work there and live with this amazing girl that I love so much, or go for the opportunity to work for one of the biggest companies in the world. Financially the option to live with her will increase my study debts (compared to the other option), but I am willing to make that sacrifice.

Any advice?.."

4u3lsi,1,2016-07-22,I'm 22 and I'm feeling like I'm never going to amount to anything,Brisholine,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4u3lsi/im_22_and_im_feeling_like_im_never_going_to/,"My whole life I've been average. Went through school just getting C's, struggled to graduate college with a 2.5 GPA, always made the B teams in sports (hated sports anyways), have never gotten 1^st place in anything, I've never won anything except a bunch of Pokémon plushies at Burger King one time but my parents gave them away.

Sometimes I feel like I'm trying too hard or that I care too much and it's having an opposite affect on me. I try not to overdo it but I end up overdoing it anyways.

I also just graduated college with a degree in computer science and haven't gotten a single job offer. I started applying during my sophomore year for anything at all and I couldn't even get an internship. I have no work experience to my name except a crappy high school job which means nothing to employers. I've had at least 10-20 interviews since I began applying so it's not even a resume issue, employers just don't like me.

The worst part is that I decided to pick one of the most naive dream jobs I could have chosen, game developer. I bet right now you're facepalming or cringing, believe me I'm right there with you. The only problem is nothing else interests me and I don't feel like I'd be happy anywhere else. I'm aware my chances are pretty much less than 1% and even if I get into it I'll be worked to the bone then fired. However, absolutely nothing else interests me. I'm 22 and still haven't found anything to replace my dream job. I've even taken it a step further and developed my own personal game just to make sure I was actually interested in it.

So now that I've told you my life story I should explain why I think I'm never going to amount to anything. Lately I've been on a bit of a history binge. I took a computer architecture course for my last semester which was essentially computer history. Every important figure we learned about was already doing important things either right out college or sometimes even before. I've also been watching documentaries and again and again the successful ones were already on their path to success in their early 20s.

I have no path, I've searched for it as hard as I could but it's like I'm lost deep in the jungle or out in the middle of sea with no land in sight. I just want to be happy and do something important with my life. I'm not in it for the money or anything like that, I'm just sick of being only average.

Also I completely understand being average sometimes is perfectly okay. But the keyword there is **sometimes** and in my case it's all the time.

I try to surround myself with influential material. I follow YouTube channels that cover topics in my field. I'm on /r/programming, /r/gamedev, anything else related to what I want to be better at. I've done projects in my spare time, I've made an app, I've even made a game. However, I feel like I'm not making any progress. In fact I rarely understand any of the YouTube channels, subreddits, even the stuff I've made. I basically stacked multiple tutorials on top of each other for the things I've made. I hardly even understood the stuff when I was learning about it in college.

If there's anything I'm sure of it's that I'm most likely going to end up working at McDonald's and rot the rest of my life away. Often times I feel like I would be better off just ending it because I'm just going to end up a failure anyways.

I'm sorry that my thoughts are pretty scattered in my post. I've just been holding a lot in and it just kind of all came out at once. I'm just desperate for some guidance or advice."
4u3stn,7,2016-07-22,Choosing University,KaanFresh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4u3stn/choosing_university/,"Hey Everyone !

I'm 20 y.o guy who lives in Turkey. After 2 years of adventure* I joined University Entrance Exam (something like SAT in U.S) and next tuesday I need to choose a university. with my grade from the Exam I have 2 options:

* Istanbul Kultur University - Computer Engineering (Private)
* Karabuk University - Computer Engineering (Public)

I cannot decide, so I will write their pros/cons and seek for your opinions.

Firstly, **Istanbul Kultur University** :

This University as you can understand from its name located in Istanbul, Turkey. Unofficial capital of Turkey and maybe world itself. (according to Napoleon Bonaparte) IKU is private university which you need pay. Fee's are approx. 32.000,00 Turkish Liras but due to my Exam Grade I have %50 scholarship. If I write IKU at the first place of the list (You send a list to examination center for which universities would you like to go.) I'll get +15% scholarship from university. With the taxes and everything it's around 13.000 Turkish Liras for the school. 

I live in another city so I need to find somewhere to stay. University has a dorm but it's expensive. You need to pay 7.7 thousand liras for 10 months (1 Education year) to stay. I've found some houses 650 Liras per month studio flat. All bills etc included to rent.

Even tho it's expensive there are some good things to consider. It's really huge city. Official population is 14.03 million people but true population is approx 19-20 million people. There are lots of companies, many place to work, places to have fun. So many opportunities. I can work while I study or it will be a LOT more easy to find internship.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Karabuk University** :

[Wiki Page For Karabuk City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karab%C3%BCk)

University is new, founded in 2007. 2 of my friends are studies there. As far as I know city is too small, there is nothing to do. Locals are strong conservative people. I do not know what to tell because city is small and I've seen lots of people who hates this school (alumni). Only thing about this school is you do not pay for anything. I've found a nice super luxury flat (as they say :P) near school. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I do not know which one should I choose. Actually I really want IKU but I cannot decide whether it's worth to study with all of difficulties about finance. I do not want to push hard my dad. (BTW he earns 4000 lira per month if there is anyone who'll do the math.)  

Also I have two cousin. Both of them Software Developer. Big brother used to work in Microsoft at Seattle/Washington, now he started to work in Snapchat in Cali. Other brother used to work at CERN/Switzerland, few weeks he'll be moving to Canada to work at Amazon. I really love and admire both them. They're saying me that go which university you want. ""Important thing is how you improve yourself while you study."" they said to me. I know this, I've been working hard for 3-4 months for learning programming. I know that I can not do another job. I'm determined about this. It's my childhood dream. Not hacking or gaming. My dream was create something or make something better.

Please give me your opinion guys. It's more than important.

Thanks."

Never done this before but please bear with me: I am a recent college grad who just turned 24 male and live in Chicago. I studied marketing and international business. I specialized in sales and began my sales career 1 month after graduating. I am good at sales due to my training and personality but I have been through 3 jobs already and I am pretty sure I hate sales. I started as a recruiter for an IT staffing company and making 70 cold calls a day; it was mind numbing for me. I appreciate how hard other recruiters work and it is not an easy job but every day I was having an existential crisis sitting there calling people. I left on good terms just said it was not for me and they let me call it an internship which was nice. I then sold a database for a start up and did really well. I always beat my quota but I hated sitting on the phone making cold calls all day it was boring and I would never commit more then 8 hours a day then run for the door. I left there 5 months in only because they went back on their word for my commissions and I couldn't even pay rent with how little they were giving me (contracts are important, I know that now). Which leads me to now where I am a Marketing Director for a building that provides care for the disabled. I like doing the different tasks and cold calling doesn't bother me as long as I do not have to do it every single day non-stop. I like parts of my job but I am not money hungry enough and sometimes I wish I was because I would put more effort into my work.
I feel like I need a job that is a little more analytical and less repetition if something else exists. I have been trying to figure out what I should be doing and I am looking for any advice out there. According to Myers Briggs which I heard is overrated and I try not to put too much stock into it but I am an ENFP personality even though I am an ambivert or between the introvert/extrovert classification. I am thinking about going back to school to get a masters in business analytics which I could complete in 1 year and would lead me into the IT world. I justify this decision because I could still be more on the client facing side and not purely working with the coding/database admin which I know that I would probably hate. Also it would be a secure and high paying field and I know I am bright enough to work with the technology and hopefully leverage my skill set to positions that are not 60 hour work weeks. I just want to make decent money and to feel somewhat secure because I do have a medical condition that could some day take me out of the workforce. Which is potentially losing my eyesight. Here are some more fun facts about me which may help:
- I am a prolific reader (Faulkner-Dostoyevsky) I read the news and articles religiously. I love random information and could read random subreddits all day
- I am good at connecting/socializing with most people 
-I am quick on my feet and can come up with answers quickly which helped me in sales 
- I am not detail oriented ( I try to be but I just miss things)
-I am getting more organized but still not pretty. I do not forget appointments.
-I like to have a plan but I would rather go with the flow then freak out over every little step and action
- I can talk but I enjoy listening to people. Everyone has a story and if you want something from someone the only way you will get it is by listening to them to find what they need.

I am kind of at a loss because I feel that I should be more passionate about what I should go into but I am studying for the GRE which the school accepts. I am taking the GRE also just in case another masters program appeals to me. 

Do you guys have any advice? opinions?

Please forgive me for any grammar mistakes as I said I am not the most detail oriented person. Thanks guys.

I did extremely well in my first few courses. I chose the degree based on practicality, but because of a lack of interest and passion I began slacking off. I am clever enough to do well enough on exams and get decent grades, but because of this I haven't learned much since my lower-division courses.

I have not done an internship yet. I am graduating early (3 years vs 4 and do not have the option of staying longer) and I decided on my major late, so I was using my summers to fulfill degree requirements. I don't have much practice in coding as my most recent classes have been theoretical. My upcoming courses are of the same nature.

I am completely lost and unsure of how to move forward from here. I have just picked up a personal project but I'm moving extremely slow and have many dumb questions, but don't know where to ask them. I don't see myself programming in the long-term, only as a means to pay off my debt and get me started off before I move on to something that I am more passionate about.

I have a competitive GPA but I know I will do poorly on any coding interviews. Any advice on how I can become a proficient programmer and a competitive recruit would be great. I have basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms. And limited knowledge of Python and Java."

4u5fwu,1,2016-07-22,Need advice on majors/student loans,collegehelp16,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4u5fwu/need_advice_on_majorsstudent_loans/,"I'll try and make this post as short as I can. Sorry if it seems jumbled. I'm going to talk to a school counselor about all of it, but I'd love any kind of advice I can get.

I'm 23 (F) and have been at a community college for the past almost 4 years. I was at a religious university that I disliked for a few semesters and ended up failing my freshman year. I come from a poor family, but my mom recently remarried and now I don't qualify for financial aid as my step dad makes too much money. He does not help pay for my schooling and I don't expect him to. My mom gives me a set $600 / semester which only equates to 2 classes + books. I throw in what money I can after my own bills, so I've only been able to take 3 classes per semester. I'm going to try and look into student loans so any advice on that would be helpful, too.

I was set on becoming a nursing major when I started college, took the prereqs for it and then decided it wasn't a good fit. Since then, I've been struggling on picking a good major. The problem is, given my poor GPA (2.6) and money issues I'm planning on not transferring to a 4 year. I know an associates degree will not open many doors, if any, but I don't want all of these factors to hold me back from continuing my education. I lost hope and decided to go to a very cheap trade school for dental assisting this summer and it doesn't feel like the best fit for me either, so I want to continue what I was doing at my CC. However, I'm glad I'm taking the dental classes because it can serve as a backup if I ever needed it. The truth is, I have pretty bad anxiety that I need to have checked out. Being in a healthcare job comes with a lot of responsibility and honestly, working that close (in another person's mouth) is very nerve-wracking for me. I didn't realize it until I started taking the dental courses and working as an intern. I felt the need to point this out because I think it weighs heavily on the kind of job that would be best for me. Another big factor is my fiancé's job can take us to any city in the future, big or small. I would need to find a career that can work with that kind of plan.

My list of potential majors:
. English (or Journalism)
. Business (Marketing/Small Business Entrepreneurship)
. Communications
. Psychology 
. Early Childhood Education
. Kinesiology (or physical therapist assistant)

I know those choices are all over the place, but I can see myself in a career pertaining to any of those listed majors. I have many different interests. I've always had a love for writing and am pretty good at it. If I decide to go the English/Journalism path I have great connections at my local 4 year university. The same goes for the Kinesiology route. Though, I don't know of any schools that offer a physical therapy assistant program. I'm considering business because I've always been told it's a good degree to have. I also knit and create small things such as candles, bookmarks, and jewelry that I'd one day like to sell, so business may help me gain more knowledge with that. I'm also very interested in photography and have been told that getting a degree in business would be better than one focused on photography. Psychology is still listed up there although the amount of schooling I would need turns me off to it. Early Childhood Education is another one I'm considering because I work well with kids and if I decide to not go to a 4 year I could still find a job, though I understand it won't be a good paying one. 

Again, sorry if this post is jumbled! Hopefully I explained my situation clearly. Any advice would be extremely appreciated."

I've seen a colleague not make it past the hiring process for Riot Games and go on to intern at Google, but I'm hoping there are many people who can prove this wrong."

Do you guys have any ideas as to what I could do to maximize my time during the month? Suggestions here could apply to any student in CS/SE with free time. I'm sure there have been other threads like this in the past, but I would definitely like a new perspective on this!

A few obvious ideas that come to mind, please do tell me if they seem like they should *not* be a priority:

* Contribute to open source projects *(but how do I find these projects? how do I become someone whose code can be trusted within a short period of time?)*
* Work on personal projects *(doing this right now but it's definitely tough to come up with ideas)*
* Work on personal projects in programming languages I'm not exposed to! Also use different libraries/frameworks in known languages.
* **Really want to do this one:** get more experience with distributed systems *(Not sure how to approach this one as I have zero experience)*
* Answer questions on Stack Overflow *(this one I'm a little iffy about)*
* Build my own website that would serve as a resume and potential blog
* Get better at technical interviews

I'll try to keep this list updated if the thread takes off!"

**Work Experience**

* Internet Page - Director of a publishing website in Spanish and Portuguese delivering over 60 million page views per month (up from 6,000 views per month total when I started), as well as reaching 20 million people a week on Facebook. Job duties include all aspects of running a major publishing page, with strategic decision making for development (front and back end), content (text and video), advertising, and social media being primary day to day responsibilities. To put it simply, aside from actually writing the code and stories, I do everything else for the website. I manage about 25 employees total in LATAM (primarily Brazil and Argentina, where I travel to frequently).

* Soccer Marketing - Worked with family in creating marketing decks for sponsors wishing to be part of a major soccer event. Within that, I additionally utilized the overlap in audiences for the event and website to develop interesting projects that can create recorded actions online for sponsors - something traditional billboard advertising has difficulty in generating. I can expand on other actions I have done here if necessary.

* Farm - Assisted in the planning and realization of a family farm. This included deciding on animals to raise, how to sell goods, the type of goods to produce aside from beef/poultry/pork, services we could offer outside of purely raising animals (hunts, etc), and other facets of running a farm (primarily financial-related).

* General Store - Needing an outlet for the farm's produce, we rented out an abandoned storefront in a local town. This allowed the farm some leeway in the form of vertical integration and developed a sales channel for our goods. Currently working on increasing average customer spending and generating greater margins as well as increasing sales in non-perishable and compact goods. This and the farm together are generating over 500k/year

* PWM Firm - Summer Analyst for PWM Firm, received training on investment philosophy as well as tailored investment portfolios.


**Extra-Curricular**

* Compete in Powerlifting (Next competition in November, current maxes of 455/345/545 on S/B/DL)

* Racing (Attending Bondurant after R1 applications go through)

* Scuba Diving

* Free Diving/Spear Fishing

* Target Shooting

* Sports (Football/Volleyball/Basketball)


**University - Top 20 School**

* BS in International Economics

* Recipient of competitive Honors Certificate (competing with Master's and MBA students)

* 2011 Sports League Honor Roll Certificate

* Member of University Football Team (D1)

* Winner of weight class in Regional Powerlifting Meet (2010)

* Co-Captain of Club Volleyball Team

* Member of Collegiate Investors Club


**High School - (Irrelevant for the application, but some info may be pertinent to an essay I write)**

* Intern at Goldman Sachs at 17

* Captain of Basketball and Volleyball Teams

* Treasurer and VP of National Honor Society


**Race/Nationality** - White/USA - Dual Citizen, however, with a non-Brexit EU Nation


**Stats**

* GMAT - Only took BASELINE prep test, this was without study, so I have room to improve. 710, 45Q, 41V, 8IR. Goal is 750+ by September 15th.

* Undergrad GPA - 3.2  (mediocre, I'm being fair here, and I identify this as the weakest part of my application. The average econ degree during my time was a 2.9-3.0 due to the curve only allowing 10-15% of students per class to receive A's, but that is irrelevant. My GPA is the main reason why my current goal for the GMAT is a 750 or higher)


**Goal of MBA**

* Network, Learn, Absorb - I really want to go to the West Coast as a goal for my MBA as working with Technology in any facet has been my calling. I've taken basic HTML/CSS and Comp Sci classes (the latter from EdX), and even since my time working at Goldman as a high schooler I was in the Technology department. Ideally I'd like to sell the website I run and get into technology consulting, because I worked a few times with people who were absolute geniuses and had amazing products but were myopic in how they approached bringing it to market and its true functionality. Also working with people smarter than me is always inspirational. Sounds silly but it gets me working.

* Target Schools - H/S, Sloan, Haas, Tuck, in that order.

It's great and the users are just... well they're funny let's tune into my first week story shall we? 

Our story beings with me doing some manual labor, as the new intern I totally get it and no issues with that, I'm the FNG. I hear $coworker on the phone with  $user and I'm asked to go do some intern stuff (trash needed thrown away needed some stuff moved etc) and after an hour I return to see that  $coworker is still on the phone with  $user. Finally $coworker ends the call and promptly shuts down his pc in a brief fit of rage. 

$boss: did you just shut off your pc because you're f***ing pissed?

$coworker: yup I have to go on site to fix the issue and I think this will take a while.

$boss: ok well take hdmibunny with you 

Fast forward to us sitting in the car

$me: so what happened?

$coworker: well these people are crazy cheap wouldn't let me sell them a new switch. And now they want us to figure out where their ethernet cable went to.

$me: they lost their ethernet cable?

$coworker: I asked $user to unplug the cable from their switch and plug it back in the router to bypass their switch but $user said it disappeared.

We arrive on site and meet $user, a sweet elderly lady working out of our client's building. Sure enough the ethernet cable was plugged Into her pc.... but when we looked at the router it wasn't there. Their  ISP had fished the wall to get the cables down neatly and so I popped my head up above the ceiling tiles and I realized what had happened. When the internet service provider ran the client's ethernet cable they ran it an extra 200 feet to one side the building and then brought it straight back to the office where this lady works instead of plugging it directly into their router. When $user unplugged the ethernet cable it flew right back up the wall into the ceiling.Our solution? Plug in a cable from the computer to the router that was literally 15 feet away on the other side of the room.

TLDR: User says Ethernet cable vanished and it literally did. Cable was so tightly snug that it flew right up the wall and into the ceiling."

I am currently a math major, and far into it, but have come to realize that a math major on its own provides little value on its own but a lot of value when coupled with something else that is analytical. I took AP computer science in high school, got a 5 on the test, and was able to code some simple games in Java. 

By some miracle this summer I got a software engineering internship through a professor at my school, but it is unpaid and the company understands I have very little programming experience. As a result, they don't really have me coding; instead they had me go through a crash course in machine learning, which I am now using to help them with image processing (as much as I can help). 

But as a result over the summer I haven't been getting any better at writing code. My skills in Java are super rusty. To review basic principles I went through the Codeacademy course in Python, which I found very easy; things like classes, loops, conditionals, etc came back easily. Still, though, I feel so weak in my programming that I feel like I can't really create anything USEFUL or interesting.

I am taking a class in C++ and a class in algorithms and data structures in Java next semester. When do you all think I can say, as a student, that these languages are skills of mine, ie when is it resume worthy? How much more would I have to do with python beyond codeacademy to make it resume worthy? I don't want to oversell or undersell myself, and it is causing me a lot of anxiety.

My school requires a 3.2 GPA to be in the CS program and mine was around a 2.7(thanks physics and calc) for a while and I could not get it to 3.2 so my advisors recommended I move to another technical major that doesn't have a GPA requirement and I would be able to still become a software developer just won't be a CS major. So I moved to Geographical Information Science, which is like mapping and topology. And I'm pursuing a minor in Computer Science. 

This year I planned on going to my school's job fair and applying everywhere and really working on some personal projects on Github, but I feel like I'm not going to get any offers. I know I have potential to get some offers in the GIS field(which I do think is interesting) but I do not see myself doing that for the rest of my career like programming. I currently know Java really well and have made some smaller projects in other languages. But I still fear if I can even make it to an interview they are going to ask me why I'm not a CS major and the fact my GPA is low is going to turn them off from me.

Does anyone have any advice in getting a CS internship without a CS major?"

It's been 3 months since I graduated and I have no real luck or good leads yet.

As for experience, I had 2 internships and plenty of school projects on: C#/.NET, ASP.net, C++/Java/OOP, Python (server scripting, networking, and plenty of assignments), HTML/CSS/Javascript/jQuery, SQL and noSQL queries/modeling/stored procedures (and tons of related Excel stuff too), Git/TFS, etc.  Both website development and desktop application development.  I am not the most amazing coder of all time, I suck at design and have zero artistic creativity admittedly, but I am personable and well spoken in real life and would like to think I am good to work with in a team.

I've applied now to 70+ places, government, small business, megacorp, academia, and everything in between.  For both web developer and software developer positions.  And that number just keeps growing every day. I usually do only about 2-3 a day, but tailor my resume keywords and cover letter if needed to each one, making the application look great.  Have had my resume reviewed and critiqued by multiple hiring managers in the IT industry, as well as friends of parents who are professionals and well into their career, the resume is professional looking and I know the keywords are getting picked up correctly.  

Most of the entry level and junior developer type of positions I am finding seem to want a lot more experience than I have (3-5 years in enterprise level software, tools that I don't have access to, etc), and I'm not sure how to gain that experience without a job.  My skills are falling behind the times as the days go on, so it's critical that I find a software job soon or my skills will become ""stale"".  Recruiters have told me that I'm competing with other recent grads from the same program that have more experience than me or are just better coders and have a ton of projects on GitHub.  Kind of scary.  It seems that having the degree doesn't matter at all and people just need a superman coder with tons of experience in all of these things I've never done.  

I have CTCI and work through that occasionally, but honestly I am usually pretty okay in technical interviews and solving hard problems. Definitely going to try to keep up with my coding speed and accuracy since I haven't worked on any big projects in a few months.  

My dad is currently supporting me, so I don't need to get a part time job, but I feel bad for not contributing and feeling unsure of what I'm doing currently (applying for jobs somewhat repetitively every day and not getting anywhere).  **Should I focus my time on applying for more development jobs and practicing my coding, or should I grab a part time job to fill in the work history gap on my resume.**  

For example, I was thinking about pizza delivery driver, since that pays decent and I have access to a reliable but old car which needs to be driven into the ground, plus would give me time to still apply to dev jobs and practice coding.  I spent quite a few hours looking at freelancing jobs on UpWork, but honestly I didn't find much there that fit me or I was just getting beat out by other candidates who probably bid for a cheaper price, felt like I was wasting time there.  Alternatively, I was thinking about looking for administrative assistant, tech support, or desk jockey type of jobs at companies where I could lateral into a software dev type of position after they see that I'm smart and skilled in software and have a degree.

I'm stuck, I'm spinning my wheels and not sure of what to do.  Halp.  "

-He (my boss) is also my friend (or at least I think he is.)
-This whole payment thing was completely under the table. No paperwork or anything, just a promise that he'd pay me twice a week when he could afford it.
-I already posted about this in /r/business, but I don't feel like I went into close enough detail, so I'm trying again.

I'm a 15 year old computer tech intern in Ohio ""interning"" for a local computer repair shop. I'll call my boss Jim. I've been working at the shop with Jim for about 1 and a half years. At the beginning of this summer he said that he would pay me around 60 bucks a week (not much, I know, but to me it's better than nothing.) Well, so far I don't have anything.

Whenever I try to discuss the issue with him, he either postpones it, cracks a joke to distract me, or simply puts his hand on his head and sighs like I'm the nexus of all his woes. From this I assumed he was just manipulative and got over it, but now I'm broke and extremely pissed. Before I was afraid to go against him in fear that it would fuck up our friendship, but now I don't care.

To sum things up, I've fixed easily over 100 PCs, flattened all of the boxes in his storage closet multiple times, gone with him on several service calls, nearly had his asshole friend throw a bar stool at me, and have taken customer support calls for him. Not a dime came out of any of that. No, I never got hurt, nor did I get threatened, but this emotional rollercoaster is starting to seriously fuck me up. Any advice is appreciated"
4u9jkb,1,2016-07-23,need advice on job.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4u9jkb/need_advice_on_job/,"For clarification on flair: I am considering leaving this job, but wanted more advice to see if it's the right thing.

So ~4 months ago I got my first job and it ended up being the last type of job I wanted. A restaurant job. The reason I took the job is because after 6 months, what feels like 1000 applications and interviews later, I was offered the job on the spot. The work itself is jist running food, cleaning, restocking, etc. so the actual work is not all that bad.

The first couple months were ok. The last 2 months though I have dreaded going in to work and have to fight this urge to quit every day I go in. The main reason I think would be my coworkers. I would safely say more than half of them are generally bad people to put it very lightly. I get yelled at and scolded my coworkers every day for stupid reasons. They also put you down all the time. When someone works lots of overtime and works really hard the first thing you hear is ""that's nothing"". Way to make each other feel good and want to stay. Also the place is incredibly loud. We have this DJ that comes in at night when I work(I cant get any hours other than night because it's not busy during day, I tried) and he turns up his music so loud I can't hear anyone unless they are within an inch of my face. This has lead to customers yelling at me for not being able to hear them, and the same with coworkers.

I also had surgery one time and I called in work and emailed my manager multiple times saying I could not come in for medical reasons, leaving messages and so on each time. he finally responded and accused me of never contacting him earlier. To be fair though the other managers are nice.

I always countered these things with ""I'm 18, any job I get at this age will probably be just as crappy"". Recently though I have been looking into minor positions in child care or camp positions because I have some volunteer experience in those areas. At my current job I have talked to my manager and we switched some hours up to see if it would fit better with me(I admire him for that) but it's not relieving my current attitude of borderline hating my job. In addition to all this I am starting college next month and have looked into their programs with finding internships that match with my degree choice but I won't qualify for it until sophomore year.

Sorry for the long post, I just felt all this info was important. I guess it comes down to should I stick it out at my current job or find a new job?

I tried asking this questions elsewhere and the comments I got basically called me lazy and whiny, no advice on actually how to improve the situation. So please provide advice and not do what they did. I am really trying to find ways to improve things, not just complaining about them."
4u9q3k,12,2016-07-23,"How do I choose between an assured technician position with the possibility of promotion to an engineering position, or an interview for an engineering position?",blueskiddoo,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4u9q3k/how_do_i_choose_between_an_assured_technician/,"Background: I graduated with my BS in mechanical engineering in June of last year. I moved to a city a couple states away for a six month long internship. When that ended, the company didn't have any openings, so I've been job hunting since, for the last four-ish months. During that time, my savings have gotten low and recently decided I needed to get some sort of basic job just to pay the bills.  

With that in mind, while still applying to entry-level engineering jobs, I also started applying to slightly skilled labor positions. On the engineering side, earlier this week I had a phone screen for a Jr. engineering position that went well, and they said that they would let me know next week if I would be selected for an in-person interview. However, I'm not the most qualified for the position (they wanted 1-3 years of experience in that specific field, I have .5 years of experience in a similar but different field). A few days after that, I had an in-person interview for a technician position that paid slightly above minimum wage, but promised raises soon after starting. However, during the interview the interviewer mentioned my engineering degree on my resume, and said that while he couldn't give me an engineering position now, if I worked hard and did well on the production floor, really learned the product inside and out, I could move into an engineering position. And he assured me that the company was growing quickly, they recognize hard work, and that all departments would be increasing in size. And then at the end of the interview, he offered me the technician position. I thanked him, and let him know that I was waiting to hear back from another company, and asked if I could have a week to decide and get back to him. He agreed, and thanked me for coming. 

So here's my question: How should I handle this situation? As a recent graduate with not much experience, low on money and options, I really have to make a decision here. Obviously, the manufacturing position could chose to move forward with other candidates, which would make my choice easy. But if they do want to do an in person interview, what should I do? (Keeping in mind that according to Glassdoor the interview process with this company takes about 6 weeks, and I'm still in week 1). Do I; 

1) Tell the technician position that I'm moving forward with the manufacturing position, which will probably lose me the technician position? This path seems risky because obviously if the interview doesn't go well I would end up where I started, with nothing.

2) Just go with the technician position anyways and hope for the best? The pay isn't great, and while I was promised the possibility of promotion, that's a promise at best and I can't rely on that.

So please give me what advice you can, I'm really not enjoying being in this position. I think either way I go could lead to a great career, or to things just going poorly. In hindsight I wish I had pushed the technician interview back a week to buy myself some time with the other company, but of course I didn't know that there would be the engineering possibility or that I would be offered a job in the interview. And I don't mind hard work, I've had labor jobs before and honestly I enjoy it, but at the same time I would prefer to be making 2.5 times the money and growing my engineering career."

This series is made for someone who is at that level or has had some other kind of equivalent introduction to java. This game programming tutorial is not made to teach you java but is made to teach you game design and some different programming practices involved with game design....and java along the way.

I decided to upload all of the lessons I had so far into one video and then for anybody who cares about them, I can upload more of whatever they want. So be sure to comment on the video if you actually go through this! It would be awesome if you could recommend this to your friends who want to get into game dev but don't quite know where to start!

If you have already had any decent level of experience with game dev/made a complete game before then this is definitely not for you btw! This is for people who are just getting into the practice after any basic java course/introduction."

Once I went over to the retirement and aksed them if they know about the lady screaming. They said they are aware of the situation and find it sweet that I care about the woman. She is suffering from dementia, has been to the hospital recently and has difficulties to realign. They know about her. They can not do very much about her. I left then.

I once made an internship in a retirement home when I was 13 for three weeks. I know this a very hard job and the team is often unde-staffed. But even if everything with body of the woman is okay it appears to me that she feel scared or is suffering. I don’t know what do about it. 

* Should I insist they should check more often for her and take her serious? 
* Shall I offer my help? Should I ask if I can visit her once or a regular basis?
* Maybe she has relatives. Can I contact them?

Does it sound like negligence to you? Or is it the sad but inevitable face of dementia?"

I graduated from UCI in June of 2015 with a BS in Computer Science with a 3.39 GPA. (I finished the degree in 3 years) 

**Experience**

* I currently work at AT&amp;T as a Software Engineeron their Recommendation Engine.

* Before that I had interned for 3 months at Thales Avionics as a Software Engineering Intern, where I spear-headed the re-design of their data transformation pipelines to use a full distributed Hadoop cluster

* During my university career I worked for 2 years as the Lead Desktop Support Staff, managing the deployment and maintenance of campus-wide computers. 

**Senior Projects**

* A Netflix-like e-comerce web application, Fabflix, where users could create profiles, purchase movies, and browse a manually curated catalogue of over 5000 films.

* A course notes sharing platform, NoteShare, where authenticated students and faculty could create profiles and online class rooms for students to share class notes and have an informal forum to help plan and coordinate study sessions and homework help. 

I have unfortunately have not had the chance to take other courses at Coursera or Udacity, if that is a important factor, though I have expanded my skill set through the completion of several Lynda.com courses.

In terms of letters of Recommendation, I am not in touch with my core professors or my former colleagues though my instructor for my Senior Project (the e-comerce website) has graciously agreed to write a letter of recommendation for me. 

Also what are they looking for in the background and SOP. As in, what is the prompt or what are we trying to convey to them via it? Should I go in to technical detail about my previous work and projects or are they looking for something more aligned with me describing my passion about Computer Science?

Also I know the deadline is in September am I fine if I turn in my application by next weekend? And the people recommending me have until Sept to turn them in right? Should I put that I am interested in pursuing a Ph.D.? even though this is not a research/thesis based program?

Some of my key university courses:
Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CS 161)
Network Systems (EECS 148)
Information Retrieval and Data Mining (CS 121)
Machine Learning and Data Mining (CS 178)
Project in Databases and Web Applications (CS 122B)
Principles in Operating Systems (CS 143A)
Concept Programming Languages (CS 141)
Principles in System Design (ICS 53)
Discrete Mathematics (ICS 6D)
Linear and Boolean Algebra (ICS 6N / ICS 6B)
Database Management Systems (CS 122A)
Projects in Human Computer Interaction (INF 134)

4ubwzy,9,2016-07-24,"Graduated, can't find a job in finance, and now I don't know what to do.",yxkns,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4ubwzy/graduated_cant_find_a_job_in_finance_and_now_i/,"I'm a recently graduated business admin and finance graduate from a fairly decent state school. I completed my degree hoping to somehow break into the finance field or work in consulting. During my schooling I made significant effort to show my interest by contributing in a lot of extracurricular finance activities, competitions, and by networking.

Most finance and consulting jobs are elite, incredibly competitive, and have a time table for hiring. After applying for a bunch of jobs I started feeling like I'll never get anywhere close to the type of job I'd be interested in.

How it usually works for people entering the field is...assuming you have a high GPA, are incredibly accomplished, and happen to go to a target school for these fields you will get an internship. By target school I mean your Ivys and highly ranked business schools. Firms will only hire interns from these schools they have agreements with. Usually during your junior year you get hired on for an internship, do well, and get a fulltime offer. I attended a state school and couldn't get an internship during my junior year despite sending out a high amount of applications. During my senior year I worked on a lot of projects, cases, and my schools fund to be more impressive. Now I graduated and I can't find a job. I've applied for almost anything.

Any non finance but business related job looks at my resume, they're impressed by everything but turn me down because they think I'm either overqualified, not TRULY interested because ""it's obvious you're passionate about capital markets/finance and not this"" or they often think I'm just looking for a first job using the job as a stepping stone and will leave in 6 months. This has happened no matter how much interest I've displayed in interviews.

It's been 8 months since I've graduated and I feel my degree is completely useless and a paperweight. I'm of humble means, have been struggling and poor for YEARS and I was hoping this would improve my life. 

I hear nothing from finance/consulting type jobs due to how competitive they are. I've tried e-mailing people to network, applying, and everything I could. It's never worked. Most would say, ""Contact alumni"" but if you go to a non target your network is mostly non existent for these fields. Basically alumni hire alumni and keep the ""plebes"" out. I recently applied to a job and the HR manager straight up told me the head of the department I was applying for was looking for ""people with more of an Ivy League background."" Apparently my degree isn't worth the same.

Most recommendations to get into these fields if you're stuck is to get an MBA. Ok no problem, I can study the GMAT try to get an MBA. But that just leads to MORE problems. To get into MBA programs that hires for these sort of jobs you must again, go to an MBA target school. To have a shot with MBA programs you must work for at least two years and do something impressive or have a decent leadership job, I can't even get a regular job. You can't work at some no name place and go to a top banking target school. The schools are just as competitive as the jobs. So not only am I locked from finance jobs, I'm locked out of any future because I'll never get into any MBA program without a decent job. I can't get a job because I didn't attend a target, I can't go to a target because they won't let me in without a good job. It feels like the industry does its best to keep anyone else but the elite Ivy League type out. 

On top of that it's been months since I've done finance related things and I'm scared I'll slowly lose all my modeling skills and finance knowledge..it's happening to me. I'm at my wits end. I'm frustrated. I don't know what to do. I'm interning at a place right now doing telemarketing calls for FREE. It's brainless, depressing, and terrible. I pay my last few hundred dollars in gas to go to an unpaid internship that's useless to me.

I'm stuck. I'm broke. I lay awake at night till the sun rises reading about these jobs I'll never have, feeling anxiety, feeling inferior, feeling like there's no way out. There's always more hoops to jump, ""if you just get a CFA, if you just get an MBA, if you just score at the 97th percentile on the GMAT""

 I'm 25 and I'm getting old and losing the time window for these jobs being possible for me. I've been broke for years and I want to start my life. I feel like I've wasted my life. Like perhaps I should have majored in aeroforce engineering or software engineering something more technical.

 I have no idea what to do next from here. I'm willing to try other careers or jobs but I don't know where to go. Not being allowed to be part of the field you thought you were passionate about is heartbreaking and I'm becoming resentful towards the field.

I need an internship but they only hire juniors, seniors, or people in school. So I'm locked out of internships, jobs, and a target MBA program. Wtf am I supposed to do???

I'm willing to get into other fields but I don't know where I can go. Someone please advise me on what I should do next?"

Details inside.",Hramyzn,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4uc2k1/i_currently_hate_college_education_and_feel_like/,"Hello, here is a detailed version of my problems.

I've always been interested in IT and have been relatively good at it. I'm mainly talking about web and desktop development. But at the same time, I suck at high level math... *hard*. Being the genious that I am ^/s, I decided to study computer science at university and got in easily due to entrance exams being a choice between math or IT tests (and naturally, choosing IT). Remember how I said that I suck at math? Yeah...

The problem right now is, that the IT part of my education is currently below my level, while I can't handle the math at all. This leads to me being unable to improve my IT skills because: 

1) All I do in college is retread what I already know when it comes to IT.

2) I can't improve my IT skills outside of college because I have to focus so much on math (and despite that, end up stressing about it and failing the math exams).

I'm currently at a point where education is holding me back.

All in all, I'd quit college in a heartbeat and apply for internship or whatever at a company. Working for free to gain knowledge and experience would be no problem for me, but when you live in a country with a 44% unemployment rate, nobody will hire someone who needs training while there's a professional with 20 years of experience waiting to fill in that job. If there is no such person, there is always at least someone with a college degree.

So, does anyone have any idea on what to do?"
4uchev,1,2016-07-24,New Associate in firm...social improvement tips for to consider while i grow?,AccountingGeek,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/4uchev/new_associate_in_firmsocial_improvement_tips_for/,"Starting in a CPA firm in January as an associate. I won't have much of a life during January-January(2018) because tax season &amp; CPA Exam.

I have identified a few key weaknesses and fears and was hoping for some tips. I worked as an intern previously at this company.

1. Awkward employees....some are awkward like me. Not wanting to say Hello first/at all. Walking by as if they are too in thought to notice you. I'm sure its not an arrogance thing, just a social thing. 

1a. I'm also sorta bad at this. I feel like if I don't say hello to someone first thing when showing up to work that I can't say it at all for the rest of the day. This can't be right because I feel weird as hell.

2. Interacting with new faces. We often have audit folk who are usually out of the office come in. I don't really know them or how to make conversation with them. These guys are usually quite conversational but are likely to duck out at the first sign of quietness. Best way to take these new faces head-on and begin establishing a relationship?

2a. Establishing relationships with everyone besides who I am working on a project with.

3. Mingling....How do people do this? How do you break into conversation groups? How do you jump from one person to another? Sometimes I feel like I have to stand and look at the side of someones head until they notice me and then do some really weird handshake introduction(if they are new to me). Either way I'm not very graceful here.

4. Making my way to the ""inner"" table. I say this because it is a rule of thumb that the person who radiates the most conversation sits in the midde(inner) parts of table. It is an unspoken rule and can be totally noticeable when large groups of us are together. Who do I become more conversational? I frequently find myself listening to others and then never contributing to anything they say or the conversation in any meaningful way because Nothing ever comes to minds, just finding there words come and go until I get lost in thought on something else. After a while conversations go on and I have no idea what the discussion is.

Finally, getting to know people. I have found out by now that conversation (and perhaps relationships too) depends on getting to know people better. In fact, I would say this is the second most important skill after a graceful approach. That being said, without being some awkward-bot....how do I go about this? 

Sorry for the huge post. And thank you!"

I'm currently enrolled in University through Penn State, but I live in between the Cincinnati and Indianapolis areas.  Recently I have been looking for something Entry level or with Intern work to develop experience to be able to go after the jobs that are typically posted on the job boards that seek 2+ years of experience (Which seems to be almost all of them.)  

The struggle that I'm running into is finding those entry level/internship opportunities as it seems that the market is very heavy for experienced work, but not so much for work for someone who doesn't actually have resident/hired job experience doing any type of coding.  I have just recently started to get going on Github as I actually didn't even know of that community until just recently.

The biggest problem I've had with finding an opportunity for internship through my university has been that the majority (almost all) of their internship opportunities that fit for developers are inside of PA itself, while I'm living in the Ohio/Indiana area and looking to get the ball rolling.  

The majority of my coding experience for web platforms is through PHP and MSSQL/MYSQL.  I have begun to learn and develop a skillset in C# as I was looking to transition over to become an application developer.  Am I making a mistake by looking for Application stuff, and should I go back to searching for Web Development, and if so what should I be looking into to become more current/caught up in that facet.

Thank you guys a bunch as I know the community here is very patient."
4ud1p3,6,2016-07-24,A note of encouragement for people starting Engineering later or those thinking they may not be smart enough.,SneakiusBritius,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4ud1p3/a_note_of_encouragement_for_people_starting/,"Hi guys! I thought I'd give a little background on myself, I'm from a small fishing town in the UK and while I was seen as in the ""Likely to be successful group"" in school, my grades were mixed. (3 A's, 3 B's 3 C's for GCSE's) my 1st year in College was mixed too, my first A-level exams consisted of a D, C and 2 B's in the first Semester and while improved slightly in second it really knocked my confidence as I was always bigged up to be better than I was apparently performing. My mother kicked my arse and said I was being short sighted and that I either get my act together or she's cutting the plug on my computer. She always did know where to threaten. So for the next year I essentially repeated all my exams and carried on with my second year A-levels at the same time. I managed, and pulled my grades up to something more respectable. (A in computing and 2 B's for maths and physics)

I took a chemistry apprenticeship with the lure being I could get a full degree and graduate without paying a single penny towards any tuition. 3 years later a little jaded with chemistry and at the end of my contract I decided to go to university full time to study Mechatronics and Robotics. I was reserved about it, I hadn't practiced A-levels in 3 years apart from my 1st year level chemistry. 

My first in-semester test for engineering maths I scored something like 40% and it really took me back. ""What sort of engineer can't do maths?"" So I doubled down and practiced, looking at the recommended books that were available in the library, relearning principles I understood 3 years ago, and applying the same ethos to my other modules to get ahead of the curve. At the end of my first semester exams, I had some promising results, with an 80% mark for my engineering maths module. The struggle however didn't end there, as 2nd semester I felt modules rolled up their sleeves and increased the pace. I was back to having doubts if I could really complete this degree. I steeled my resolve again and got back to it. I also bought a book called ""The Now habit"" as my biggest weakness was procrastination, that helped me to manage my time and get into good habits which helped **Big. Time.** 

Finally this year my efforts have payed off as I ended my first year with an overall 1st which will put me in an excellent position for summer internships after my second year! 

The message I'm conveying here is it doesn't matter if you have been out of the loop for a little while  or your confidence isn't at the highest levels, as long as you are determined this is what you want to do and you put in effort and ask help any time you need it. You will get there.

However it is also important that you review your successes to see any stumble you had along the way to make sure they still don't trip you up in the future! Mine was note taking, good notes that you can understand will honestly save you heaps of time and give you the fastest route to remembering something that was fuzzy in your head, and I believe it will only happen more often as you progress through your years of study.

So, I'll leave you with a saying my basketball coach said that always stuck with me ""Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard"", So get your head down, work hard! Reward yourself with that hard work though, so you always remember what you are doing it for!"

However, when I came home to visit them they said I looked disgustingly fatter than the last time they saw me a couple months ago. They keep thinking that it's the medication because there's a common theory that it causes weight gain but I've been told by my doctor that it's a myth. I personally believe I gained weight because my work does catered meals twice a week and I eat out with my friends once a week, and I am a software developer intern so my job is mostly sitting down. I do go to the gym 3 times a week but I know that's not a lot. I told my parents that since there is no proof anywhere that taking a break from this medication would be beneficial, I didn't see why I had to stop taking it. I asked them to show me evidence from studies and they said doctors can be wrong and studies are ""meaningless"". I grew up being controlled by them, whenever I didn't do something my mom wanted she would throw a tantrum and threaten me until she got her way, so this time I didn't want to do that anymore since I'm 21 and I am capable of making my own decisions. 

I told my parents that I would try to exercise more and start eating clean and that if after a month or two my weight still increases, then I would consider their advice. They accepted it last night but today for some reason they are angry again. We got into an argument and my mom was asking how I could be so cold to my parents who raised me and I said I had to stop being naive and weak after the way they treated me in high school (never cared about what I did, never came to my concerts and said anything aside from grades was a waste of time. Also dismissed it when I told them twice that I was depressed and said it was my fault). The argument ended with my dad exploding and yelling that I treat my parents like shit and I am garbage and that he will no longer recognize me as his daughter. 

I don't really know what to do now...I am going back to school but did I really step out of line? I just didn't want to be forced into anything for once and I tried to reason with them but it didn't work.."

I transferred in the spring from a community college as info sci (CALS). I managed to score an internship for this summer, but it's not exactly what I had expected. It's lead me to realize that a 'hardcore' (more dedicated?) software development role is more in tune with my career aspirations.

I feel like I could definitely get a 'CS' job out of school with IS degree, but I also feel that i'm missing a -ton- of core CS fundamentals after 2110.

Is it even possible for me to internal to CS as a previous external transfer student?

I'm a rising junior, and after looking at course equivalencies/what I have, it just seems like i -may- have to spend an additional semester if i'm even allowed to transfer, which is... fine.

I know IS in CALS (and CALS in general besides AEM) is significantly easier to external-transfer into, and I feel that will hurt my chances when I plead my case, and i'll be told something like: ""Oh, you just applied IS instead of CS in AS/eng because it's statistically easier to get into! Sorry, we don't allow sneaky backdoor transfers here"". I legitimately applied IS because it seemed to be exactly what I wanted to major in, but its allure is fading on me.

I do have a bit of relevant CS experience (two fully-fleshed websites, an iOS app/website (company), and a ton of random side-projects), too, though, so I wouldn't exactly be going in blind. 

Thoughts?

The problem is, I don't really believe I am ready for an internship, if that makes sense. I'm looking to go into either risk analysis or wealth management. I'm an econ undergrad in a non-target school which makes things even harder. 

I have no previous work experience or internships. I know how to use Python, R, Excel; I know some machine learning methods, and I've taken advanced econometrics classes (that are offered only to honours students but I spoke my way into them).

So, with that skillset, where do I go from there? I read a post on here which suggested trying to get in touch with alumni from your program / university that work in the field you're trying to break in. Great, but what do I tell them? Like, do I just email them and attach my cv, then explain that I'm soon graduating and looking for an internship? Or do I play coy and ask about the job, about themselves and about the company in hopes that the conversation will end with them offering me something?

So, as the title says, I'm going into my senior year of Computer Engineering next month, and over the past year I have truly enjoyed every minute of both in and out-of-class coding I've done in my little projects teaching myself how to build android apps and it's really been a great experience to open up my Dev Console and see someone in a different continent use an app I made, even if the numbers are really low. But with less than a year of time to get my shit together and be a candidate for decent full time gigs, my worries are really starting to get the better of me.

1. Now, given that I have no internships to show and will be applying as an average state university *CE* student from the Midwest, what do you guys think of my chances to land a job as a Software Engineer? Java being my language of choice.

2. I did not want to factor this in as an excuse or bring it up in the post but for complete clarity..over the last year and a half, my gpa has dropped from a 3.2 to a 2.6, after the passing away of a close family member; realistically, with 32 hours to go, do you think I still have the time to reverse my gpa back? Microcontroller System Design, Intro to FPGA Design, Operating Systems and Computer Networks seemingly being the most important remaining courses.

3. From reading past posts on this subreddit, I have realized how big of a factor open source contributions are when it comes to the job hunt, and being a CE major, I would think that it applies even more so to myself. 
So, if I were confident at this point in my Java skills, how do I go about finding a project to contribute to? 

4. .....Is a winter internship even possible, if I cannot delay graduation? It would span mid December to late January.

Thanks for reading!"

I quit a very good paying job in order to move out to the boonies, live on the ranch we bought together, and go back to school for engineering. Over the last six months my relationship with my fiancee has fallen apart and she says she no longer has any sort of attraction for me. I know for a fact much of this stems from me not having a job or any friends in the area yet. I have become clingy without much effort, it just kinda happened. I have made many attempts to go out on various MeetUps in order to meet people and find friends, but as we all know that's easier said than done. Last week I finally started an engineering internship, which is good because now I finally have something positive going on, but I'm afraid it's too late. She no longer looks at me like she used to. It's like she looks right through me. I feel trapped and alone being so far from old friends and my family. Living with her and her mom has been civil, but I feel like I'm getting in the way. I have no idea what to do. I gave a good portion of my 401k to move in here with the expectations that they would cover the mortgage while I got my degree. Now it seems like I need to seriously consider moving out.. The main issue with that is I will be in serious debt, not to mention the stress of yet another move.
What should I do? She said she's willing to give the relationship 2 months, but I seriously think in her mind she's only saying that to be nice and to delay the inevitable. Of course I want to be with her, but I also don't want to be with someone who gets annoyed at my very presence. I don't know if I should consider trying to get my old job back, if I should duke it out here in my house, or if I should risk the stress and move again, hoping for the best financially.

Currently I'm completing an internship in the defense industry but I've always has a pull towards finance since watching CNBC in my Uncle's office where he was an investment advisor when I was young (not what I'm interested in). In terms of my financial background, it's mostly just through self-education and a desire to learn. I live in Chicago and occasionally look at job boards to see my options but it's hard to parse through what would be an appropriate path. So I guess these are my 3 questions:

1. Are there any career paths you can think of that would fulfill my desires? I'm not necessarily looking for a strictly engineering role...I took a mental math pretest for a trader at a prop firm in Chicago but unfortunately didn't make the cut. Equity analysis? Anything along those lines?

2. Do you think it would be more difficult for me considering I'm in my mid-20s and just getting a start in finance? 

3. Do you have any additional advice as to books to read/things to learn on my own? I'm pretty packed the next 3 semesters with curriculum courses so it would be extremely difficult to fit a legitimate finance course into my schedule but I'm pretty good at learning outside of the classroom environment.

Thanks!

4ugrz8,2,2016-07-25,Should I continue my internship during the school year?,sdf08,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/4ugrz8/should_i_continue_my_internship_during_the_school/,"My summer internship will be wrapping up in a few weeks, and I will probably be given the option of continuing this job part time during the school year. I am a CpE student going into my final year, and this was my first internship. I only need 12-13 credits each semester, so working during school would be doable. But I have some doubts:

The project I am working on is fun and related to my career goals (firmware/embedded), but I am working in isolation because there are no firmware/embedded engineers in my (very small) organization. One other engineer did a few super-simple MCU projects a while ago, but he insists that I know way more about embedded than he does. So I ask people high-level questions about what my application should do, and I show them some high-level results, but that's it. I do not have anyone to look to for mentorship or feedback on the quality of my work. 

To be honest, I don't think they need firmware engineers. There is plenty of serious engineering work happening, but it's pretty much all in other disciplines of engineering. Most places you might expect to find a custom MCU solution, they have purchased a 'black box' solution instead. They are more of a 'systems integrator' shop in this regard, and it has worked well for them so far. So I am not entirely sure how I fit in here or why they hired me. 

There are some things I like about this job. The people are great, I am working on fairly interesting stuff, and I am getting some money and experience out of it. But I would much rather work somewhere else after graduation, because I know I will grow way more as an engineer if I am working closely with others, especially with more experienced engineers who can provide feedback and mentorship. And I just don't see that happening here.
 
I think continuing my work during the school year, even though I don't really intend to work there after graduating, would be a bit awkward and kind of dishonest. What do you think?"

Minor Career Progression?,VoxClarus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ugw97/comp_sci_minor_career_progression/,"I have many academic interests, and have declared my major in a rather unprofitable one. I've opened a year of classes through AP Credit and would like to fill that with a second minor.

The CS minor looks appealing, and would open a separate and relatively high-demand career path. However, I have no idea what hiring prospects are like with just a minor. This seems a good area to ask a few questions.

 



Do Comp. Sci minors without significant internships have viable careers in the application and game development sectors? (Software development seems to be a field where project portfolios should matter more than formal education, but obviously I'm an outsider here.)


 

Besides basic Calc. and Stats, are there any courses that *must* be taken to be successful in CS coursework?
Further, would taking some of the Software Engineering major courses be valuable substitutions? It includes some AI and UI development, as well as basic formal language courses (UML, MATLAB).


 


If it helps, the official class setup I'm thinking is:
 
Object-Oriented -&gt; Data Communication -&gt; Software Construction  -&gt; Software Architecture -&gt; Game Programming/Game Design (Why not?)

The school district I have been hired for is in an affluent area, but the district itself is nothing but title 1 schools. The school I will be at is one of the highest needs, and one of the lowest rated. I am fine with this because every school I have volunteered in, as well as the one I student taught at, was a title 1. I am aware of the trauma and the difficulties of working in a title 1, and I know I can handle this.

My concerns are that the position I was offered is a 4/5th grade combo class, and the district itself is full inclusion. I have no idea where to start with a combo class, nor do I completely have the knowledge of how to run a full inclusion classroom.

What advice would anyone who has taught a combo class, or has worked in full inclusion, or both, would you offer me? What can I expect in full inclusion? Is it possible to combine curriculums for 4/5th grade so that both grade levels are being taught to the standards? How do I find time to instruct on both grade level curriculum if I can't combine it?

So I am very lucky to get this unpaid internship at a startup for an iOS app. I went from not knowing how to program or even identify what a method is in a function to being able to create a productivity app on the iPhone programatically. Off the top of my head, the app required me to make use of: Tableviews, design patterns, single responsibility principle (making my project readable by other programmers and making each method efficient), parsing JSON, networking with JSON, using third party tools from open source github repos (like FBShimering, AFNetworking, etc), and more. 

This took me about two months to really understand what's going on, and I can say that I've learned a lot at a pretty fast pace. My work hours are from 8am - 4pm M-F. 

Anyway, I have approximately a month left at this internship, and at this point we're not exactly sure what I should be doing in order to really make the most of my time. The argument is, sure, I can continue to *practice* creating apps and making them better, or even move on from productivity apps with only tableviews to creating productivity apps with collection views. But the thing is I already know those things exist, and I can do that without guidance because I know what questions to ask and I have an idea of what to do when I'm stuck.

I feel the purpose of an internship is to really make use of the mentor / manager by encountering things that I will have trouble finding an answer to and having him teach me how to answer it. He gave me a project to work on that he personally wanted to create himself, and we encountered a few questions that we *both* can't answer, and after 2 days of no progress, we feel that it's better that I move on to something more productive.

Right now, his suggestion is for me to study advanced data structures with the online free MIT Courses. The reason why I'm a little hesitant about this is I don't want to use my time in this internship with an online course that already has answers. 

Anyway, my question to you guys is : Should I be studying advanced data structures? If there are any of you who were ever in my situation before, what is the best thing I should be doing?

I want to be a reliable iOS dev in the future, and when I put on my resume that I've had an internship for 2-3 months, I want to be able to exceed the expectations of someone who has my amount of experience. Ultimately, I really want to be a greater developer to get a paying job. Am I in the right direction? What would you do better?

I've always listened to this amazing, very well known (new age/instrumental) composer (sold millions of albums), and his music truly inspires me, makes me happy, and alive. I could write a book how his music makes me feel. 

He was on tour in a city near me recently with his orchestra, and a thought came to mind that maybe I could have a chance to work for him as an intern? He has his marketing team, but I was wondering if there are any things AT ALL I should know about the music industry in general. Before I contact them asking about the possibility, can you guys please share with me your insights or advice?

I study business and marketing so that is where I would like to work. It would be really cool if someone had some ideas how a college student could help a popular musician on his tour? What kinds of tasks could I have? 

It would be such a blessing to help spread his music to people who haven't yet heard it (the very few). He travels all over the world, and is recognized everywhere. 

ANY ADVICE AT ALL would be much appreciated!! 

Thank you!"

4ulxsb,1,2016-07-25,Parsing variable spacings from a generated file,TNSEG,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/4ulxsb/parsing_variable_spacings_from_a_generated_file/,"Greetings /r/excel, I apologize if this is long winded, but I'm trying to explain my need and rational the best I can.

So, I've been toying with this for a few days and have drawn a blank with this last piece of the puzzle.

A little background, I'm working this summer as an intern for a contracting company. One task I've acquired as part of my responsibilities is inputting the time cards for the crews for the week. The way this is done is, I receive the paper timecards, of the previous day. I take these and input them into a commercial construction software (CCS), that is accessed through a remote desktop connection. Once all the timecards for the week are put in, we have to make sure everything is correct, then generate a report, and send that off to payroll. 

The problem I've had is with the report. I haven't had a week yet, nor has my supervisor prior to me joining the team when he did these, where payroll hasn't found something we've missed. One issue is that our foreman are relatively new, so they're learning the system, and make mistakes on the paper timecards (and I don't get to really go over the cards directly with them). The other, is there are a lot of little easy to miss things. 

The main things we're looking for in the report are to make sure that each employee and piece of equipment is being charged to a cost code with labor or equipment hours respectively, each piece of equipment is tracked for exactly 40 hours, and each employee has 40 regular hours, and how ever many overtime hours they've worked. 

So I discovered in the CCS that there is a way to print a text file report (vs actual printing or pdf which we were doing to review it prior). Using this, I'm created this VBA program to check all of these criteria for me, and help me more quickly, and more accurately catch any mistakes. 

Now what I need help with is better parsing the file. The file uses spaces to align the items, and maintain columns for each day of the week. I'm using RegEx to break each space separated section into a comma separated section, and then from there I can run my checks.    
***        
The issue I have is in cases where we get a new piece of equipment in midway through the week, or in CCS I forget to input a ""0"" if someone misses a day of work. In these cases, the columns are just spaces, so what ends up happening is if piece of equipment A came in on Wednesday, when my program runs, it looks like it was there on Monday, and we just forgot to track it for Thursday and Friday. 

Here is the VBA Source: http://pastebin.com/duVLbMAP

Here is the excel sheet, and a sample of the file. 
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-Y5B2pA-UFTSk1sc3E1VlQwYUk

You can see, ""Dirt Mover A1234"" came in on a Wednesday, but if you run the program (""Sanity Check"" button on the ""Output"" sheet) it looks like it was there on Monday. 


Hopefully this makes sense, if not please dont hesitate to ask questions. Thank you for any help!"

Less than one hour after I sent them out I got someone who called me wanting to interview me for a $20+/hr job.

The issue is the job is full time and will conflict with my school schedule so it's between continuing school and working a crappy job for 15 hours a week or quitting and actually working full time and making decent money.

So I'm torn...

* One friend says it'd be a mistake to quit persuing my degree because I will hit a hard cap to how far I'll advance in my career without a degree.

* My mom says she thinks I should finish my degree but also understands that you can make it without a degree in programming.

* The internet says you can definitely get by without a degree.

The thing is, once I have a lot of experience in my field will that degree even matter? And I can already open a lot of doors as I've had a pretty solid internship the past year and I've been a part of multiple game development teams as well as had plenty of programming projects on my own time.

TLDR:Do you need a degree to advance in CS? Particularly Software Engineering? Or does a degree only get you in the door. "

However, this software package has shell scripts, .ac, .am, and header files in addition to the C++ code files. Also, the software has dependencies on another C++ package (that has no Java implementation as far as I'm aware of) and the GCC compiler for Linux. The software runs in the Linux Terminal.

**WEDNESDAY MORNING, 13 JULY 2016...**

- - - - -

&gt;I need local admin access. I want to be able install software on my computer. This needs to happen today. 

""For you? You wish. Not going to happen,"" I said, sipping at my coffee and adjusting my terrycloth robe while I looked at the ticket. I typed back a form response, stating that we don't give out local admin access to users without management's written approval for security reasons, and clicked Send &amp; Close in ConnectWise.

My bosses, in their benevolence, had decided that it was easier for me to work remotely in the mornings (I had a home office setup similar to my office setup - i5-3570K, 16GB RAM, 2x GeForce 760s, 256GB SSD, 2x2TB 7200RPM drives in RAID1, a Yealink T46G IP phone, and multiple monitors - but my home setup only had two monitors as opposed to the four at the office) than to fight Austin traffic and come in homicidally angry. It also didn't hurt that I have multiple floofs (cats, in this case) to curl up on my lap while I worked, and I could literally roll out of bed, get my coffee from Mr. Coffee in the kitchen, feed the cats, and trudge back to my workstation in about 5 minutes, all the while waking myself up to be a productive senior systems administrator.

A few minutes later, my inbox dinged with a reply to the ticket.

&gt;I don't care. Either give me local admin rights or I will involve senior management.

I raised an eyebrow and started typing my response.

&gt;Unfortunately, due to SOP and security requirements, you will not be granted local administrator privileges. Your system and software are specifically configured for your position, and granting local administrative rights can allow the software and OS to deviate from the mandatory configurations. Again, we cannot - and will not - grant local administrative privileges without management signing off on it in writing.

Another Send &amp; Close later, and I started working on a few group policies to automatically map drives based on group membership. I didn't hear from the user for the rest of the day, so I figured the matter was closed.

- - - - - 

**THURSDAY MORNING, 14 JULY 2016...**

- - - - -

I rolled over, fell out of bed, and trudged into my office after grabbing a mug full of Jet Fuel, brewed strong. Outlook was already open, and I looked at the tickets that had come in overnight, then the Nagios alerts, and finally, the GFI and CompuTrace notifications.

""What the...""

I looked at the CompuTrace alerts - a user OTHER than that user's domain account had logged into his PC that night, and sure enough, it was Administrator (the local one, mind you, not the Domain Admin account). I pulled up a remote background command prompt through GFI (fun fact: GFI's dashboard can let you do that - remote background command prompts, service control, and even process control via a handy-dandy web interface). 

&gt;net localgroup ""Administrators""

&gt;

&gt;LocalAdmin Administrator $DOMAIN\NAUGHTY_USER 

&gt;$DOMAIN\Domain Admins $Domain\Enterprise Admins

""Oh, now that's just not cricket,"" I muttered, and typed in some commands (changing the local admin passwords, disabling the local admin accounts, and removing $NAUGHTY_USER from the local admins group - then force-rebooting in 30 seconds).

Thirty seconds later, the computer dropped offline, and the user's admin rights were removed. I dashed off a quick message to the client's HR department, notifying them of what happened, and told them that I'd be checking up on his machine daily for the next few weeks. I also flipped on reporting on their web proxy for his account, just for paranoia's sake. 

Outlook dinged again, and sure enough...

&gt;I need to have local admin access. Management has approved my request and will be sending in a ticket to grant this. I need this IMMEDIATELY, as I cannot work without this.

""Well, then.""

&gt;When we receive a ticket from the appropriate managers that states you have been granted administrative privileges, we will enable them for you. Per SOP, however, until that approval is in writing in our hands, we cannot and will not grant you those privileges.

One more mouse-click, and it went off into the ether. Another message came in a few minutes later.

&gt;I expect to have administrative privileges within the hour. If this does not happen, management will be speaking with your supervisors in regards to your continued employment at $FIRM_NAME.

I snorted. 

&gt;Again, you are asking us to break explicitly stated standard operating policy, which we have written instructions not to deviate from under any circumstances, to grant you administrative rights. Unfortunately, unless and until we hear from the appropriate management personnel stating that you are allowed such privileges, we will not, under any circumstances, grant them to you. Further requests from you for administrative rights will be rejected unless they are directly sent from the appropriate management personnel. This ticket is now closed.

""You can go now,"" I snarked, thinking back to the tale of Jack, the worst intern, and BCCing his HR department on the e-mail chain.

- - - - -

**FRIDAY MORNING, 15 JULY 2016...**

- - - - -

Two cups of Jet Fuel woke me up, and a small tuxedo cat nibbling on the back of my head from my swivel chair's headrest kept me giggling as I logged into my office box remotely and took a look at the day's alerts.

Sure enough, there was a CompuTrace alert about the same user's machine logging in as Administrator again. The same commands were executed, his admin rights were removed, and I wrote up a GPO explicitly defining which accounts could be local admins, then applied it to his machine and a bunch of others.

I then immediately restarted his machine with shutdown -r -t 0 -f, because he lost the right to save his morning's work when he decided that he was going to be that much of a pain. Another e-mail went to his HR department, and another cup of Jet Fuel went down my gullet.

&gt;YOUR UPPITY NETWORK ADMIN RESTARTED MY COMPUTER WHILE I WAS WORKING! THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR AND IT WILL BE STOPPED _NOW!_

My eye twitched, and the crappy Dell multimedia keyboard I had started bending dangerously under the angry typing I pounded out.

&gt;We have restarted your machine to address security concerns - namely, a disallowed local privilege escalation. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.

His HR rep was again BCC'd, and five minutes later, I was on the phone with her.

""Look, this is the second time he's done it. He KNOWS he can't have local admin rights.""

Her sigh was audible. ""I know he can't have them. Look... he's kind of the office bell-end. We all want him fired, we're building a case as is, but we need more ammo. Is there any chance you can let him dig his own grave? If he's done it twice already, you and I both know he'll do it again.""

I grinned a grin not unlike Al Pacino's in ""The Devil's Advocate"" and chuckled. Sure enough, her gulp could be heard over the VOIP link. ""Oh, dear, however did you know what I was planning? If he's even remotely smart, he'll back off now. Of course, given his role over there, I'm betting that he doesn't.""

- - - - -

**LAST MONDAY MORNING...**

- - - - -

More coffee, more tickets, and more alerts.

CompuTrace again signaled that he'd logged in as a local account over the weekend, except this one was different - he'd made a local admin account with his username. I shrugged, then did a double-take - how could he do that, when a GPO explicitly prevented every account but ours from being local admin?

The answer was easy - he'd used Hiren's or another boot environment to remove the local admin password, the same as he'd done the other days - then booted the system up, logged in, and UNJOINED THE PC FROM THE DOMAIN! That, of course, nulled all group policy objects and let him do whatever he wanted.

""Oh, he's for the high jump now,"" I said to the HR rep, and she confirmed it - Legal was listening in on the call, and stated that they were going to meet with him the next day, and to leave his machine as it was, so they could catch him red-handed.

""I think I can also do you one better,"" I continued, exporting his web logs to HTML and sending them over. ""Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and GMail, all of which are prohibited by name in the employee agreement. Think we can have some fun with this one?""

""Normally, I'd say no, as we need to treat this as a hostile termination - but since it's going to take us a bit of time to get the paperwork done today, we can't fire him until tomorrow.""

""Tell you what... any chance I can be there when this happens?"" My mind was racing, and I had a BRILLIANT idea. ""Make it known that I'll be there tomorrow in the Colorado River conference room around 10 AM. I have a hunch he'll show up - really, I plan on making it happen, so be close by but out of sight, okay?""

With their approval, I spent an hour or so ironing out my cunning plan and getting everything together.

- - - - -

**LAST TUESDAY MORNING...**

- - - - -

I couldn't resist - I pulled a slim-cut grey suit out of my closet that made me look like Sterling Archer, and after feeding the floofs and driving to the client's office, I made myself comfortable in the conference room. The HR rep and her friend (from the look of him, one of the heavy-duty droids they keep for the real tough cases) from Legal were slumming it a few cubicles down, and the trap was ready to be sprung.

Standard policy for me is that I keep certain MSI files slipstreamed into my install images - one of which is my company's generic LogMeIn installer, WITHOUT the characteristic system tray icon. Sure, $NAUGHTY_USER had uninstalled the copy I had on there as is, but he'd missed the GFI management agent (which, rather conveniently, I'd hidden from the list in Programs &amp; Features - it's a simple registry hack, nothing special). I fired up GFI's agent (fun fact: it runs as SYSTEM, and you can actually remote-BSOD machines with it), silently installed LogMeIn via msiexec /i /qn /norestart, and made a quick call to the HR rep. 

She, in turn, made a call to his manager, asking the manager to pull $NAUGHTY_USER into a meeting and not let him go back until he got a text instructing him to, and as soon as $NAUGHTY_USER left his office - with the machine locked, I noted (didn't care) - I reset one of the local admin passwords via the remote background prompt, logged in via LogMeIn, and unleashed a rather destructive toy that I'd gotten my hands on - [the MEMZ trojan] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-jdSgjtUPk) (seriously, I'm not kidding, that's what it's called - and if you open that link, be warned, there's NSFW language in the video). I logged off as the local admin account, then uninstalled LogMeIn, and logged into the domain controller and Exchange cluster to lock his accounts and - if instructed - remote-wipe his personal phone (this is why BYOD is a ridiculously bad idea).

Sure enough, the machine bluescreened, just like MEMZ is supposed to do (if I'd left it logged in, it would have had all kinds of fun effects, but in all honesty, I wanted the best effect of them all and that one only). 

On my signal, the HR rep texted the manager, who let $NAUGHTY_USER return to his office... to a machine with a BSOD on it. He rebooted, and the final payload showed up on his laptop's screen - a [bootloader that was replaced with Nyancat](https://youtu.be/I-jdSgjtUPk?t=467) (kid you not, that's the last payload of MEMZ). A few seconds after Nyancat's music started playing, I heard furious stomping coming down the hallway towards the conference room (along with the Nyancat music).

""FIX THIS, NOW!"" he yelled, thrusting the laptop towards me, Nyancat's disgustingly beetus-inducing PopTart body bouncing on the screen. ""I know you did this. You've been stopping me from getting my work done for the past week! Now either you fix this, or you're not going to be working for your company after today!""

""Actually,"" the HR rep said, entering the room with her friend from Legal, ""that's my line. We need to have a discussion about your continued employment here - namely, its continuance. Jack, would you mind?""

I stood up, closed my laptop, slipped it back into the case, and pulled out a sheaf of papers. ""And here's his web logs. I didn't man-in-the-middle the SSL, though I should have, I suppose. Oh, well, that's moot.""

Turning to leave, I looked at $NAUGHTY_USER, and through his rage, I saw just a hint of fear. I'd worked for about ten minutes on a little speech, and it would have been a shame to waste it, so after a quick glance at the HR rep, and a nod from her, I said my piece (admittedly with a halfway decent imitation of a certain actor's voice).

""You know, for you, one of the worst days of your life will probably be the day that an 'uppity network admin,' as you so charmingly put it, got you fired, in utter disgrace, from your cushy six-figure job where you played games and sat on Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter all day.""

I leaned against the wall, hand on chin, and delivered the last part with a smirk

""But for me? It was Tuesday.""

I waved goodbye to the HR admin and the Legal droid, and validated my parking on the way out (icing on the cake - after all, who wants to pay for parking in downtown Austin?).

- - - - -

**TL;DR: It was Tuesday.**

I'm looking for putting something like [this](http://www.inkfolder.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Black-Geometric-Forearm-Tattoo.jpg) or [this](http://create-tattoos.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/arrow-tattoo-on-forearm.jpg) on my forearm, something like an arrow or other geometrical ones. For my chest it would basically be roman numerals, something like [this](http://tattooblend.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/roman-numeral-tattoo.jpg).

At the same time, do you guys have any tattoo parlor/artists to introduce? Would love to have some where people have been to and have tried out their services before.

Lastly, I've a few question regarding tattoos, some of them are pretty stupid do bear with me. I'm totally clueless on this.

1) Will a tattoo stretch? I'm rather skinny, like bamboo pole so my worry is that if I become fatter in the future the tattoo would stretch. (pretty dumb question I know, but I really am clueless.)

2) I know tattoo's are permanent but will they like be affected for example if I have one on my forearm and I accidentally cut myself on the area the tattoo is on, it would heal but it would leave a scar right? I have a tendency to pluck the healing skin when it's in the progress of healing, will that affect the tattoo in any way?

3)What's the price of getting a tattoo? I know it defers base on length but is there a general guideline?

4)How pain is it?

5)Will it affect future employments and university enrolling chances? I've been through my internship where I do see people with tattoos around an office environment, nothing wrong with that as they are still able to important positions, at the same time I've heard there are companies that still wouldn't like it. I heard that for some you would've to declare it, but if it's not visible during working hours since I'll be wearing shirts, is there a need to still declare?

Thanks in advance.

I also have a little bit of desktop support experience from an internship I held at a car dealership. I'm currently studying for my CCNA as well as going through WGU for a Bachelors. I originally had gone through my networking courses in 2010 and did not feel very passionate about it. I found a renewed passion in 2013 after feeling burnt out in sales. I recently decided to start setting up virtual machines and currently have a Windows Server 2012 R2, OSX El Capitan, and Linux. I also have SQL 2014 setup on the Server 2012 setup. I can do very basic OSX troubleshooting and do not really use Linux much at my work. There is light server administration when interfacing with copiers. We will usually set up a new user for the copier in the AD tree and sometimes reset passwords and such as well as troubleshoot installs. My current supervisor has told me there is really nowhere for me to grow unless someone leaves. This currently has me looking for new positions. 

I also used to troubleshoot cell phones for six years. I want to work this into my resume again because I believe it would show my technical aptitude. Not really sure if it would be beneficial as I've seen some positions specifically ask for experience with certain mobile operating systems. Any insight would be appreciated.

However, I'm a current comp sci student and our entire course is in Java. 

Java the *language* I am totally comfortable with. However, development in Java is a totally confusing field to me. Unlike Python's community (which is generally more web-based and vibrant), the Java community seems very enterprise-y, and that reflects in the documentation/resources I find online.

I've got my Python workflow down pat - virtualenvs, `pip install` for requirements, PEP8 linters in my text editor, I've used various testing frameworks etc. But when I'm working with Java, I don't really know how to work besides opening my IDE and typing the code. How do I run tests? Hell, how do I *write* tests (JUnit something something...)?

I've heard terms like Ant, Gradle, Maven etc. being thrown around and even after looking them up I have no idea what they do. I struggled even to find out how to resolve dependency issues in one of my projects (with Python it's just `pip install dependency`, with Java there's something to do with a CLASSPATH?).

**So basically**, I'm asking for a complete description of a good Java development workflow, as you would explain it to someone coming from a Python background."

I always come up with excuses for myself for not reaching out, and usually end up believing that I am good enough on my own.

This summer, I have been an intern at a large company. There are about 100 interns in our city and most of us live in the same place. However, I was one of the last to arrive, a few weeks after the first, and I felt that most people had already made friends, the ""icebreaker"" events had already happened, so I didn't really make any friends. 

I know a few people, but have never done anything outside of work with any of them. See excuses above.

However, there is an intern event for the end of the year coming up and I really don't want to go. It is at a family fun place with mini golf, etc, things like that. But I don't want to go and not have a group, and I don't want to force myself into a group because I hate to feel like I am imposing. 

I am honestly just planning to miss it. I know that I shouldn't, that things would probably work out and it would be fine, and I would feel great if I did meet a few more people. But with the summer coming to a close in a few weeks, I just keep saying ""there isn't really a point."" 

I know I have problems with social situations, being outgoing, self-confidence. And it's been hard, but I've been pretty good on my own. It's lonely, but safe, comfortable.

Sorry for the long message if you are still reading this, but this is as much asking for advice as it is just letting some stuff out a little bit.

Thanks,

I got good marks in practically everything, but here's my problem:

I really, really don't enjoy the course. We had programming (C), computing systems, algorithms, maths, physics, electrical engineering and web development classes and the only one I actually liked was maths. 

I've also been working in a software department for the summer on an internship thanks to some connections I have and I really don't like that either. I've been left with a project that I should be able to do, but I'm nowhere near creative enough to come up with ideas for it. Honestly I can't see myself working in software development at all if this is what it entails.

So my predicament is this: I don't particularly like anything other than the maths element of the course, which there isn't as much as I thought there would be. So do I drop out, keep going and try and find some kind of analytical job? Unfortunately because the course is so specific and how Irish Universities work, I cannot transfer to another course, although I wish I could.

It costs $32,000 yearly to attend.
With grants and basic financial aid, it's still about $20,000.


And before you say anything, yes, I know now I should've gone to a cheaper state school. It's a bit late for that.


My GPA has never been amazing. I've always gotten Cs and C-s with the occasional B or A. This is mostly caused by the mid-semester slump where I'm behind on every assignment all at once. In general, time management and punctuality are my greatest weaknesses, but I digress.

Fall Semester of 2015, I was attempting to juggle an internship (12 hrs/week + 4hrs/week of driving) and 15 credit hours. It went very poorly and I failed two of my classes. I should've dropped them, but I was stupid and thought I could salvage my grades enough to scrape by.

This Spring, I made my best effort to boost my GPA so those two F's wouldn't hold me down too much. This, however, was futile. As I said, my GPA has always teetered around the 2.0 minimum, so those two F's dropped it down to a 1.9.
The Spring semester raised it to a 1.955, but that's not great.

Now I'm no longer approved for federal or institutional aid and have to take out private loans if I want to continue.

I also have two more years (after three years already). 

I have absolutely no idea what to do. Taking out the full $16,000 in private loans for at least one semester sounds like financial suicide when I've already accrued about $60,000 in federal loans, and my GPA is hurting so badly that I'm wondering if I can even salvage it at all."

I'm not sure if this the correct place for this, but I'm an IT Intern at a company and we're experiencing an issue with Sophos Encryption on Windows 10 machines.

The issue is the login screen for Bitlocker (which overrides the Sophos Safeguard software) is either showing a blank blue screen or an orange screen with white vertical lines running down it.

This is a problem for our users, one because the product surely isn't doing what it was intended to do, which is display a Bitlocker screen prompting the user to enter their Bitlocker PIN so they can regain access to their hard drive.

I've research a few articles about this issue and seems that it isn't as common as I would like.

http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-security/bitlocker-pin-pre-boot-screen-empty/f985c4f6-dd71-4586-bd46-50f513432bb3

I've contacted Sophos Tech Support for this issue and their response to me was that they hadn't heard of this issue before.

Yet, I've found it on multiple different forums as well as Microsoft's own website.

I feel like Microsoft would have notified Sophos if there was an issue considering the two companies appear to be working in unison with Bitlocker overriding the Sophos Encryption.

Anyways, my supervisor asked me to contact Sophos multiple times to find a tech that might be able to help me. Eventually, I was able to find a tech that informed me that we had an outdated version of the Sophos Encryption software. We were using Version 7.00.1.35. According, to this tech, Windows 10 requires users to use at least Version 7.00.2.

So, there's a plus. However, on these forum posts I don't see anyone posting what version of Sophos Safeguard they're installing on their machines, so I can't be sure if this resolves the issue entirely, hence why I have three laptops that I'm testing with 3 different versions.

UPDATE: While I type this post out, we received an email from the Sophos vendor we work with and they contacted a Senior Software Engineer and his response was that it isn't a Sophos issue whatsoever. It is entirely a Windows issue.

The reason why they believe it is solely a Windows issue is that there a reports from users that only use Bitlocker that are not using Sophos.

Also, most of my users that are experiencing this issue are remote and in a very different timezone than PST so it makes it difficult to test.

However, I have one user that is leaving today at 4PM PST that is allowing me to run a test to uninstall the KB while Bitlocker is suspended or by trying out the command.

I'll post my results after I leave work today.

Any other useful comments that you all might have would be so greatly appreciated. My supervisor keeps asking me for updates every hour which is rather difficult since the encryption for Bitlocker takes anywhere from 1hour to 6 hours depending on the speed of the machine.

Thanks /r/sysadmin :)

I majored in Computer Science with a minor in Web Design &amp; Development.

I'm trying to figure out what i'm doing wrong, because I've only had 1 interview (on the phone) so far. I honestly feel like the interview went perfect for a job in Colorado, I had all of the skills they wanted and felt very confident throughout the interview. I answered their questions with easy with no hesitation. When it came down to it, they said they couldn't hire me because I was not already in Colorado and they needed someone asap.

I have a website which just links my resume/githib (sort of my portfolio)/linkedin, you can see it here and maybe offer me some feedback on my resume/github/linkedin. http://rohanharrison.com/

I've been told by a lot of different people that my resume looks really good from friends to family to people on r/resumes.

I'm from a small town in KY and I have applied to a few jobs in-state, but I'm really trying to get a job out of state because living at home is just toxic for me.

I'm mainly applying in San Francisco, San Jose, Denver, Seattle, Austin, Dallas, and NYC. I could probably apply in Connecticut (where I went to school and did my internship), but I would rather not. 

I've been told my resume was good. The only interview I did went as smooth as I could possibly imagine, and I've probably applied to a billion places. I've used Glassdoor, Indeed, Ziprecruiter, and a couple other sites to find jobs. I tried searching on linkedin, but couldn't figure out how to find what I wanted. The idea of searching linkedin was to message recruiters directly, but I couldn't figure out who/what to message and how to go about it. 


I realize I didn't go to an awesome university, but my school is decently respected in CT (or everyone at least knows of it). I didn't have an awesome GPA, but I also didn't have a bad GPA. But most jobs i've applied to have not even asked about it.

I've applied to a lot of entry level/associate level jobs as a software engineer, developer, mobile (Android) developer, web designer/developer and more. I am pretty experienced in what i did at my internship (mainly .NET/SQL) stuff. I design websites as a hobby (full stack LAMP) and more. 

It's been eating at me but I have only gotten ONE interview out of so many job applications and hours spend applying. I really want to work for my money, and I am absolutely willing to learn whatever skill or language I don't know. Saying I am enthusiastic is an understatement. My parents have graciously allowed me to stay at home for as long as I need, but I can tell they're a little antsy. I have applied to jobs locally, but like I said I would much prefer to move out of state. Thankfully I do not have loans or this would be even more stressful.

I'm obviously willing to relocate with maybe 2-3 weeks notice (so I can get a place to stay out of state), and I'm not even asking for relocation compensation. I am willing to eat that cost myself. My requirements for pay aren't exceptionally high either. I would be willing to take $50k a year starting, where most of the states I've applied average more around $60-90k.

I graduated in May by the way, and I started applying maybe two weeks after graduation."

I am a rising senior in CS, and i am currently doing an QA/Automation Internship. I am kind of disappointed in my internship, as i applied to so many development internships (~20 or so) and did not get even a single offer. When i received the offer for my current internship, it was rather bittersweet since i knew i would not enjoy QA too much, but i still took it, because its still better than no internship (and i was desperate). i would say 80% of my responsibilities revolve around writing selenium scripts to test web applications. At first, it was moderately interesting, because i was learning a new framework and felt like i was getting decent coding experience, however, after a while it got extremely, mind-numbingly boring. It has gotten to the point where i hate going to work, because, i know it is just going to be another 8 hours of writing boring Selenium scripts, and gaining no relevant development experience. It is also so frustrating when i am talking to friends, and they tell me about their awesome internships where they are creating mobile applications, websites, and working as a part of an actual Agile development team. I started this internship on June 1st and it is supposed to last six months. I have been through barely 2 months now, and i honestly don't know if i can keep this up for another 4 months.

This internship, however, has given me so much appreciation for QA people. I don't take QA for granted, and know it is an extremely crucial part of the development process (finding bugs, automating testing, etc), however, i just don't think it is for me, as i always have had a fascination for development.

My main question is, for all the QA/Automation Engineers out there, what keeps you really interested in your job, and why do you enjoy doing it? Would you say you have a ""passion"" for what you do?

Thanks for any responses :)"

I am beginning to have nightmares where I am fired due to poor performance or a lack of knowledge. I need help - what should I be doing to improve myself as a programmer?

I have two industry (electrical engineering) related work experiences and have completed research with one professor for about a year and a half. My resume is decent but it doesn't really stand out. I have been thinking about maybe going to graduate school if I decide to graduate, or: stay at my school, complete another internship, gather more research experience, and get a double major. Right now I have a 3.8 GPA, but a safe range for the end of the year will be 3.7-3.9. 

Finances are not really a constraint. It would obviously be nice to save an extra ~15k by graduating early, but I am definitely not in a strain. I feel that this decision will be worth more than 15k as a long term move.

4usfpm,3,2016-07-26,"I was let go from my internship halfway through. Should I include this position in my re.sume even though I was only there for a month and a half (i.e., June-July)?",Throwaway_cuzwhynot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4usfpm/i_was_let_go_from_my_internship_halfway_through/,"Hi everyone. I previously posted this in the resume advice thread, but I think I'll get more responses if I post my question here.

So, I recently graduated with my bachelor's degree in computer science, and I was fortunate enough to get hired as an intern at a software company. Though I did well during the training process and completed earlier tasks quickly and with little to no errors, I was unable to finish a larger project by my manager’s deadline. I also believe that I was working at a slower pace compared to the other interns, and as a result, I felt that I gave my manager the impression that I was slacking off on the job (even though I was just struggling to understand their development environment). Unfortunately, because I didn’t have projects in production by the end of the month and because the managers didn’t see improvement in my performance, I was let go from my internship halfway through.

Anyway, what I am most worried about is that this is the only internship opportunity I’ve had in development. Since a lot of what I did at the internship dealt with web development, I feel that I can apply those experiences towards other positions. Therefore, I was wondering if I should keep this experience on my resume even though I was only at the company for a month and a half (i.e., June-July).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

1. I am going to talk to my boss/mentor soon about a possible full time opportunity. I have half a semester of college left so I would be looking to come back starting January. How should I approach him about this? I have a few ideas how to and am pretty confident of them, but want to get other peoples views (especially people that have been talked to by an intern, or an intern who has spoken to his boss about this)

2. is that fact that i have been given the opportunity to intern here not only once, but twice give me a better shot at landing a possible full time role?

3. When applying to startup jobs, do most companies like the fact that someone has a few years of startup experience? or does it really not matter?

I wanted to study advertising and I didn't choose any other safety options.

I am kinda devastated because I see how everyone around me succeeded and I did not. It's not like I was the last one in my class, I finished 2nd in my last year and I passed the baccalaureate with 8 (that was the criteria for the admission). 

So, now that I dried my eyes, I'm trying to think about my options. 

I can still find some colleges in autumn but only with tax places, but I don't want to go to a random college just for the sake of it.

I could take a gap year, maybe travel a bit, learn new things, read a lot, and this way maybe I can discover what I really like and what I want to do in life. And after that, if I still want to follow an advertising programme in college, I would also have plenty of time to sign up for a college that has an history exam as criteria and study for that, or any other college that has an exam for admission. Plus, I could even have a chance to get a tax-free place.

But the idea with this gap year would make my parents quite sad, not only they're disappointed right now but mom would pretty much go insane if I mention it to her, she thinks I want to give up college at all.

However, I see it like the perfect plan, maybe I could work abroad a few months and this way I could afford a new camera and lenses to progress with my hobby. Or even if I don't work to get paid, maybe I can volunteer or get an internship somewhere in a advertising agency to actually see how it would be to work in that area.

I would pretty much try to do anything not to actually ""stay home"", because I live in a small and boring town and I'm sick of it.
I could start learning by myself HTML, or Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop etc., any skills that would prove useful in the future.

So, any words of wisdom ?"

4uumxq,5,2016-07-27,A little stuck in transitioning to a dev career,AdvDubs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4uumxq/a_little_stuck_in_transitioning_to_a_dev_career/,"I currently work in IT security and I'm positively desperate to get out.  I love the idea of it, but in practice the profession is glorified sysadmin but worse because I'm also the guy that has to get in the way of business all the time while having to check audit checkboxes constantly.  I just started in a new position thinking that maybe a change in scenery was what I needed, but I still dread coming in to work every day. Don't get me wrong, I know that the IT security practice is vital, but it's not for me.  For awhile now I've been struggling to figure out what else I could do for a career that I think I would be good at and I keep coming back to development.  I've come to the conclusion that I want to use my tech skills to build things, rather than obstruct people from building their stuff. 

I graduated 2 years ago with a B.S. in Information Science, which at my university was basically a sizable chunk of a CS degree with some Business, psychology and economics thrown in.  I've taken the basic CS classes (Programming Fundamentals, Discrete mathematics, OO programming, data structures) and some of the more advanced ones (Assembly, OS/Network Level programming, database design, Basic Software Security).  As part of my education I used a whole bunch of languages for various projects including Python, C, Java, Javascript, even Lisp and Racket.  Projects ranged from basics like writing a recursive Fibonacci counter in Racket to a functioning implementation of TCP that was tested against various network conditions for accuracy and throughput.  I'm also acknowledged in the errata of a published book (by one of my professors) for helping to build and test initial ideas for teaching programming concepts through basic games.  In my IT security roles since graduating I've used a smattering of python and bash to script stupid little things that I don't want to do anymore, but nothing that resembles real software development.   

I'm simply at a loss on how I can transition into a dev career because I feel kindof stuck in a weird position.  I feel like I have a pretty solid understanding of a lot of programming theory via my university degree and projects, but when I look at even junior level development positions out there, they seem to look for internships and professional experience in development which I don't have so I'm afraid that I won't cut it in the interview process.  I really loved programming in college and I was initially on a CS track, but somehow convinced myself back then that the business portion of the Information Science degree was going to be better for me. Any suggestions on potential paths to transition into a development focused career? Is my experience good enough to apply to dev jobs?

**TLDR**: Stuck in IT, desperate to get out.  I have a good amount of experience programming in college via my university degree (which consists of a good chunk of a CS degree) I obtained 2 years ago, but I have a lack of professional experience and am unsure if my knowledge of programming is good enough to be hired, so I'm looking for suggestions on things I can do to transition.

I've made very strong progress on my summer intern project, and in a lot of ways the functionality and features are ""done"". In my last couple of weeks, I think I'm going to be tasked with coordinating with a few different teams to try to get my project into some pipeline to be released in the future.

However, I feel like I've lost MAJOR daily stamina. I can concentrate on coding a new feature or debugging something for two good hours each morning, but after that I feel like my attention span is shot for the day, and I justify the work I do in a given day and push future work to the next day. 

What's frustrating is that my company/team doesn't have a lot of breaks in the day. Most of my days are wide open with no meetings scheduled. And being alone on the project, it's hard to get a feel of overall team pace on building the project, so as to feel more or less pressure to get a certain amount done each day.

Does anyone have any words of wisdom that can help me relax and/or focus a bit more? I feel considerable guilt for not getting more done each day, but I don't receive strong signals from the team about my progress/pace.

4uuyxs,37,2016-07-27,Just finished an internship with a (sort of) job offer – sharing my experiences,ryuhphino,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4uuyxs/just_finished_an_internship_with_a_sort_of_job/,"Hey all! I’ve relied a good bit on this subreddit and some of the other ones (like learnprogramming) and I wanted to take the opportunity to try and give back by sharing my experiences at my internship and a couple of the ways I handled things in order to be offered a job.

Some backstory real quick: I just finished my time at an internship which spanned over this summer for 10ish weeks. I went in as a weak programmer with a degree (C++ and Python mainly) and made it out with a job offer for when I graduate (I’m finishing my Masters). I didn’t blow people away with my programming, but rather it was how I handled myself people liked. I wanted to share some of my philosophes which helped me learn and grow so much from this internship.

1)	Be Proactive – In this I mean take the initiative for things, even if you don’t know what you’re doing. I found out near my last week that my boss actually really had a good feeling about me before I even made it to the office because when they told me what language I would be working I asked for specific details on things like APIs and such, in order to study up before I got there. It showed initiative to learn and get the job done. I did the same when new jobs came up for testing, trying new things I’ve never done before, which showed them I was willing to work and learn to get a job done. Or even if you know what you’re doing, that is even more the reason to be proactive and offer to take care of it.

2)	Get Out of Your Comfort Zone – This was another big one for me. I knew I was an intern. There was a lot I didn’t know, but it means a lot to a company to constantly show your desire to learn, even if it means working on things you don’t quite understand. Put yourself out there, and try anyways. Showing you’re willing to get out of your comfort zone shows them how you’re willing to learn to help the project out. This kind of goes along with number 1, but it means more to work on things you’ve never done before in order to learn.

3)	 Be Professional – I showed up at 7a.m. in Khakis and a Button up every day and would work out after my 8 hours. People grew a natural respect for me because I would stay to get the job done, and consistently stayed after to work out. I worked well with everyone else on the project and kept everything very professional between fellow employees. There can be drama when working with some people every day but you always have to stay professional about it and keep the job in mind. My boss at the end of it all believed me to be a ‘Team Player’ which contributed a lot to getting an offer.

4)	Programming Wasn’t the Most Important Thing – This is going to sound crazy considering programming is your JOB, but you also have to keep in mind if you work on a project with all different people, all of which are new to you at an internship so, honestly, programming becomes one of the least important things at times. Your ability to work with others, communicate properly, and ability to learn on the spot are all going to end up playing a higher role. It won’t help you be the best programmer around if you can’t properly communicate with your fellow employees.

I know this advice won’t work for everyone, but it worked very well for me, and I think can for others.  A lot of this seems pretty straight forward but when dealing with the stress of a new job sometimes it can be forgotten. I know I had plenty of off days. You just have to remember to keep the job in mind and be willing to put yourself out there. They know you aren’t a junior engineer or anything, so the goal is to learn. The test, in my opinion, is how quickly, and willing, you are to learn new skills and to learn the agile development process.

I hope this helps some, as I actually still am not a strong programmer. I was able to learn from what they had and use that to work my way up, and I definitely am better today than I was when I started, but I have a long way to go. If I can do it, I believe that everyone else can too if you have the right attitude!

Tl;dr: Some skills which helped me get a job offer after an internship were My Work Ethic, Professionalism, and my focus on the job itself, not my focus on the programming.

Would it be more beneficial for me to pursue a software engineering internship at a highly desirable company/startup or pursue a  less desirable full time job? Also I am very open to relocation (California) but I'm wondering if that's a good option for a newly grad or a better idea for someone with a couple years of experience under their belt. 

Thanks and any advice is appreciated!"
4uv6k6,1,2016-07-27,Is it possible to have a dependent drop-down with a dynamic range and illegal characters?,overconfidentginger,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/4uv6k6/is_it_possible_to_have_a_dependent_dropdown_with/,"Currently an intern and have been trying to figure this out for hours and I can't tell if I'm close.. 

I'm looking to have a drop-down list with Broad Sectors and then a second dependent list with just Sectors, some of which are named e.g. Oli &amp; Gas in the dependent column 

I've managed to create a system that works but it has the unwanted side-effect, depending on how I do it, of either 

a) Creating a limited range of cells so that the formula needs to be changed whenever sectors are added
b) Leaving blank spaces that need to be scrolled up through to reach the top due to the infinite blank spaces below

I was wondering whether it was possible to create a dynamic range which includes illegal characters in the dependent list, this is what I've currently got for the Data validation box but it doesn't work :( 

=OFFSET(INDIRECT(VLOOKUP(C31,SectorLookup,2,0,)&amp;""List""),0,0,(COUNTA(INDIRECT(VLOOKUP(C31,SectorLookup,2,0,0)&amp;""List""))),1)

Hope this makes any sense at all, I've only ever used excel in the past for making registers and shit so I'm learning all this as I go. Here's an image that I hope makes it a bit clearer http://imgur.com/inVxArG Cheers!

I am a recent graduate, I received my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from a well known University in Canada. The university offers a co-op/internship program and despite my major, most of my co-ops were software related and less on the electrical engineering side of things. 

I realized that I want to be in a software development position a bit late (in 4th year) and am not sure if my degree or my experience or skill are holding me back. I have been applying for the last 2.5 months, I know I should've started sooner while I was in my last semester and that is a mistake I will just have to live with unfortunately. I have applied to over 200 positions, been contacted for interviews by 2 big companies and around 6-7 others. I messed up on the technical interviews, but I have been studying (CTCI, Leetcode, DSA, etc.) and I know I am getting better with every interview.

Most of my internships were lacklustre and I have maybe 2 out of 5 internships where I really learned so I removed the others from my resume.

Now I am wondering why I do not get interviews from most of the places that I apply to, maybe it is a resume issue so I am attaching links to 2 of the resumes that I have made:

This is the one I have been using so far, my main resume: 

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/88911532/csq1.pdf

This is the new one I just made which shows all my work experience:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/88911532/csq2.pdf

Company 1 and company 4 were horrible waste experiences that I have nothing to say about if they ever come up in an interview so I removed those from my main resume. 

I am wondering should I keep all my experience on my resume? Is that better? 

Also, I have made 2 games in Unity (nothing major I know) but game development is my end goal. I want to end up in that industry, possibly as a gameplay programmer or tools.

Sorry if this post sounds like I am rambling, I am just wondering what I need to do to get there. A lot of the jobs I see say ""Degree in Computer Science or related field"" and am wondering if having a degree in EE is seen as a negative?

A position as a junior software developer or associate (regardless if its gamedev or anything else) is what I feel would be ideal, I really want to break into this industry but maybe I am going at it wrong and that is why I am posting here.

Thank you very much!

(Also if anyone recognizes my resume or realizes who I am, please do not expose)

Edit: Also I should add that I have no issues with location, as long as the position offers enough to get by where it is located. I have been applying all over Canada and the States, I haven't limited myself much with regards to location I feel"

The schools here are okay, nothing special compared to the schools in NC, California, TX, etc. but not particularly awful either. 

I recently visited USC and found the John E. Swearingen building to feel really depressing on the inside, however I am aware that an IBM-funded Innovation Center is being built where many CS, EE, and CompE classes will be moved to. As far as Clemson is concerned, all I know is that they have a strong overall engineering program, however I'm not sure how well this translates into the quality of CS program. Similarly, I don't know very much about CofC either except knowing that they have a data science major and there being a startup culture in Charleston, which seems interesting.

Anyway, this is all I know about CS in my state. I do plan on applying OOS to top colleges, however staying in-state is still an option due to the scholarship programs here. Between USC, Clemson, and CofC, which school is best in terms of internships, job outlook at top companies/CS firms, and overall CS education?

I am a B.S. and M.S. engineering graduate. I had very good GPA, significant research and engineering experience (internships, consulting, various other projects), academic achievements and awards, and even a patent.

&amp;nbsp;

Since my job search hasn't been going so well, I've been building profiles on various job and career sites.

&amp;nbsp;

However, I have been receiving many solicitations for Insurance or Financial positions. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've looked up these positions and they look like bottom-of-the-barrel deals. However, I'm perplexed by the fact that they are contacting a candidate clearly geared towards engineering-science positions.

&amp;nbsp;

Other than the fact that I was (and am) a high performer across the board, does anyone know why this might be?"

Wednesdays are half days for me. I don’t have to go in until one in the afternoon, and I get to leave normal time, six at night - a.k.a. prime drinking hour to my friends. So, since some were still in the area, and we were all still close friends, we had planned a drinking night. I could get as drunk as I wanted and not have to worry about the hangover tomorrow (Thursday’s are one of my two days off). Drinking and drinking excessively with friends was exactly what I needed after ten days of utter bullshit. 

My alarm woke me up promptly at five-thirty. I pressed off but then Scotty jumped on me with his leash. Coerced into exercise by adorableness, I was thankful the town park was a short walk away so that I didn’t have to drive anywhere when rush hour was just about to start. An hour later, when we got back, Niex was in the kitchen, the smell of coffee permeating the air and making me perk up. Scotty bounded past me to his water bowl once I released him and I meandered over to the other side of kitchen. Instead of the usual jeans and button down that Niex would wear, he was in what looked like to be a fully tailored suit. I felt under dressed in my pink running shorts and college sweatshirt. 

“Where were you this morning?” He asked, watching as the coffee maker finished up. He poured himself a cup and tried it black.  

“Scotty wanted to go for a walk, so I took him,” I said, pulling out the sugar and a mug for myself. Niex immediately dumped about five spoonfuls into his coffee. “Where’d you get the suit?”

“I know a guy,” he answered. 

My eyes involuntarily rolled. *Cryptics. Joy.*

“You’ve spent ten days on earth, only five of which you spent actually outside of this house. How could you have possibly found a tailor already?” 

“You think I spend the past seven years in prison doing nothing?”

*Yes*. “I dunno.”

Niex looked insulted. “I’m a businessman. While I may have been unable to attend meetings, I was still able to delegate my representative. How do you think I got that phone so fast?”

“I just figured you stole it.” 

“No. And even if I hadn’t been working while in prison, I’d been doing business on Earth for years before my imprisonment.”

“Why Earth? I thought you hated humans.”

“I find that your kind is too easily influenced by the range of emotions you have. It makes you weak.”

*Says the guy who bought a dog on whim.* “Mm. I see.”

“But that also makes you a good market. Plus, if that ship hadn’t broken down, they’d never suspect me of being on Earth.”

I glared at the cream in my coffee. “So why the suit?”

“I have a meeting with some business associates. Breakfast.”

“Ah.”

“Which brings up the question - why are you not at work? Normally you’d be rushing out the door at 6.”

“I don’t have to go in until noon today,” I answered, turning on the television and sitting down with my coffee. Scotty rested on the floor next to me. 

Niex glanced briefly at the morning news show before he grabbed his car keys and left without so much as a goodbye. 

Once his car was down the street, I was bored of the news. I changed the input on the television to my x-box and opened up Netflix. *The Walking Dead* had been neglected by me for too long. 

When Niex returned two hours later, I was sobbing to the credits and had to stop the next episode from playing. 

“What’s wrong with your face?” Niex asked, blocking my view of the screen.

“I’m an emotional trainwreck,” I answered. *And a sympathetic crier and a sucker for family values.*

“So your eyes leak?”

“I’m crying, asshole.”

“Well stop it.”

“Easier said than done.” I wiped my face and stood. Niex glanced at the screen, the titles of available shows and movies up now that I had exited the show. “You can watch something if you’d like.”

Scotty growled protectively over the couch. I flicked him on the nose to get him to stop.

Niex glared, “I’m busy.” He stormed off up the stairs.

Kristoph Caper had invaded my workspace, a woman dangling off his arm as they strolled right past the cowed intern. 

“And this is where we keep all the artifacts and information not currently being displayed anywhere,” he said, turning to show off the massive filing cabinet that was the basement. I looked at the woman. She wore a butt length dress that lacked a distinguishable neckline, a designer purse, three inch heels, gold hoop earrings that were pulling her lobes down, and an excessive amount of rings . I tried not to judge, I swear. 

“Get out, Kristoph,” I snapped, slamming the drawer of the cabinet I was at shut. “I’m still cleaning up from the last one you brought down here.”

Kristoph smiled, “Charming as ever, Calla.”

I glared, clipboard in hand. “I’m serious. You’ve got to stop showing this room to…” I debated on outright insulting the woman or not, “Your totems.”

She looked hurt. I instantly felt guilty.

“Fine, fine,” Kristoph waved it off. I knew nothing would change. “More interesting things upstairs anyway.”

The pair exited the room and I made a face - some mix of disgust and relief. The intern gave me a look. 

“Is it a human custom to always have a new partner every week or is that only for Mister Caper?”

“Kristoph Caper is the absolute worst womanizer alive. He has a new partner any time he wants one, which is usually every other day,” I answered. Then gave them a pleading look. “For the love of all that is good in this world, do not base your expectations of humans off of that man and anyone who he keeps in his company.”

The intern nodded, and scratched some notes down. I looked at my clipboard and moved onto the Maori section of the room.

I’d been duped. This wasn’t a get together and go bar crawling with the girls night. This was a last minute attempt at a mixer to try and pair up all the single friends. I glared at the couple who had tricked us all into coming, stormed over to the bar and ordered a piña colada. Some of my more sociable friends immediately jumped on the opportunity and drinks were being bought for pairs. 

I may have been too harsh, but meeting new people was never my strong point, and flirting has always gone right over my head. In other words - I don’t really *do* parties. I tend to stand in a corner and admire the wall paper once my only friend has abandoned me to the hoards. 

“You get tricked too?” A friendly voice asked. To my right was a guy that looked about my age, average looking, with rimless glasses covering his hazel eyes. 

“Yeah,” I answered, wiping the condensation off of my glass. “I was really looking forward to a girls night out.”

He huffed out a laugh. “I feel that.”

“You’re not going to try and talk to me all night, are you? ‘Cause I kind of came here to drink.”

“So was I. Just figured there’d be no harm in sitting next to you while I drink.”

“It’s a free country.”

“So it is.”

*…*

“My name’s Calla, by the way.”

“George.” We shook hands. I looked anywhere but at him. 

A Blue Moon was placed in front of him. “What happened to not talking?”

I grinned and sipped my drink. “I’m not really good with silence.”

George laughed. 

Another piña colada and a Strongbow and a half later, I was laughing my ass off at almost every joke being tossed my way and unable to sit without leaning on the counter. I think at least an hour had passed at that point, but the clock was fuzzy because of the distance so I gave up, not wanting to even look at my phone. The bar’s noise level had been steadily increasing, as people talked and music was turned up, and the mood lighting had been set. 

“You seem to be drinking a lot,” George noted. He’d only just started on his second Blue Moon. 

“I’m stressed,” I said, blowing hair out of my face and smiling sloppily. I’m a lightweight and not ashamed. 

“About?”

“Eeeeeeverything.” My head shook a little with the answer and I got a little dizzy. “My boss is a womanizing dick and my new housemate is a fucking ass.”

“Where do you work?”

“The MHH.”

“Oh, nice museum. I’ve heard Caper’s a bit difficult to work with.”

I rolled my eyes and stuck out my tongue. “That’s an understatement.” My hand waved for the bartender, “Rum and coke please.”

My future most definitely included a bright white porcelain. 

“What makes you say that?”

“I want ‘nother drink?” 

He laughed over his drink. “No, as to why working with Caper is a pain.”

“Ooh. Because he’s annoying, always brings unauthorized people down into the archives, has absolutely no self control, and loves money and himself.”

“Pay must be good though.”

“It’s fucking amazing. Best library job. Ever.” I stared at him, the cool of the counter nice against my face. “What ‘bout you? What’d’you do?”

“I work with the embassy.”

“Which?”

“The planetary one.”

“Fun. Must meet lots of interesting characters.” I went to drink again but was met with only ice-cubes. “‘Nother one please.”
“It’s okay, I don’t really do much though.”

“Trust me, anything sounds fun when you organize shit for a living.”

He laughed again. My other drink arrived. Everyone else in the group of our friends had started challenging each other to karaoke dules and all around having a good time. 

“So, what exactly d’you do?” I pressed, trying to not down my drink whole again. 

“I’m part of the research division. We basically collect data and information for the ambassador and keep records of all visiting aliens and travelling humans. It’s mostly so that we can keep track of everyone in case someone, God forbid, gets in trouble. It’s not perfect, since people can still move around once they’re outside of our jurisdiction, but it at least gives us the reason they came and where they headed to first.”

“So, you guys must be exploding with this escaped convict escapade huh?”

“We’re mostly just glad we’re not getting shit for it, since it wasn’t our prison or jurisdiction . But the other part of my job is to research any aliens for the ambassador if one of their own ambassadors is visiting, or if we never heard of them before.”

“Like the Aestians? Where do you even find this information?”

“The federation has a database of all known species. Aestians were a pain in the ass to find though. They’re as old as the Sorainias, so not much is really known.”

I must’ve given a look of confusion, ‘cause George explained. “Sorainians are one of the oldest species in the federation - they actually started it. Anyway, because the Aestians are basically an entire race of Mystiques, what records we do have of them is completely useless. All we really know for certain is that because they can shapeshift, they’ve basically become the intergalactic monopoly race for espionage and sabotage. It’s an unproven fact that they’re have played a hand in all immediate causes for all interplanetary slash interspecies wars. Some of the scholars say that they do it because they enjoy creating chaos, the money is just an added bonus.”

*Sounds like Niex.* I thought. I looked down at my rum and coke and noticed it was gone. “So then how do they know this guy’s forms?”

“Some law that was basically forced on them to release their records for the registered forms of each Aestian that traveled off planet. So I’m guessing that when they caught him, they got this and had him shift into each one for the different mug shots.” George shrugged and sipped his beer. “They’re a pain in the ass to work with, to be honest.”

“Are they not helping?” I asked. *If they’re all like Niex than I can see the entire planet collective making things difficult just to cause a little distress.*

“Just barely. I think they want to catch him as much as everyone else, but it seems to be for different reasons. They never share anything, and they act like they’re either neurotic about the whole situation or perfectly fine with him having escaped.”

I choked back a laugh and stood up to go to the bathroom. Everything was unclear and I was dizzy as all hell, but I tried to maintain my balance and not make a fool of myself. When I got back, there was another rum and coke waiting for me. George watched as I sat down, his third beer finally opened, and made sure I didn’t fall over. 

“So, your housemate?” George asked, sipping his beer. 

“Ugh. Don’t even get me started. He’s a fucking complete soulless bastard.”

“Hellspawn?”

“The absolute worst kind. He’s always mocking me, ‘s bull headed, incompetent, impulsive, obnoxious, full of ‘imself, in you face, childish,” I was listing off with my fingers, pushing away from the bar. “He’s the kind of guy who just barges into your life with no warning and expects you to bed light and your life around him to suit his needs. It’s just so fucking annoying!”

The liquor on the shelf went past as I fell back. I expected to hit my head on cold floor, scrape my knees against the bar even. Did not expect to be stopped by a wall of finely made cloth. 

I blinked up, intending to apologize to whoever I had just accidentally disturbed. Grey eyes smirked down. “What about me?”

I scrambled away and pressed my back into the bar. Niex looked about to laugh so I glared. “What’re you doin’ ‘ere?”

“Is this the guy?” George asked me in a whisper. I only nodded. 

A man came from the back room before Niex could answer me. His face was flushed from drinking and even I hadn’t run into a table. I don’t think. “Mister Vicariot! It’s such an honor to finally be able to - hiccup.”

Niex glared at the man but the intoxicated idiot didn’t notice. He only approached further, extending his hand. I saw Niex’s hand twitch, but instead of punching the man (like I expected), he firmly grasped it.

“The pleasure is mine, Mister Pinsotti. Please, call me Jonathan.” Niex smiled as the man insisted on being called Louis then. I shivered at the sight. “I’ll join you in a moment. Simply finishing up a conversation with this lovely young lady.”

The man looked at me, smiled, and clasped Niex on the shoulder. “Ah yes, of course, of course. I understand completely. Come to the back when you’ve sorted things out, yes?”

I gagged at the implications, reached for my drink and downed it to burn out the vomit taste in my mouth. Niex  continued to smile. George had turned around to try and avoid getting involved, nursing his beer and making himself smaller. Once the man had disappeared back into the back room, Niex forced himself between George and I, flagging down the bartender. 

“Yes?”

“Anything this one,” he pointed at me, “has had and will have you can put on a tab for me. I’ll get the receipt when I come to collect her.”

“Hey!” I snapped indignantly. “I can pay for myself. I’m not as broke as you seem to think I am! And what makes you think that I’d be -”

“You’re too drunk to even walk to the subway properly,” he interrupted. “I don’t believe you’ll stop drinking anytime soon, it’s half past eight and no amount of time on the train is going to make it safe for you to drive back from the train station. I drove down here, I’ll take you.”

“She could always stay at my place,” George offered up as an out. “I don’t live too far away.”

Niex paused in his thought process, turned around and looked at George. He glanced down and then back up, sizing up my companion. “What unfortunate circumstances caused you to exist?”

Even the bartender flinched. 

“God! Why are you so mean!” I shouted. Some other patrons looked away. “It’s like you never got punished for anything so you think you can do anything! What god gave you the all powerful right to be an asshole?!”

Paper was shoved in my mouth. I spat it out and promised myself to smother the bastard in his sleep. 

“Shut up, would you Calla?” Niex had another drink brought to me. He turned towards George. “If I come back out of that room and find the two of you have run away, I’ll hunt you down and gut you. I’ve heard that long pig sells wonderfully on the galactic meat market.”

George’s pale face reflected my own as Niex left us. “See what I mean.”

“No wonder  you needed a fucking drink. Does he act like that all the time?”

“The threats are always present, but the bossy attitude is on point.”

George raised his eyebrows in agreement. I downed the new drink and then glared at it. If he was going to pay for me then I might as well make his bill as high as I could. Bastard deserves it. Smiling broadly, I asked for the most expensive liquor the bar had. The bartender asked if I was sure,and then placed a shot of a deep blue drink in front of me. The air around it was sort of fruity, which made me think that it couldn’t be that bad. 

“Take this, you bastard,” I toasted. 

George gave me a worried look. “Do you know what that is?”

“No, but it smells good.”

“It’s called Demon’s blood. It’s basically Belphanegm moonshine.”

“Aaand?”

“Belphagora isn’t exactly known for its serenity and diplomacy with other planets.”

“So? They wouldn’t be serving it if it was dangerous.” There was definitely a flaw to my logic, but George saw me as a lost cause. 

George sighed. “It’s a free country.”

I grinned and downed the shot. 

*Holy shit fruit.* It was like pouring berry honey down my throat. There was barely a burn and it tasted amazing. I had another one immediately. George watched uneasily as I downed it quickly. I waited a bit to ask for another, savoring the other two. When I did go to ask for another, I stopped halfway. Everything started mixing together and I couldn’t tell one face from another. The lights, even though they were at half power, got brighter and the noise became muted.

“Calla you okay?” George asked. His face looked more like something out of a cartoon.

“Even the alien patrons tend to shy away from that one.” The bartender, I think. It was really hard to distinguish anything from everything else. A bird flew past my face and I turned to follow it. Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw my mom and tried to hide my face. Looking down at the floor, it was more like grass and I wondered, briefly how the hell they managed that. I giggled and rested my head against the bar again, and closed my eyes to savor the coolness. 

“Calla-”

“Mm. Shh.”

“Calla, you need to wake up.” A hand shook me. 

“No. I dun wanna.” 

*His* voice was the next to try. “If you don’t wake up in ten seconds I’ll leave your body exposed in a ditch. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.”

I groaned and managed to pull myself up. 

“Oh good, you’re awake,” Niex snapped, looking at his wristwatch.

“I didn’t-” I looked around. I was still in the bar. Still drunk as all hell with George still watching over me.

“Devil’s blood affects everyone differently. You seemed to have a milder reaction to it than some of the others I’ve seen,” Niex explained, picking up my untouched shot glass and downing it in one go. He paid the bartender with cash.  

“How’d you know-?” George began to ask, but Niex had already started a habit of cutting him off. 

“I’ve spent the past ten years doing business in space. With the joining of Earth to the Intergalactic Federation, a whole new market opened up to me. I had the pleasure of spending a year on Belphagora while trying to establish a branch out there. They drink this stuff like it’s nectar from the gods.”

*Lies. So good at lying.* I thought.

“Well, now that I’ve-” I wobbled when I stood, my body not prepared to take it’s own weight. To my utter annoyance, Niex caught me, throwing one of my arms over his shoulder.

“Yes, yes. Let’s get you out of here.” He supported me out into the side of the road and shoved me into the passenger side of the camaro. The engine roared and then we were navigating the New York City roads, trying to make our way onto the Major Deegan Expressway. I avoided talking, watching the lights and buildings meld together as we drove by. The expressway was mostly empty, being about ten when we finally got to it. Nothing other than the usual construction delays really got in the way of us making our way back north. The silence was nice.

“Do humans always drink excessively?” Niex ruined it. 

“What, you never drink because you don’t want to deal with your problems?” I asked, turning in my seat. 

“I drink. Not with the vigor that you had tonight though.”

I scoffed, a smirk showing through. “I find that hard to believe.”

“Why’s that?”

“Pirate.”

Niex glared. “Piracy is more than just what you humans have concocted as the iconic drunken rapscallion.”

“Oh really? I wouldn’t know since I’m not a pirate!”

He sighed. “You’re too intoxicated for anything to pass through -”

“And while we’re on the subject, just how the hell do you have business connections after only ten days on Earth?”

“I explained-”

“I mean really! That’s just impossible! Even if you are some suave crime lord who could probably overthrow the devil and start eating souls, you just shouldn’t have connections that are fawning over you already! No matter if you were working while in prison, most people want to meet the person they’re working with, it’s just a good policy. You can’t trust someone who you’ve never met before! And furthermore-”

“Would you shut up! For the love of Signan, woman, you’re too chatty when you drink!”

I slumped in my seat and Niex slowed down. I hadn’t noticed that he had sped up in his agitation. The exit for the Taconic was coming up on our right. 

“I already told you that I’d been doing business on Earth prior to being incarcerated. Jonathan Vicariot is my human alias, and my second in command has been setting up the background and framework for him. He’s had open accounts and solid  business on Earth for a good fifteen years. As far as records go, he’s clean because all my… Other business is done through alternate means. All the business people I’ve been meeting with on Earth haven’t seen him, first because of health reasons and then again because we had him travelling space to do business. Your friend at the bar can even look for a Visa for him and it’ll be there.”

“Then why would such a successful businessman be renting out an attic in a suburban home?”

“Does a wealthy person really need to explain why they do anything? I could simply wrire it off as needing fresh air for my health.”

My stomach gurgled. “You’re going to need some fresh air if you don’t pull over right now.”

“What?”

“I’m gonna puke.”

“You better fucking not. Not in this car. These seats are fucking leather.” He pulled over hastily. 

*Just like him to be more worried about his car than my health.*  I thought, pushing the door open and emptying out the contents of my stomach. After a minute, I spat out the rest to try and remove the taste. 

“Are you done yet?” He asked. I nodded, closed the door, and rested as he drove back home. 

---

After a shower, I fell onto my bed and pulled out my phone. It had died during the night, so I plugged it in and watched as it exploded with messages. There was at least twenty from my best friend, and a missed phone call from her. And then another from a number I didn’t recognize. 

*Hey, it’s George. You probably don’t remember giving me your number. Just wanted to make sure you got home alright.*

I flipped onto my back and typed out a quick reply. *Yeah. Thanks for making sure I didn’t get kidnapped.*

*Haha. No problem.*

I paused and went to the other twenty something messages.

*Calla, who is that?*

*Calla, Calla.*

*Seriously, answer the phone*

*Is your phone dead?*

*Who is that man?*

*You just left the bar with him?!*

*How could you not introduce me to your potential kidnapper/rapist?*

*If I wake up to news of your dead body in the Hudson, I’m going to tell your grave I told you so every day*

*Calla. At least you had an attractive killer.*

*You could say, he kill you with his look ;D*

I groaned. *Jesus fuck, Ash, he’s my fucking housemate. You know, the annoying one who should promptly die in the fires of hell.*

*Nice to know you’re alive*

*Go to sleep*

*Still drinking my sorrows away*

I sighed and put my phone on the night stand. The door to my room opened and Scotty ran in. I looked up and saw Niex standing there. 

“What?” I asked. 

“Nothing.” He turned around and pulled down the stairs to the attic. I had to get up to close my door. 

“Good night to you too,” I muttered, pushing my door closed. Scotty nestled into the blankets as I lay back down and passed out.

* Programmer with a degree from University of Maryland in Computer Science. 3 years proffessional work experience

* Interested in the field of politics long term

* Don't want to go to law school. Paid my way through undergrad and that was painful enough

* Am willing to do volunteer work as long as it's not an unpaid internship. I have a 10-6 M-F gig at the moment that I need to pay my mortgage

* Am willing to spend several years volunteering before making a full time switch. Need to save up a chunk of change before accepting a lower paying career path.

* Would like if my volunteer work was tech oriented(IT, web programming, application programming, security, etc) but certainly not a must

Any advice on the best path forward? Is it unreasonable to want to get into politics without a political science or law degree?

I'm a recent grad non-traditional student (age 27). I did well in my CS program but never interned. I didn't really realize until late in the game how important this was (I wish I had found this sub earlier). 

I'm getting some hits in my job search, but I'm almost scared at the prospect of getting a job. I feel like experience as an intern where I learn a lot without the fear of high expectations would have been valuable.

As a junior dev, am I going to lose out on that experience? I'm afraid of being thrown to the wolves and just failing right away. And once I fail at one place, how hard is it going to be to land another gig?"

I'm kind of freaking out a bit. I wasn't able to get a summer internship this year, and I know I need one next summer. However, I feel like the only thing I have going for me is good grades. 
 
I was a peer tutor this past year in Math and Science, and I'm only part of one club that does Engineering-based projects to help the community. But I don't think I really have any relevant experience for any Electrical Engineering or Software Engineering jobs.  

Does anyone have any advice on how I can improve my resume so that I can get hired for a summer internship next year. I have a month of 100% free time just to work on whatever it takes, and I'm willing to work extremely hard on developing real work experience this next school year even it means a slight drop in grades.  

If it's relevant, I go to Texas A&amp;M University.  

Thank you anyone who takes the time to reply. I'm kinda freaking out because people always say your GPA doesn't matter to get a job, rather your work experience does, and I have nothing but a good GPA.

So I was taken into an early stage company as an intern for general SEO improvement (and to learn an unbelievable amount).

I've done the typical dynamic meta/title work, image alts, as well as revamped their social in/outbound linkage. 

I think as a low level young intern this is as good as I can get it, right?

The issue now is they are claiming that it was a great start but it seems they are now waiting for phase 2 of modifications. 

I've read dozens of articles and reached out to multiple full-time engineers and nobody seems to have any ideas of what more I can do in terms of SEO.

Does anybody have advice for a nervous intern like me? Should I simply say ""there's nothing else to do?"" or something like ""what do you expect?""

I can't tell if I'm severely inadequate for my role or if this manager has unrealistic expectations. 

Is there a whole world of SEO I'm missing?"

I also took a contract position for a year that gave me so much real world experience, I feel ready for anything. 

For the last year and a half I have been working at a QA automation company, but recently left because I was more interested in the automation side of things versus the QA side and the job was paying terribly. 

I would love to get into DevOps, as I had the opportunity to help with deploys and creating tools to use. The bad thing is that there is no way to get into a role like that without having experience doing it. 

I am also open to returning to a developer role, but again, it seems I don't have enough experience for most places. I have a decent portfolio of some of my side projects including websites I've created, desktop applications, and some bots I've made for personal uses like sneaker bots and IFTTT node scripts for a ton of tasks. 

Lastly, I live in north Louisiana, which seems to be one of the worst markets for software development. I would love to work with cutting edge technology and contribute in any way possible while learning as much as possible... That's not happening in north Louisiana, and can't/don't want to move. 

I have applied for over 35-40 jobs via Stack Overflow, company websites, angelslist, and any other listing that looks like a great fit. Most of them say they are looking for more experience since I've only been out of college one year. 

ANY help is greatly appreciated, guys. Feedback on this post is even appreciated. How can I do better in getting myself established? "

4uy10r,3,2016-07-27,My best friend and I are at each other's throats.,roommate6093,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/4uy10r/my_best_friend_and_i_are_at_each_others_throats/,"I'm not sure if anyone will read this but I just needed to vent somewhere. I met my best friend, let's call him D, in fifth grade and we've always been super close. We had all of our highschool classes together and even have the same job. When we graduated from our very small highschool we both got accepted to the same college, which is the flagship university of the state. I moved into an apartment my second year, and he moved in a couple months after. 

Now I know what people say about having friends as roommates but and we had zero problems for the first year, and loved living together. However, he flunked out of the state school and had to enroll in the local community college. Then the next semester he flunked out of there and went to working full time. 

The entire time this was going on, I was doing pretty well in college.  I really don't mean to sound pretentious but I had always been a sort of introvert my entire life, but finally came out of my shell in college. I went from having a small circle of friends from highschool to joining a huge club in the business college, which meant I went to every single football game (which are huge at my school), and parties every weekend. I tried to get him involved with my friends and at least keep him in the loop, but he refused every invite, opting to stay at our apartment with his girlfriend.

Like I said before, he slowly started getting colder towards me. Before, we play video games together all the time, usually in the same room, but now when I ask him, he declines and goes straight to his room without a word and shuts the door. We used to split doing the chores (dishes, vacuuming, trash, etc) with no problem,  but he had stopped doing it completely, letting everything pile up until I caved in and cleaned all of it myself, everytime. Whereas before we would have all of our shifts together at work and carpool every shift, he secretly requested to be scheduled opposite shifts as me. It has now gotten to the point where he is openly aggressive, refusing to do any chores, having little to no contact, and leaving messes out on purpose for me to clean (I am a very clean person and hate having a dirty apartment.) Just the other day I put up a decoration in the main room, only to find it torn down and thrown in my room when I came home from work.

I just don't understand where all of this hostility is coming from. I tried to include him with my new group of friends, and he refused. I never thought less of him for flunking out, and even helped him with his studies at the Community College, and he still wants nothing to do with me. I'll admit, we are both very closed people, we do not talk openly about our feelings. But the passive aggressiveness his starting to come to a head.

I'm now on the brink of cancelling my lease and moving somewhere else while I finish up my last year of undergrad and go for my Masters, but I have no one else to live with. All of my other friends are either already living somewhere, or can't afford to move out.

So this bring me to what's been my situation this entire summer: I've been working 65 hours a week between my summer internship and regular job, and every day I come home to him playing video games in silence in a filthy apartment, where I have to try and find time to clean myself since he won't do it. He completely ignores me every time I talk to him, and avoids me when our shifts at work overlap. The only theory I have for his attitude is the fact that I'm doing well in college and he flunked out. I have a big group of friends and an active social life and he still hangs out with our highschool friends, all 4 of them. Again, I don't act like i'm better than him in any way, and try to get him involved every chance I get. I just think it's unfair that I moved on while he didn't and he's now taking it out on me. 

Can someone please empathize with me, or at least tell me i'm a huge jerk, since I obviously can't see it

Thank you for reading.

Also, how do I go about finding internships geared towards front-end? Back-end ones are super easy to find, but I'm having a more difficult time trying to find front-end.

For those that are curious, I started at OSU last fall on the 1 year track, and will be graduating in 16 days (but who's counting?). I got contacted by a Google recruiter in late March, after attending two hackathons which they were sponsors of. I did the online coding assessment in April, a phone technical interview in May, an onsite interview with 4 sessions in June, then got called back for 2 more technical interviews over Hangouts two weeks ago. The whole process is an exhausting gauntlet but evidently it's paid off! I initially interviewed for a full software engineer position, but given my lack of industry experience, they felt the residency program -- essentially a year long internship with the option to convert to a full engineer position at the end -- was a better fit for me. I'm so relieved this process is over and that it all worked out haha! Plus I've wanted to live and work in New York since a college visit there way back in high school!

I'm going to be a junior this fall and I don't know if I should work my ass off in high school, I have a 3.33 overall gpa. Or, should I go to a community college and work my ass off there and possibly get into a good UC I don't know how this shit works. I have people telling me it''s easier to get into a good college after 2 years of undergrad and others telling me to work my ass of the last two years of high school. I'm just not sure if that would make a difference because I don't know what colleges want. Especially UC's. 

Also how do you get a job that makes a least 6 figures. I've heard of people having a job that's not even close to their major and they are making a lot of money. I want to become some type of engineer, mechanical, electronic, computer doesn't really matter. Though, if there is a job that would pay better I would probably take it. 

Lastly, should I start working in that kind of field, maybe an internship or something over the summer. Another Job i'm thinking about is being a chief, for that job should I work at a restaurant, climb up the ladder or what. Do I go to culinary school and get a job as a chief, or do I still have to pay my dues. 

This is so confusing, I want a job that pays well, but I have no Idea how to get it. Specially, with the shitty economy we have right now. I'm only expecting it to get worse, and make it worst for the next generation to get a descent job.

My other peers did this same interview and they performed well.  Feeling pretty bad right now.  In fact, this feeling has just permeated my entire career so now I'm seriously considering a career switch.  I decided to put my whole story since maybe it'll give you some idea of what would be a good fit.  So please sit down, relax, have a cup of joe... or just scroll down to the bottom for a synopsis. :)

Throughout my career (and college) I've felt pretty insecure about my abilities.  It became pretty obvious to me when I was in school that I wasn't all that 'mathy' and I just didn't learn as quickly as the rest of my peers.  I went to one of the best schools in my country for CS (my marks were shit though), I've had positive feedback about my work in my internships and full-time work, and a single instance of negative feedback that just killed me (""the only good female developer is X"", where X was not me).  I constantly toy with the idea of being a UX designer, a UX researcher, a tester, a project manager, a product manager, a developer advocate, tech support or just someone who is involved in the tech scene and can code, but is in more of a supportive role to the developers.  I like to code (less so now) but never to the same extent as my coworkers, especially the ones who've been programming since childhood, and unlike them, I don't code at all when I get home.  I would classify myself as a developer who can quickly prototype stuff, make the UI look elegant (this is the only thing I'm actually very confident in) and I'm pretty versatile in terms of the frameworks and languages I've used (though most people are anyway).  There is a willingness I've noticed in me to try to always go above and beyond at work and I'm not one to ever turn away work because it's 'below me' or anything like that.  I am a workhorse and tend to take on too many things and burn myself out in the process.  However, when it comes to the theory and proving myself in an interview, I just suck a lot.  I'm fine when it comes to performance reviews, but I have never been considered for a management role.  I work well without much supervision (it's preferred actually) and I rarely ask for help, but there's just something about my general demeanour or lack of self-confidence that has never put me in a leadership role.  There was one guy at work who wanted to have more female stakeholders and even went to our lab head to set me up for a leadership role since he had heard wonderful things about me, but it just never panned out and I felt too weird about following up.  I feel inadequate almost daily though.  Still, I can't think of a better career for myself since I've always had an interest in computers.

As a kid, I used to watch this computer show, and would read almost every kid's computer book at the library.  I started developing later than my peers, but I felt like I always had an affinity to 'computers' throughout my childhood.


I went to an all-girls high school that had a slight emphasis on math and sciences, but I didn't really have any other friends who got into a STEM field.  (As an aside, it's not all that necessary for me to mention it was all-girls, but maybe it is important to my story?  Lately I've been asked to be part of a few initiatives at work to help promote women in tech.  I really dislike that whole dialogue and get a little embarrassed by it honestly, since I am mediocre at best but anyways, that's just my low self-esteem talking)...  Anyway,  high school is when my interest waned a fair bit, but even so, I would still work on webpages throughout high school, was pretty ok with my math abilities and was part of the computer science club.  I didn't really want to be part of the computer science club since my friends would roast me about it (not seriously or anything), and I mostly did it because my math teacher, also the supervisor for the club, really liked me and wanted me to be a part of it.  I happened to do very well in her math classes so she thought highly of me.  However, she did ask me one logic question (I suck at logic... weird that I became a programmer, right?) and after that, she advised me to get into law instead of math/cs.  I felt weird after that, but I still ended up getting into CS.  I have regrets about not doing more CS-ey stuff in high school, but I was really boy crazy and had stupid priorities. lol

Cut to university and I just felt like a total idiot.  So many other people would outperform me to the point where I just stopped caring and the only reason why I didn't drop out and switch careers was because I enjoyed my internships so much.  Most of the coding I ever did in school was during my internships.  If I had a group project, I was almost always on documentation (it was a huge chunk of the grade anyway haha).  I am eternally grateful for my internships as they helped me pay off my tuition and gave me the financial stability I needed since childhood.

I've been working full-time for close to 10 years now and I'm thinking maybe there is some weird hybrid role I can do so that I can feel wonderfully confident in my role.  I either need to start affirming that I am a great developer and resign myself to doing 100 interviews as practice or just freaking switch out of development altogether.  So I know I'm in the right field, but I just don't know what my role would be.  If you have any suggestions, I'm definitely open to it.  I'm not the young, impressionistic kid anymore but I'm also not terribly old either.  Feeling a little bummed right now.  I'll probably read through this again after I posted and be like, geez!  I am one depressed mofo.  But yeah, this is probably the lowest I've felt about my career and any sage advice or words of encouragement are definitely welcome!

I feel that the only thing that sets me apart from the next developer is that I really, seriously care about the aesthetics of the product.  I have no portfolio, I can't draw for shit but I am sensitive to placement of stuff and how things look and my 'eye' is usually aligned with the ux designer's eye if that makes any sense.  I just feel like others may notice these things but it just bugs them less or something.  Unfortunately, there is no hybrid role for that, at least not one I've seen.  I either need to just be the UI developer or the UI designer.  I bet a startup would be fantastic with that as I'd have to wear many hats anyway.  Thoughts?

I'm now two months into an internship as a software engineer and everyday after I get home my eyes are completely dead. They're very red, irritated, constantly itching. 
I take a short 2/3 min break every hour to look outside a window next to my desk. For the last year I haven't spent any time AT ALL on a computer or watching TV when at home. But nothing I do is enough.

My eyes are continuing to get worse and worse.

The last two months alone have me considering changing my career because I don't want to be blind by the time I'm 40.

Anyone else have a similar experience?"

I'll be a student full-time, with my first semester (and probably second) being 9 credits, or 3 classes.

I also have an opportunity to accept a part-time internship while I am studying. The internship asks for 15-20 hours a week. It is on my school's campus, so commute time isn't really an issue.

Has anyone done a full time masters and part time working? I wanted to gauge some opinions on whether this is feasible or whether I am tackling too much work.

As an undergrad, I took a couple of graduate courses and never felt overwhelmed. I've also been successful academically, so I haven't struggled yet. However, I know that going full-time grad school is completely different than undergrad, so I'm not sure how well I can handle it.

At the same time, I also want to earn some money and get more experience. If I take this internship and do well, they would continue me through to the summer. I currently have a return offer to my current internship, but want to try something else, so that is a nice benefit. I'm not short on money, so I don't need to do this financially, but taking the position would give me more security and open up my options for fun.

Thanks for the help!

4v15lr,0,2016-07-28,Question about getting a Masters degree.,MelosMojo,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/4v15lr/question_about_getting_a_masters_degree/,"Hi guys,

So I am on track to graduate in Spring 2017 with a Bachelors in Industrial and Systems Engineering from a top 15 public school in the US. I am unsure if it would be worthwhile for me to go for the Masters program here or not. The undergrad program has given me a solid foundation in math, statistics, programming, and operations research. Ideally, I would get a job in data science right after graduation but I don't know if I have enough experience. What I DO have on my resume, however, is an assistant research position at my school's Center for Applied Optimization (the CAO is an office within the ISE dept.) and I am currently spending my summer as a Business Development intern at a major materials supplier. A little bit of background on these two things:

The research: Our project (I work with a PhD student) involves studying the network of Facebook ""Likes"". Basically we have a large, two-column datatable of FB users paired with something that a user liked on FB (this can be websites/links/companies etc - but everything has been converted to integers). I have been calculating the degrees in/out at each node, average path length, clustering coefficients, centrality, etc. of this network all using C#. We want to compare this network to the network of FB friends as well as other social networks. I used SQL pretty extensively in the initial stages when we were figuring out what datatable we wanted to use. I will be receiving a stipend for my work this coming year and we plan on writing a paper and submitting it for publication at our school.

The internship - I am currently writing a C# program (WinForms application in Visual studio) that essentially takes in messy .csv and Excel files, cleans them up, extracts necessary information and outputs that information as a new table into a new/existing Excel file or an Access database file. SQL commands are used but its mainly the basic select and insert statements. There are hundreds of these messy files that I have to process and a lot of them take a different form than the rest, and so developing the cleaning mechanism has been hands down the biggest challenge, but I am making significant progress.

As a side note, I don't know much about python yet, but I plan on learning it and becoming fluent before graduation.

Now that you know what my experience entails, do you guys think it would be worth it to pursue the Masters in Industrial and Systems Engineering at my school? If not, do you think I could get a job in data science fresh after graduation, or would I be better off starting in data analysis/development work and then eventually trying to transition into data science. It's also worth mentioning that I will have $150,000+ in loans and would only consider the Masters program if it would really be worth my time and money. 

tl;dr Getting Bachelors in Industrial and Systems engineering soon with some decent experience but major student loans and I'm wondering if Masters program is worth it for me.

Any help/guidance would be greatly appreciated!"
4v1l1j,2,2016-07-28,Possibly bad internship experience - How will this affect my career?,nothingto1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4v1l1j/possibly_bad_internship_experience_how_will_this/,"I am a junior still studying in college.

Currently, I am interning at a pretty large industrial company (one of the largest), and I applied for their leadership program in IT. Being a leadership program, I was expecting something with coordination or helping someone higher up than me manage their project, but instead was put into an IT Project Manager role for a pretty large project from the get-go (Possibly understaffed at the moment? Interns usually don't get this role... especially on projects that are expected to make 1m+). I've been getting very minimal help and have had to deal with the usual corporate bullshit, forms, security and etc for this project with little to no help and generally everything else a project manager has to do, at the age of 20. I think it's unfair, especially being put into this role coming from a CS background without any help or prior experience, but I went through and have actually in my own opinion surprisingly done well so far. I progressed the project which was already a month behind, and in the process of getting development started, but I have doubts as to whether many things can even be done in time. I leave in 3 weeks but the project has about a month and a half left before release so I have to hand off to someone else. I asked my manager and he said I was doing really well, but considering there are many huge roadblocks that will come up soon that might delay which are out of my control (our business manager for this project is on vacation for a month...., this application has absolute shit documentation, architecture control, etc) so there are no information and many things undefined that needs to be done with security reviews that are simply out of my control, and I do not have info to, but I don't think my manager really would understand. I am just an intern, but I don't think she understands the level of stress and difficulty I am going through, and while she thought i was doing well 2 weeks ago (I have 3 weeks left now), i'm not sure how she will review me at the end... Although this is not confirmed and based on suspicion. I feel like I am honestly doing the best I can for coming in not knowing anything and with murky requirements, but I'm not sure if the future roadblocks and delays will give me a bad review even though everything before that i've done well. 

So to conclude, I am intending on definitely putting this on my resume as this is role I took was critical to my career in the future (I do intend to go from Software engineering to project manager or something similar down the line), but not sure if a possibly bad review will matter much. If applying to software engineering roles and mentioning this internship, I can definitely pull out thousands of things I've learned and accomplished, but ultimately, project is not in a good spot and its out of my control, so I'm not sure if that affects anything (do companies do background checks on this?). Also considering i'm looking for software engineering internships/jobs in the future, this wouldn't matter much either right? 

I just wish I wasn't treated like an experienced project manager while an intern. If this is not the right sub-reddit, i apologize, im a CS major and future software-engineer prospect so I thought I would ask here. 

Thank you!"
4v1slr,4,2016-07-28,I failed to get an Internship and need advice.,cscareertoss,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4v1slr/i_failed_to_get_an_internship_and_need_advice/,"Throwaway account.

I switched in to computer science my junior year. I was formerly in the Army ROTC program (on national scholarship) with a different major. I gave back the scholarship and dropped ROTC once I took CS I to purse a programming career. I will be graduating a semester late due to this (December), so I will be on the market for a full time job soon. I figure that because I was unable to get an internship, I am doing something wrong and that you guys might be able to help me. 

I go to a medium sized state university. I have a 3.9 overall GPA and received an A in every CS course I have taken. I work tutoring students in computer science through the university and also work a weekend help lab for CS I and II through the CS department. My resume has been looked at and edited through my university career services.

At the start of my senior year, I started looking for internships (wanted to get a head start, right?). I was targeting the Raleigh/Durham area, but did not limit myself and have tried out of state options. I went to a huge career fair at a prominent university and talked to/submitted my resume to at least 20 companies. No response. I spend the rest of the school year submitting my resume to companies, probably 25-30 overall. I only received one interview, but it was through the school and everyone got one. I did not make it past the first round. I went to another career fair in the Spring, which I also submitted about 15-20 resumes to and did not get any responses from.

I honestly did not expect it to be this hard and thought that I would be a top prospect. However, when the mid Spring semester rolled around I started to get extremely discouraged. It really hurt my self esteem and has me worried about my prospects as a programmer. 

Nobody that I have asked can tell me anything that I am doing wrong, other than the ""follow up more"" advice. I am admittedly not great at getting past the nerves to follow up, but I have pushed myself to do it on many occasions and still gotten no response (phone calls and emails). Projects are the other main thing I can think of here: I have very little outside of class programming work, because I have been swamped trying to catch up with this major. I am currently working on open source work to try and patch up this gap.

Only one more thing stands out to me, but it seems like an excuse in my head. I share the same exact name as my father, who is a registered sex offender. He shows up first on google when you search my name. I don't know if this matters, but I figured someone on this subreddit might know.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I am sorry if I sound like a complainer or ""woe is me,"" I am just expressing what I feel because I have had no other answers or input and the real deal is coming up for me. I am excited to hear what constructive advice you guys might have for me."

By ""relevant"" I am referring to the relevance to the industry and roles I am looking at. The field is advertising and there is a bit of an expectation that you move around a fair bit.

If this is not the right place to post this, let me know, I'll delete and move somewhere else.

I've been at my job for about 6 months. In that time I've had to deal with really difficult management. I feel as though my immediate manager (who started when I  did) is disorganized, overstressed, and does not act like a manager. There was a lot of drama about one of my co workers who was verbally abusive to another co worker and came to work high a lot. When i told the facility manager (my managers manager) she said to me ""it would have been as much your fault if she did something as hers because you didn't tell us"". After I had just told them... They also have a habit of (in my opinion) overworking their staff. A part time employee has been consistently working 38-40 hours while the manager handle ever hits 40. My department (customer service) seems to get blamed for everything in the facility and I regularly get yelled/snapped at by the facility manager who changes the way things are ""supposed"" to be done regularly.


My position is customer service in a pet boarding place. I like the job because I get to be around animals but I've found that working with the public is becoming more and more difficult. Especially here where is something goes wrong in the back (a dog didn't get a certain playtime or if a morning person put something into our software incorrectly) I get cursed out by the customer. I'm tired of people being annoyed with me or being rude about something that's out of my control. I know that's part of the job but I've worked with the public in all my other jobs and it's just felt different. Maybe I'm burnt out. I already have depression and anxiety issues, but I'm such an empathetic person that I'm really good at customer service. It's just an odd/shitty situation. 

This is just a temporary thing. I'm trying to get into a master's program, but that may not be for another year. I just graduated college in December. I'm currently doing an internship as well in my field of study (anthropology). 

I guess what I'm asking advice for is if I should stay in this job or not. If I do, what can I do to deal with the public and not be so sensitive to their rudeness? How can I deal with the difficult management? If I should leave this job what would be something I could do that doesn't deal so much with angry customers? 

Thanks y'all."

I only saw maybe two or three listings out of several hundreds which I thought I might have a chance at.


For one, I never really did any personal project(I like programming, but I have many interests besides this and after spending 40-50hrs on coursework a week I'd rather spend time on other things than programming..), which a lot of the listings aimed at entry-level jobs seem so to freaking love mentioning. Secondly, I don't have any experience besides being a 
teaching assistant for one semester and never did any internships. (However internships are fairly rare in my country unless you are a master degree student, I only know 2 in my class who has an internship now..). 


Now this semester is gonna be really busy, and on top of getting full credits I also need to re-take operating systems which I failed...I feel a bit overwhelmed.  I have to pass my classes, apply for jobs, study for interviews so i dont fail them, and do my part time job.


What I really wanna know, what can I do this last semester to make myself a bit more employable ? Learn new technologies, languages etc? Focus more on preparing for job interviews? One semester away from graduation and all I feel I  can offer is having good grades. I don't feel like anywhere near a competent programmer at least, so all my subjects in last semester are programming subjects..

Being divorced has given me a new perspective on my life and I realize that more than needing a job, I need a career. I need to know that I, myself, can provide for my child. While I love being a SAHM and being a caretaker for my family and would love to do it again one day, I know that is not the best thing for my son. I cannot rely on another man that is not his father to provide for me and him. I need to do it myself. Which means I need a career. I don't need a job, I need a career that will grow and allow me to provide for him equally along with his dad (my ex).

In my previous life I was in restaurant management, and while I enjoyed it at the time, working nights and weekends and busy holidays just plain sucks. So I don't want to go back to that. I pretty much did that until the day I gave birth and was a SAHM ever since. That's my job experience. But I am a leader. I work hard. I am detail oriented and smart.

I started studying to take the LSAT but then I started to read advice about the best way to do it and the overall message is ""DON'T"". Which scares me! So I started to look into coding and going to a developer bootcamp. I've always loved computers and while I don't know the languages, I am probably more technical than the average woman and I've always been curious about this field. But the cost of a boot camp is close to $20K (sounds ridiculous to say that given I'm considering law school...I know!).
The issue is that time is not on my side. I'm 36-years old and have a 7-year old son. My alimony ends in 28 months. My clock is ticking. I have the time now to spend in school all day, learning a trade or degree. I don't have the time to work an internship for the summer to see if this is a field I'll really like. I don't have the time to try one thing and if it doesn't work then try something else.

I don't want to be a disappointment to my son, or myself. I don't want to be a leech on my ex-husband. I don't want to find a new husband because it's an easy out. The next 5 years of my life is going to pass and I want to know that the decision I make today is a good one.

I need help. I need guidance. I need someone to ask me the right questions so I can hear what my conscience is saying to me.
TLDR: SAHM wants to go to Law School or coding school. Deadline is 5 years. Which direction do I go?"

Hi, I've been working on this project for a couple weeks now and it's at a point where I'm fairly happy with it, but I'd like to get some feedback on things like code quality, any bugs found, ease of use, or any suggestions.

Project info is in the readme, but I'll give a quick rundown here for people who are skimming. Basically the project uses a recipe website API to grab a recipe for you (either completely at random or based on particular ingredients which you can input). It can then make a shopping list for you. This was my first experience with writing a GUI in python, but I found PyQt5 to be pretty easy to use.

The goal was to have a personal project that I could use on resumes for internships and such (I'm in school for CS currently), as well as something my roommates and I could use if we needed some inspiration.

Anway, feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

- I just graduated in May from UC Merced (10 year old school so still new, but I would still say somewhat rigorous because they're trying to match the rigor of their fellow UC sister schools) with a 2.94 GPA in Mechanical Engineering. (Used to be above 3.0 but I took a large course load my final year to graduate in 4 yrs as opposed to 4.5-5 and took a hit grades-wise)

- I worked as an intern at a global HVAC company in Minneapolis last summer. Most of my work was data analysis but that required condensing a lot of data. It was there that I first started to learn to program. I learned VBA on my work time to create a script to condense the data much quicker than I would manually. Impressed my supervisor as it wasn't really my job to do that. 

- Since then, I've learned a bit in some other languages. I took a MATLAB course and have used it extensively for the courses for my degree. I've been learning some Swift in my free time (I wanted to create a bus app for my former school's bus system and I'm still working on it but job apps have taken priority as of now). I've also learned a but of FORTRAN but I don't really use it anymore. I think I get the basics of coding which allows me to transition languages somewhat quickly but I'm still very raw when it comes to more advanced stuff

- Pretty strong understanding of math courses like linear algebra, calculus (multi-var and such), probability and statistics, numerical analysis. My grades ranged from As to Cs, but I think my understanding is strong because I reinforced a lot of that math in my engineering courses. 


Overall, I want to do this because I've really grown an interest in CS recently and I've been stuck at the crossroads of whether I should start over and go back to school for it, or start my career in ME, which I've grown less fond of recently. I've been mostly applying to jobs that have allowed me to combine the two subjects such as controls, or more programming related ME jobs. I believe this program would allow me to get a job in ME while still getting the chance to learn CS. I think I can balance it and thrive in both but I also feel like certain factors hurt my chances (limited CS experience, small non-prestigious school, slightly lower than 3.0 GPA). What do you guys think? I also saw that they hire a lot of working professionals so if I go for it, should I push off the application closer to the deadline to see if I get a job before then that I can add to the app? "

4v44hp,17,2016-07-28,(Soon to be) Aeronautical Engineer: Need advice on career direction,Spiah,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4v44hp/soon_to_be_aeronautical_engineer_need_advice_on/,"Long post, sorry. Here's a TL;DR: Big vs small company. Big company offers career advancement and a chance at ""maybe"" getting amazing job after slogging through 3-5 years of an un-ideal position. Smaller company offers happiness and great career alignment, though it may result in me straying away from ""true"" structural/aero/manufacturing.


I'm currently finishing my final internship at a large aerospace company before I head off to finish my final year of university. I'll start my post by saying, I'm very fortunate to have the issue I'm having. However, it's been a large source of stress for me, as I have a very tough choice to make about my future career. To make this long post easy on the eyes, I'll explain the pros and cons of each option, and then my thoughts comparing the two.


**Company 1:**


Prior to starting at this big company, I worked at a small, albeit quite well known design company in the aerospace industry. Enjoying art and creative ""things"" outside of engineering, this was a really cool fit for me doing design prototyping and interfacing with industrial designers to make concepts real. I spent two summers with the company, and they have seemed very excited and open about the possibility of bringing me back full time. The pay is competitive, and personality wise, I fit in better with small companies. I know I would be (very) happy there.


Pros: 

* Proven to have talent and genuine interest in the work

* Heavy design focus

* Like the people, benefits and facilities

* Behind the scenes, but makes huge impact on aerospace, feels like work ""matters""

* Customer-facing though not so much as the second option

Cons:

* Small company, lack of possibilities for lateral moves, other career directions
* Rather specific role in industry, could see myself shoehorned into a corner career-wise


**Company 2:**


On the other hand, I have spent this summer in production engineering, just to get a taste of the industry from another light. Quite frankly, I was not enjoying it, and planned not to return post-graduation. However, I recently had the opportunity to shadow flight-line production engineers, where they prepare aircraft for test and then delivery. Being very interested in customer-facing jobs and fleet-side engineering/operations, it was an awesome experience. I love learning about aircraft routes, fleet operations and testing, and to literally be able to meet returning aircraft at the gate and address engineering problems on the spot was *amazing*. However, I was told it is rarely a first job for college-graduates. The advice I was given was to initially gain experience in factory-side production (maybe 3-5 years?) and then I might see the opportunity to come to the group arise. This is likely my only chance to get my foot in this door, as the only other place to really do this kind of work is in Toulouse.


Pros:
* Very unique line of work, genuine interest in flight ops/test
* Close to planes every day
* Opportunity for immense career growth, company name recognition
* Chance to work on new aircraft programs
* Customer-facing, cool opportunities for travel, networking

Cons

* More rigid company, not as enjoyable culture
* More stress, and mandatory overtime
* Must work a few years in an un-ideal job just to ""maybe"" get position I want
* Focus on paper-pushing rather than real engineering
* No design aspect (i.e. no CAD used at all)



When it comes down to it, I really don't know what to do. I have the chance to really boost my aerospace career by staying at the big company. I've been told that by staying there I essentially ""pay my dues"" and can find myself able to realistically go anywhere from there (including the smaller company). However, I know I will be the happiest at the smaller company in the long run. Pay and location are basically the same in both cases.


Thoughts, life advice, words of encouragement? I realize that it's very obvious which companies I'm talking about. So, if you have specific advice/notes about the companies in question, please PM me. I appreciate all the advice I can get.

4v4di1,4,2016-07-28,[US] Advice for Accounting student: career in Accounting or Finance?,GlamourCanWait,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4v4di1/us_advice_for_accounting_student_career_in/,"//Please pardon my English and the wall of text. Cross-posting in /r/Accounting and /r/FinancialCareers.//

**TL;DR** I don’t see myself working in Accounting for more than 7 years. I’m interested in Finance and strategic planning. Should I do the 5-year B.S./M.S. in Accounting and get the CPA stamp?



Hi everyone. I'm an international student in NYC. I've just finished the second year of the 5-year B.S./M.S. program in Accounting to qualify for the 150-credit requirement of CPA. I'm in two minds about a career in Accounting versus Finance.

I found out I loved planning and thinking strategically when running my high school club. Regardless of my career choice, I have always loved Math and Excel--two magical tools humans have invented. I studied Math and Excel rigorously in Southeast Asia. When other middle school kids were playing video/computer games, I was learning MS Word, Excel, Photoshop, and CorelDraw at night with adults at a learning center. (I’m a proud nerd.) I'm interested in the markets and world economy as well. I keep up on the news while riding the subway. 

At this point, it sounds like I lean towards Finance. Upon beginning college, I declared a major in Accounting since I'd heard it was recession-proof and Accounting was the business language. In addition, my school didn’t offer a major in Finance, but a Business Management major with a concentration in Finance. I thought a bachelor’s degree in business was worthless, and I’d rather learn something technical. If I could choose again, I would still pick Accounting, Finance, or Computer Science. My liberal arts college doesn’t offer Computer Science. I’ve tacked on an IT minor, but I saved the five IT classes for the last two years. IT has always been appealing to me. My high school IT teacher, who taught me for 3 years, would be glad to hear I was learning more about IT in college.

Anyway, I’ve sincerely enjoyed Intermediate Accounting and Principles of Finance in the class setting, so I’ve become one of the top students in the department. I don't like the Auditing class, but still managed to get an A. 

I did some internal audit in my previous part-time job and in the current Accounting internship. I don't think I can do auditing for long since it gets really tedious. I just sucked it up and never complained about it to anyone. 

I haven't taken any tax courses, but I was a tax volunteer last spring. Though I know preparing basic tax returns for individuals and researching corporate tax is a world different. I've heard corporate tax is more complicated and feels enjoyable when you successfully file a complicated return. I'm not sure if I want a career in tax, but it sounds a little more interesting than auditing.

I’ve read all over Reddit and the Internet that public accounting gets you to see how multiple industries work and opens many doors in the Accounting industry if you stick around long enough, say, 3 years. That’s the only selling point to me.

If choosing Finance, I will have to land a Finance internship next summer and graduate with a B.S. in Accounting in May 2018. I may not be able to do the IT minor with the 4-year program. If going for Accounting, I will try to get a big 4 internship for at least one of the two summers remaining, manage to pass a few CPA sessions in the fifth year, and graduate with a B.S./M.S. degree in Accounting and a minor in IT in May 2019. 

With that said, I'm wondering if I should steer towards Accounting or Finance. I think this Fall semester (third year) is the turning point for me where I have to decide whether to go into Finance or Accounting, since the penultimate-year internship weighs in a lot on the first job out of college and possibly orients the entire career. 

Some people on Reddit have said they get pigeon-holed into certain jobs they hate because X years of experience is the pre-requisite for exit opportunities. I’m young and free now so I will try to soak up all I can learn to make a well-informed decision. I’m trying hard to avoid wasting my most potential years in an unsatisfying career. In addition, I understand the lure of sunk cost fallacy when jumping ship. 


Lastly, my F-1 visa status certainly makes it harder for me to get a job here. I love working in this country due to the professionalism. Unfortunately, the uncertainty of my luck with H-1B working visa will negatively factor in my career planning. I’m not trying to stay in the US at all cost and will be open to relocation to other countries. If necessary, I will come back to a US business school for an MBA.

Thank you for reading my unorganized thoughts laid out on the computer screen. I’m living all by myself in this city. I feel bewildered and desperate for advice. I’d sincerely appreciate any tiny input."

1. I officially end my internship on August 15
2. My internship started in May
3. I fly back to school on September 29
4. My current internship is paid




I am a culinary arts student that is interning as a cook at a restaurant - this is part of my school's curriculum. One of my sous chefs asked me if I would stay longer because he likes the way I work. Even though I am flattered that he offered this to me, I am starting to realize that this part of the restaurant industry isn't for me. As a result, I sent an email to a local food R&amp;D company looking for a short internship/shadow at their facility for the remaining time I have before I move back to school. Reason being is because I want to experience other avenues in this business. The problem is they never got back to me, despite all the calls and emails. Should I keep contacting them?




My question is this, should I stay at my internship for a longer time even though I dread going in  now? My Dad told me that I should ask for some time off and just go back to work in September and ask for less hours (My internship has gotten to the point where I am considered more of an employee than an intern). My sous chef said that this wouldn't be a problem. He also said that he understands if I don't want to stay any longer as well.

If you were in my situation, what would you do?"

4v5nj0,3,2016-07-29,About to graduate this spring with a BA in marketing - Past work experience is haunting me though,PoopSoupOnly,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/4v5nj0/about_to_graduate_this_spring_with_a_ba_in/,"I'm 24 and I have a year left of school. While I'm happy I'm finishing and getting out, I'm pretty scared that I'm not going to find a job based on my past employment. Since I've been 19, the only work experience I've had is in the medical marijuana / i502 recreational cannabis industry here in Washington. My intentions were to make a life long career out of it when I was younger, but for the past few months I've been having a lot of second thoughts.   Although I love what I do, I don't think doing psychical labor all day under HID lights is a great long term plan.

I'd really like to get a professional white collar job once I graduate, but I feel like no one's going to take me serious when I apply. Although it's a legal industry here, there's still a lot of people that are against it. I'm starting to think that my only options are to lie about past work experience, or pretend like I've been unemployed and have been focusing all my time on school the past few years. I really want to move back to the midwest where I'm from after graduation too, but I feel like if I do that I'll even have less of a chance of finding a job (with it being even more taboo out there.) Cost of living here in Seattle is pretty outrageous and I'd like to one day own a house and be closer to my family. I'm starting to feel like it will never happen now because of some bad decision making and choices I made when I was younger. This upcoming fall semester I've got a job on campus as a proctor for students taking online entry level course exams, so that helps my situation a little bit as far as a more respectable job, but I still am pretty worried. I'm also hoping I can land an internship in the beginning of spring to get some professional experience, but again I feel like my resume is pretty screwed and my chances are low against my peers.

TL,DR: Should I lie about work experience, or lie and have a 5 year gap of no employment on my resume, or tell the truth?

4v8f1o,6,2016-07-29,TIFU by disinfecting my finger,H4sd,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/4v8f1o/tifu_by_disinfecting_my_finger/,"This happened in 2014 while I was living in France.

It is summer and  my family and I are looking forward to a nice 2-weeks vacation in Greek islands. Our flight to Greece is scheduled on Monday morning. On the Saturday evening before, I notice a small infection on the index finger of my right hand, close to the nail. Not wanting to let it fester during vacation and develop complications during vacation, I lance the infection with a sanitized X-Acto blade and drain it. To disinfect the area, I rub some Chlorehexidine on it.

Because I really don't want to be bothered during vacation, I decide to soak a compress in Chlorhexidine and dress it around the last phalanx of my finger overnight. In the event I didn't fully drain the infection, the overnight soaking should take care of it, right?

I go to bed and, during the night, feel some slight discomfort an that area. I ignore it, believing I might have slightly over-tightened the dressing and not wanting to get up at 2 or 3 AM to handle it, and get back to sleep.

I wake up the morning after, take the dressing out, and find the soaked skin completely white and wrinkled. It’s looking gross, but I’m not really concerned about it as I figure the skin probably spent too much time being wet, and that it should dry out in a matter of hours. Being Sunday morning, doctors are closed, so my wife insists that I go to the ER and have my finger checked out in case something needs to be done before we leave for Greece.
The intern that checks my finger confirms it will dry out during the day, and that there's nothing to worry about. She's nice and gives me antibiotics for 3 days, just in case.

The skin dries, and the wrinkles slowly give way to a huge blister. By Sunday afternoon, the last phalanx of my finger is covered by a ¼ inch-thick blister. It encompasses the top, sides, and fingerprint areas. I realize that, on top of disinfecting my finger, I actually chemically burnt my finger with Chlorhexidine.

This is my right hand, and I am right-handed... I can't use my index finger for about 2 weeks but still enjoy the vacation. My finger takes about 5 weeks to heal and develops hypertrophic scar tissue that encroaches on the joint, preventing me from bending that phalanx more than 30 degrees.

Over the following 12 months, the hypertrophic tissue softens enough around the joint that I recover almost all mobility. As of writing, a part of the burnt skin is still rigid and slightly discolored from the scarring, and will stay this way for the rest of my life. Luckily this is on the top and side of my index finger and doesn’t bother me whatsoever.

TL;DR: I soaked the last phalanx of my finger in Chlorhexidine overnight to ensure an infection was fully drained, it burnt my finger the day before going on vacation. I developed scar tissue and needed 1 year to recover almost full mobility of my finger."

I am having a bit of diffculty getting interest from companies I am applying to (so far, It's been almost 2 months since graduation and I've had 4 or so rejections). I would appreciate it if you guys could critique my resume (let me know if I'm attaching it wrong, I graduated from silent lurker just yesterday).

I eventually decided that I'd rather pursue something that I'm passionate about, and have since moved to San Francisco to pursue a career in Animation. Aside from currently taking classes to prepare for this industry, I'm also job hunting, but am a bit unsure as to what exactly I should be looking for, aside from the fact that I'm leaning more towards contract/ part-time work to devote time to my studies.

Despite being a computer science graduate in California, I've been trying to stay away from strictly coding/ software based jobs, as I'd likely repeat what happened in Cleveland as a result. However, after weeks of searching AngelList, Indeed, and LinkedIn, these seem to be the only sort of jobs that I'm qualified for. On the flip side, because I'm only currently acquiring the necessary skills needed for an animation based job and am lacking the portfolio/ photo reel required by many animation companies, I also don't feel ready for the jobs that I'd like to get into either, especially since, despite loving art and animation, the classes that I'm taking now are the first ever sort of ""formal"" training.

With that being said, I'm a bit lost as to what I should be aiming for, or what my next step ought to be. Instead of job hunting for something that admittedly be temporary, should I focus on portfolio building and maybe try applying for animation internships? I'm a bit concerned in terms of money, as I'm more or less supporting myself at the moment. Going back to Computer Science, my formal training is in back-end development, but I have some interest in front-end/ UI/ UX work, despite only briefly touching upon it while in Cleveland. Most jobs also require portfolios/ reels, which again, I don't have. Maybe I should consider taking online classes for this?

As you can see, I'm a bit lost. Any sort of advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated."

My situation is a bit of a tricky one, first some background: I am in my early twenties and studying Computer Science in a Bachelor program. I am currently working as intern at one of the audit big 4 in first level support. I like the job, I have great colleagues and the general atmosphere in the company is really nice and enjoyable. My internship will end in roughly 2 months about that time I would go back to university. I was informed that our IT dept. is currently recruiting 20 and 40 hrs/week work forces, being already in the company I would score a job there with ease. I know an intern colleague who has just applied for the same position and he got it within a day, so staying would not be an issue. However first or even second level support is not really my dream job, I would like to go into software development and as such I have already started looking for possible jobs after this internship with at least 2 positions that would fit my profile.


Naturally this is where my wisdom ends. I don't know if I should apply at my current company for a position I would be guaranteed to get, but it's not what I really ny dream job or pursue a kickstart into a software development career and start applying for other jobs right now. Of course there is the third option of not working at all after my internship and going back to Uni without a job, but being in my early twenties and this being my first job I feel like I am already in a huge disadvantage in the job market with the little experience I have.



I appreciate all comments and help you folks have for me. Cheers!"

I'm focused on embedded systems mostly, FPGA's etc, low level applications (C to ASM), and some DSP here and there.   I spent 5 years to get my bachelors, and set up my masters. Doing this allowed me to finish up my masters in one year, so 6 to go from highschool to masters.   My university was lacking in general for CompE instructors, and so most of what I learned was through broad guidance and lectures. For reference, I was never aware of ZYNQ chips asynchronous multiprocessing (AMP) being a thing, and had never worked with a real time operating system. 

*I've had a few internships where I build up ZYNQ systems or a custom embedded microprocessor from scratch, but I aside from those and personal projects, my experience is limited. 

I've known that there is a lot that I don't know and I am learning a *LOT* in this first month at my current job.  I know C pretty well, C++ a little less. VHDL and ASM I'm very good with. Python, bash, perl, etc I'm competent in as well.. (see: common languages from 2000's).  

To get to the point, I'm wondering if anyone can give me some advice on where to go from here. Important languages to learn (I'm starting on Verilog &amp; system Verilog / system C), or things to be aware of.  I'm aware D is getting popular in robotics too.

So far in my college search, I've really only been looking at UC's. The proximity and prestige seem like a good fit, but I'm wondering if I, academically, am a right fit for them and if I'm suffering from a sort of tunnel vision.

The schools in particular I plan on applying to:

* UC Berkeley
* UC Los Angeles
* UC San Diego
* UC Irvine
* UC Santa Cruz

(Outside of those the only other college I plan on applying to is maybe SJSU.)


**My Academics**

SAT: 1500/1600 - 780 English, 720 Math (I've only taken it once)

SAT II: None

Class rank: 116/992 Unweighted, 69/992 Weighted (this is a bit outdated)

UW/W GPA: 3.67/4.22

UC GPA: 3.88 (according to [this](https://rogerhub.com/gpa-calculator-uc/), my school calculates it on our transcript and it's higher)

AP's: World, Lang, Calc AB, Physics, CS - All 4s

Awards: Honorable Mention at a hackathon, Superintendent's Honor Roll

Extracurriculars: President of CS club, Volunteer programmer for school, Summer internship as a developer, JV swim team (1yr only)

**Questions**

Do my academics justify mainly applying to UC's being a good idea (and do I even have a chance at Cal/UCLA) or should I look at CSU's as well? Is there a reason why I should also look at private universities as well? (I've only been considering public so far) I feel lost about the college search and I don't know if my expectations will meet reality, thanks for any help!"

I went on two rotations: ops and now in dev. I did my part for ops but was informed in the mid point review that I don't ask for help when stuck, should communicate more, ask more questions and be more proactive in getting work. They assured that technical ability is not a problem but my attitude and soft skills are a deal-breaker if I want to work for them after my degree.

The truth is different though. I am NOT confident in my technical ability and that is why I am seen so passive. I actually like to pester experienced people with questions but I simply suck technically. I can't even formulate a right question. I am only a week into second part of the internship in dev role and got this confirmed. The code base is huge, written in a language I don't know, using web dev methodologies I am not aware of and principles from networking classes that I could not take. In other words, a new grad with my background would fail the interviews completely for this team. All developers in the team are of senior level, there are no new grads without experience and they are not looking to hire newbies to their team because work they do is critical to whole infrastructure and they cannot afford mistakes.

I was told to reflect on those remarks and turn the ship around in a remaining month. I am grossly underqualified for a role technically and apparently suck in social situations, making me a horrible candidate. I was questioning if career in software is for me as well and was diagnosed with medium depression by a doctor. It causes me to be disinterested in most things. I am doing okay in CS and like the material but when it comes to programming, I just seem to lack passion for it.

I also remember a couple of interviews I attended where the feedback was that 'you just give a wrong vibe' or 'we are looking for better soft skills and technical knowledge'. I guess the comment about 'vibe' was that I was not showing enthusiasm etc. I did mess up on a couple of technical questions but recovered afterwards. I also asked a fair amount of questions about how team works, software lifecycle and training/help available. I concluded that lack of passion for software seems to be a big 'no hire' indicator for the above interview experiences.

I would appreciate some advice regarding this. "

About me: I have an AAS in Computer Science from a Community/Technical college in Minnesota. I have quite a few other credits from an additional AAS, and misc. Liberal Arts credits. I achieved these degrees online and am comfortable with difficult classes in this environment. In my AAS I saw a broad coverage of languages, learning COBOL, VB, C++, Java, Python, SQL, and MS Access (and a bit more). Now I'd like to focus on what I think of as 'higher level' topics such as algorithms, discrete math, calculus, and generally bigger picture software development. I've never...actually coded anything outside of class. Partly due to work and life limitations, but really it's a matter of I'm just not that motivated outside of work to work on it. Please let me know if it's a huge red flag, as I sometimes wonder if this is the right career path for me. I'm passionate about new technologies, and love to read about emerging tech, specifically consumer products, and love helping a building people up. I see myself as working for a few years learning the ropes, and then trying to focus on teaching within a company, or possibly recruiting...

Limits: I am limited to online, as I am active duty military and not able to move to a school, or be committed to one near me. My ability to have an internship during school is limited due to this, as well. Also that means the school must be regionally accredited for my tuition assistance. While I'm not explicitly against 'Private, For Profit' schools, I am definitely leery of them. 

My plan is to finish this bachelor's in the next 3 years, as well as my military commitment. It's difficult to narrow down the school choices, or know what online options are worth their salt. 

I'm getting a bit wordy, so I'll end here and answer any questions you might have. I'll just end with saying I've been so encouraged by this community. Your interactions and helping others is awesome to see. "

For purely financial reasons, I haven't finished cool, however, I've spent the last several years studying (and attempting to ""breaking into"") copywriting.

I've attempted freelancing to little success (and several burning experiences), I've constructed a creative spec portfolio, I've done an internship with a startup company, and I've interviewed for a handful of *paid* writing positions (without any offers).

In that time, I haven't had a day job because I quite literally wasn't able to find one in the depressed part of the Pacific Northwest I was living in; even Vector Marketing stood me up.

I've since moved back to my hometown of Minneapolis. I'm likely looking back at returning to school for my marketing degree. Things have improved a little, but I still don't have a job, and that this point, I'm frankly terrified of the idea of working after being out of the arena for so long.

My last ""real"" job was night shift janitorial work at a major concert venue (which is a fancy way of saying I scraped up beer-crusted confetti off the floor). It was tough work, and I had some scary experiences walking back home in the small hours (I couldn't afford a car back then, either). 

That's kind of what I know, and I'm genuinely scared of the idea of working now. I've invested so much of my self-worth into how I ""earn my bread"" and have just fundamentally *not* earned said bread for so long, that it's difficult for me to make sense of it.

I've kind of resigned to the fact that I lack the credentials and experience to get an entry-level job in my chosen field, so I'm biting the bullet and looking at significant debt (like a lot of us) so that I can finish my degree.

I'm terrified that I won't have the opportunity to enter the bottom rung until I'm in my late twenties, and I'm more terrified of the idea that I might do things ""the right way"" with a mixture of obtaining credentials and dipping into entrepreneurship and ""new economy"" ventures, and just not make it.

I know, a lot of this probably sounds like it's me. I'm willing to admit that I'm certainly *some*of the problem, and I know I'm quite depressed about my lack of financial independence and ownership, but it ain't all one me. 

What do you folks make of my situation? Brutal honesty is welcome. "

I graduated in 2012 and have been working since, now going for my masters. 

Here in India, we do not have flexibility to opt in for courses. The colleges have a fixed syllabus for every stream. So someone doing a B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering would be given 5-6 subjects (you call them courses) to be studied every semester. You cannot replace the course with something you find useful.
 
Now I am totally confused on what I need to select and how many courses to complete. My program requires me to complete 4 (at least 2 from department) graduate half courses in the first 8 months (fall and winter) before I can move to the internship phase of next 8 months (summer and fall). Since this is a professionals master's degree and the time involved in class is just 2 semesters, I was wondering if I could soak some decent knowledge in ML and Distributed Computing.

So my current enrolment looks like:

* CSC2221H F (Fall) Introduction to the Theory of Distributed Computing
* CSC2515H F (Fall) Introduction to Machine Learning
* CSC2415H S (Winter) Advanced Topics in Distributed Computing

I need to select one more course (if I understand the concept of half graduate course correctly). I was looking for *CSC2541H S (Winter) Topics in Machine Learning* or *CSC2506H S (Winter) Probabilistic Learning and Reasoning* but both of them have their sections full and I cannot enrol in. Moreover I can select 2 courses from other departments, but have no idea where to locate relevant courses in other departments.

Anyone who can guide me on this or can discuss the pros/cons of this particular course selection would be great!

Thanks

I am an intern at an SF startup right now. I am very lucky to have received offers from Uber and Twilio for this current summer (but took an offer somewhere else). If I wanted to work as an intern for Uber or Twilio or similar company next year, I'm assuming I'd have to interview again? The fact an offer was previously extended does not matter? Please let me know if you have any experience in this manner. 

The reason I ask is there is a certain amount of luck to technical interviewing. I think if I had gotten a different interviewer, even where I currently work, I would not have gotten an offer (mostly due to different skillsets).  I think this is called anti-interview loop by Steve Yegge.

Thanks for any advice and please exclude my ignorance."

This concerns me because I have very little coding experience and haven't done any personal projects and don't know any HTML or CSS, and most internship applications open this fall and close around December. I'm worried that I won't be able to do well in my classes or socially while teaching myself how to make a website or do personal projects.

4vfs4r,2,2016-07-31,I hate my retail job so much it's making me miserable. How can I quit without causing any issues?,notsomagical,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4vfs4r/i_hate_my_retail_job_so_much_its_making_me/,"So I was hired at my local Disney Store about a month and a half ago. I had previously worked at Walt Disney World in the College Program and I loved it, so when I moved back home I applied at my local Disney Store to get some of that Disney magic. I liked it at first, but pretty much since training ended I've hated it. It's ended up to be nothing like I thought it would, and I'm being scrutinized and judged my entire shift. It involves a lot of upselling, which I'm not comfortable with, and I feel like I have to be too fake. I have to come up with these corny ways of saying things which I don't like. Overall I just don't think working at the Disney Store is a good fit for me, and I want to leave.

I want to work for the company again, and if I end this job on bad terms I could be listed as a restricted rehire, or not hirable at all. So it's really important that I don't end this job badly. When I was hired I told my manager that I was ending school this summer so I would be free the rest of the year, and I told her that I was fine with the hours so I can't complain about my schedule.

I'm going to see if it's possible to transfer from the Disney Store to Disney World, and hopefully that's possible and can happen asap. But if I can't transfer within the next few weeks, then I need another option, because I won't make it much longer. I dread work so much, and it's making me miserable, and I'm so tempted to just quit, but since it'll affect my future status with the company I haven't yet.

So since I know I won't make it here much longer, what is the best way or reason to quit? If I found an internship related to my degree would my manager still view that badly? I've also never quit a job before, they've kinda just ended or had a time limit, so how do I even do that? I really wanted this job to work and I'm really upset it isn't, but it's nothing like I thought it would be, and I need to move on to make myself happy. 

TL;DR: I hate my job, it's not what I expected, but I want to work for the company in the future. What is the best way to quit without burning any bridges?"

I was going into senior year of school, but looking for jobs or well paying internships because I couldn't afford rent any longer. 

So I am now in my first job, without a degree, when the offer was made they acknowledged I would be 'sort of like a junior dev' but that they treated all their devs more or less the same. I'm not super managed in my job, was handed code base day one told to look over it and start trying to fix bugs on the board. It's nice to not have someone breathing over my shoulder, but at the same time it would be nice to have some good guidance in first dev job. (The hire previous to me with 5 years experience has stated publicly that our onboarding process is shit.... which for essentially a junior dev isn't ideal.) Anyways, I got some bugs fixed that first week, am learning my way around the code base, and the languages and frameworks we use.

However, I can't shake the feeling that I was a mistake in their hiring process, and I'm working 70+ hrs a week partially because of that. We are actively growing and have interviewed 10 experienced, qualified devs in the last week and made 0 offers. Why on earth would you hire me for experienced dev price when I can contribute less? (I'd probably feel more secure in my job if they paid me 30k less)

It would be nice to have more gentle guidance at least like ""hey here is an item on the board that you should look at,"" or perhaps an idea of what being successful looks like, but all I have to go off is what everyone else here gets done. I'm working about 70 hrs a week trying to learn all the new stuff and contribute to the team, and stressed even though I have indication that I'm doing poorly. 

I have a one on one with manager weekly and CTO monthly, and would like to use these to talk about my concerns without coming off as completely in over my head (ie I don't want to lose my job). Any good ideas on what to say, how to get in less over my head?

**tl;dr: Started first job, feel like I'm seeking have little guidance at work, feel like I'm overpayed. Want to convey feelings, maybe get some guidance, get an idea of how I'm doing from management so that hopefully I can stress less and get up to speed faster without getting fired. Help? **"

I also have grades in around 10% percentile of people at top institution for CS among mostly excellent, smart individuals. My programming chops are weak though. I am too slow and don't enjoy coding that much. I am also having hard time at my internship right now where I try to make sense of huge web hosting system written by ancient programmers using ancient tech like Perl. Honestly, I am underqualified for the role because whole team are senior engineers with 10+ years exp in development and they do not accept new grads there. I went for CS because there was nothing at a time that peeked my interest more. I work on an Android app though and enjoy it so far but find professional development intimidating and my morale is at all time low.

This experience got me thinking about how I can best contribute to the world. Another area would be life sciences. I looked into bioinformatics. The reqs seem daunting though: PhD in the field, heavy algorithmic thinking component. I cannot answer most questions I see on Glassdoor, Leetcode and was trying to become better but I learn so slow that cannot help to think that my brain are not wired for software engineering unlike some other excellent people and friends I know. While persistence and hard work would make me an average developer, I hardly see myself happy in the long run.

I also recognise that time is ticking away...and that it is harder to turn ship around when older and commited to a career. I am 23 right now. I don't see myself being more than average in this field. I think that working in the field that enhances science and lives of people like bioinformatics would keep me content with what I am doing though. I just don't know if I am good enough for this.

Can people comment on my observations so far? Anyone working in health IT industry or bioinformatics? I am in UK if that helps."

I just can't seem to look at the positives anymore like I used to, everything seems useless and I feel like I'm taking things for granted and I try so hard. My dream has always been to finish my novel but it's been in the works for the last 3 years, writing a script, drawing out characters, I've finished two pages almost (graphic novel) but I still always go back to change things. nobody is impressed with my drawings and I don't really get support, my bf of 5 years is great but he's honest and isn't into art as I am so he's not really interested in my hobbies, but he's in other stuff and I try to learn but I'm too slow and lack of interest makes it harder.

I just feel like the human race should just die out, I'm so sick of people and human beings, I exercise by taking hour long walks and push ups, sit ups and Squats 3-4 days a week but my energy is still low and my hate and wish to die never goes away. I love my bf and he makes me laugh and happy most days but I always wish he would be more romantic or sensitive but I can't force him to be like that and I don't want to change him.

I fantasise being with fictional romantic relationships in wonderful worlds when I take my walks or am on my own or even when I'm around his friends.

I did internships as a graphic design intern but they told me I wasn't knowledgeable enough, since my course only introduced us to photoshop and illustrator each for one semester and I never used it until my uni course.

I just want to die it feels like something better would await me. I just wish it would happen soon, even if I had cancer I wouldn't do anything about it because I think at least ppl can accept it as a natural cause of death rather than commit suicide,  but waiting is agonising and I think that's probably why I'm so irritated and angry lately.

I just lost faith in people,  even when I hear good things happen I just feel that should be the norm! Is it really so rare we need to celebrate it?

Im just so bored with life, people are so predictably selfish or deluded in some ways, it makes me angry that they assume I have nothing better to do than my cashier job.

Am I missing any core things they are looking for? I guess it's hard to be interesting and cover everything in just 2000 characters. I was not able to add my intern experience or on campus work, is it too heavy on college. BTW graduated last June so gives you a perspective of where I am.

I don’t know when it happened really, when programming seamlessly transitioned from a chore to a passion through which I began to express myself. It was this fundamental shift in perspective which drove me to graduate from UCI in just three years with a BS in Computer Science, excluding the family death causing me to miss an exam and retake a class my second year. One of the highlights of my undergraduate career was researching under Professor Sheu my sophomore year; who introduced me to the concepts of big data management and the practical applications it drives. I was tasked to statistically analyze, using Python and Scala, the performance of an in-house semi-structured database, AsterixDB, with comparable solutions such as Hadoop and present my findings to my peers.

This opportunity peaked my interest and drove the inspiration behind my two senior projects: NoteShare and Fabflix. While taking my discrete mathematics and algorithm design courses, I experienced first hand the importance aggregating notes and decided to create NoteShare. Inspired by Facebook, this online web-app allowed users to create profiles and online classrooms, send friend requests, and share notes. Fabflix on the other hand was a core project that went too far. Initially the motive was to create an online platform where users could browse and purchase movies. However, long after the course was complete I continued to apply the knowledge I learned from my information retrieval and machine learning course to create my very own recommendation engine.

Currently I am a software engineer at AT&amp;T where I design and develop algorithms for their in-house recommendation engine. My current focus is on analyzing behavioral viewing patterns to create user profiles. Though my undergraduate education is complete, I believe the OMSCS program will be an excellent opportunity gain a deeper understanding of key concepts such as machine learning and algorithm design empowering my goal of becoming a data scientist.

4vj6lz,3,2016-07-31,Starting in technical sales?,Britito,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4vj6lz/starting_in_technical_sales/,"Hey guys,

I'm a CS student in the UK. I've spent the last year on an industry placement a a medium-sized software company that makes CAD/CAM software. It was enjoyable enough, though hardly the most interesting stuff. I never dreaded going to work, but sitting and and programming internal dev tools all day was hardly the most engaging work.

Since that internship ended early summer, I applied for summer internships, and got a technical sales internship at Cisco. I'm just finishing that now, and I rather enjoyed it. The work seems more intense, but far more varied and more interaction with people, which is something I missed at the software company, despite being somewhat introverted. 

So, what sort of career paths are there for someone in technical sales? My official job title if I went with Cisco for grad would be Systems Engineer, which seems to differ from company to company. How hard would it be to change roles, and what's the job market like?

tl;dr Am CS student in UK, considering technical sales, what can I expect?"
4vjq7v,2,2016-07-31,New job at big company has been going terrible. Looking for advice on transitioning to a startup.,rsheeler,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4vjq7v/new_job_at_big_company_has_been_going_terrible/,"So started my new-hire career and so far it's been going absolutely terribly and I would like to get out before my ""new hire"" 6 month status expires.


I work at a very big company so I am getting VERY lost in the bureaucracy no matter how much I advocate for myself with my manager or our program manager etc (of course in a professional way). I'm not even doing development work and I was hired as a developer along with being told that's what I would be doing. I took the position because I was very excited to become a better software engineer and to work on complex technologies, as that's how I was sold the position. However that's not at all what I'm doing. I also strongly dislike how many people are in it because ""it's a job"", when software development is my passion.


I am really looking to work for a startup because after working for two large companies for 3 years I feel like I am missing a lot of opportunity to ""build"" something and really jump into learning. (My last company I worked at for almost 2 years straight and was a ""intern"" to ""software engineer"" while completing my senior year). I want to be around other people who are as enthusiastic about technology as I am. I've had two mentors and both have been older gentlemen who are still as excited about building things as I am. They have also advocated that they preferred the pace of startups.
I browse AngelList daily, have been working on expanding my portfolio, and working on problem sets some hiring companies require. After this novel, I would greatly appreciate others advice on the matter and how I might be able to transition to a role at a startup? Has anyone been in a similar situation and if they have, what have you done about it? I've also been at my current position for 2 months."
