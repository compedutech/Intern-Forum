aywyf,3,2010-02-06,"Advice please, Reddit. Currently paying for an apartment I haven’t lived in for two months.",bentaboutrent,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/aywyf/advice_please_reddit_currently_paying_for_an/,"Anyone here had to leave an apartment before the lease was up? Did the landlord have an agent who did a questionable job of re-renting the place?

Backstory: Your average roommate horror story, I ‘spose. We had worked together during an internship in San Francisco and then decided to get a place together once the internship was up. We find a place with a great view ... but once we move in, we start noticing all the crap that’s wrong with the place: elevator doesn’t work, fridge leaks constantly (spoiling our food), no fire alarms, icky mold, screen door that’s fallen off because it’s so corroded (landlord said she would replace before we moved in), etc. Only after constant complaining does the landlord do a halfass job fixing anything--after two months the fridge was never fixed or replaced because she wanted to see the fridge leaking herself. Well, it would leak sporadically and we even showed her our soggy food and food with a layer of ice on it.

Soooo ... shortly after we move in, roommate gets a boyfriend and she does a complete 180. The world stops for this guy, she starts acting different, and I soon get it out of her that he’s a drug dealer. I’m a pretty quiet person who keeps to herself, and these two are up all night talking, playing music, and laughing (sweet jesus, did they have loud, annoying laughs). She gets no sleep, starts acting increasingly erratic, and I can hear her at all hours of the night blowing her nose. Oh, and the guy has basically moved in at this point.

After several confrontations, weeks of her drug dealing boyfriend living in the place, me not feeling safe in my own home, and her refusal to compromise at all (I didn’t trust that she was in a sound state of mind during all this, I knew this when I talked to her, but didn’t know what else I could do). We have the traditional falling out. And landlord could care less about the situation, as expected.

The landlord said before that we could give a 30-days notice and leave--this was after our calling about several things wrong with our apartment. She just never wanted to deal with it. Don’t have it in writing, though. We both move out, and I drop the keys off with the landlord’s agent about two months ago. I now live about six hours away. The place still hasn’t been rented, according to the agent, and our deposit is almost up (in another week).

Any advice, Reddit? Should I start pestering the heck out of the agent? Or just accept that I’ll probably end up in small claims court for additional rent?

Or do you have any similar stories? Or any words to put this whole thing into perspective?

b1351,5,2010-02-11,I have a 2.7 gpa and a DUI.  I am a  soon to be graduated Software Developer.  Am I screwed?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b1351/i_have_a_27_gpa_and_a_dui_i_am_a_soon_to_be/,"I chose computer science because i was excited about my future in a relatively new field.  I was never the best student but i always work hard and I'm a quick learner.  

To explain my GPA, I have had to work every year of college to provide for food and rent.  Recently the past two years  I have maintained an internship developing web applications in .Net while also working at Olive Garden at night. (strangely this has produced my best grades in college)  I wish i had at least a 3.0 and I'm really ashamed that i havent been able to achieve that goal.

To explain my DUI.  Well, really, there isn't an explanation.  I was an idiot and complete wreck-loose for awhile because of heartbreak.  I have since stopped drinking (6 months sober) and there is not a day that goes by that i don't regret because of this.  Seriously biggest regret of my life.  DO NOT DRINK AND DRIVE.

I don't post here often, but i feel like reddit gives the most genuine advice.  I'm applying for jobs right now and I'm feeling pretty hopeless.  So in essence Am I screwed? What should I do?

As part of my research, I'd like to find out what other software systems like-businesses are using (where the type of business I intern for is a retirement investment state agency).  These software systems should fall into the categories of Customer Relationship (CRM), Business Intelligency (BI), and etc.  Any suggestions on where to start.  I'd also like to locate some information that gives an aggregate of the business software systems out there in use."

Any ideas where I can look / suggestions?",relequestual,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/b1p09/reddit_i_need_a_years_technical_internship/,"Hi Reddit. Many of my friends use reddit nearly every day, and I've seen some of the stuff that you lot can do, so I thought worth a try!

I'm a second year student at Bournemouth University currently looking for a years internship / placement.  So far, it's not going too well.

I applied to Microsoft, and didn't get an interview (because of the situational questions). Just got a reply back from the only other place I've applied, which was a local school, no joy, no reason.

I've had my CV checked by a good number of people from the Uni's employment help service, and they say it's fantastic. I got a 1st in my first year of uni, and so far doing even better this year.

I think my main problem is I don't know EXACTLY what I want to do. I'm studying ""Computing"", which is the broadest course I could find! This year our units are Programming, Data Management, Games, Team Projects, Networks and Security, and System Design. I enjoy them all really, although I do like programming alot.

I'm a problem solver at heart, it's what I like to do, solve problems! I also like computers, and have a pretty good all round knowledge too!

I'm looking for a placement preferably in the South of the UK or London.

Any help or advice welcome :)"

What advice can you offer?,davydog187,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b3tce/dear_reddit_i_have_my_first_job_interview_next/,"I recently applied for a coding position at a large financial software company and I was just scheduled interview for early next week. I am still a student and it will be an internship for this coming summer. I will be speaking to an interviewer directly, although I am not sure if I will be interviewed by myself or with other people.

From your previous experience, what kind of questions will I be asked? How should I prepare? What can I do to make myself stand out from the other interviewees? Help!"
b5qyo,1,2010-02-23,Indecisive about where to go now in pursuing a career in IT?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b5qyo/indecisive_about_where_to_go_now_in_pursuing_a/,"I'm planning to pursue a career in IT, specifically network administration. I'm nearing the end of my first degree program – a technical degree (Associate of Science) in network engineering – at a community college. This quarter I'm interning for the IT department at the college I attend. I have two more classes and then get the degree this coming June.

But now I'm stuck. I have no idea what I should do after that. I have a lot of options: going to a university to get a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (or something similar), trying to find a job working as a help desk tech and start to work my way up, taking certification exams... I just don't know which route to take.

The university option means four more years of school (since the degree I get in June will have been a technical/accelerated degree).

I don't know if I can get a job with the two-year degree I'll be getting. From what I've heard from many of my IT colleagues and friends, the degree, and even the certifications, don't mean anything. I've been told that the actual experience is what lands you the ideal job and enables you to advance.

On the other hand, I still hear that the two-year degree is almost equivalent to a high school diploma nowadays, and that I need to get the Bachelor Degree.

I don't have any certifications currently. From what I've experienced, the courses that prepare people for the exams, and even the exams themselves, is all bookwork and memorization. I don't learn much from reading a bunch of text and better absorb the information by applying it in some kind of scenario or simulation. Furthermore, I don't have the money to spend on the exams (that keep getting updating anyway).

Something else I've noticed is that being female seems to be to my disadvantage; I'm not taken as seriously as the men doing the same kind of work. Even for my internship, all my supervisors are male, and I know only one other female on the campus who works in IT – I thought the male-to-female ratio was decreasing?

Anyway, I just need some insight on what I should be doing next, because I feel stuck, and I don't want to waste time on school if it would be more to my benefit to find work, or vice-versa. Any advice?"
b7cpz,1,2010-02-27,"Reddit, I need job advice",jobadvice,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b7cpz/reddit_i_need_job_advice/,"I'm in my last year at an average Canadian school doing a **Finance** degree (emphasized for a reason you will soon see) .  I've been working for the federal government part-time for a few years and was recently offered a full-time job doing clerical stuff.  The pay is pretty good (42k) with amazing benefits... excellent work/life balance and a steady employment and golden pension with basically no risk of getting fired.  The thing about working for the government is everything is inefficient--it takes one year to hire someone externally and there's so much beurocratic bullshit nothing gets done and everyone slacks off because they know they can't get fired.  Not to mention for EVERY SINGLE JOB there's literally thousands of people applying (an EA job for my manager was open for 48 hours and had over 4,500 applications).  The only reason I got the full-time job is because there's a big 'once you're in, you're in' mentality.  It's extremely hard to get a job but once you're inside you're allowed to apply for jobs internally which is much much easier then externally.  If I didn't take this job, I don't think I could get back in and I do think there's a lot of potential for advancement.. but no chance I could 'make it big'.

I was also also just offered an internship doing software development for a very big IT company.  Not google or MS, but if you started to name global IT companies you would say this one early.  The pay is good for an internship.. more then the gov't job but without benefits... and it's only for 16 months.    The thing is, as I said... I'm a FINANCE major.  I've done some freelance web development, tech support, taken some CS classes (my minor), and done some Database work for a relative who has a Financial Services company but I don't think I'm even at an intermediate level of any programming language.  It doesn't help that I'd be working with Java which I've never even touched before.  I'm not going to say I lied to get this job because there was a very thorough interview process but I did exaggerate a thing or two.  if I did take the internship, I'm scared to death that I'd be completely lost.  I have friends in SE/CS and they almost beat me when I told them I landed this job... I don't even think you could compare my technical knowledge-base with theirs... and those are the type of people I'd be working with.   On the other hand, it'd be an amazing opportunity to learn a lot and I'd have something solid to put on my resume.

Am I out of my mind for even considering taking the internship?  I'm a pretty ambitious and I know I'd be bored to death at the government job... even if I did end up getting transferred to a job in IT or Finance (still not sure where I want to work).   I'm young and I have absolutely no idea what I want.. which is why I'm asking for advice.  Sometimes I think I want to do a masters in finance or MBA and see if I could break into equity research or trading (which has always been a dream).  Other times I think about just having a relaxing and fairly stress-free and stable life.  Once you're in the government, your resume is radioactive in IT/Banking because they think the public sector is a joke... I'd most likely be in the public sector my entire life.

Thoughts?  Experiences?

tldr: i'm a young finance major who got offered two jobs, one full-time clerical job (with a lot of upward potential) with the govt that would provide a golden pension and stability my entire life.  The other an internship (16/mo) for a very well known IT company doing software development which is something I don't have much experience in."
