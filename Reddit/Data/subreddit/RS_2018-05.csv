8g4l96,1,2018-04-30,3 months to get a job: Which direction to go?,DJPharaohCHS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8g4l96/3_months_to_get_a_job_which_direction_to_go/,"I have 3 months until my lease ends and would like to have a job by then. If I end up moving in with my parents then maybe call it 4-5 months. (Given the assumption that more than 6 months after graduation without a job would look bad?)

&amp;nbsp;

I'm trying to decide whether I should go a Core Java/Spring route, Android/Mobile route, or Javascript stack?
I've been browsing through this reddit, as well as youtube and google all day but could use some advice/guidance.

&amp;nbsp;

My questions relate to 3 things: 

1. Interest level &amp; Background
2. Number of available jobs
3. Likelihood of learning the associated stack in 3 months

&amp;nbsp;

1) My most recent internship that just finished was in Android. The language I used the most in college classes was Java(graduated in December). I did particularly like that my work felt varied when doing Android because I got to work with both algorithms but also on the UI side.

* I'm wondering given this if I will like the web/Javascript route better compared to what I would be building in Spring/Core Java? 

&amp;nbsp;

2) I haven't mentioned Android yet as I am not seeing a lot of Junior level Android jobs (I've been looking particularly in Austin and Houston). However I am not seeing many Junior level Java/Spring positions either. 

* Which direction do you believe has more junior level positions? 
* Is Austin really as difficult to get a junior level developer position as some of the people on this subreddit are saying?

&amp;nbsp;

3) Also, what is the likelihood of me learning a JavaScript stack (e.g. MEAN) in 3 months(note: I have little experience with JavaScript stacks), versus learning Spring in 3 months(considering I have more of a Java background)?  

[Note: I'm aware of the importance of algorithms,data structures etc and will be reviewing them alongside my framework/stack study and job hunting]

I come from a single parent household. Growing up I never wanted for the necessities but the luxuries like extra curricula and birthday parties were a nope. When I left HighSchool it was highly recommended that I start off at a community or technical college. Get college credit for cheap then transfer elsewhere when the time comes. Well, I ended up not only getting credits but getting an Associate of Applied Science in Computer Programming. At the time it seemed like a great idea. In 2014 it seemed like software developers had the best jobs and I wanted to be one. Fast forward to 2017 when I graduated the economy has changed and software developers do still make great money but unbeknownst to me (then), employers are now offering lower salaries for more experience. E.g. In my area an employer is asking for 5 years experience php, Java, kotlin, node.js, mongoDB and python for $50k as entry level with a bachelors degree. It was almost twice that figure when I first decided to take this route, so I figured I could get in at $40k. Not the case anymore. There just aren't a lot of true entry level position jobs other than internships and those are 50/50 on whether or not they're paid. Most times when I apply for a tech internship I don't even get a rejection letter and I think it's because I come from a technical school.

The whole reason I went through with this degree was because I wanted to be able to support myself before I went for a bachelors degree, because money. My mother is also a senior and has not retirement or employment at the moment and needs help. Now here I am. 5 months out. Applying like crazy. I got 2 interviews. I bombed one. Nailed the other. But then they pulled out so no offer. I'm stuck at my server/busgirl/cashier/dishwasher job.

At this point I have a few options. I could go for the bachelors degree with loans but I'm very loan averse. My biggest fear is taking out loans for a degree but then still being unemployed/unemployable and having the interest pile up on me. I'm looking for scholarships to apply for but does anyone really get those? I've been accepted to WGU for Software Development but having second thoughts on the program I want to go into. Honestly if I spent a year getting a degree with this school, only had to pay out of pocket $1k total, but still ended up unemployed, I would be okay. Bc at least no one can say I didn't try and I wouldn't be in debt!! Then I would have peace about focusing on other things that I find more enjoyable and worth my while to generate income, save for the future and help my mom.

I am going to make this as short as possible. I will still put a ""TL;DR"" at the bottom.

At the end of undergraduate, I wasn't sure of what I wanted to do. I had enjoyed a summer internship I did at a government chemistry research lab. So I decided to basically rush a PhD application to a university not far from my undergraduate school. I got in and started about three weeks after finishing undergrad.

There I met someone who we will refer to as ""D."" D became one of my best friends, and opened up some doors to me that I can honestly say saved my life.

The reason she saved my life is because going to grad school was one of the top ""bad decisions"" of my life. I am not meant to be an academic, I am not meant to be a full-time researcher, and I am (now) 110 percent ok with that. The 9 months that I was there as a PhD student were the some of the worst of my life. I was a square peg in a round hole and hated every minute of it. However, D got me involved with certain organizations on campus that re-directed my life back to where it belongs.

I was half kicked out/half dropped out of the PhD program and forced to become a Masters student. I was still planning on doing a thesis, and had several meetings with a professor (who we will call Dr. M) who had shown  interest in advising me. Then I realized that doing the thesis would cost me an extra 30K overall, take an extra year, and would do nothing to advance my career. So I kind of stopped talking to Dr. M out of the blue. I had another year of classes to finish so I just kind of did classes part time and did major volunteering with three different organizations on campus. Somehow in my second and final year I was nominated for graduate student of the year in the department.

I did the comprehensive exam to get my masters. Failed the first time. Almost failed the second time but one of the professors felt bad for me and liked the science demo I brought.

So I know I am sort of ""persona non grata"" in the department. I did end up taking quite a bit of the departments money, wasted a bunch of people's time, and barely passed by the skin of my teeth.

If it weren't for D and the programs she hooked me up with, my career would not be where it is today. Period. So of course I will be at her hooding ceremony. When she invited me it instantly went on my calendar. I've already started making her gift.

What do I say to people, including Dr. M? I don't want to come across as standoffish or rude, but realize that many people there probably have no interest in seeing my face at that university ever again.

TL;DR Close friend is getting her PhD from a program I ""Mastered out"" off. I am sort of ""persona non-grata"" for that. How do I approach things at her hooding ceremony?"

The boss and manager also let me know that they would be of help if I needed it.

It seems there are so many options I'm just not sure where to go next.

Should I go to college for a two year degree in computer networking? This degree will cost me roughly $12k. Also this is one of the only colleges I live near so this is really my only college option unless I were to move somewhere (not really an option). These are the classes I'd need to take in order to get the degree:
PC Hardware A+,
Operating Systems A+,
IT Ethics and Careers,
Introduction to Programming,
Network Technologies,
Introduction to Linux Operating Systems,
Client/Desktop Operating Systems II,
Windows Powershell,
Linux Administration &amp; Configuration,
Windows Server Administration,
Advanced Special Topics I,
Network Security Fundamentals,
Windows Server Network Infrastructure,
Advanced Special Topics II,	
Job Skills,
Network Communications Infrastructure,
Field-Based Experience,
Capstone Project.

Another option is doing Google's Coursera IT Support Professional certification. This is an 8-12 month course that looks like it goes over a lot. It goes over a lot of the basics and also dives into some intermediate stuff. I am currently most interested in pursuing this. After doing this I could also do the Cisco Networking Basics course. This costs $50 per month.
Here are links to the courses: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-it-support
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/networking-basics

Side note: Coursera has some cool courses on Cloud stuff. This looks interesting and fun to learn on the side (aka not really high priority).

Another option is doing the CompTIA exams. The typical order I've seen is A+, Security+, Net+. I was studying the A+ on the side during this internship and am about 1/4 of the way through.

Should I do some of these together, e.g college and CompTIA exams, or the Google cert + CompTIA etc?

Any input or other ideas greatly appreciated. I'm just a confused student not knowing quite where to start.

TLDR: I don't know where to start my career in IT. College, Coursera, or CompTIA?  "

Graduate school isn't off the table for me, and I'm absolutely terrified that if I go pass/fail in an upper division major course it's going to be a huge red flag on my transcript. *Particularly* during a quarter when I'm going part-time as is. The class is way outside of my comfort zone (computational linguistics), and I'm really disliking how the course is taught. I tend to avoid courses where attendance is absolutely mandatory due to my health, and this class is exactly that; heavy emphasis on lectures, and no real comprehensive textbook to fall back on. I also find the directions for assignments to be confusing and unclear, and the subject matter to be boring. 

Because my majors are so interdisciplinary and don't go deep into any one thing, maybe a pass/fail in a more niche class isn't a huge deal; after all, computational linguistics is just one small part of cognitive science. This class is one of two linguistics classes I'll take before I graduate, and I don't think I'll go any further. I suppose the only thing to really worry about is the chance that I'll suddenly discover I love linguistics at some point down the line, and then that pass/fail in an upper division linguistics course could come back to haunt me...

I'm seriously considering going pass/fail. I can admit that I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and not getting an A is really going to bother me. Even more than that, with the way things are going I don't think an A is even going to be possible. I think I would have to work very hard to achieve a B, and I'm afraid of what the stress could do to my health.

I want to give myself a break. I want to use my time to focus on things that are more important to me. But I'm worried that having one of my major classes pass/fail, especially if it's in a class that looks ""harder"" and more STEM-ish on paper, is going to really hurt me if I end up applying to grad school.

UPenn:

Can take Wharton classes

More social?

Ranked higher for CS (by how much? is it worth grade deflation?)

Didn't like how the campus is integrated with the city

Yale:

Got a better vibe from students, they weren't as stressed

Not as good CS program

Investing heavily into the CS department (how good will it be by 2022?)

Liked the campus

At the end of the day, I'll be putting in the same amount of work at both universities. Would I miss out on any CS opportunities (classes, internships, etc) by going to Yale instead of UPenn?"

Back in November I accepted an 8 month long internship, starting in january, working as a software developer. I was enrolled in my masters at the time and I was very interested in data science, but accepted the position because I did not have any experience in the CS field. 

Fast forward to now, I have been with the company for about 3 months and a half, (This is in Washington USA), but I have been offered a data analyst internship not too far away. 

If you were in my position, would you quit your current internship as a Software Dev (Full stack), and go to Data Analytics? The pay is better, the technology used is closer to my field of interest and its not Full stack, which honestly, I havent been fully engaged with but I have enjoyed learning from my coworkers.

The list of technologies as a Data Analyst are: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SQL, Hadoop Hive, Power BI, Excel, R, Spotfire. 

In my free time I have been going to Data Science meetups and it sounds like the technologies being used at the Data Analystics internship are more in line with what is being used in the field of DS. I honestly think it would be a productive career move to get familiar with these technologies as I intend to use them in my future career.

8gd79p,1,2018-05-01,Should I switch jobs from Software Engineer to Security Engineer? Read my story and help me decide!,mr-gandalf-sir,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/8gd79p/should_i_switch_jobs_from_software_engineer_to/,"I‚Äôll write this down so I can stop it from spinning round and round in my head. I'm considering a job role at a place that we'll call Company X for this post :).

So about a year ago, I helped the senior engineering manager of a company that was just setting up in my town to host a Women Who Code event when they were just setting up, in order to encourage recruitment. Let's call this senior engineering manager: Manager X of Company X.  

&amp;nbsp;

Manager X was great, and seemed to really care about tech and diversity. We kept meeting each other at things, most noticeably at a major hackathon in the city, where he endorsed my Dungeons &amp; Dragons big data project because he was also a fan.

So a few months later (recently), I gave a talk at a big diversity conference in my city on ""Time Management and Productivity"", and he was there, and according to one of my friends (whom I got a job at workplace X through that WWCode event I ran), he said after my talk that he wanted to convince me to work at Company X, no matter what.

I‚Äôve been fretting over the past year or so about not being in a particularly cyber security centric role, as I feel like I‚Äôm doing a disservice to my Cyber Security MSc, but the truth is, I really love coding in Python or C++. I love automation. But I also love the lure of cyber security, but my fear is that I'll end up just running automated tools all day. I don‚Äôt want to just run automated tools; I want to build those tools and the automation myself. 

&amp;nbsp;

So I had a meeting with Manager X and he told me there was a Cyber Security Engineer role going at Company X, and there was opportunity for growth and promotion to senior, and then to management if I wanted. I was worried about a few things: 

1) I would be the only security engineer in my country, and I have not been in a strictly cyber role since I graduated.

2) I didn‚Äôt want to leave my current team, manager and senior manager, as they‚Äôre amazing mentors and allow me space to learn in a fairly unpressurized role.

3) I didn‚Äôt want to leave my current company too soon (i've been there a year), and I didn‚Äôt want to leave the awesome perks. I had also submitted a project to the pitching competition, and I have a referral in the works.

4) I found it hard to get particularly excited about the end product that Company X produce, whereas my current company is seen as very 'cool' in the cyber security sphere. Current company is a cyber security vendor, Company X is a very large marketing and reviews organisation.

5) What if I finally get my wish, switch to a security role, and find it‚Äôs not for me? 

&amp;nbsp;

Manager X had also mentioned that they have very generous salaries to give out, which was exciting, as I knew they‚Äôd hopefully pay at least half of what they pay in the USA; and Security Engineers over there get upwards of 100k.

So I agreed to meet the senior security manager of Company X, Manager SX, in San Francisco when I was over for a conference. I had assumed that she would be there anyway, because I thought for example, she might live there, or was visiting for a business trip or something. WRONG. She was visiting solely to meet with me. Um. Massive compliment? 

She was lovely, a real role model and someone I could see myself working for. She said that security was not a big focus at Company X at the moment, but that she was working on it. I answered a few interview questions, and she seemed satisfied and we talked about podcasts and cryptocurrency for the remainder of the time. 

I was still determined to be loyal to my current company though. I asked around at the San Francisco conference about what other people thought, and the overwhelming answer was ‚ÄúGO FOR IT!‚Äù. I met the CISO of a massive security firm, and asked her what she thought, and she also thought I should totally go for it, and ‚Äòmake bank‚Äô, as security jobs tended to pay higher than dev jobs, and ‚Äòyou‚Äôll never lose those programming skills and that dev experience you have under your belt‚Äô. 


&amp;nbsp;


So I got back to my hometown, and a few things happened that made me think that the Universe was trying to tell me something.

1) My manager complained that the code I wrote before I went to the conference had broken and that the day before had been an absolute nightmare because of this.

2) I was told that the intern on my team (whom I get on really well with) was leaving in 5 weeks, not having been consulted on this when we‚Äôre a full time team of 2. 

3) There was a change in my manager‚Äôs manager, (who we will have 1-1 meetings with and who will be responsible for our career growth) from someone I trust and very much like to someone who I‚Äôm extremely nervous of, and have always been awkward around as such. I‚Äôm worried just thinking about this.

4) Company X emailed me to say they would actually be hiring 2 Security Engineers rather than just 1 (one of which may potentially be me).

I‚Äôve only been at my current company for a year (although I interned here for 6 months during my MSc). And I was at my previous job, which was my first one out of University after I graduated from my Cyber Security MSc, for 6-8 months as it wasn‚Äôt right for me. 

I'm feeling loyal to my current company really only because my current job is rewarding and not too stressful, I like(d) my team, I got on well with a group of co-workers as we play games together, and I enjoy coding. 

What I might be potentially going to is a higher paid, potentially more stressful job, but one that fits the profile of what I've been saying I want to do for ages. My worry would be leaving too soon and causing my CV to look bad, and also not being able to go back if I don't like the security focused job.


...... any advice, Reddit? :) 

*****

TL;DR: Do I switch jobs because of a really tempting and career-savvy offer if I'm really scared, have only been at my previous two jobs for ~a year, and think that the new company is slightly less 'cool' than my current one? This new company seem to really want me, and I'm really considering it, but I need a second opinion.

When I had applied to the job, I put on my resume that my grad date was December 2018(the semester prior). It changed over the past semester, because my advisor at college set a path for my courses. I worked with the advisor the prior 3 semesters so I didn't have any real reason to believe they gave me inaccurate information, but I'm unable to take a class concurrently with another class and that has resulted in me having to take a class next Spring to fulfill my degree requirement.

Anyway, my recruiter told me when I was offered the internship that the company only takes junior students and generally, the internship leads to the job out of college. They try to retain their interns and aren't taking on freshman and sophomores.

Now, my grad date changed and even though, it's not like I've even been offered anything further, I think them knowing this information would likely affect their decision on if they would offer me a full time position. 

Anybody in management or a senior tech person have any advice on how to handle this. Also, if I were to tell them this before I started the internship, would they be likely to take the internship away from me? I don't know. Just any advice would be helpful."

Stats: 
* 3.65 GPA
* Graduating in May
* Math and Comp Sci major with finance minor
* Top 25 U.S. Midwest university


Just received an offer into wealth management. I plan to use algorithms to trade clients money for a profit. I never got an internship in college, this is because I had been working at my local beach as a lifeguard in highschool, and they made me manager my freshman year college summer. I thought that being a manager there for a few years would round out my soft-skills and prepare me for client facing roles. I posted my resume on my LinkedIn and am proud to say I was sent multiple recruiting letters from big names (Charles Schwab, Edward Jones, Merrill Lynch) before ultimately signing with Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management Division. (*Hint* The interviewer saw my strong quantitative past and did not decide to ask me quantitative technicals, instead focused on behavioral). 

I didn't want to post this to brag, but I am very excited to make it into such a coveted role. I wanted to post this to show my fellow STEM-mers that it is possible to break into the prestigious and well paying finance jobs without getting a PHD. I assume most individuals on my desk will be jealous for wasting their time working on a masters/PHD while I was recruited from UG. I pity them.

I did not only to apply to finance jobs, I had software engineering offers from two top 25 tech companies. After I signed with Goldman I emailed both companies letting them know I would be going to Goldman's PWM division and thanked them for their interest in my talent (you never know, if I MBA lateral into a managerial type tech role, I could be interested in coming back as CFO or director of finance). I chose the Capital management finance role because I love working with hard numbers and designing algorithms to maximize profit. 

I've seen that CompSci is reccommended here for Finance majors and I agree. Skip the finance minor and go straight for Computer Science. My interviewer said that having a deep grasp of finance will not be needed for this role, which highlights the pure quantitative work needed. 


Best of luck to all.

25% Identifying and implementing process improvements/advancements and reporting status

25% Establishing data collection methods. Learning and applying understanding of variation and statistical analysis

10% Creating and releasing process documentation and process specification interpretation

They asked me to submit a link to the Github and I did, and my implementation worked flawlessly (which I regret now). My friend warned me that small startups sometimes issue coding challenges like this as scams for someone to do free work for them. They are now not responding to any of my emails and it has been 2 weeks, and they were quite responsive throughout the duration of the ""challenge"", mind you this is a company of 3 people.

Edit: Damn this got a lot more responses than I expected... General consensus seems to be that I got take advantage of, and looking back the company is pretty suspicious but I guess I assumed that if I did the challenge I could avoid some technical interviews huehuehue... I don't think I'm gonna disclose the name of the company just because it seems kind of controversial.

I started a seasonal internship at a company in the fall making $14/hr. I learned a lot in that time and was eventually offered a non-temporary part-time position, and my official title would no longer be intern (Associate Software Developer).

Last month was our annual, company-wide compensation review. I was informed that I would be getting a whopping $1/hr raise. He math behind it was also provided. Normal annual raises at the company are 16% and since I had only been there half a year, it was cut in half to 8%. Which makes sense I guess, but it still feels like a slap in the face. Especially because when I first began interviewing for this company they openly stated that interns make between $14-19/hr, so since I was originally placed at the bottom of this scale I could go 2 more years at this place and only *just* reach the top end of the scale...

To add more salt to the wound, all of my friends that had internships were paid way more (sometimes even double). I genuinely feel like I am many times more productive now than I was when I first started. Tasks that originally took me a week I can get done in a day or less."

My question is: When you are at a career/job fair looking for a career change to your first CS job. Is it better to tell the recruiter that you are looking for a career change? Or is it better to wait for their question of: ""Why are you pursuing CS when your background is in XXX?""  

Background:
I am a recent Mechanical Engineer grad with 1 year of working experience at an automotive company and a lot of internship experience.  I started liking programming in my college projects where I had to do some embedded controls, or simulation scripts.  In my recent job, all of the engineers around me did their data analysis in excel. I hate excel so I wrote a script in Python to generate better data visualization.  Of course, being the auto company, nobody knows what Python is. I had to build my script into an executable with a GUI. Now multiple engineering teams are using it to analyze their data.

All the while, I am doing my masters part time in CS through Georgia Tech's OMSCS program.

I realized I have a passion for CS, everything it so interesting to me and I am finally using the math and science that I was trained for.  (It was so difficult to find jobs with technical challenges that used my ME training)  I don't mind programming Python for data analysis at work and coming home to do C++ homework with multi threading and OpenGL.  

However, I am beginning to realize that my career aspiration to become a software developer is very limited in the automotive industry and I am looking for a change. I know it's early for me but I would like to perhaps go into software testing or a junior software position.  

I am attending a job fair soon and would like advice on how I should approach recruiters! Or maybe how I can approach the career transition in general. And how I can get relevant experience , get better at programming, talk to recruiters, and perhaps land my dream job one day! :)

Thanks all for your time! "

And I didn't let it get to me that much, and applied to other outside of it. I had 6 more interviews but unfortunately I got rejected. And this internship has to  be 3 months long, and I don't have much time to find one before June.

I've just been feeling really defeated because I've talked to my counselor and guides at my school and they don't understand why I'm struggling so hard. I thought maybe it was my resume but I got outside opinions and they say it's fine. I even talked to my professors and they are confused too. I made sure my linkedin is updated and professional, but nothing. I don't really know what is wrong with me, because I've had jobs in the past but finding one specific to my program has been hard.

All the rejection is just making me feel really defeated and I'm just worried because you can't graduate without completing one, and I'm worried I won't graduate. I have good grades and I'm on track to graduate, but it's only this preventing me from graduating next year. It also doesn't help all my friends found one, but I haven't.

I live in a more small rural community and a lot of these places are in more populated areas, where a lot more of my classmates live and so I can't really apply to them. I tried before but it is too difficult to get too and also employers don't want someone who is 2 hours away by car or public transit.

I don't really know what to do, and I'm just finding myself to become really depressed because of this. I'm really feeling like giving up and quitting school because of how down I've felt.

I'm less worried \(although still a bit worried\) about my ability to get a tech job post\-grad, but more worried that if I decide to try to get an internship next summer in a legislative office or a legislative job post\-grad I'll be immediately turned down on account of my GPA."

I am a graduate student in Electrical Engineering, specializing in Digital VLSI, from ASU. I am graduating next week and would like some advice regarding finding a full time job.

So far, I have completed courses such as VLSI Design, Computer Architecture, Semiconductor Memory Technologies. I have an in\-depth understanding on combinational and sequential circuit elements and design, digital logic design, MIPS architecture, Cache replacement policies, and memory technologies such as DRAM, NAND Flash, 3D XPoint. Apart from these, I have a grasp over semiconductor device physics, analog circuits. 

I have interviewed so far with a couple of companies, but nothing has turned out positive. I do not have any prior internship or work experience. For what its worth, I'm an international student, currently on F1 Visa and would need H1B sponsorship down the road. 

I've been actively applying for jobs on company websites, career portals, networking on LinkedIn and emailing recruiters/managers, hoping to secure an interview, but of no avail. I'm looking for full time positions as a Physical Design Engineer, SoC Design Engineer, Product Engineer and any position on those lines.

Is there anything I'm not doing right? Is there anything else I should be doing? Any piece of advice is much appreciated. Thanks "

At the previous location, the culture was a little different. My co-workers were younger, they were all mostly entry-level or interns and right out of college same as me. This made it really easy for me to relate and make friends, talk, and get along with everyone. I felt comfortable at work and was pretty happy where I was. 

At my new job, not only am I the only female developer, I am also the only entry level person on my team. Everyone else are at least two levels above me, and some seniors so it's super intimidating for me. Now, I'm really having a hard time to speak up and ask questions and state my ideas because I'm afraid of saying something dumb (particularly in group brainstorm situations cuz all I'm thinking is that what's the point of me saying anything when they all probably already know better). I'm literally just quiet all meeting -- which I don't think is good either, but I just can't bring myself to say anything. And them being older, I'm having a harder time finding a topic to relate to so I just feel super awkward most of the time because I never know how to react when they're all talking together.

Feeling like this for 40 hours a week, really sucks and I want to improve my situation. I know that it's in my power to be friends w/ my coworkers or at the very least be able to speak my mind or be myself with them. I'm pretty outgoing when it comes to my peers so I know I'm capable of speaking to other people. 

I wonder if anyone has any ideas to help me feel more comfortable around my new coworkers."

8gslah,8,2018-05-03,Differences between the entrepreneurial/school resources at USC vs. UC Berkeley?,KingShindo,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8gslah/differences_between_the_entrepreneurialschool/,"Currently I'm in a bind between attending UCB or USC. As an electrical engineering major Berkeley seems to be a no brainier. Silicon Valley, ranked third for my major (behind MIT and Stanford), and the best public school in the world. But the allure of a private school is still strong and I'm wondering if you guys could shed some wisdom in regards to any differences that exist between the two.

My main goal in life is to work for myself and use my efforts to help the world out as much as possible. The prospect of making money and using that on philanthropy and business capital is exciting, but after some jobs and internships I learned that working for an employer just isn't for me. At least not for the long term.

As such, I want to use my time in university (which won't be long as I'm a transfer student) to use the entrepreneurial resources around me as much as possible to network and make connections and either work with or build my own startup. I know both schools provide great opportunities in this regard, but I'm ignorant in how they're different.

I always hear that USC is the 'university of social connections' and a great place for anyone wanting to become an entrepreneur. But from the people I asked (current Berkeley students and various professors) they all tell me that cal is also stacked with these opportunities and resources. So are the entrepreneurial resources not talked about as much in cal than USC because Cal's so diverse, or does USC have UCB beat in this regard and how different are the two with how they foster entrepreneurship and innovation in students?

Secondly, even though Berkeley is the 'better' school it is still a public school and USC is a private school. Practically, what does this mean for a student? On surface value, if USC has so much money flowing into it, I'd think that their student resources would be better: better gym, better dining hall, better makerspaces, etc. but again I really don't know. Do you guys know when and where the distinction between public/private is palpable? I'm not super into the 'fun' events of schools (sports games, concerts, etc.) I just want to spend my time passing classes, meeting new people, networking, and building something that could reap a lot of benefits for society. Does USC's extra money help in this regard, or would I not miss much if I went to cal?

Thanks in advance for any and all advice and help!"

8gsuje,1,2018-05-03,Purdue vs. San Jose State,[deleted],ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8gsuje/purdue_vs_san_jose_state/,"Hey guys, I am currently deciding between San Jose State and Purdue. I am committed to Purdue but am ready to drop the deposit if needed. \(I got my San Jose State decision back after May 1 so I have time to commit there\).

**Purdue \- Major: Web Programming and Design // Minor: Computer Science // Cost: \~$42,000/year**

*\*I will be attempting to CODO to computer science. If not, I will switch my major to Computer and Information Technology which is in the same department as my current major.*

**Pros:**

* Far away from home \(I've lived in San Jose all my life and going to Purdue will allow me to experience something new. I will also learn to become more independent since I'd have to commute from home after my first year if I went to San Jose State.\)
* Better computer science program
* Better brand name overall
* Beautiful campus
* Lots of clubs and organizations
* If I fail to transfer into computer science, I have the web design major/computer information technology major as a backup.
* I am able to minor in computer science if I am unable to CODO into computer science.

**Cons:**

* Weather \(will be a big difference from California weather\)
* Cost \(my parents can afford it, but it will be more expensive than San Jose State\)
* Parents will be faraway \(we have family friends living about an hour away from the campus in case of an emergency, but I won't be able to depend on them as much\)

**San Jose State \- Major: Undeclared // Cost \(if I live on campus\): \~$30,000/year // Cost \(if I commute from home\): \~$19,000**

*\*I will be attempting to declare a software engineering or computer science major*

**Pros:**

* Location \- being in the Silicon Valley, it is in a prime location for internships and jobs
* Great computer science/software engineering program
* Cheaper \(especially since I may have to commute from home after my first year\)
* Parents are close by in case of an emergency
* Campus is nice
* Lots of clubs and organizations

**Cons:**

* If I am unable to declare a computer science or software engineering major \(which may happen due to how impacted computer science is at San Jose State\), I'll have to either take a gap year or go to DeAnza and then transfer somewhere else.
* Close to home \(I won't experience something ""new"" since I've lived in San Jose almost my entire life. I will also not be as independent since I might have to commute from home after my first year.\)
* Less of a brand name in comparison to Purdue

I am currently leaning towards Purdue, but would like your insight as well in case I am forgetting to consider something. Money is not an issue \(parents have been saving up for my college education for a long time\), but I just want to make sure Purdue is worth the extra money, especially since I did not get into my intended major of computer science at either university.

I made some mistakes during my sophomore year which led to my GPA tanking a lot, so I couldn't get into computer science directly at any university \(besides San Francisco State and UT Dallas, both of which were either too expensive and / or not a fit for me \- I just can't see myself going there\). So these are my best options right now \(unless I get blessed from the waitlist at my dream school\).

Thanks."

2. Applying to numerous companies hiring for both buy and sell side positions
3. Following the market habitually through Morningstar, WSJ, MSNBC, SEC filings, IBD, and Charles Schwab research tools
4. Increasing my excel proficiency and practicing DCF, Market/Book, and Comparable company analysis valuation techniques 
5. Focusing mainly on companies in the Financial, Consumer Staples, and Technology industry
6. Studying for the Level 1 CFA

1. If I am unable to receive any analyst/research offers, would taking an Advisory or PWM position be a beneficial step to obtain industry experience? 

2. What are some tangibles or technical skills that I should highlight when meeting and interviewing with the small research firms?

3. Any other certificates, credentials, or skills I should be improving? 

4. Below I have attached a link to my resume, any critiques or suggestions you'd recommend to make my candidacy more competitive?

I'm in a student run angel investing group in my current uni and I'm really enjoying that. I'm consider getting an MBA later on in my career as well, if any of that makes a difference. 

**tldr: (EDIT: moved up here since apparently this was easily missed)**

Worked with a study abroad provider to find an internship for me, assuming they'd find one where I would be doing programming. They didn't and I have little interest in the project I'll be working on. It's not really related to computer science and might not even fit on my resume. The program is really expensive, and I'm not being paid. Should I reneg?

**Pros:**

* Will be in a foreign city for the summer
* Non-zero chance to do some programming at the end + potential to be kept on as a remote developer
* I won't have to find something else to do over the summer
* The non-refundable deposits we've made won't go to waste (although this is kind of moot since it's still less expensive than taking the internship)
* Maybe I get some of the crypto I help develop?
* Maybe it will be an opportunity to widen my skill set into kinda-bizdev stuff
* Not really a pro per se, but reneging on the offer would make things pretty awkward between the company I'd be working for and the placement company, since the company I'm working for told me stuff about the project without me being under an NDA

**Cons:**

* AFAIK, I'm the only person interning in STEM of the other people in the group
* The entire program including visa fees is really expensive and the internship itself is unpaid (assuming I don't get any of the crypto I develop)
* I won't be home for the summer (I've been really homesick while at uni on the other side of the country)
* I've heard poor things about the housing that we'll have (Chapter Kings Cross if anyone is familiar)
* The internship doesn't have anything to do with programming right now
* I'm worried that I won't get good mentorship, since I'm fearing they're basically putting the task of developing/planning/doing bizdev for a WHOLE NEW CRYPTOCURRENCY on my shoulders
* Likewise, I literally have no idea where to start with the bizdev behind cryptocurrencies. I have a tiny bit of interest in them (I own a small portfolio), but I've really lost interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech as a whole recently. I don't follow markets or any coins, I just check my portfolio every morning and that's all I've been doing for quite some time now. I like to say I know enough to know that I don't know enough to do this project. Even if I do complete the project, I wouldn't know where to begin with programming a cryptocurrency.
* To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure if this would even fit on my resume since I think the other projects/internships/etc. that are on there now are more relevant to STEM
* I am interested in studying abroad for a school semester, but I am afraid that, if I pay for this internship, I won't have enough to pay for another study abroad experience
* I am seriously intimidated by the project. Like it's lowkey freaking me out
* Experience might not fit on my resume, and might not necessarily help me get a CS internship next year

**WARNING: LONG RANT/STORY AHEAD, ALSO LONG BECAUSE THIS IS ME JUST FINDING/COLLECTING MY THOUGHTS**

As background, I'm a sophomore computer science major at my current university (although I'm technically a freshman in major standing since I switched from mechanical engineering the summer after my freshman year). Back in January, I applied for ~150 internship applications through both cold-contacting companies and through online applications. Of the few that I actually heard back from, they all said no. I have decent side projects, good (albeit non-CS) past experience/internships, and a good GPA, but I assume me being a sophomore is what hurt my chances.

Not wanting to not have anything to do over the summer (since I had interned places for the two previous summers) and having a lot of interest in studying/living abroad, I thought it might be interesting to work with a college study abroad provider to find me an internship over the summer (since that's one of the things the providers offer).

So, I applied online through one of the providers' website's and eventually heard back that I was accepted into the program. I was excited, but weary that I wouldn't get placed into a computer-science related internship. I talked to one of the advisors when I applied, and she assured me that they had computer science (or at least STEM) majors work with them in the past to do internships.

Eventually, I had to talk with the placement advisor to sort out what I am interested in and what I'm not interested in. In that talk, I made it clear that I just wanted CS (programming) role. But I also mentioned that if absolutely no programming internships were available, that I might be interested in something like business development (which was a bad call at the time, imo).

Fast forward about a month or two, and I get an email from the placement advisor saying I have a provisional internship offer. As I feared, the role was not for computer science or programming, but rather to do with cryptocurrencies and scoping out the development of a new crypto currency for the company which has no experience or background with cryptocurrency. Now I mentioned in the initial talk with the advisor that I might be interested in something to do with cryptocurrency, but only in a programming role (and with the expectation that if I was going to be matched with a company that had experience with crypto so I could be mentored about what I'm doing). 

I sent the advisor an email back explaining that I wasn't really interested in the role (especially since my interest in cryptocurrency had waned since the initial meeting) and that I didn't think I would be comfortable or particularly good at the job either. Nonetheless, I agreed to interview with the company as long as I could say that I just want to do programming, since maybe they'd have another assignment for me (and that it would be me interviewing them as much as them interviewing me). I also asked that the advisor still look for placements for me in the mean time.

Well, the interview was less of an interview and more of the guy I was talking to explaining the project I would be working on. The entire conversation was set as if me interning there were a set thing. The person I talked with told me about the project and that (despite not being an NDA) said it was pretty much a company secret (the project is in total stealth mode right now) and that I couldn't disclose much to others about that I'm working on (what I've said above isn't revealing enough to break that IMO, and well I'm not under an NDA anyways). This was pretty weird to me since it didn't give me a chance to question them, and I couldn't say ""Stop! Stop! Don't tell me any secrets because I might not intern here."" for the sake of the interview (I didn't want to ruin any chances I had). I was kind of upset since I didn't get to spin the interview my way, saying that I just wanted to do programming. What they did say, however, is that as long I do enough enough research and work ahead of time (at home, before the internship) and if I worked fast enough there, that I might be able to get some programming in at the end of the internship in actually programming the cryptocurrency (it's not anything technical, it's just supposed to replace money a la bitcoin) and that they might retain me afterwards as a remote programmer. 

I sent a follow-up email to the advisor after the interview asking if she had found any other placements for me. She responded today saying that she wasn't able to find anything. So I'm torn between taking the placement or reneging on them. I've written down some pros and cons above.

If I do reneg, I'm not sure I would have any internship opportunities back home. On a whim yesterday, I applied to a few positions near my home (silicon valley thankfully) I found through LinkedIn, but I highly doubt I'll even hear back from any of them. I could also email the startup I worked for last year doing mechanical engineering work, but I'm afraid that would be kinda awkward with me contacting them so late and coming back doing different work than what I did before (even though I LOVED worked with that startup).

So yeah, I really can't decide whether or not to take this. I email the person at the company I would be working for an email asking specifically what I'd be working on in the project, so hopefully that'll help me make up my mind (I'm hoping he says that I won't be leading the project and that my work will be kinda insignificant). But I also don't want to be narrow-minded.

Hello, 

I plan on going to UIUC‚Äôs Gies college of business, although I will apply to other schools this is my cheapest option. 

There I will have multiple options of what to major in.

I can choose between 

BS in Accountancy
BS in Finance
BS-Mas in Accountancy 
An Accountancy/Finance double major. 

I hope to end up in IB or consulting which I find very interesting. However potentially getting a CPA as a backup in case I don‚Äôt get into either of those seems like a good idea to me... but what do I know.

On top of that some things to consider is that I am for sure going to try to do internships at banks. That I may want to travel abroad as that seems fun and useful. That I may want to minor in Econ or another foreign language as I love both of those.


I‚Äôm also going to finish high school with between 33-49 Credit hours from Ap tests for UIUC depending on whether I get 3/4s or 5s. I‚Äôm not sure but this will hopefully allow me to do more of the things I‚Äôm interested in. I will only have 4 required  gen ed classes remaining afaik.

Of course this is all speculative as I have to get into the school but this is my dream. 

For anyone who thinks I should be studying and more worried about high school and applying... I am.. this is what I like to do in my free time.

Just a bit of background of myself. I recently graduated college and I was fortunate enough to land a job straight out of college. I've held an internship every summer of college and got slightly above average grades throughout my time at school. I have an apartment locked down and I'm moving in June 1st and starting my job the week after. 

I'm really nervous about messing this up. I'm scared that I just got lucky with this job and that I'll end up getting fired after a month because I'm actually not a good developer. This leads to more anxiety because then I worry how I'll disappoint my family and end up having to leave my apartment and screwing over my roommates because I couldn't hold a job. 

The one thing I am 100% confident on is my work ethic. I know that I'm an adequate developer, but above all else, it's my work ethic and drive that got me through most of college and the work at my internships. I'm just still nervous that it won't be enough. 

Basically, what I'm asking for in this post is advice for dealing with these worries that comes with starting your first real full time developer job. How did you cope with it and when did you feel like you were a good developer. 

Thanks for reading.

But the problem is that, then she told me that doing extracurricular activities would be great to overcome my shyness and that I was ""dull"" (not sure if it is the right word, English is not my native language) and that would be a disadvantage when looking for a job. When I heard that, my eyes started to water and I just wanted to cry, but I didn't, but I am pretty sure that she noticed.
It is not the first time that someone says someting like that to me and it really hurts me, because I think I am doing better and I try to be sociable, respectfull and try to talk to people, but it is never enough.
I always hear people say ""be yourself"", but myself is someone that is usually quiet and doesn't like to talk a lot and I am pretty sure that even if my social skills get better, people will always say that, because I am not energetic like extroverted people."

Hello im new to posting on reddit but i would just like to share my internship finding experience this year. I am currently a sophomore attending a university with a fairly good computer science department. At the beginning of this year, I was not expecting to receive an internship and was probably just going to stay and take summer courses. However, after apply to 400+ internship positions for software engineering i received 4 behavioral interviews, which led to 2 technical interviews, which led to two offers on the table. I was ecstatic. They were both around 18/hr but i was happy with them. However, a week after i accepted one, Amazon sent me an assessment test for their SDE intern position. I was surprised that i even received something from amazon and took the assessment. Ending up being fairly ez for me and i received a second assessment the next day. Took that one and also aced it and received an email saying Amazon wanted to have a technical interview me via video call. In awe i did not expect to even get so far so i went to hard core study mode before my interview with them. I fell around 2 weeks behind in school from studying Leetcode, CTCI, etc. I worked my butt off and try to make the fullest of this situation. When the day of my interview came i felt ready and went in with confidence. When i took the interview, i completely aced it and was very confident in all my answers and and for the coding question. Four days later, I received my offer letter and i was screaming excitement. From thinking about not getting an internship this summer to working for one of the Big 4. I had to renege my accepted offer, but now i am going to be going to Seattle to work for Amazon this summer. 

If there had to be a lesson from my experience i guess it would have to be take each opportunity to the very end. Try to make the most of each and every opportunity no matter what. You never know when your gonna get that big chance and don't waste it.

Computer science major 
Mathematics minor
Gpa 3.3

I‚Äôm going to try to keep this short

I‚Äôm that kid that is smart but doesn‚Äôt apply himself, in school at least. I‚Äôve always been a bad student, but I have a legitimate interest in the material and I‚Äôm smart, so I have always been able to get passable grades. I know I‚Äôm not a good student I spend I don‚Äôt really bother with school, so I spend my time doing projects which is my strong suit. I was also recently diagnosed with mild ADD so that might explain some of my performance in school \(maybe all of it?\). Anyway, my GPA is below a 3.0 I decided to inflate it some on my resume.

I applied for a summer internship at a local fortune 500 company through their website where I submitted a copy of my resume with an inflated GPA of 3.2 cumulative. I never expected a reply because I know they receive many applications with fancy looking credentials, so I was surprised when got an email two days later asking to schedule a phone interview. I took the phone interview and confirmed that GPA on my resume which I promptly forget happened \(more on this below\). The interview went well so we scheduled a second interview with an engineer a few days later. The interview with the engineer went surprising well so I started to get excited and worried at the same time. I was constantly worried the whole time they would call to confirm my GPA and every time I didn‚Äôt get a response instantly I figured this is what happened. So, the fact that I lied on my application was constantly on my mind. The recruiter called the next day and said they would like to extend an offer which I was very glad to hear but also now extremely worried. Once I received the offer I saw that it was contingent on maintaining a 3.0 GPA so I knew the jig was up. After consulting with friends, I called and asked what she would do if a student lied about their GPA, she explained that a 3.0 was hard requirement, I told her I would have to turn down the offer and apologized for wasting her time.

**Lying about GPA on a resume is a bad idea.** I‚Äôm still up in the air about lying about GPA in general but I regret lying about it on my resume.

**If a recruiter asks about GPA multiple times it‚Äôs probably important.** Thinking back, I ended up lying about my GPA three specific times, in hind\-sight it‚Äôs obvious that the first question of the first interview was about my GPA because they have a hard requirement.

**You‚Äôre inherently wasting someone‚Äôs time when you lie to get a job.** This is the one I feel bad about because when I told her I would have to turn down the offer she was clearly annoyed that I wasted her time.

**You‚Äôre making your school look bad.** Yeah, I‚Äôm pretty okay with this one.

**Make sure you get interview specifics before the interview**. Unrelated but the recruiter made it sound my second interview was in person. I asked her to call and email me when the specifics were worked out but she never did so I sat around in a suit for a few hours the day of the interview waiting when the engineer seemingly called at random and interviewed me.

**Employers have multiple ways to confirm your GPA.** They can confirm your GPA during the interview process by calling the school, they can check it during a background check or they can ask for a transcript.

**It‚Äôs stressful telling the truth and earlier might be better.** I wish I told the truth earlier in the interview process. Even though the hard 3.0 requirement would have ended my prospects in this case. I think I might have been better off admitting my GPA on my resume was incorrect during the first interview rather than calling after I received an offer and explaining that I have been lying since our first interaction.

**When you lie you are throwing your references under the bus.** In this case I knew this ahead of time and refused to submit references. Don‚Äôt risk relationships and put other people‚Äôs opportunities at risk. Don‚Äôt be a fuck, just don‚Äôt.

**Tell the truth.** When I saw the offer was contingent on GPA I knew I had to tell the truth but wasn‚Äôt sure how I would go about it so I talked to multiple friends and got a variety of responses including.

* Turn down the offer with no explanation.
* Tell the truth and see where things go from there.
* Submitting a transcript and not say anything.
* Stall until you can think of a better idea.

**Tl;dr Don‚Äôt lie about your GPA or do, it‚Äôs your choice. This is just some of the stuff I learned. That being said I probably won‚Äôt do it again.**"

I'm a junior in HS. I have a 36 ACT, 4.0 GPA, a decent amount of extracurriculars, and will have about 10 AP classes when I graduate. I plan on applying at least to my state school(University at Nebraska-Lincoln), Georgia Tech, and MIT. I basically for sure have full tuition to UNL, so that's the backup plan. I'm hoping I'll get accepted to GTech; I think it's within my reach. The Stamps Presidential Scholar program would be amazing to get, but I'm not sure I should get my hopes up about it. MIT is always gonna be a crapshoot of a chance, especially since I'm a white male. My main question is whether the prestige and learning opportunities and easier job prospects of GTech are worth the OOS tuition I would have to pay over UNL. Obviously I have time to make a decision but I would like to start thinking about this now. At UNL I would be able to room with my friends and have more of a ""fun"" college experience but that isn't really where my goals lie. Just want to know what you guys think about this!

Second, a lot of people on reddit seem to have a shitty opinion on the outlook of ChemE. This is currently what I want to do, but I have yet to take a CS class and I may enjoy that. Is the job market for ChemEs really that bad? I hear it's a very diverse field yet people still complain about how hard it is to find a job even with co-ops and internships. Is ChemE still a good major for the future? I am not opposed to going into management or sales later in my career if that makes a difference.
 
Edit: Also some people say that GTech is utter hell with difficulty, any input on this?

There were no plans to further my education after I graduated HS; I had the ""fuck the education system"" mentality, but that was also induced by the toxic group of friends I had at the time. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and simply put- I was stuck. I attended community college for a semester and dropped out after barely two weeks of class. At that time I declared a major in graphic design. 

Long story short: I dropped out of CC and was working as a hostess at The Cheesecake Factory. After working for six months, I left to travel abroad for two months- and that was when I had the realization that I needed to get my life ""together"".

Two years later, I am now 20 and am currently working full time while attending a community college. My major is along the lines of Info. Sci/Comp. Sci (very vague, as I am still exploring). From someone who initially was passionate about art and design, I quickly learned that a major in liberal arts would lead me to difficulty in finding gainful employment. A degree in STEM makes the most sense to me.
This is my third semester and I had planned to transfer to a four-year University, but at this point, I think it is best for me to attain an AA. I have been revising my resume in hopes to apply (and hopefully get accepted) to internships and part-time jobs in this Summer/Fall related to tech. and data to help advance my skills and buttress my experiences. 

There's this guilt that I carry in terms of: I can't help but feel bad about being a 20 year old (turning 21 next month) and not achieving a BA and graduating like many of my friends are. 

Most of my friends are nearly done with school, graduating by the end of this semester. Some are graduating next year and already have jobs lined up.

My boyfriend is 22 and is graduating in two weeks.

Without said, I am grateful to be in this position where I am working a job with above decent pay and to be able to cash flow through community college with no loans. I am also proud of myself for being able to make a 180 degree turn from being someone who was so anti-school to someone who is passionate about learning and an affinity for growing further. 

I don't want to complain nor compare. This has been something that I have been working on...it's just, difficult. 

So with that said, are there any redditors out there who can relate or would like to share their thoughts? 

Very much appreciated. "

After a long search I finally got hired, and I've been working for a medium\-size big data company as an intern for 6\-months and a month ago, I got a full time position doing the same work at a new office. I primarily work on cloud/data engineering where I architect AWS/GCP designs and implement them in Python. I really enjoy the work and like architecting and implementing efficient cloud systems that best serve client needs.

However, since I arrived at this new office, I'm seated somewhat close to our company's data science department. I never interact with our data scientists but I'm extremely interested in that field. Prior to working for this company, all of my background and skills were focused on data analysis, machine learning, and AI. During my job search, I tried really hard to find an analyst or data scientist position but that was really difficult since I only have a bachelors and my only experience in the field was as a mentor for Udacity's data analyst and machine learning nano degrees. My GPA wasn't the greatest either, so I basically took the first job I could get with the hope of changing career paths later on when I get more work experience.

I've certainly excelled at my current role and got a glowing recommendation for a full\-time hire in my current position but I'm worried I'll be railroaded into a career path that takes me away from my true passion, which is data science and machine learning.

From what I can tell, all of our data scientists are extremely intelligent people that went to good universities and have, at minimum, a masters in some sort of science. My data science and ML knowledge has fallen off a bit since I had to scramble to learn the skills required for my current role and as a result, I feel like there's this insurmountable gap between me and the data scientists.

So several questions that I'm struggling with are:

* Are cross\-department hires/moves possible and/or advisable?
* How should I go about inquiring about the possibility of changing positions?
* Is the higher education gap going to be my biggest obstacle? Should I pursue a masters to make up for it?

I did terribly in college because of undiagnosed mental issues that I've since been getting treatment for. It's made a world of difference since I'm now excelling in the work place, but the damage has been done and it makes looking for higher education a real difficulty. I don't have any good relationships with professors, especially a year out of college. So if there's anything I can do to avoid having to go through that route, I'd like to explore it."

Furthermore, I have more or less a perfect GPA, and I've done/am doing internships in top CS roles as well as top business roles \(think Google, FB, MBB, IB, etc\) throughout my summers.

I have been a reader of this sub for a long time, but have never posted. Sorry if this is not the right sub. I thank you in advance

For a little background, I was hired at a Start-up in the Northern Califronia at a company I really see the value in for the future. It has just been six months since being hired. Everything had been going great. I worked with my small core team day in and day out, had interns come and help, went on a business trip with my boss (CEO), and built relationships with my customers. I was working hard (40+) hours every week for the growth stage of this company that is the most important part this early on.

The only thing is I felt my co-founder started being passive with me and acting different with me a few months in. To be more clear, she was always more critical of me in our weekly meeting and in general, with anything I did. There was just something off, but keeping it professional I would just listen to her and move onto my tasks in my role.

Fast forward a few weeks ago, we would have investors coming in and out to meet our team and talk briefly about our roles. Not saying specifics. The last time that happened the investors never showed up, but I stayed after hours in the office. Within an hour after work they come into the office (Co-founder, Investor-1, and Investor-2). Investor-1, I had never met, but I heard about her before. The other is a nice guy and we had met him the most.

I had asked my boss immediately in secrecy what the situation was and she said CASUAL as we were in the largest room with a big couched area. I was about 10 feet away from them. I introduced myself and told her about my role and went on to my work as they talked. She would occasionally ask me questions from afar and take me from my focus on my work, but she asked me one question that started the situation. Investor-1 asked me about a specific number on the growth of my customers since I had started, and I could only answer the question as she funds my company a lot of money and my Co-founder did not intervene! I had to answer, but the real problem started when my co-founder said a completely wrong number and then my Investor-1 started saying way different numbers and I just stayed quiet as they both did not understand where we were at (side note: I was proud of the growth in that short time). Next thing you know my co-founder headed downstairs to let my (sick!) CEO what happened and he came up, but messaged me before ""Don't you EVER say numbers with investors"" and I had to quickly and professionally explain the situation. Next thing you know he is in the same room and all I wanted to do was finish my work.

I finished soon after and said my goodbys soon after that. 10 minutes later on my way home they both started messaging me and blowing up saying how I can't say/ do this and that, but my co-founder started using lots of terms like termination and making it seem like I said any false numbers but knowing messages are saved and I didn't want to get fired, I just apologized to both of them, knowing she was the one who as a high representative of my company to even let something like this after hours happen (I know my work as I work on it everyday). My CEO was more understanding but I didn't know what to expect in the morning.

Come morning he is there and I apologized again, but I didn't want to say anything about my co-founder saying misleading information not knowing what she was talking about. He just said ""we shouldn't say numbers to anyone, but especially Investors as they are trying to protect us because if the Investor feels we are not capable of the job, we will be terminated.."" I listened and went on to my work.

This Monday: Came into my work and after six months, they finally had someone start to ""help me"" market even though they terminated me the same day. What are the odds. Something seemed off during our normal Monday meeting discussing our weekly progress so they are aware of the work we are doing and where we are at. Once again my co-founder that doesn't keep up with my side of my role was extra critical and aggressive with her tone, but I would answer the questions as usual to not stir up anything that wasn't in the professional realm. The rest of the day I went on with my work and they had meetings all day. At the end of the day they asked for a ""brief conversation"" and to head down to our lobby. We had a discussion for about 20 mins about that situation and how they felt now they are not confident at me building my team even though they have know about all my work every week and acted like they now did not understand some approaches to my work I was doing. It circled back again to the Investor situation and at this point I was going to tell the truth to my CEO and co-founder so he could understand how she created the situation and tried to protect herself 100%. Immediately after bringing it up, she cut me off and said ""you know what, the bottom line is you're terminated which caught me off guard and I could not explain it to my CEO. She indeed has been clever with the way she has interacted with me individually and around the team. She made me feel like I was always doing something wrong and I actually started documenting some information in my note pad, but what do you know, they took that and the laptop back with most of my work and information.

I talked to my CEO on the way out and he will still be my reference and I respect him a lot. He took all the things they provided and he said I would receive an email from the termination... I still have not received anything from them or the HR company that has the contract, my pay information, etc.

By the way, in the contract we were supposed to have healthcare and dental covered and they NEVER set it up even though I asked almost weekly at one point.

I guess my question or ask for help is: - Can I potentially ask for unemployment (SF, California and I had received it last year from another employer) - Should I ask for a severance package or something similar for the situation? - Is this real ground for termination (is it potentially wrongful termination?) - I have still no information from the HR company of any termination notice because it may have been under the email I used from their company! - Go to court (CEO is a non practicing attorney in CA)?

TL;DR: Co-founder blamed me for an investor incident at my start up and things got weird for about a week. One week later they say that was a huge issue and all the sudden have no confidence in me and building my team. Decided to terminate me and still have no information whatsoever of our conversation or anything from my HR company with all my pay information and any termination letter. Can I come at them with anything from this?

I've implemented a simple standard for creating email addresses, as I've allowed a group of about 10 management\-level employees to create new users \(we use Google / Gmail\).  The policy is to use {first initial}{last name}@domain.com.  There are a few exceptions to this:

* A senior or more strategic hire.¬† Think director level, management, executive, etc.
* The last name is awkward, like John Haycock.¬† We give him ""johnh"" because of this.
* The last name is super long and complicated.

These individuals are purposely not following this standard and I don't want to be the guy who rules with an iron fist, I just want them to follow this rule and get on with their day.  I've given a list of reasons why we are doing this, but they still don't like the rules or agree with them, and continue to give first name basis emails out to anyone.  My biggest issue is they are giving them to interns, who are as junior as they get and may or may not work out.

I don‚Äôt know where to start for preparation besides past projects I‚Äôve done and familiarizing myself with what the startup does. Do you have any advice? Thanks!"

8h40wj,3,2018-05-04,Sophomore @ a non-target vs Junior @ a semi-target/target?,countryshiz,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/8h40wj/sophomore_a_nontarget_vs_junior_a_semitargettarget/,"I'm currently a freshman community student, and was recently rejected from all semi-targets (think top publics/privates) with a 3.8 GPA (took all the pre-requsities such as Calc 1, Stats, micro&amp;macroecon, etc) but got accepted to my state-universities. 

However (I understand I am not in the position to say this but I will anyways for the sake of getting the point across), Clemson &amp; USC don't place a lot of students in high-finance roles. One of the two actually has a program that has sent students into banking in the South and NYC but being a Sophomore transfer already hurts my chances of getting into that specific club. 

I am very confident that staying at community for another 30 credits, I will keep my GPA where it's at since I just need general eds, and some science labs. I am joining some clubs soon which will standout slightly, and doing my best at the moment to get any kind of internship. 

Now the issue is (at least for IBDs), they start recruiting Sophomore year so I don't know if transferring to a semitarget/target is worth doing? I'm retaking the SAT/ACT, and will aim for the better private unis as well. A high GPA just wont cut it but having a high SAT/ACT is something they can compare across other admits who probably wont submit it since it isn't required (or will if they scored very high).

It's a really iffy situation. The thing is, I know these schools will give you multiple options aside from IB such as AM/CB (corporate banking) which are less accelerated from what I heard. But then again, Clemson/USC do have alumni in these roles. Maybe the small group of alumni are more willing to stick out for you since not everyone there is gunning for IB, and they were in your shoes at one point probably. 

Thanks.

8h4bkr,3,2018-05-04,Coding Bootcamp vs. Internship vs. Job (Need Advice),cardinal2700,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8h4bkr/coding_bootcamp_vs_internship_vs_job_need_advice/,"Here's the situation. I'm a current high school senior who's probably going to pursue computer science/mathematical and computational science at Stanford and as a career. I'd say I'm pretty fluent in both Java and Python as I've taken two years of Computer Science in High School (have scored a 4 on AP Comp Sci A exam and currently taking IB Computer Science exam). I'm not perfect, but I'd say I could easily pass a first-semester college computer science class (like Stanford's CS 106A). Last summer I also worked for six and a half weeks in an intensive research setting at a university where I helped develop a Python program using Anaconda that the members who work in the lab will use extensively in the future for analysis and data processing. In addition, I'm learning how to code in Scala for my senior project and I hope to learn C++ or JavaScript or maybe SQL before I head to college.

Right now I'm at odds with my parents who are pushing me to spend my whole summer at a coding bootcamp. From what they've heard from my relatives who work at big tech companies in Silicon Valley, bootcamps are the ""secret passageway"" to landing the top jobs at companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, etc. There is no doubt that I want to land one of those jobs/internships during my summers in college. However, I'm a little hesistant. From what I've read on the internet and Reddit, bootcamps seem to be more useful for those without programming experience and those who do not have time to get a CS degree in college. Although money isn't a factor in the decision for me, it does seem like a big waste of money for me to go to an intensive, 12-week bootcamp where I'm just reviewing things I may already know and will probably learn in college. That's not even to mention that my whole summer would essentially be taken up by the bootcamp. But other places online do seem to show that bootcamps really can give a leg up in the super competitive job hiring process, and I'm willing to do nearly anything to separate myself from the pack.

My other alternatives for the summer are working at a summer camp at my high school or potentially taking a coding internship with a financial company (my preferred option). 

What do you guys think? Is it worth it spending my summer at a coding bootcamp? Can it really give me an advantage in a year or two when I apply for an internship at Google or Facebook? Or should I work at my school, make some money, hone my programming skills on my own and relax a little more before I head to college? I'm open to all suggestions.

(malaysia)

When I was 5-12, I usually get beaten by my mother and sometimes my father.

The reasons usually will be that i am intellectually slow and stupid.
How stupid? I can't read and can't spell cant even properly construct proper sentences and my grades is a joke. other times was usually due to bad behavior

Not only that, my mom have the nice idea to shame me in front of her friends, relatives and even my friends. from my academics, to looks, desires, and a certain body part of mine.

then around the age of 13-15 my parents had a fight. It was about me, I heard they said my name. Then they divorced afterwards, I used to blame my self. But I don't anymore. after that, it was spiraling down wards. I envied my brother so much, he was better at everything, He didn't even get hit by my parents. If he wanted something he'll get it anyways. If I wanted something I'll be called ""stupid"" and ""you worth nothing""

school life was pretty normal. I think, never had a gf during school. sometimes I break down emotionally. My parents financial status was never a problem, We had food on our plates, Stainless steel spoon/forks. 

what was not considered normal during my school years is that, I became atheist.

fast forward to my 20's. I had a job, resigned because I had to take diploma, got a gf then broke up (we were together since 19-24). I had to stop pursuing my diploma during my internship (or my sixth semester), because my ""depression"" was getting out of hands. Episodes of Extreme sadness, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, with a mix of moral dilemma's and sometimes multiple inner voices. Like 3 of them in my head that bicker back and forth.

Now I am 25. I got diagnosed with ""dysthimia"" doctors say it was a type of depression  that lasted longer than normal. With usually a mild depression. I was diagnosed on september 2017 if I remember correctly.

Nowadays. I don't really know what or how I feel. Sometimes when I think back, I do recall on happy memories, but they are.. Muddied or blurred and sometimes hard to remember. During sleepless night or in deep thought. I can fully recall when I was hit, where and how I was hit.

I don't think I have depression, sometimes I think I made up the story. I don't really know anymore. sometimes I just want to die but I don't want to in the same time. Other times, I think... I am already dead and this is my purgatory.

So.. the questions is.. Is this depression? Is this what it feels like? Was I really abused, if I can recall the memories vividly?

And why do I feel that I made up the story. Maybe my parents did love me.
Because. If they dont, Why am I fat? My stomach is always full, I have a PC that can play games that I want. I have a bed, a roof on my head and pocket money when I want it. Maybe I am just a spoiled child, rotten to the core and manipulative with my sob stories.

but thats just about it. I just can't tell, what is real and whats not anymore. my life was constructed on my lie and my own perspective of the world anyways.

Now the content overflows into the second page. I would like some feedback on what to do since I have a job that is cut out from the resume now. Should I just drop that experience? Are the bullet points for my projects and for my experience applicable or should they be changed?

I am attempting to look for internships or full time positions as a developer. I currently have no professional experience in this field and tried tailoring my technologist background to be a little more applicable. I have a github, but the projects within it are school related or tutorial driven. One of the projects is for a program at my school that they requested.

A little about me - I have been working as a team lead in ad tech in India since 3 years, and have been admitted to an on-campus MS in CS in Northeastern University, and in the OMSCS by Georgia Tech. 

OMSCS is very attractive because of its coursework (it actually is MS level as opposed to NEU which seems easier), it's cost, and just Georgia Tech in general. 

However, I want to move out of the country, explore other cultures, and NEU would provide me with the option of working in US on OPT which GTech wouldn't. 

Now, I am prioritizing coursework and hence leaning towards OMSCS, but I don't want to live in India all my life, and I am thinking that I'll make most of my online MS program by traveling and working around the world doing short internships, and then eventually staying where I like the most.

How feasible is the idea?

I waited for the immigration procedure for about 3 months (I'm originally from north africa), got back to Paris in late december and started working in January.


From January to May, I only did 3 interviews : the clients in the first 2 interviews wanted senior or junior developers with a minimum working experience and i did them in february. The 3rd interview was for a junior position about 2 weeks ago and I almost got hired but the client told the consultancy company that they appreciated my application but they chose someone with bit more experience.
During those months I learned more about java , angular and front end technologies and financial markets. I followed some pluralsight courses and tried working on some problems on leetcode.


Event though the company extended my trial periode a month ago,they gave me a 5 week notice 2 days ago. The HR manager who hired me told me that during my 5 or 6 interviews ( I only did 3) they got negative feedback from the clients and that hiring me , an inexperienced dev was a bet and they no longer can afford paying me.  


The problem now is that I lost too much time between waiting for the immigration procedure and the time at my company. I did learn new skills but I did not get to apply them on concrete projects. 


Now that I am searching for a new job how am I going to justify that lost time? Why would a company hire me instead of a freshly graduated dev because we pretty much have the same experience?

I've been lurking around here and it seems like LeetCode is a great way to prepare, but I haven't seen anyone share their progression plan or advice on ways to optimize the use of LeetCode for passing interviews.

I'm hoping this thread can change that. Veterans, give us newbies some tips on the best way to use LeetCode. Some questions you could answer are:

What was your progression like?

Which questions did you start with and how should we choose?

Time/frequency that you spent to land your dream internship (and where was that?)

Studying the solutions vs trying to do it yourself?

Is LeetCode enough or did you use any other resources?

Basically, how do we newbies make sure we're not wasting our time doing it ""wrong""? ...etc.

8hbshy,9,2018-05-05,New internship role at a recently formed startup and is my first developer role. Overtime expected and I'm the only developer.,CurrentBarnacle,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8hbshy/new_internship_role_at_a_recently_formed_startup/,"I recently got employed to work as an developer at a very small company (less than ten employees). This is my first internship and I have had very light technical experience relating to the project. For many internship roles, there are mentors who act as a resource and a source for learning for the new interns, which is something that I expected for this role. Upon starting, I realized that I would be the sole developer for the project (with the exception of a few part time remote backend developers) meaning that I would essentially have to complete the project by myself with little to no technical guidance. The startups product relies solely on the project which to me doesn't make sense especially for someone who hasn't had much experience with the language. 


Most recently however, I left the work three minutes early and fifteen minutes later, was received with a long winded response from the boss who claims that what just happened is unacceptable. He essentially said that I should be expecting many late nights and should not be leaving until work is completed. Keeping in mind that I do not have equity in the company and am being paid below average for the area I'm in. He also expects that I reply to all messages immediately (even on weekends) and have contacted me through two different mediums to ensure that I abide to that rule. Furthermore, there doesn't appear to be any record of how many hours I have been working and he mentioned that I won't be paid until the end of the month.

What is everybody's thoughts on this? Any advice on how I should proceed? We are planning to have a meeting on Monday to discuss the situation and I would like to come to the table prepared. "

At this point I have two options for next year, take eleven junior/senior level classes and graduate May 2019 or prolong my graduation and try to find an internship to build some ""work experience"". My biggest fear is that I am going so fast that I will come out of this with a degree (and a pretty good GPA) but no projects or internships to show future employers. On the other hand, if I get an internship my graduation gets pushed back anywhere from 4-8 months and I'm not sure if that's enough experience to convince anyone I'm worth even interviewing when I do graduate.

My goal is to hopefully get an internship at a tech/fin tech company by the end of sophomore year (Summer 2019), and as a result I‚Äôm trying to utilize this summer as effectively as possible to prepare me for the summer 2019 internship  interviews that are coming up this fall.

And that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm stuck. I have a list of so many things I want to learn, projects I want to do, etc, but I can‚Äôt figure out realistically what I could get done in the summer and what would be of most benefit.

I‚Äôve only taken the intro computer science course at my uni, and will be taking data structures an algorithms next semester. I thought it would be a good idea to get ahead and start the course this summer (since it‚Äôs offered on coursera) so I have a better time absorbing this info throughout the next school year. I also wanted to use online resources in the summer to learn java (I only know and learn in java as of now), so there‚Äôs that.

I also started looking into some online resources that will help me learn some JS, HTML, and CSS because my uni doesn‚Äôt have any web dev courses and front end is something I believe that I should be familiar with. 

Along with what I want to learn is that I want to take up a project or two to start building my portfolio, but don‚Äôt know what to really make (other than a front end website project I began to start already).

And there‚Äôs the dilemma, there‚Äôs so many things I want to accomplish this summer, and I have ample time to do so, it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt know what I can realistically get done, and that is why I ask you guys in this subreddit who‚Äôve had experience working on your portfolio during the summer.

I graduated from a undergrad with BS in Biology and grad school with MS in Biomedical Engineering from the same school. My plan was to go to medical school. Therefore, I worked at research labs and volunteered at hospitals during the summers. However, with financial difficulties, I decided I had to fold my dream and venture into the industry.

After finishing grad school, I worked at a medical device company as its regulatory affairs specialist. I was desperate to get a job when I graduated so I grabbed the first opportunity that came my way. Ever since then, I worked at 2 different companies, all as regulatory specialist. So with having 3 total years of experience being in the regulatory team, I sought out many recruiters to help me find jobs in the research or product development area since I wanted my job to be more technical and hands\-on. 

This has been a nightmare for me since every single recruiters I talked with gave me the same answer: ""I believe it will be hard for you to find a research job since you have extensive regulatory and quality experience. You have no internship or any relevant experience that we can use."" I even specified that I am willing to take an entry level position to help me build my career.

I am in desperate need of help and guidance to somehow dig myself out of regulatory affairs. Does anyone have similar experience or have any suggestions that may help me in my search? I would greatly appreciate any comments or help you can provide for me. I can further explain my situation if needed as well."

8hcp2f,0,2018-05-05,"Graduating soon with a super strange set of credentials and just short some magic numbers, what are my options and best strategies moving forwards?",personizzle,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/8hcp2f/graduating_soon_with_a_super_strange_set_of/,"I could write an absolute essay about the academic, mental, family, and life circumstances that have lead to me being where I am right now, but I'll just summarize what I have to show people. After this June, I will have: 

* A Bachelor's of Science degree in engineering from a good but not elite university. 

* Plenty of addendums to this degree. It's a double major, Mechanical Engineering, and Robotics Engineering, which is widely considered the most intense/prestigious major option my school offers -- they're pretty well known nationally for this program. Also managed to add ***four*** minors to this: in Aerospace Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering, Astrophysics, and Computer Science. The first two especially are highly relevant to the kind of work I would like to end up doing. 

* A lovely, nice and round cumulative GPA of **2.974**. Oh so close. In-major GPA is similar or actually slightly lower, I did well with my humanities, and especially with my minors (manufacturing is a 4.0). 

* Graduation with distinction, though the way my university measures this, this is more a function of the sheer number of courses I've taken than anything else. 

* A transcript which shows it took me eight years to get there. 2.5 years at a normal pace, then part-time or no-time up until the start of this past academic year. My school grades on an A/B/C/NR system so failed classes just don't show up on a transcript. In many cases, this means I simply wasn't enrolling in classes, in other cases...yeah. 

* A final year which starts with gradewise the best term (quarter system school) I've had during an academic overload, and ramps up from there in intensity if not performance, with the past two quarters containing literally ***triple*** a full academic load, primarily jumping straight into upper-level coursework for the various minors. Overall GPA for this insane year is going to be 3.2, for the last semester+the bit I'll be finishing over summer, ~3.4. 

* In the middle of this roller coaster of a transcript, two separate attempts to complete my university's capstone project requirement, each abandoned halfway through, with less than stellar grades beforehand. Doesn't look good, and made it nearly impossible for me to apply for attempts to complete these again. 

* Fun fact: If you drop off those two project attempts, plus the couple of other things which are not counting towards my degree in any way, shape, or form due to being fully superseded by things I took when I went minor-happy this past year, I have a 3.0 right on the nose. Sigh. 

* Absolute fuck-all for the senior project that *will* be counting to my degree. I'm talking, embarrassed to put my name on this work or this project anywhere on my resume, nobody on the team is on speaking terms with each other, final result is so woefully below the stated goals that there really isn't anything innovative to it and it doesn't meet most of the university's requirements for these projects but they're passing us because who wants to do another year of this shitshow, no way could I begin to ask the prof for recommendations, I've gone to therapy over this thing, shitty grades, fuck-all. My university takes great pride in its project based approach, and places great emphasis on this senior project for job placement, and I effectively don't have one. 

* However, an ***extremely*** extensive personal portfolio of engineering project and leadership work. 15+ meticulously documented design projects, some for classes where I went over the top, some from school clubs, some personal. Some genuinely impressive stuff in there...a nine bar linkage for a robotics class which 5 years later is still the only project in the course's history to complete the task as originally intended before a class petition created a nerfed requirements option...full 1st order design of a mars orbiter with an associated 110 page engineering report...founding and working as lead engineering mentor for a competitive FRC program...vertical form fill seal machine build...a couple giant rocket builds. All feature in-depth documentation, analysis, and reflection on the entire engineering process....all could have been my senior project for credit, but things didn't work out that way. 

* Ability to absolutely nail every job application technical question I've found so far. 

* Likely, passed the FE - Mechanical exam. 

* A patent. 

* No research experience

* No engineering internships

* Two professors who are very, very familiar with the things I can do at my best, who I would ask for recommendations. One is accessible, the other retired the year I did bunches of stuff with him, about 5 years ago, and I haven't been able to get in touch. 

* A bunch more people who do not know me in an academic setting, but have designed and built things with me in varied contexts, and would give absolute glowing reviews. 

* Very little relevant or conventional work experience. Plenty of ""gig economy"" Uber type work, a few misguided startup concepts that didn't work out, plenty of off-the-books work like homeschooling tutor. A conventional, working professional resume-style chronology of it leaves gaps and a lot of question marks, not all of which have especially satisfying answers. 

* More debt than I care to say, and a living situation which I need to get out of ASAP for my mental health, but cannot financially at the moment. 

* Lifelong passion for and obsession with this kind of work. It's all I've ever known, wanted to do, or been especially good at. 

My family seems to think it's a foregone conclusion that this bizarre mix of highs and lows means I've tried and failed, that it'll be impossible to find any engineering job, let alone one in the competitive area I'd like to get into. I've been told some really strange things by my school's career center, like that if I'm not listing my GPA on my resume (I'm not right now) and have been in and out of school, I shouldn't be emphasizing project work so much, because people will assume I rode other people's coattails on them and won't be able to back up the overall project accomplishments, and that menial work history is more important, but also that I won't be taken seriously if that disaster-project isn't front and center. 

I want to get into mechanism design for spacecraft, either directly, or designing systems in support of their manufacture, and have since I was extremely young. All the big players and dream jobs demand a 3.0 or better, and it seems like you basically get thrown out of you're not there. I've considered grad school, thinking better grades and deeper background would help me get my foot in the door, but I've just missed what looks like a pretty universal hard cutoff there as well. I know I can do this stuff, and have the project work, knowledge, and evidence of raw work ethic to back it up, but I'm worried that because I've just missed a 3.0, and didn't gain those things through internships and more conventional means, that it won't really be looked at to begin with. 

Thoughts on my best path forwards? As I look to finding jobs, should I really be in ""take literally anything you can get"" mode, or am I able to set my sights higher than I feel like I can right now? If I have to take a position pretty unrelated to what I'd like to do, how do I best prevent myself from getting locked into a place/field I don't want to be forever, and how much risk do I run of this? How realistic is grad school for me, and what might some options be to look at? I know for jobs I can give things a shot and there's no harm in applying, but for grad schools, I have to bother professors for recommendations and such -- how viable is applying to programs which state a 3.0 minimum anyways; is this just wasted time and money?

One parent is dead and the other isn't really in my life, so I was raised by my grandparents. His death shook me to the very core and made me reevaluate my priorities and goals in life. 



I had a very tumultuous high school experience, as my grandfather became too ill to drive me to school (I had to go to a school 40 minutes away because I lived in an extremely rural area) and was forced to live with a classmate who stole money, books, my drawing tablet and god knows what else from me. My grades suffered and I came out of the ordeal with 3.8 weighted GPA and a 3.3 unweighted GPA. 



My high school teachers and councelor had a lot of admonition for me, and made it a point to tell me that I would never go to any college I wanted to, and that I should settle for the local community college instead. 2 more years being looked down on and mocked by my redneck classmates was not a future that I had anticipated. I ended up going to a small, liberal arts college several hours away on a hefty scholarship. I had a terrible experience due to the political climate and the lackluster curriculum which would have delayed my graduation for over a year. 



I was essentially punished for choosing a science major rather than a humanities degree. My housemate caused a bunch of drama with me, and essentially threatened blackmail because I was unhappy with her behavior. I had no friends. I went to the student health center every week for counseling and saw a doctor for medication, with no results. I begged for accommodations because I was autistic, and was met with scorn. After a semester, I left with a 3.4 GPA.




This past December was my last month of school, and I applied to a couple of schools as a transfer in hopes of escaping my living situation. I was not accepted to my state university, but received an offer for admission to a top 75 college in a neighboring state. They stuck me with a 18,000$ bill 3 days before classes started and demanded that I pay up immediately. They kept saying I would get financial aid then I never did.




So, I took a semester off to work and get all my finances in order. I received an inheritance from one of my parents which can cover all 4 years of college, however, I had no idea what the magnitude of that wealth truly was at the time of my acceptance. 



I am currently working at a department store and am scheduled to take summer classes at a CC near my college (my university is a 40 minute commute so this was a good catching up option) Yet, I feel rather resignated about this decision. I've been living with my boyfriend since December, and our relationship is getting very rocky.




He refuses to let us move closer to campus, because his 10 minute commute would become longer. He makes me do every single chore even though I have so much on my plate, and attempts at discussion are futile. He says the least that I can do is clean up, and that my retail job isn't that stressful because I work 30 hours instead of 40. The costs of living in our city are extremely high, and I don't think I could afford a place by myself. I'm tentative about roommates. 




After watching my grandfather die, I had the urge to go back home and live with my grandma. The only problem was that the nearest university was an hour away, and the nearest community college 35-40 minutes away. It's my dream to attend Northwestern, and I feel like going to the state school here will give me more opportunities to succeed and transfer to NU (or attend grad school there) I'm afraid colleges will look down on me for attending community college after I briefly went to a four year. 




My thoughts have been filled with helping my grandma like I did during this week. She is 79, so I worry about her immensely. I want to help her with her farm and crops, with the cooking, sew with her, etc. But it's nearly impossible to find employment in her community, much less an internship or extracurricular activity that could help me with my major. I could theoretically drop all my classes and not attend the state uni in the fall in favor of the community college, but I seriously doubt they would readmit me again. 



I'm so torn."

I'm well aware of the fact that I can only change my major once, so I'd really appreciate some input into what majors would be the best fit for me. 

I'm considering aerospace, mechanical, electrical, and computer science/engineering as my main options, as I'm not all that interested in the other engineering majors. 

My top pick major as of now would be computer science, and I'd like to know a little more about the program from students who have majored in it. 

-Is prior experience in computer science (C++, Python, etc.) drastically important for success as a freshman noob? 

-Is it feasible to perform well without having taken the AP computer science courses in high school? 

-Kind of an unimportant question, but how important is your ability to type effectively as a comp sci major? I 
consider typing to be one of my better skills, and I'd just like to know how well that integrates into this major in particular. 

-Which engineering majors tend to have the best internship opportunities and are relatively ""easier"" to get hired from? 

-How many hours of studying would you say you do a day? 

Thanks if you have the time to answer this. Again, I'm a pretty clueless high school senior coming into college nervous and fearful of what UCLA is gonna throw at me, so please, if you have anything important/relevant to say about this school and its engineering programs, please do. Everything from the quarter system to the insane amount of studying to the new people to meet is all exciting and daunting at the same time. Good luck to all of my other fellow engineering majors and UCLA bound peers out there :)"
8hdiqu,0,2018-05-06,Question about CIT major in Polytechnic,[deleted],Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/8hdiqu/question_about_cit_major_in_polytechnic/,"I've heard that Purdue's Polytechnic Institute's CIT \(computer information technology\) major also leads to students getting software engineering/CS jobs post\-graduation.

My questions are:

* Will CIT majors be at any disadvantage in getting a job vs a CS major? Do lots of employers have a bias towards one major when looking at resumes? \(Less pay, less opportunities, etc\)? I will be minoring in CS along with the CIT major \(unless I can CODO into CS which will be hard... and even if I can CODO into CS, I'll think about whether or not it is worth it for me and I can handle it\) and hope to land a job in silicon valley after graduation, although tbh, i don't really care too much about location as long as it's job I like and i'm happy.
   * Yes, I know CS/SE is more about internships, projects, etc. etc. more than the college you go to or what you major in, but better schools/majors have better things just given to students... at lower\-ranked schools/programs, students have to work harder to find those opportunities. I just want to know how much harder CIT majors will have to work to get those opportunities that Purdue CS majors are just given access to \- if they even have to work harder at all
* How much inferior \- if at all \- is the quality of education with a CIT major in comparison to a CS major? Do you know any CIT majors \(or if you're a CIT major, feel free to answer too\) who have regretted not majoring in regular CS?

I know Purdue has an amazing brand name nationwide for CS and engineering, but I hope it is the same for the CIT major in Polytechnic.

Thanks, and Boiler Up!"

8hee58,5,2018-05-06,Non CS degree?,gz_36,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8hee58/non_cs_degree/,"How important is having a CS degree vs other degrees in terms of job prospects? Our school has a bioinformatics major and its requirements appeals to me more than the CS major. I'm still leaning towards working in industry after graduation but I'm not ruling out the possibility of going to grad school for computational biology, but either way im more interested in the courses offered in the bioinformatics track than the CS track. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to reduce the number of CS courses I'm taking. I feel like instead of taking some of the required physics classes/theory classes in CS major, I would be more interested in taking some project classes or upper division courses instead. And honestly the bioinformatics courses sound really cool to learn about and are just courses I want to take regardless of what I want to do in the future, and many are very computationally heavy/well taught. The only thing that worries me is whether not having a CS degree would negatively affect me in internship/job searching, or if people would think that I didn't do CS because I can't handle the rigor of it. 

Background about me: current freshman; I'll be at the Microsoft freshmen internship program, and after the internship ends, working at a small local startup paid by hours for a little while. I don't think either say too much about my programming abilities since one is underclassmen only and one is a relatively low paying startup, and I definitely have a long way to go in computer science. I plan to do another internship either sophomore or junior summer and hopefully I'll be better prepared and able to land bigger roles, but i also want to do research for at least one summer because there are so many cool projects going on. I'm not opposed to being a CS major at all, but I just prefer course sequence in bioinformatics. Would hear some advice about whether that's a good idea, thanks! "

Any advice?",Heyhowareya123,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8hg7qf/finished_school_got_a_good_job_in_my_field_and_my/,"I finished grad school in 2017 and immediately started a good paying salaried job in my field in a city 3000km away from my hometown. I'm not particularly fond of this city but it's where my girlfriend is from.

She wanted to move here for family, so here we are. We signed on a lease for a year and she wasn't able to find a job so I often paid all of the rent.

My girlfriend is planning on going back to school in the fall in central Canada, a 3 and a half hour flight from here and an 8 hour drive from my family and friends. We weren't sure about renewing a lease even for the short term as money was tight, so she suggested moving in with her parents and I begrudgingly agreed.

The situation hasn't been too awful but I feel as though I'm treated like a 16 year old again. My girlfriend found a good paying internship in her field, and I finished paying off my 15k in student debt, so money isn't really an issue anymore ironically. 

While my job is good and my coworkers and boss are reasonable, I don't really enjoy living here and don't have a friends circle. I had a great friends circle while I was in grad school, and in my undergrad so it's not like I've always been bad at making friends. I joined a rec league and participated from October to April and nothing came of that. 

I'm trying to decide if I should move with my girlfriend to the city where she's going to school in August, wait until January, or wait until next April so that my resume looks better. At the same time, I wonder if being there will even solve any problems or if I should move closer to being back home and wait for her to finish school. She's moving to an area with a high cost of living and long commutes.

Right now I find myself extremely lonely and I don't like tiptoeing around the house. My girlfriend and I don't have the same days off and we hardly see each other. I've saved up a decent amount of money and have no debts, but the money is just sitting there. It's frustrating because I see my old friends buying condos and houses and I did what I was supposed to do and am living in my girlfriend's parents' basement at 26. What would you do in my position?

TL;DR - I finished school, have a salaried job and live in my girlfriend's parents' basement despite having no debt or plans to buy a house. I have no friends in my city and I don't know what to do.

So I've been viewing this subreddit for a few years now but finally posting on here. I know obviously the internet will never be able to replace deep soul searching, but I have found reddit to be a great brain storming community, even if it never gives a final answer (as that's up to you to decide).


Anyways, here it goes. I'm a soon to be 25 year old engineer who has been out of school for 1 year now. When I graduated, I had already worked countless internships in many different fields. I knew engineering simply wasn't going to be for me, it simply does not meet what I want in a job anymore, and probably never will. The repetitiveness, the sitting at a desk for 8 hours, the staring at a computer screen for hours, it just isn't for me. I was also a field engineer once, but wasn't great in a very different way (on call at any time of the day to go repair something...).


I know you can't give much help if I can't give you guys more info about what I didn't like about my engineering jobs, nor what I feel I would like. So I'll talk about that a little next.


What I didn't like in engineering, as mentioned earlier, was the repetitiveness, the long hours at the desk staring at a computer screen, not getting to interact with people (or the people I do aren't very sociable to begin with...). Worked at a start-up that was engaging at times, but damn staring at that screen all day! Not only that, but the engineering culture (can't speak for other fields, that is why I'm saying engineering). Everyone seems to not draw or try to draw value from their work. They design something, push it to meet a deadline, hurry to meet the next, and get their paycheck. I don't feel like any true value was drawn from it at all.


Summary (dislikes):


-Repetitive as hell

-Staring at a screen all day

-Sitting in one place for too long

-Around others who are not very social

-Not interacting with others much, since it's mainly meeting design deadlines

-**Doesn't directly influence/help the emotional/mental/developmental well-being of another person**


I'd say one of my favorite jobs was as a server at a Mexican restaurant, and getting old ladies drunk on Sunday for more tips, haha. Another job I loved to an extent was as a tutor for a local TRIO program for underrepresented kids and adults. I was also within the underrepresented category of students, which was why I chose engineering (fear of poverty again). Why I say to an extent was that many of the students either didn't show up or apply themselves, but I really enjoyed inspiring them to do better. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't... :/ That part was what was tough to see, because I really cared about them.


Summary (Likes):

-Variety of tasks that are changing consistently

-Engaged with a decent amount of people in a days time

-Feeling you've made a positive impact on someone's developmental/mental/emotional well-being.

-Are typically not within the same 4'X4' parameter for more than 2-3 hours at most

-Computers having 50% or less to do with your job

-Involves moving around throughout the day, not necessarily on a continues basis.


As for my personality, I had to interview a few friends and family about this. I didn't ask them for much career advice, as I'm actually a first generation college student. Most of my family are mechanics. What I'm known for is being very personable and considerate, always trying to make others feel special is pretty big to me. I just like making really deep connections with people, and am apparently good at it. So guess you could say I'm definitely the servant/giver type. Just love helping people. So if I'm confined, I can feel very caged and my anxiety will build. People also say I'm extremely social, usually starting random conversations with people at bars, or check out lines. I'm also known to be obsessive, so sometimes I'll lose myself trying to get something done for hours, whether for me or someone else. I believe this first stemmed from music. I've played music for 12 years, and was known to practice for 12 hours in a day on summer breaks. I also continuously get ENFP as my personality type on tests, if that matters.


Summary (personality):


-Very Personable

-Very selfless/giving

-Like to make people feel important/special

-Obsessive at times

-Loves to engage with others a whole lot, so pretty social

-Loves building deep connections with people

-In general likes to feel I've helped someone in some way

-ENFP (if that makes a difference, not sure it really does)


Now, what I'm willing to do and sacrifice to make the career switch. I'm willing to go back to school for either a masters or another bachelors, but that's as far as I'd be willing to go. I feel I have developed the patience to wait another year or so for the career switch if I have to. But beyond 2 years, I know my emotional health is going to take a big hit, so obviously the sooner the better. My debts aren't terrible, but would obviously be prolonged if I went back to school. If I truly knew I would be happy, I'd do it though. I've made enough money to know it will never make me happy beyond a certain point. I'm also willing to take a pay cut down to something that made 38,000-55,000 per year. Below that, it simply wouldn't be financially feasible without going bankrupt. Obviously would be okay with something that paid more too, haha. The only sacrifice I'm hesitant to make is traveling. I'd do it if it was my absolute last option, but my state has really grown on me (Kansas), it's my home, and pretty close to my heart.


Summary (Sacrifices):


-More education (BS or MS)

-Time to make the switch (1-2 years)

-Pay cut ($38,000 to $55,000)

-Travel (but would really like to avoid that at all costs)


Sorry this post is so long, but I wanted to give you guys as much information as I could. Some people have told me to be a counselor, therapist, science/math/music teacher, music instructor, work for non-profit (though I wouldn't know how) or something in sales/marketing. If you guys agree with that too or have opinions/experience with one of them, by all means I'm all ears. I'm just looking for advice and am a bit lost at the moment.


Thanks everyone, you have no idea how much I appreciate it!"
8hhua7,8,2018-05-06,Subleasing Advice Needed (Thrown Out. Money Not Returned),mauryshow,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8hhua7/subleasing_advice_needed_thrown_out_money_not/,"So, I don't really know what to do about this, but thought you guys might. Have my buddy sleeping on my couch right now and she literally has nowhere else to go.

My friend, ""Nina,"" had her lease expire at her old place and was looking for a sublet until she's done with her internship in a few months. It was going to be from April to July. So, she found a place and moved in near the end of April, but paid for the whole month anyway. Originally the girl she was subletting from told her first and last month's rent was due upfront. She paid that. Then she moved her stuff in. Then a few days after she moved in, the girl came back and asked for a security deposit that she had never mentioned to my friend before. My friend didn't have that and couldn't get it on such short notice. The girl told her to either pay the security deposit within the next few days or get out. She gave her about 3 days notice. My friend said she would just rather leave the apartment and end the sublease agreement than have to deal with this sort of situation and surprise fees. 

So, she and the girl made a deal that she would just leave the place within 3 days, the girl would refund her the last month's rent and they would be done with the whole thing. My friend has now moved out, but now the girl is refusing to refund the last month's rent and saying she never agreed to refund it. My friend stayed in the apartment for about 2 weeks total, but the girl won't give any of the money back. All of the money transactions were handled in Venmo.

Is there anything my friend can do in this situation? I advised her to try and request a refund in Venmo or ask her bank to reverse the charges ASAP. She has basically lost the place and the money, so she has no cash and nowhere to go, except with me for the time being.

My thought process is that you can't evict someone in a couple of days and make them leave. You have to go to the formal eviction process. So, is my friend allowed to move her stuff back into the apartment for the time being until they formally evict her and she can find another place?

Is she just entirely screwed?

Sorry for forgetting location. We are in Massachusetts."
8hhxcu,0,2018-05-06,Don't have a contract. Can I be fired for protesting a possible ethics violation by a lecturer?,Throwaway_031,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8hhxcu/dont_have_a_contract_can_i_be_fired_for/,"TL;DR: Lecturer forced students to disclose personal information to everyone during the lecture. I protested. Now I'm being called in for a talk about my ""attitude"". Plz halp.

I currently teach workgroups for psychology students at a university in The Netherlands. My colleagues and I are trainers, and we sit in at the lectures for this course.

The course concerns professional skills for psychologists, and includes a lot of attention towards the personal development of the students. For this purpose, all information shared in the workgroups is confidential, and we generally work to create a safe environment for students to share things about themselves and try out new behavior. Several of my students are dealing with themes of trust, safety and openness. One of them may have a history of child abuse. The previous group I taught was similar. On average, I'd estimate 30-50% of students have real issues with safety and self-disclosure.

As part of the course, students name their ""talent""; something they're good at, something that comes naturally to them, a strength they're most proud of. They did a homework assignment about this last week. Last Thursday, the lecturer opened the lecture by asking students to share their talent with the class. Unsurprisingly, no one raised their hand to answer. Instead of accepting that no one was willing to share such personal information with a room full of strangers, she then walked up to a random student, handed her a microphone and asked her what her talent was. They had a brief interaction, after which the lecturer walked up to another student and did the same thing.
This seemed to me to be extremely unethical behavior from a psychologist. Students are put under huge authoritative and social pressure to share personal information about themselves while they did not volunteer to do so.

Later on in the lecture, she was making a point about cultural differences in perception of social situations and decided to make it interactive again, so she walked up to the one student in the lecture hall with a headscarf to have her share her experience with being from another culture. I already got in so much trouble for protesting the first thing, however, that I didn't even get around to addressing that this didn't necessarily feel okay.

Worried the lecturer might ask personal questions again and feeling like I should interfere before there was any real damage (insofar as there wasn't any already - I don't know the students that were put on the spot so I can't estimate how bad it was for them to be forced to share personal information), I walked up to her during the break. I said that I didn't really feel comfortable with the way personal questions were being asked, and that the workgroups seemed a far more suitable context for students to share their talent. I know the lecturer isn't very good at receiving feedback, so I did my best to bring it as non-threateningly as possible, but despite my efforts, she immediately went on the defensive.
She complained that she had to make the lectures interactive and that now we were still complaining, that it was necessary to name your talent to be able to put it to active use, that you also made your clients name their talent (she works at the university part-time, the other half of her week she's a therapist). I said sure, but this is a room full of strangers, it's not as safe an environment as the workgroups or a therapy setting. Despite my efforts towards clear and civil communication, the interaction kept escalating. She ended with: ""So *you* think *I* don't provide them with enough space not to share??"". I admitted that essentially, yes, that was my point. She then said she'd go see if other people agreed and walked off towards a random other trainer.

The day after, last Friday, we had an intervision meeting with the lecturer, the other course coordinator, and all the trainers. I tried to raise the issue again, but I was shut down and told it wasn't relevant for other trainers and should come up to them during the break. I did so, and I barely got a word out before I was told the way I'd approached the lecturer had been unacceptable and they wanted to meet with me personally. Apparently, they take issue with my behavior in the past as well - this isn't the first time I've voiced criticisms, but they've all taken similar forms (me trying to be civil and professional while the lecturer is defensive, hostile, and generally talks down to all of us). It sounded a lot like I might be getting fired. This personal meeting is set for next Tuesday. I'm thinking of asking another trainer to sit in so I have a witness, but I'm not sure if the coordinators will agree to that.

Now, as I said, I don't have a contract. I'm still a student, and I did a Master level course in order to be able to teach this Bachelor level course. Some of the people that did that course now do the teaching as an internship, but as I will be doing a different type of internship I do it as working experience (meaning I don't get paid). What they cannot fill with students from this Master level course, they supplement with hired trainers. These trainers have a contract, as well as the trainers that do it as an internship. I do not. Therefore, I have no clue what the terms of my employment are. I am wondering what they can do in terms of firing me. I'd hate to leave my students halfway through their process, though the workgroups could continue to be given by my co-trainer (who agrees with me throughout all of this, but is of a sweeter, quieter disposition and therefore not flagged as a threat, apparently). Moreover, I'd find it *extremely* alarming if the response to raising an ethical concern is to fire someone. So my second question is what I can do to follow up on this ethical concern if I can't solve it personally with the lecturer.

Hopefully you guys can help me get some answers. Thanks in advance!"

I have 2 years of experience but I'm a new grad and it seems to be affecting my offers. Companies are focusing on the new grad part of my resume and not the 2 years of full stack development and my personal projects. I live in central California and other positions from companies nearby are in the $60,000 range.

I have interviewed with another company (**company B**) 4 times and they are calling me Monday for yet another interview. I plan on telling them I have been offered another job and that I won't be taking anymore interviews without an offer. They said they really like me and I almost had an internship lined up last year with them, but they said I had too much developer experience. This may seem harsh, but this company has been completely wasting my time and shows no respect towards me, my time, or my quality of work. 

I was hoping to hear an offer from company B and ask for more money from company A if company B offers more money. Company A is local, so I wouldn't mind if it isn't an exact match, but the gap is quite big between what the two companies are offering entry level developers.

Does asking for more money sound smart? Are signing bonuses a thing? This isn't my first time negotiating pay, but I've never dealt with a company of this size. My last job was with a startup that offered me less money but had stock options which was nice.

The offer from company A was simply a casual over the phone offer and they told me we will talk about it more on Wednesday. My phone call with company B is tomorrow. Any advice would be great, I really appreciate your help.

I'm gonna be going to University for CS in September 2018 in the UK and I was wondering how to best utilize my summer before I go off to university. (I would ideally like to get an internship the next summer). 
My experience with programming has been limited to python mostly, although I have done online courses like CS50 and NAND to Tetris. Also, I've done some basic Machine Learning stuff in python and want to continue that. (What is the best way to about learning ML?)
 I'm interested in mobile development so was thinking of doing that but would my time be best spent doing Data Structures and Algorithms? Any advice and book/course recommendations would be much appreciated."

8hjr1k,16,2018-05-06,"Student clubs, socializing/networking",[deleted],mcgill,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/8hjr1k/student_clubs_socializingnetworking/,"The impression I get from many people on here is that it is hard to make friends at McGill. I've always had problems making friends myself. In fact, I have no friends. Sometimes, my lack of friends bothers me since this means that I don't have anyone who could help me find a job through a connection. Say that someone graduates from McGill without making friends or connections, would all the time spent striving towards a degree have been spent in vain? Is it even possible to get a summer internship from Mcgill without connections or a job out of university with a bachelor's degree? 

I have such a hard time making friends because I was bullied throughout my school life. I don't like approaching people and starting conversations because of this. Most of my hobbies are solitary such as reading, playing video games and I don't like going out that much. I've had so many people to tell me to get my priorities straight or to get a life because of my hobbies. In particular, I like rpgs, which has led so many people to call me an idiot. I've come to accept that since my hobbies are solitary and not that social, it will be harder for me to make friends. I have no interest in going clubbing or drinking to meet people. I understand that these two activities are the cornerstones of bonding with others, especially in university. I'm on the fence about student clubs as well. I've seen many posts that talk about how student clubs have cliques.

Anyways, I don't want my post to drag on too long. Fellow McGillians who struggled with making friends, do you regret not establishing friendships/connections? How damaging is it to finish university without any connections on the job market? Is it hard to make friends at McGill if you don't like partying/drinking?  "

8hjyx5,2,2018-05-06,increase competitiveness &amp; internship appeal for sophomore-level CS undergrad,etcadinfinituum,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8hjyx5/increase_competitiveness_internship_appeal_for/,"TL;DR: what should I do in the next 3-6 months to make myself as appealing as possible and increase my chances of internship offers for summer 2019?

Greetings fellow Earthlings (and...others):

About me/my studies: I attended higher ed as a music major after high school, and didn't complete the degree. After that, I spent a few years in the workforce working no-name office/admin jobs, and got a bit of exposure to CS projects in that context; I discovered that I really enjoyed the puzzle-conquering aspects of the work, and started over as a STEM student. I am pursuing a CS bachelor's, and am currently waiting on acceptance letters to transfer to a fairly reputable university in fall 2018; I expect to start at the school with junior-level standing and graduate in 2020. I am taking classes at a no-name CC as of right now.

Re current pursuits: I have been working on an Android project of my own devising (nothing ground-breaking; reverse-engineering classic games [with probable sub-par app architecture]), working on contributing to open-source project(s) (made my first official OSS PR last week, and will continue to contribute as much as I can), playing around with Arduino hardware/software, etc. Thus far, most of my substantial CS work has been done in Java; I have some experience in Python, and a fairly strong foundation in the basic math courses (calculus is fun, fine, fab, and I haven't done much work [read: almost none] in statistics, datasets, etc).

I have a sneaking suspicion that my resume lacks the beefy, impressive, high-demand projects and skill sets that most employers look for when screening internship applicants (ie superb C++ skills, intimate knowledge of web stacks, buzzword technologies [docker, ML/AI, ???]). The more I read about CS careers and the challenges that new grads &amp; current students face, the more anxious I get about my credentials. I have 4 months until I start the intensive CS program that I applied for, and my internship prospects for this summer are not looking good (ie I'm not expecting to get an offer to work as a developer/SWE intern this summer). My understanding is that most internships start recruitment in September/October for the following summer, and the ticking clock is ringing in my ears.

My question is, what should I be doing to make myself more marketable? For those who have already dealt with these torments, what did you do that helped you succeed, and/or what do you wish you had done to help you stand out from the crowd? For those who field applications for internships at software firms (big-N and otherwise), what makes an applicant desirable, jaw-droppingly awesome, superhuman, etc?

A secondary question: I don't have a clear specialty in mind, and I feel that I don't have a lot of exposure to the various subtopics in the CS/SWE sphere, so I'm at a loss when people ask me ""What do you want to do with your degree?"" Figuring out my ideal answer to this question may take precedence over ""how to be an undergrad superstar"", but at this point in my career (academic and otherwise), can I kill two birds with one stone? What courses of action would you recommend to discover your specialty? For me, is this even a question worth tackling at this point in time? What do you think?

Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for your advice. Cheers!

8hk36q,3,2018-05-06,Finding internships/entry level positions in software development,VHS_Voyager,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8hk36q/finding_internshipsentry_level_positions_in/,"Hey guys, I have been on the search for internships in software development/engineering in the Long Island, NY area with very little success. I was hoping to find something for the summer and have been applying to places since February. Very few places get back to me and most of those that do are just informing me that the position has gone to someone else. 

So a brief background about myself: I have quite an unconventional background for someone looking to get into software. I got my bachelor's degree in Biology with the intention of going into medicine. After getting my degree, I got my EMT license and worked in the hospital for a bit. After seeing the work in the field, I decided medicine wasn't right for me. I am now 3 semesters into a graduate program going for a master's degree in computer science and have been maintaining a 4.0 GPA. I will be graduating this upcoming December and am starting to get concerned that I have been unable to find any internships as of yet.

Most, if not all summer internships have already filled their positions by now. I've been applying to places that I have found through job boards like indeed or glassdoor. My [resume](https://i.imgur.com/sXhSNne.png) includes a link to my [GitHub page](https://github.com/PFalkenberg), which might need some touching up. I'm really not sure what kind of projects I should make to showcase my skills. Here's a small [video demo of one of my programs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBfYBGsZadI). I'm primarily comfortable with Java, but am competent enough with Python, HTML/CSS/Javascript to make things with them too. The problem is mostly that I simply do not know *what* to make. What would be impressive and showcase that I am competent with my code? If github isn't an issue, what more can I do to really stand out? I'm really concerned that I am not going to find anything by the time I graduate and am going to be left with a hefty student debt and no job to pay it off. Sorry for the lengthy post and thank you if you took the time to read through it!

Recently I've been thinking of emailing the startup I worked at last summer for an internship again, but I'm not sure how to phrase it since it's so close to the summer already. I'd absolutely love to intern there again, since I had a great time last summer.

I was thinking of saying something like ""Hi xyz, Sorry for contacting you so late! Hope things are going well xyz! My current plans for the summer have recently fell through, so I was wondering if you would like to have me back this summer. I had an absolute blast working with you and the rest of the team last summer and would love to opportunity to work with you again!"" However, I'm worried that it'll sound like I'm considering them as my backup plan, which isn't really the case, since I would have much preferred to work for them this summer than the for internship that fell through (but the internship that fell through took precedence for reasons).

At the same time, I don't want to just say ""Hi xyz, The summer is approaching and I was wondering if you'd like to have me back..."" since then it sounds like I am unprepared and was just banking on them saying yes since I would otherwise have contacted them earlier.

Another slightly awkward note is that I interned for them last summer as a mechanical engineering major, but am now a computer science major. I don't think that'll be a huge problem though."

 I do have the Hiring Manager's personal email address on file from the job add, so is it better to email her now sometime this week and tell him/her that I am interested in the full time job if still available in September (which is not likely), or is it better to email him/her 2 weeks before my internship ends and just basically hope that she still hasn't met anyone or the person she hired quit after xx months.

I'm an international student from CCC who have been admitted to UC Davis CS letters and science. I have the following questions and I would appreciate if current CS students, especially international students could give their insight.

1. How hard is it to get internship/research opportunities as an International students?
2. I read that for upp. div., it's hard to register for classes. Should I be concerned?
3. I know L&amp;S CS is not ABET accredited and ABET accredition doesn't really matter, but does it matter when applying jobs overseas? It seems hard to get H1\-B so I'm thinking of getting a job elsewhere if I fail to find one in the US.
4. It seems like there is a decent amount of international students studying CS in Davis, but are there a decent amount of Amercians \(any race\) as well? Don't want to be called as racist but I would like to have a balanced demographics. 

I'm torn between UCSB and UCD as of now. It seems like both are academically equivalent, but UCSB has a smaller class size, and therefore easier class registration and closer rapport with the professors whereas UCD edges over on proximity to SV and therefore greater internship opportunities.

My preconceived notions/arguments might be wrong, but these are what I have gathered from extensively searching reddit, linkedin, google, etc.

Is it worth it to stay an extra year of university to study Applied Psychology? Finances aren't really a problem for me because financial aid. I did transfer majors, and an extra year would help me spread out my CS classes so I'm not cramming my schedule to graduate on time. I also don't have an internship, so it would also give me the opportunity to maybe get an internship in between my 4th and 5th year.

Are there any drawbacks to this? Would this look bad to companies that I stayed a fifth year to study psychology (esp if I don't end up working in a psych related field after)?  Also, if you have any ideas about career paths that combine CS + Psych, that would be much appreciated too! Thank you in advanced!!

EDIT: The Applied Psychology Minor is more of the social/applicable part of psychology rather than the science side of it. Which is why I'm wondering whether it would be even worth it. I know I would love it either way, I just don't know how helpful, if at all, to pursue it. "

What I want is a single master document where any changes I make (e.g. adding a new column, changing which interns are responsible for which lines) show up on the child copies, I want any information added in the child documents (e.g. updating the contact dates, putting in the answers to questions) to show up in the master copy.  

In the past I've built documents that do this sort of thing with direct links and match/indexing, but I've never been particularly happy with them.  match/index gets slow for big files and direct links have always felt very fragile.  I'm looking for a simple, robust way to make two way table links in excel 2010 without using power pivot.  If there isn't one, I can break down and use PP, but it's massive overkill for this.

I took 3 years to graduate and didn't do so great with my GPA as well (2.93/4.00). I also failed two courses along the way and had to retake them. Due to my low GPA throughout my program, I couldn't land any internships either and had to take two extra courses as a substitute to graduate. 

Now, I have been applying for the job openings listed at online job boards for the past two months and its been really frustrating as I expected it to be. 

I tried applying for positions for new graduates and they all demand copy of transcripts and given my record, I just end up not applying at all because for most positions they won't even consider anyone with less than 80% GPA with so many screenings in place.

For other positions, they require atleast 3-5 years of professional experience in certain libraries/frameworks that I also lack as well. All in all, I am getting rejections out of the gate left and right. They don't even want to bother for a phone interview. I acknowledge the fact that I definitely need professional experience and be expert in a number of tools/libraries but I don't know what else to do.

I am thinking of enrolling in online specialization degrees offered by Coursera and Udacity such as for full stack web developer and mobile development.

I do think I am decent at programming and I definitely enjoy doing it. I have done and completed projects on my own and as part of my courses that I have uploaded some on my Github page and included them in my resume to compensate for lack of professional experience. I have also scored A grades in few of the courses in my degree program even though I failed some courses.

All in all, I would appreciate if I can get a critique of my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rm1jix2vekrv1hb/Resume%20-%20Ozair%20Shafiq.pdf?dl=0) and any advice for a person in my position because this has been really frustrating and I feel like giving up.

A little info on me and my situation.  I am 28 and currently a cost accountant.  My last two jobs were A/R coordinator and Accounting Manager (basically just oversaw A/R and did payroll and misc. accounting things).  I have a degree but it is in journalism (which I did not pursue as after I did an internship I realized it was not for me).  I never took any IT classes in college but have always loved computers and IT.  I decided that I am not happy with my current career path and I want to start fresh and finally head into IT.  I just started the other day working on studying for my A+ cert and I want to update my resume so I can begin applying to IT jobs.  I have no work experience in the IT field but love computers, phones, IoT, etc..  I did build my own desktop last year and have some light experience tinkering around with various OS's and other IoT items and helping family members with simple, small computer issues.  My question is how should I create or adjust my resume seeing how I don't have any experience to highlight.

I know that I will need to start off somewhere like a help desk or something along those lines and I am ok with that.  I know I need to start from the bottom and learn and pay my dues but i'm hoping someone will have some suggestions or advice how I should setup my resume so I can at least get interviews for these positions.

Thank you to anyone who can help!"

I was never a 'stellar' student, but I think I have somewhat okay grades (3.1 GPA).

So far I know I can create servlets to handle requests from our front-end, but some of my coworkers talked about different stuff, like:

- Maven: from what I understand, a tool to build the server and handle dependencies without hassle.

- Spring Boot: To generate stuff easily, but I don't understand the utility beside it. Is it a replacement to servlet, or does it work with them? 

- Java EE: I don't really know where this goes in the list...

Is there just somewhere where I can just unwrap the basic concepts in order to simply understand a bit better before choosing the right technologies?"

I'm writing because I'm honestly burnt out trying to figure out what to do next. I'm sorry if this becomes a rant \(it will\) but I just need to vent out my whole situation, this is also going to be therapeutic for me... my questions will be in **bold.**

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from some obscure university in the Middle East in December. I'm not sure how much I've gained from this degree, it doesn't feel like much given what's happened so far but I know I enjoy developing and I've definitely learnt useful skills which will always be beneficial to me. This degree wasn't all that mathematical and didn't really dive into core computer science principles at depth but instead focused on touching on all these principles and proceeding to take the next semester's fees.

I've even done some side projects to learn what it's like developing practically and that's been more than positive, I've even published a visually appealing but not too technical app on the Play Store. I've interned at a collaborative maker space where I used to give workshops on hardware like Arduino and RPi, it wasn't entirely technical since these workshops were pretty basic but still, it helped with working on computer hardware, my public speaking skills, and meeting some interesting people. 

\*I should mention that my overall grades aren't too great in the CS subjects on my transcripts, I've struggled personally for no good reason throughout my undergrad and it's reflected on my grades in the more technical subjects and it does affect my confidence in this field at times because I can start measuring myself by those grades

I moved to Canada soon after I finished university since I'm a resident; I want to continue studying and start a career in software engineering over here but it's been rough so far. I applied for a Master's in Computer Science at several universities in Ontario \(Carleton, Ryerson, Waterloo, Western and some more...\). I've been rejected by all the ones in parentheses. I applied for a coursework Master's \(where they're available\) because I have no idea what research to work on, I felt as if I was lacking the skills for a thesis and thought doing a coursework degree would help me settle in the country and hopefully help me find what I wanted to work on in the future. I also applied for part\-time status as I felt I could try and work at the same time, my thinking is that all this status and degree type stuff can change later on if it's necessary, I should just focus on sending an application and get into a school. I visited Waterloo to see the campus and talk to the graduate office for Computer Science as well, which imo was a positive experience. \(**Did I go about this right? I researched all the programs for a long time but it felt overwhelming because besides knowing I want to work on AI, I didn't know much more\)**

Carleton was the first to reject me, and then Ryerson, after this happened I really felt as if getting an acceptance from the rest, namely Waterloo &amp; McMaster, was far\-fetched because they're all better than these two. Sure enough, that's what happened. I contacted someone at every university after I received my rejection emails to ask for the exact reason my application was declined, and also to provide me with a way forward. Ryerson was the only university that really provided me with sufficient feedback, saying my GPA was too low, and advised I could try enrolling into a Bachelor's in Canada and shave the relevant credits off with my previous degree. That felt ridiculous, that I'd have to dig up my high school transcripts \(not great reading, btw\) and apply ALL OVER again for an undergraduate degree, when people are getting their offer letters. Additionally, I didn't do math in high school so I knew that'd be a roadblock, I'll come back to this.

Ryerson at least talked to me, I even visited the campus and Chang School of Continuing Education to talk to their advisors about what to do next. Waterloo sent a *manually typed automated message* about how competitive the process is and how many factors are taken into account for the application, I don't even know how to respond to this email \(open to suggestions\). Carleton, meh, not a great experience. Western didn't even respond back. 

I expected this whole process to be tough especially with my university transcript, and I was and am ready to do any extra work to gain admission but the fact that the universities have been so unhelpful in talking to me is very disheartening. I feel like I'm doing something wrong in the way I'm approaching this, maybe I should just move my ass and go to the campus and talk to them physically. \(**Can I open a dialogue up with the universities through e\-mail and set up a meeting with them in person and trying to ask them when I'm there, it just feels very pointless given all that's happened thus far.\)**

I tend to get anxious which I can work through, but once I'm there I just hear the same stuff that I've seen online which ends with saying that the whole application process is online and that I can't get personal advice pertaining to my situation besides any extra questions I might have about the programs. Additionally, the admin faculty isn't that open to giving personal advice until you're actually a student, something mentioned explicitly on some universities' sites. 

So, I'm coming off some serious depression because of all this and some other personal stuff but I've started feeling better and I'm finally thinking clearly again, ready to start the grind once more. Working off of Ryerson's advice, I'm open to redoing a Bachelor's in CS. I know this might seem like a step back, but I also know that settling in Canada is really tough after talking to friends and family, perhaps in the long run this won't seem as major as it does now. 

I'm even willing to go back to do the required high school courses as well because I could finish them off this summer, plus applying through a school is MUCH easier since I'll get a Canadian HS diploma with my old school grades \(British\) converted in the process, and I could talk to an academic counselor which I feel I desperately need. Also, I'm thinking if I'm going to do an undergrad degree again, I might as well fancy it up by double majoring with Neuroscience because this is something that I'm deeply interested in, even my computer science interests lie in AI so I know that a combination of these two fields could prove valuable in the future. **What does anyone who's made it this far \(thank you, btw\) think about this idea?** My school background is mainly in the sciences in any case.

That's the education part of it, I've also been trying to get a job or an internship in Canada but that hasn't proved very fruitful. I've signed up on job sites, LinkedIn, and a local service called Career Edge that helps new grads and newcomers to Canada get paid internships to gain experience in the country and land a job in the future with that experience and networking. Career Edge has really been the only helpful service, they helped me build my profile while I was overseas and the one internship I applied for was with them; the interview went really well but in terms of skills they wanted someone who knew C# and I've been raised on C\+\+ and Java so I didn't know the proper syntax and intricacies of it, plus the logic question threw me off \(swap an int without a temp variable\). They got back saying that they needed someone who knew C# because there was no time to train someone from scratch. Besides this, I don't know how else to go at it with a foreign degree and that's why I'm focused more on the education, I'll get a Canadian degree, I'll gain some much\-needed knowledge, and going to a university will naturally open up opportunities in the job market. 

**Should I try finding a job instead of the whole academic pursuit I'm planning on doing? I feel as if doing a job will be good in the short term but to progress further I'll have to study more later on so I might as well set myself up now. Plus, having done a Bachelor's already I'll be much cooler about it now by being open to all the opportunities like taking time off to work if needed.**

Thanks to anyone whose read this and I'll appreciate all the responses! :D

I'd add a tl;dr but I'm gonna be lazy because I've spent a while typing all this out plus it all ties in.

When I interviewed for this job, the interviewer made it sound like they had everything together. The interviewer isn't actually on my team, and I actually have no idea where they are, but the place isn't what out to be.

The first thing I noticed was that I had a Windows 10 1803 Home desktop. I was given about an hour's explanation as to what working at the company would entail and a brief explanation of what we had, and then given a starter project to find out why an FTP server's disk was full. I looked up the server and found that it was a Solaris 9 box, and an old one at that.

I tried to ssh using the same username/password as my windows machine, but it didn't work. I asked one of the full time staff if they had a working login, but they told me to ""just log in normally"". I tried to explain that it didn't work, but he wasn't having any of it.

I went back to looking at the server, and discovered that it had FTP open to the internet. On Wednesday I found that it had anonymous FTP enabled. I looked around at what was readable, and found a directory with a lot of image files in it. I has a bit of weeb phase in high school, and I was able to tell they were all lolicon just by looking at the filenames.

I started typing up a report on Thursday, when I was tasked with investigating why an MSSQL server was using so much bandwidth. I found that it was running Windows ME, so I though it might just be something stupid that ME was doing. I was able to get one of the full timers to set things up so I could capture traffic going to/from that server, and I did that early Friday.

While I was capturing, the network suddenly cut out, and one of the full timers walked over and started in to lecture about how I needed to be more careful with company equipment. When I asked what he was talking about, he brought me over to his desk and showed me that the AV we have had detected that the pcap was ""infected"" with the slammer worm. While that answered what was up with the server, I had to wait the entire day while my desktop was rebuilt.

What prompted me to post this, though, was what happened today. While I was re-typing my report about the lolicon on the FTP server and the slammer infection on the SQL server, I received an email with the subject of ""80mb Free Web Space!"".It looked suspicious, so I didn't open the email to avoid another lecture. Instead, I looked up the sender and found that he was a remote worker in sales. Checking his laptop revealed that it was running Windows 98. I asked the full timer who handled our antivirus if he could scan that laptop, and he responded that it was too old for the antivirus to handle.

I have no idea how I'm supposed to survive this. I got an A in every class, but none of them covered anything even remotely close to this. I know modern Linux inside and out and have some idea about how Windows worked before the whole ""Windows as a Service"" thing started, but I don't know how to handle stuff that's nearly as old as I am. I'm completely at a loss for where to even start other than ""beg for help from the full timers"". I need to do well here to pass the internship, but I'm worried I won't be able to do that."

I'm not hearing back from places that I am applying to, and the times I am hearing back I'm being rejected (I must add quite politely which I appreciate a lot!).

I've been asking around in a few areas that aren't really CS career related and ultimately I'm pretty much being told that I need to move if I am to continue this career. Or that I should look at non-software related jobs, and that kills me inside.

I feel really helpless because of this now. For a few reasons, but one stands out above the rest. My mother a few months ago was diagnosed with cancer that has apparently come back, she had it completely removed before, she is going to see the specialist soon to see what's up and the next steps to battle it. 

I don't quite know how to move forward.

8hse39,161,2018-05-07,Wisdom from a graduating cs major for 1st &amp; 2nd years,stdcoutifailedinlife,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/8hse39/wisdom_from_a_graduating_cs_major_for_1st_2nd/,"Everyone told me that I was guaranteed a $100k+ job if I graduated with CS. That recruiters would be fighting for my resume. It's week 6, I'm about to graduate unemployed. Looks like I failed in life

Here's some advice so you dont ruin your life too:

* *Get a fucking internship.*

Everyone that I know that has a job lined up got an internship at some point. Everyone that I know that's graduating jobless did not get an internship. What's worse, many companies restrict internships to people enrolled in college. (So if you're like me, you're SOL if you graduate without one). This might be controversial, but don't waste your time with research (unless you want to go to grad school, but even then internship &gt; research)


* Apply to internships in the fall 

I didn't know that most internships recruited around the new year. I wish I did. 

* Do Leetcode problems 

Make a github and upload your solutions. Don't just upload any O(n^3) trash though. Internship + leetcode = Job. If you can solve medium/hard leetcode problems in &lt; 20 minutes, then you're practically already a Google employee.  This might be controversial, but leetcode is honestly more important than personal projects (more on that in the next point). 

* Learn JavaScript/HTML/CSS 

It looks like practically every software developer position expects you to know them. I'm not even joking, it looks like practically 2/5th+ of software jobs are webdev now. I wish they still taught ics 21/22 in java. hint hint: this is a good way to tack on a personal project. The ics school lets everyone have their own website, so pimp it out. Also, take cs122a seriously. SQL is incredibly important.

* There are no entry level C++ jobs 

If all you know is C++, then you're SOL. I'm not saying that there are no C++ jobs out there, it's just that there's not many for new grads. Most are in C# or java or *anything* but C++. If all you know is Python, then lol. 

_____

Don't be like me. I'm praying I can get even an unpaid internship."
8hsi7z,4,2018-05-07,Possible career switch,seaweedhorse,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8hsi7z/possible_career_switch/,"Hi there! I'm a 25 year old who has been in healthcare for a few years after graduating with a biology degree, and am now thinking of switching careers to computer science/programming. I actually was intending to major in CS in my first year of college, and switched majors. Long and complicated story short, the factors that made me switch are no longer applicable, and I think I want to go back into CS after all. My question is, I think, a typical one, and I've seen a lot of conflicting advice already on the answer. I'm wondering whether it would be more worth it to go into a bootcamp (a data science-oriented one, not a web development one), or to go back and do another bachelors in CS. I've heard that a bachelors will give a person good fundamental CS knowledge but may lack in training on specific skills that may be very relevant to what employers want. I've heard that bootcamps have the opposite strength and weakness, being great at teaching a bunch of skills/languages but not always the underpinnings of why these skills work the way they do. 

I also know that direct experience is the best way to get into this field. I would love to simply ""do my own projects"", but I am not sure where to start on this. And I don't think I would be able to get an internship right now, not having many recent projects to show. So getting some sort of structured introduction, either a bootcamp or another bachelors, seems necessary to me. Which would be a more sure bet to eventually lead to an internship or junior dev role? I definitely feel like if I go for the bachelors route, I'll definitely want to supplement it with independent projects outside of the classroom, but if I go the bootcamp route, it may make it harder to compete for internships with people who are doing bachelors (I'm in Seattle).

I haven't had any real work experience either besides work-study at school and a few odd jobs here and there. Anyways I am only a year away from finishing college but I don't feel as though I'm ready to be an engineer.

Also if there is a better subreddit to post this question please let me know. 

Edit: I want to emphasize that the question I am asking is what skills or projects I could be learning or doing over the summer to make myself more qualified as an engineer (such as what programming languages should I be trying to learn). Also I bought myself a bunch of lab equipment like a power supply and an oscilloscope but I‚Äôm not sure what to do with it.

8hthz9,4,2018-05-07,Schools I could realistically apply to to study North Korea?,sem263,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/8hthz9/schools_i_could_realistically_apply_to_to_study/,"I am a graduating senior from the SFS at Georgetown, with a B.S. in Regional and Comparative Studies (Conc. In International Security, Gender, and Human Rights in Northeast Asia) and I want to do a master's degree or a PhD in Asian Studies, International Politics, Political Science, or something related, with a concentration on North Korea specifically. 

GPA: I will probably graduate with between a 3.58 and a 3.6. Mostly As and A-s except for econ classes where I got 2 B-s a C and a B. Also a B- in freshman theology, B+ in a ridiculous Chinese literature class where we had to memorize paragraphs from books and regurgitate them on tests, and probably a B+ in a 6 credit Russian class I stupidly took this semester thinking it would not be so hard. Significant upward trend - I got a 3.5 and a 3.3 in my freshman semesters but will be finishing with a 3.777 this semester. 

Research: I have done North Korea related research for:
- My honors thesis on the portrayal of women in North Korean film vs. Their role in the economy
- the North Korea Strategy Center (1 year)
- Now Action and Unity for Human Rights (3 months)
- the Security Studies Program at Georgetown (1 year)
- The US Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins (4 months)
- Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (hired as a researcher/translator for their episode on North Korea)
- Beforedent (Korean dental startup, 4 months)
- Mansudae North Korean art gallery in Beijing (4 months)
- Assistant to Wilson Center Korea Chair Jean Lee in Seoul (4 months)
- My own YouTube channel (5 years)

I also had several part time jobs (4 this semester while taking 18 credits - my family is 100% unable/unwilling to help me and my mom was actually homeless for most of last year so not working was never really an option) 
- Student Guard 
- Korean language TA (first ever non heritage speaker to fill this position)
- Video producer and editor for school media pages
- English tutor off campus 
- Archival assistant at GU Law 

I am a recipient of the following awards:
- Oh Award (for Korean studies)
- Jiangsu Cup Silver Award (free trip to China for placing 2nd in a Chinese language competition)
- Boren Award (govt scholarship for students studying abroad in critical language countries - in my case Korea. Also has a 1 year service requirement) 
- CLS Chinese Finalist (can't take it though because of summer classes + Fulbright) 
- Fulbright finalist for China research (Yanbian border area near NK where I will be researching ethnic Koreans identity expression through language)
- Improving the Human Condition Grant (for a research project at NKSC) 
- Huayu Enrichment Scholarship (to study Chinese in Taiwan for 2 months)

Experience abroad
- Korea 2013 (10 months study abroad in high school)
- Korea 2015 (1.5 months internship)
- Taiwan 2015 (2 months Chinese study on scholarship)
- Korea 2016 (8 months on Boren)
- China 2017 (4 months language program/internship)

Other Skills:
- Stata
- Korean (ACTFL Advanced High)
- Chinese (ACTFL Advanced Mid)
- Russian (ACTFL ~Intermediate Low Or Mid according to my Russian tutor)
- Video editing

I am most worried about my GPA. At GU top 25% have around a 3.748. I tend to do poorly in classes that have exams because I get horrible test anxiety (like... passing out and then forgetting how to read level test anxiety... hence the C in freshman econ). 

I want to apply to places where I am likely to get funding. I am thinking about just doing a master's in Korea (just doing the regular Korean program, not a program for internationals) and applying to PhD here afterwards because it will be easier to get a scholarship there than here... I will get zero help from my family and this field will not make me bank so taking out a ton of loans is also not something I want to do. 

What sorts of schools would I realistically have a shot at with/without funding? What places can I start looking for funding before and while I am on my Fulbright? My dream schools are Columbia, Stanford, Berkeley and USC but I don't know if my grades are going to get me disqualified esp if I apply for PhD. 

So what are schools I could realistically apply for? Should I do master's in Korea or here? Should I apply for PhD in the States? "

She deleted the job offer post and reposted it. Then it became visible next to the 2 forms in the candidate portal. I clicked on it, it opened a new window with a decline/accept form and I submitted it to accept. My hiring is being filed now and will hopefully be expedited so I can start on time, worst cast I have to miss 1 week.

I applied to IBM and made a brassring account. I got an internship offer via email, listing essentially only ""Software Developer Intern"", my location, and my wage level. I got this in early March.

I was told to accept the job offer via brassring, but there was never any ""accept offer"" button anywhere in the candidate portal. I filled out the ""Consent and Disclosure"" and then ""Background Verification"" forms in the candidate portal, thinking I would be prompted to ""accept"" once they were completed. I emailed my recruiter repeatedly asking to set up a phone call to discuss the offer and how to accept but never got a response. In multiple emails I stated I wanted to accept the offer.

Then, mid-march, I get an email from the recruiter asking what my preferred start date is. I reply May 21st. Then April 9th I get another email from the same recruiter asking what my preferred start date is, again replying May 21st.

Then radio silence. Until afternoon of May 7th, when I'm so worried about getting no info about my department or manager or anything, I call my specific office, get forwarded to HR, then get forwarded to an employee services helpline. I eventually got hold of someone (they were surprised that I had no idea what my employee ID was or what bluepages is etc) who messaged my recruiter via some internal communications about how I don't have any info yet.

Then, about 2 hours ago (1am EST) I get an email from my recruiter saying I haven't accepted my job offer because I never clicked ""accept"" on brassring and that my new target start date is June 4th. (there is no accept button! I've spent hours looking, it still prompts me to fill out the disclosure/consent and background verification forms, but if I click on either it just says in plaintext that I've already filled out these forms) I'm a college student: 2 weeks income is a big deal and I'm not OK with starting later.

Is anybody else in a similar boat? Anybody else not heard anything from recruiters or still don't know their starting info? Looking to see if anyone else is having the same problems.

I need your help. As an intern I've been asked to create a program using Python but I'm a total beginner. I have 6 weeks to come up with something that works and that's pretty, so I need your hindsight to make it happen.

Basically what I need to do is to recreate an already existing business simulation program. You enter some values concerning a fictional business and it outputs market predictions, turnover etc. The idea is: you enter the first decision values for your simulated business (like the company just started; input values 1). You then get first predictions (output values 1), and then based on if it's good or bad, you make new decisions (input values 2) for the next period (1 period = 1 year). Etc. So from period 2 on, the output values are based on the last output values and your new input values. It's written in visual basic and runs through the windows command line (using gw-basic). It's really archaic.

I want to do something pretty, with a graphical user interface, and something that can keep track of all the previous values (they need to be stored somewhere). I need for each indicator, to have graphs to see their evolution over time (period after period).

My question is: what framework would be the best suited for this? Do I use pyQT? Or do I make a web application that runs locally with Flask for example? What do I need to be able to store the previous values? A SQL database?

I have only some basic knowledge of Python programming, I really need your hindsight. Any help is welcome.

Thank you!"

Anyways my question: Is it worth to go to a top school even if its not for CS, rather than a mediocre school for CS.

What happened there would always haunt me until the day I die, but I have to let everyone know before you make the same choice that I did.

""I'm sorry Jonathan, but we have to let you go."" said Frank, my supervisor.

Let me go? What the fuck was he talking about? 

""Wh-What do you mean let me go? You're firing me?"" I asked.

""Yes, regretfully so."" he replied. 

At that moment, I couldn't stop myself from an emotional outburst. As if this day can't get worse than it already has, what with me having to deliver my car to the shop for repairs after breaking down this morning, I also get fired.

""Why?"" I asked, having been taken aback by the sudden news.

""The order came from above. I am sorry but the higher ups have said it."" he replies to my question, having the same expression I was wearing.

The rest of that was a blur to me. I could vaguely remember standing up and leaving his office while Frank was still talking and heading over to my own office. Everything has already been arranged in boxes, and that sent another wave of anger through me.

""Fucking corporate bastards."" I mutter. I rummaged through each boxes to make sure everything's in each box and came across an envelope with no address. I tore it open and found a ticket to a first-class trip around the world and it's date says the ship will depart tomorrow. i figured this must be for one of the fuckheads above, an unwitting intern must have misplaced it. 

Without hesitating, I put it back in the box and carry each one to a cab I called outside. I didn't give a shit if somebody would lose a job, if taking someone responsible for firing me an opportunity for a vacation means screwing them back, I would gladly do so.

So fast forward to the day of the cruise, I left the apartment with my bags packed with clothes and my wallet filled with nearly $5000, I hailed a cab to the ship.

It was massive. The name 'SS Ripley' was etched on its side. I don't know much about ships or boats in particular but it was the most beautiful thing I ever saw.

I stood behind the line of passengers towards the entrance of the ship and saw an old man guided by six bulky men. 

Curious, I asked the man in front of me.

""Any idea who that is?"" 

""No clue, probably the ship's owner or somethin'"" he replied.

Three hours later, the ship set sailed towards the Pacific. I participated in a tour led by a guy named Pietro, getting to see different areas of the ship such as the dining area, which also served as the ballroom. The whole area was beautiful, from its domed ceiling and large chandelier, to its spacious bar and grand stage. 

The tour took about an hour or so and everyone was left to do whatever they want by the friendly steward. I headed straight to the bar and after nearly a dozen beers later, I was escorted to my room. 

Hours later, I was awakened by a knock on the door by a steward saying that there's a grand ceremony to be attended by everyone. Attendance was a must.

Reluctantly, I dressed on the best suit that I had and went to the ballroom. Grand indeed, it was. A 10 feet long table was set on the middle of the room, different foods set on top of it, and everyone seemed like they've already beelined for all of it. 

An hour later, I was full. I leaned back on my chair and closed my eyes, thinking that this IS the life, until a commotion rose in the crowd. I tried to search for the cause and saw the Captain, face first into the table and a hole in the back of his head. I look at the stage and see a bunch of men in suits, armed to the teeth with assault rifles, and an elderly man from earlier dressed in a lab coat, holding a still smoking silenced pistol.

""Good evening everyone, my name is Doctor Gru√´nsb√´rg,"" said the elderly man in a German accent, ""and welcome to a science experiment carried on by your own government. Now before yo--"" the elderly man, or Gru√´nsb√´rg, was interrupted by a shriek from an elderly woman, which he shoots without a remorse.

A sudden hush grew throughout the crowd but everyone stayed still on their seats. 

""Anyway,"" the Doctor continued, ""I would gladly love to know if someone else wants to interrupt, or let me carry on what I was saying earlier. Anyone? No? Okay. Before you all panic, I want to tell you why you are all here and what it is your government is trying to accomplish."" he says calmly with a smile, ""I have been tasked to study the results of a drug that was slipped in your foods from earlier and I would love it if it goes without a hitch."" 

""Of course, naturally, you would all panic with this news. Allow me to explain that we are testing a drug that would all--"" he gets interrupted by one of the men in black next to him. 

""Oh, it's confidential? So sorry."" he says out loud after the man whispered something in his ear. 

""You heard it folks, now I would ask you to return to your rooms to let us clean this.... mess up.""

Suffice to say, this didn't stop everyone from suddenly panicking and rushing out the room. The ""doctor"" orders something that was drowned out by the screams. The men in black opens fire to the crowd and I immediately duck for cover. The screams were drawn out by gunfire and I made a run for it to the exits. Unfortunately, I tripped on a body and was knocked out by the stampeding crowd.

I woke up to the face of Gru√´nsb√´rg staring at me and saying, ""Apologies for the rudeness of your fellow passengers."" He looks around and motions one of his lackeys over, ""Would you please escort this young man to his room.""

The man nods and grabs me roughly by the arm.

""Come with me sir."" the man says.

I am about to graduate from college, and have been offered my dream job at the company I've been interning for all semester. I was so so excited to hear this, since it's a creative field that's kind of hard to break in to, but today I was on a call to discuss logistics, and my supervisor mentioned that they would like me to start out working with them on a project-to-project basis for the first few months to make sure that it's a good fit before they take me on as a full-time salaried employee. The pay for these projects would be very good, but she said that sometimes there could be weeks of very busy activity, and then weeks with little or no projects. The company is really small (think less than 5 employees) so she wants to make sure that the team will continue to run smoothly with me as a member before they take me on full-time.

This really worried me at first, because the company is in an area with a high cost of living and the idea of not having a guaranteed income freaks me out, but then she mentioned that I could work remotely (as a paid employee, not an intern) for the first few months. This would be great, because I have a cheap place to live and a way to make money where I am now. However, I am nervous about this ""project-to-project"" business. Has anyone heard of this? Is it a way for companies to string dumb graduates along, or does it lead to actual full-time jobs? Any help would be appreciated. I really want to make this work, because it's literally my dream job! I want to be smart, and I'm afraid I might be blinded by my excitement. Any advice?

When we first meet we were both in relationships but she was very pretty we flirted a lot etc. but nothing happened more than that. When the internship ended we exchanged numbers and SC handles, i would reach out once in a while to see how she was, how was the company since i really wanted to get on there. About 2-3 months after my internship ended she starts really flirting heavy with me and the SC turned into not just friendly ones. I find out she is now single but I'm not single and after a few weeks of flirting i felt bad for my gf and what i was doing and her as well. I told her i cant do this I'm in a relationship etc. that she was great and if things where different then this whole situation might be different. She told me she respected my honesty and was embarrassed but it was okay. Now what i think the strange part is we have kept in touch still to this day, though txt and SC nothing like it was then but still playful flirting. We don't have each other on FB but i have seen her account before so i know her relationship status, she knows that I'm married with a kid now. But i also know that she is engaged, she never mentions its, never says anything about having a guy in her life, still messages me when she is having a bad day or saying things like ""want to run away together"" or ""have you won the lottery yet to take care of me"". I feel like im one of her good friends i know i am actually but i just find it weird that she has never told me she is engaged, never added me on FB which is where all of her pics are with him, but added me on IG and post zero pictures of him and her together. Does it seem like she is hiding it? and if so why? Does she think it will hurt our friendship or is she thinking me and her still might have a shot? "

8hydyy,3,2018-05-08,Programming vs Consulting,bmb134,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8hydyy/programming_vs_consulting/," Hello there,

I've googled this question and I'm afraid of the answers that I've seen, so I would appreciate any piece of advise. I'm graduating from a university soon with a Computer Science degree, but I lack any internship experience \(I'm not lazy, I spent countless hours trying to get an internship\).

I've been offered a $60k salary from a tech company. They would not budge on the salary, but I love programming and I'm good at it. There's a small chance I could advance in that company, so I would have to go to another one for a higher salary.

I was also offered $55k salary from a consulting firm. They would not budge on the salary either, and I don't have any consulting experience \(I will of course go through a 2 month training program before I interact with clients\). This company is a lot larger and I would definitely be able to advance. I would be up for promotion in December with good performance according to a family member who has worked there for some years.

My question is, what would you do if you were me? If I do choose the tech company \(programming\), when should I start looking for another job, assuming that is my only choice in getting a higher salary. If you want to know the company names, let me know and I'll PM them to you."

The general feedback was that I am trying to go very fast and it will be hard to learn. So I have decided to go for 1.5 year (6 quarter plan) as specified below. I will also start looking for internship after my 2/3/4/5 quarter and if I get one then I will delay my plan to accommodate that and take 1 during the internship. I will be a fulltime student with no family or social obligations.

My new plan is as follow: 

##6 Quarter Plan

###Term 1: Summer 2018 (June 2018 - Sept 2018)

- CS161 - Intro to Computer Science I (4) 
- CS225 - Discrete Structures (4)

###Term 2: Fall 2018 (Sept 2018 - Dec 2018)
- CS162 - Intro to Computer Science II (4) 
- CS271 - Computer Architecture &amp; Assembly Language (4)

*I am aware that 162 is a lot of work and taking it with 271 is not advisable but since summer quarter does not have 165 I don't see an alternative where I fit all the courses in 6 quarters plan.*

###Term 3: Winter 2019 (Jan 2019- March 2019)
- CS261 - Data Structures (4)
- CS290 - Web Development (4)
- CS340 - Introduction to Databases (4)

- CS372 - Intro to Computer Networks (4)

### Term 5: Summer 2019 (June 2019 - Sept 2019)
- CS344 - Operating Systems I (4)
- CS362 - Software Engineering II (4)
- CS475 - Parallel Programming (4) or CS464 - Open Source Software Development (4)

###Term 6: Fall 2019 (Sept 2019 - Dec 2019)

I'm a junior dev looking to move to the west coast for a job so I decided to try out TripleByte as I had heard good things about it. So I tried out the front end track.

First step was a short quiz asking a variety of questions testing my knowledge on web technologies, JS and other similar topics. It then told me I did well enough so the next step would be a 1-2 hour video call interview. The video call interview tested to see if I could actually code competently and tested me further on web technologies and concepts.

I then received an email in about 48 hours telling me I had been accepted! ""Great"" I thought. It didn't occur to me that even though I would want to interview with these great companies they matched me with, the companies might not want to interview with me. I had not seen this scenario online when looking up TripleByte.

This experience has been a bit crushing since I thought I was somewhat competent for an entry level applicant, I've had an internship at a ""big N"", and have other internships and even research experience but so far I've never received an interview (from TripleByte or from applying on websites). I tried to fix my resume by following online guides and posting to the resume threads but I haven't gotten any comments on it. Anyone else have any similar experiences with TripleByte or a similar service?

If anyone has any advice for me, I'd appreciate it.

Thank you."

This is an OFFICIAL MOD ANNOUNCEMENT, please hold your undoubtedly worshipful praise until you have read the announcement in full.

A persistent issue in this sub has been questions that are much more about CS schooling than they are about jobs, such as ""Help, I only got into Stanford, CMU, Berkeley, and MIT, please help me decide between safety schools so my life isn't ruined!"" We the mods have been somewhat inconsistent about removing these threads, because they're not entirely irrelevant to this sub's focus, and because there wasn't a good subreddit to deflect them to.

...until *now*.

In partnership with the technically pre-existing sub of /r/csmajors and its previously lone moderator /u/ian421, we will begin deflecting to that sub all questions that are more about being a CS major -- or any other form of CS student, for that matter -- than they are about CS jobs. We have also partnered in sprucing up the sub a bit, so it should be easier on the eyes now. So if you want to ask about how to get started on being Big 4-Ready in middle school, or how in God's name anyone survives Operating Systems without swearing off computers, now there's a place for you to do so! Over there! And not over here! Please, God, *not over here*.

Similarly, /r/csmajors will be deflecting any career-specific questions it gets over to this sub. Questions that are in-between, such as about college career fairs, or internships, or ""How do working stiffs actually use the stuff they learned in CS classes?"", may go in either.

Lastly, the mod team of /r/csmajors, of which I am now half, will be recruiting a few new mods. More details on that will be announced later this week."

Hello! I‚Äôm a student majoring in computer science with a concentrate in network &amp; security. I‚Äôm going to graduate in december (fingers crossed) however I‚Äôve never had an internship or position in this industry. I‚Äôve honestly applied to over 30 internship postings that require little to no experience in the security field and have yet to receive any phone calls. 

This concerns be because of how close my graduation date is. Due to this, I‚Äôve been on my grind separately studying for CompTIA‚Äôs security+ exam, just to help my resume stick out some more. 

Is this a good method of attack? I was really looking forward to getting an internship this summer but it doesn‚Äôt look like that‚Äôs happening even though I live in Chicago :(

As far as my experience, I‚Äôve tinkered with kali Linux and have penetrated a vulnerable Linux server(through virtualization of course). I‚Äôve configured a raspberry pi to allow me to connect to my home network, through a vpn. I‚Äôve bruteforced password hashes with gpu and without and many more things. 

I just don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing in order to be considered qualified for these ‚Äúentry level‚Äù positions, if I don‚Äôt even get a phone call to begin with. I know there‚Äôs a million factors regarding why a company may or may not call, I just want to know if studying for the certification is my best bet. I‚Äôve already purchased and read Darril Gibson‚Äôs SYO-501 book but I‚Äôve heard most people who take the exam, have worked in the field. 

Tldr: is the certification my best option if I can‚Äôt find a summer internship?

Thank you for reading my post. I appreciate it and please let me know if you have any feedback on things I can potentially work on or should be doing. Eventually I want to be a penetration tester but know I can‚Äôt do that without starting somewhere!"

My previous employer was pretty ""whatever"" about this sort of thing. We had generic non-person accounts all over the place. But I was always a little uncomfortable with that.

So far I‚Äôve been doing projects related to the work the company does, and the boss has been giving me feedback which I use to improve this practice code. I honestly like this place and the educational environment where I learn new things with a mentor.

I don‚Äôt want to go into specifics cuzz I know the boss uses Reddit haha so PM me if you have any further questions about the internship.

So I guess my question is: should I settle on this place, look for another internship, or drop it and do an independent project?

My personal opinion is to stick with this place cuzz I‚Äôm too lazy to continue the grueling job search process and I‚Äôm actually developing my software skills in the time I joined this internship, but then again apparently unpaid internships get a bad rap.

Concerning pay, I‚Äôve been working the last 3 summers at the local dominos in my hometown and I make a few thousand in the times I worked there. So if monetary value is really an argument to not take the internship, then by that logic I should just go back to delivering pizzas, which I don‚Äôt want to do."
8i0ys7,1,2018-05-08,How could I handle working two different jobs that are in separate states and about 7 hours (~450 miles) apart over the summer?,fullcircle052,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8i0ys7/how_could_i_handle_working_two_different_jobs/,"TL;DR: My girlfriend may be moving about 7 hours away, I am finishing college but would still like to be with her. My question summed up is could I get a job in the new location while only staying over the weekends OR going there one week at a time and returning to my current location. Also, I apologize for writing a book

I am currently a college student and have an on campus job at that college. The pay is currently enough for me to play for rent, food, etc. With a little left over, and since I still have one more year of school left, I have no intention of leaving this job. Right now, it's my only job and I will be working there over the summer and into the next school year.

However, my girlfriend of over two years has a pretty good chance of getting an internship that is 450 miles away from our current location. She has not been accepted yet, so this is all hypothetical. It is a three month summer internship, and the possibility of a job offer afterwards. She will have a place to stay rent free provided by the company. She needs to complete an internship to finish her degree, so I have absolutely no problem with her accepting it if it is offered to her, and I will of course encourage her to do so

My dilemma, however, is that since I still have one year of school left, I still need to be in the area my college is in, yet I would like to be there with her. We both decided we don't really want to do a long distance relationship, but this is a very good opportunity for her. 

I have two options that I've come up with to see her over the summer. Option one is to work my current job Monday through Thursday, leaving work at around noon. This is a student job, and students are not allowed to work over 28 hours, which I could reach in three and a half days. After leaving at noon on Thursday, head to the other location and get there around 7 or 8 pm. Then I would have Friday, Saturday, and part of Sunday to work another job, after which I would head back to the current location. This of course means I would only be available weekends in the new location.

The other option is to stay in each place one week at a time, alternating jobs each week. This is the preferable option to me. I believe I could work it out with my current employers, however I'm sure that this will make me a much less desirable candidate for a new job. Are there any employers willing to work with  brand new employee like that in the first place? Also, are either of these options are good idea?

There is the third option if staying in my current location while she goes to the new location, and go to visit when I can. This is the least desirable option since I would like to have a job while I'm up there, and we both decided we don't really want to do a long distance relationship.

As of right now, this is all hypothetical. I would just like to have a plan in place in case my girlfriend gets this internship. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I've gotten no phone calls, a handful of rejection letters and zero interviews. What the hell am I doing wrong? My family is first generation, relatively low income, and I'm the first person ever in my entire family to be getting a bachelor's degree, so I don't have much of any connections though family. 

I've had a guy in industry look over my resume, and he said it was solid, and if he was in a position to hire me, he would. So I don't think my resume is awful enough to not even get a phone call. I go to school in NorCal, have a 3.4 GPA, and have leadership roles in a few engineering clubs on campus. I'm nearing the end of college and I can't find any damn company who will take me, and I'd hate to let down my family who's helped me so much through college. I feel like I've got the weight of the world on my shoulders, my whole family looks ups to me and I'd hate to let everyone down. It's honestly depressing to work so hard in school and have work at the same time, and have absolutely nothing come to fruition after so many months of applying and hearing nothing back. I know guys who were barely making it through their classes finding nice cushy jobs because of family getting them jobs they didn't even apply for or even know about. I've got to try something different but the stress and anxiety of not finding work after hundreds of applications, final projects and exams coming up, and the dissapointment of being a failure to myself and my family is all getting to be a bit much for me.

I don't know if you guys have felt this way, I can usually just work through tough times by telling myself it'll all be worth it later. But now later has come, and it feels I'm heading towards a cliff and nothing is there to help me. 

I guess I'm just posting this to get it off my chest, but all the ranting in the world doesn't fix my problems so frankly I don't know what to do. If you guys have advice for any of this I'd like to hear it. Thanks."

I am currently looking for a job right now. I have done researches on what is needed before you become a data analyst. There doesn't seem like anything that will lead into data analyst. Data Analyst itself seems like the starting point already. I imagine those people who could get a job with data analyst without any prior experience would be those people from top university with great GPA and those who have internship experiences.

So my actual question is:

How do I get into data analysis field, (Business intelligence, Data Analyst, Data Scientist, etc) with a bad GPA in a mediocre college degree and a not-bad GPA in an in-progress MSCIS AND no experience in the field?

I have applied to countless data analyst jobs and no one seems to care even calling me to an interview. I feel so lost right now. Being in the field is my dream. I have this passion with big data.

I currently have two options:  
1. Take College Physics 1 &amp; 2, finish school @ 11:45 each day, have more time to focus on ECs/applications. (I'll have an internship, president of two clubs, robotics, etc.)  
2. Take University Physics 1 &amp; 2 and Calculus II (cal 2 is required to be in university physics), finish at 2:20/3:20 each day (block schedule), have less time for ECs/applications. Would also have to pay $200 to take Calculus, as it's a dual credit program and I've exceeded my math credits.  
  
So basically it's pay for harder classes and have less time, or take slightly easier classes, not pay for them, and have more free time. I'm already paying to take Calculus I over the summer, so I don't really want to continue that through senior year.
    
I posted a while back about having an easier course load due to having to pay for some classes, however after I found out about university physics, my approach changed a tad. Any input would be appreciated, thank you!"

Feel free to go check it out @ https://youtu.be/dDP7N-qrgZE
Again, thank you for ALL the awesome support &lt;3

EDIT: Based on the incredible response this post has received, I will be posting ALL the videos recorded during the creation of SimpleAlerts on YouTube. Please stay tuned for details if you are interested in watching. Thank you all for the support :) 

Hi everyone!

I want to preface this post by stating that I am in no way trying to self promote something I have made. While I think it would be awesome for people here to check it out and use it, I wanted to post about my experience with creating an application in 28 days and hopefully motivate someone else to do the same.

### About SimpleAlerts
As the title states, I streamed the entirety of my work for this project on Twitch. I have always been enthralled with the concept of Twitch and I really thought it could be an incredible place for programmers to showcase their work. This led me to start a stream that would encourage people to get involved with programming. I have almost three years of experience working with web development, mobile development, and I am mostly self taught. I still have much to learn and I believe the best way of doing that is through projects. This is where the format for my stream comes- start a project from start to launch in 28 days. This is how SimpleAlerts was born. SimpleAlerts is an open source project that is here to solve the problem of unreadable, disorganized stream events through Streamlabs. For much more detail on this feel free to head over to [the repo](https://github.com/PixelogicDev/SimpleAlerts) as it has much more information about the project. 

### Learning Points
As someone who started off his programming career truly through internships and hackathons, I know how intimidating it is to begin your programming journey. This is why I think this style of project is a great way get a deep dive into something that you have been really wanting to try. I wanted to list the benefits I got from this no matter what level programmer you may be:

#### Learning how to properly setup your project beforehand is KEY
- This is something I have been really wanting to get into as I have always struggled with it. The way you tackle massive projects/problems all comes down to the initial setup. Take as much time as you need in order to really understand how you will be doing each step of the application. It will save you tons of time in the long run.

#### Keep every task bite sized
- I am a huge advocate of Github Issues (as you will see if you check out [the repo](https://github.com/PixelogicDev/SimpleAlerts)). It is much easier for me to digest tasks if they are written out in bite sized concepts. I feel this is a practice many people lack. They feel as if they need to tackle huge problems at once. You don‚Äôt! Your code will be there tomorrow, I promise :)

#### Set a deadline and be consistent
- This take away I think is really important. Many projects that are started are never finished. This could be the shear amount of features that you may want to implement or you‚Äôve simply lost your drive. I had two main motivating factors when building this project. First was the 28 day timeframe and second was the fact that I set a stream schedule 5 days a week for 2-3 hours a day. This kept me engaged with SimpleAlerts.

#### It‚Äôs okay to struggle and not be perfect from the beginning
- You are going to mess up and do things wrong. That's okay! As you start building more projects things will start to click. This could even lead you to refactor older projects with this new insight!

#### Be proud of your work even if only one person uses it
- It‚Äôs okay that your application doesn‚Äôt pop off-most don‚Äôt. Just take a look back at all the time you spent and how much you learned from building out an app from start to launch. These projects are always beneficial even if you don‚Äôt make millions of dollars ;)

I wanted to wrap up this post by saying that the programming community is a great one to be a part of. All the people I have interacted with during this project have been more than great. Everyone is willing to help each other out and want to see everyone succeed. If you are afraid to start something like this or even start programming, just remember people are here to support you. One of the reasons why I decided to make SimpleAlerts open source was to encourage beginners to come and add to the codebase. Consider contributing on Github @ [this repo](https://github.com/PixelogicDev/SimpleAlerts) if you are interested!
 
Thanks for taking the time to read this and if you have any questions/concerns please feel free to reach out :)

I don't have any internships, no personal projects, and I feel like I don't really actually know much. I have a decent GPA (3.7) and I don't really know what to do.

I've been trying out different things (though not diving too deep into these) like iOS development with Swift and some web dev HTML/CSS and looked into JavaScript today. I'm not sure if it's because I haven't really dived into these for too long but I feel like I'm not really interested in them. I don't know what I'm interested in. I don't know what kind of projects to even work on.

With all the ICS / CS classes I've taken, I never really loved or hated any of the assignments we've had to do. There's been satisfaction at some points when I finish projects, but I guess that's it. 

Does anyone have any advice for me on what to do next? What kinds of things I should try out or learn? I'm honestly pretty scared that I'm graduating in a year and I have no idea what I'm going to do. Scared that I'm not going to find a job.

8i2uqp,3,2018-05-08,Is a project management certificate worth it for software development?,ht04,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8i2uqp/is_a_project_management_certificate_worth_it_for/,"Hello,


I am looking for some guidance for extra courses that do not apply to my degree, but may still prove useful.


I went to see an academic advisor at the cheapest local university, trying to get a BS in computer science after a year break from education. I found I could take more courses at my local community college (great because it's cheaper and I don't think I could have graduated in 4 semesters at the university anyway, as it would require 18 credit hours per semester + working).


I thought I could go full-time (getting full-time financial benefits) with 4 courses (13 credit hours), but the only 2 courses that satisfy a specific requirement are only available 2nd semester. That leaves me with only 10 credit hours (2 under full-time).


As far as I can tell I do have a few options, but my preferred 2 are:


- Take a course in CS that would be interesting and useful, but that does not apply to my degree (like Programming C or Computer Arch/Assembly)

- Take 1 of 3 project management courses (paying for the other 2 during summer out-of-pocket, and completing their ""Project Management Certificate""), which also does not apply to my degree


The second option would definitely cost more money, but seems like it could be worth it in the long run. I'm guessing I won't be on a job where I am managing the project anytime soon, even after the degree, but I don't think getting an early start on getting ahead of other applicants would be a bad idea. The thing is, I'm not sure that:


A. This certificate and its courses will be useful for software development (though one of them has ""MS Project"" in the title, if that is for software)

B. That employers or managers or whatever would care that I got this certificate, especially if it is as old as it would be when I apply


I would not want to spend extra money and extra time on a certificate that will not help me. I also could spend my summer applying for internships instead, if that would be more productive. I also understand everything is a risk, and is valued at whatever that employer arbitrarily feels (even the degree). Just looking for advice, hopefully from multiple people.


Here are the classes if that helps answer (FRCC):


- Project Management in Organizations (needed: 3 credits in MAN 241)

- Project Management in Action (needed: 3 credits in MAN 243)

- Automated Project Management: MS Project (needed: 3 credits in CIS)


MAN = Management

CIS = Computer Information Systems


Any advice is much appreciated. Have a great one, and thanks, even for reading."

These are just some of the intern positions in the U.S that I've applied for.




The main reason for wanting to work there is solely for the purpose of experience and to give me advantages in the future when I finish my degree or find my self in a position of being critiqued.





I started investing in small companies in the past year and I noticed when I would look at the team members I would go to their linkedIn and see what kind of experience they had. I was immediately attracted to projects which had a team with a strong background in big firms like the one's I've mentioned.





Also I love Computer Science, I've been programming since I was 12 and entrepreneurial before that age as-well and I'm always cooking up ideas and creating them to make something worthwhile.





I have a pretty decent on-going portfolio right now, with 3 Web-Applications solely written by me generating decent traffic. I'm experienced in a multitude of languages such as C++,Java,Ruby,Rails,React,JS,PostgreSQL and have even helped open-source projects on GitHub.


My question is, how can I get these big firms to notice me?

To my disappointment, I haven't found anyone at University with my kind of drive and determination to succeed. I haven't met anyone in my year that has as many skills as I do so far when it comes to development or business. Yet I think my chances of obtaining a desired intern position are limited due to my background (father emigrated here, no connection, family very poor back home)





The reason for me posting this is one of my friends, lets call her Chloe told me she had an uncle at Sun Microsystems (acquired by Java) who is getting her a placement for the summer. She barely knows how to program and frequently under performs in tests.






No point being jealous though, thats not gonna help so what I'm asking people is if they've had any experience in getting a placement or a summer internship at a competitive company?






PS: After failing for 2 months to get a good response from intern jobs in America, I tried also in the U.K and haven't heard from them yet.

Very skilled 19 year old WITH experience and portfolio looking for ideas and help to get noticed by competitive technology companies!

2 Go back to uni to take a more employable bachelor (i was thinking computer science or bioengineering).
3 Get the most employable master's degree I can enter with my bachelor into (I figured that would probably be International Relations).
4 Get some kind of related professional certificate, like TESL to teach English in Japan or similar.

I want to go to grad school, but I'm having trouble figuring out what area I should focus on. I've had a few professors tell me that I should go to grad school or that I'd be successful there and I have no doubt that I could be. Also my parents are essentially expecting me to go to grad school, but that's mainly cause I'm their ""smart little boy"" or whatever. My own personal reasons for wanting to go to grad school are simply that I'm not satisfied with how much I learned in undergrad. I'm still really curious about a lot of things. Also I've two in-industry internships and found both of them to be quite soul-crushing\*. I know that one of the most universal pieces of advice about grad school is don't just go because you don't want to get a ""real"" job, but honestly that's kind of where I'm at. 

I don't have any research experience, but this summer I found a professor and a project to work with. I only got connected to that because of a friend of mine who's going to grad school did some undergrad research for one of the other professors in the same research area. The research project does sound interesting to me, and I'm excited to see how this summer goes. But I need to start applying now, and that means finding schools, research groups, and professors that are doing what I want to be doing, but I don't know what that is. My issue is less that nothing interests me, and more that everything interests me and nothing stands out (cue reference to Syndrome from The Incredibles). 

In high school I was on a robotics team and there was a team mentor that I talked to a lot and he taught me a lot about controls, programming, and electronics and I really enjoyed that and that's honestly why I chose to major in mechanical engineering. Since starting college I've enjoyed the controls and systems courses I've taken. My dad works in the aerospace field, so once I started taking classes on fluids and heat and mass transfer, I started talking with him a lot more about those areas and what he does more specifically and my interest in those areas increased. I just took an upper level thermodynamics course this semester and I really enjoyed that, especially the topic of combustion after I had some discussion with the professor about it. When I originally met with the professor I'm going to be working with this summer, we sat down and I just asked him question after question for over and hour and got really interested in that research area, which is why I decided to work with him this summer. It seems to me that for almost any subject that I'm able to sit down with someone knowledgeable about it and have some type of discussion, even if I know next to nothing about it, that I'll walk away being really interested in it.

How do I go about narrowing down my interests? How do I answer the question ""What are your research interests?"" Just saying ""What ever I'm exposed to"" doesn't seem like a good answer. And I realize that you can still figure this kind of stuff out during the first semester of grad school, but my chances are much better if I can specifically target one professor/research group at the universities I apply to, and I'll need all the chances I can get since I will be graduating in December. Also, sort of tangentially, when looking for specific research groups and professors, how do I find the ones that are okay with sitting down and just answering questions for an hour, like the one I'm working for this summer? Cause I feel like that's probably not super common considering how busy professors can be.

Thanks for reading the wall of text. **TL:DR** I'm a senior in Mechanical Engineering and I want to go to grad school, but I don't just have one interest (or even something narrowed down like specifically thermodynamics) as I'm really interested and curious about pretty much anything I'm exposed to and have an opportunity to explore. How do I pick an area for grad school?

\* Soul-crushing industry experience was mostly that 95+% of the problems the ""engineers"" I was working with had to solve were stupid people problems and political issues, not technical ones (which might have been attributable to it being a union shop). This was at a major Fortune 500 company and basically none of their jobs involved any technical nitty-gritty, and I like the nitty-gritty."

Doing an internship during summer would be expected of me, but it doesn't really reasonate with me as I prefer to push towards my fields of interest",togademi,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8i62rw/ive_finished_my_2nd_year_of_cs_degree_doing_an/,"I've finished my 2nd year of CS degree and I want to take advantage of my summer vacation to learn and acquire experience in the fields that interest me: machine learning, data analysis, deep learning, data mining, AI...

I feel like doing an internship would be expected of me, but it doesn't really reasonate with me. For the internship to be useful to me, it would have to involve working with those fields that interest me. However:

* I have barely any experience in those fields. I haven't studied any of those at college yet (I'll supposedly start next year). The only knowledge I have is the [ML MOOC by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) that I did last summer
* I think that companies working in those fields are hiring data science programmers who know their shit, not 2nd-year students that know nothing and want to start learning and practicing
* I feel like doing an internship in a different field than those that interest me wouldn't get me further in my career. And that I would be better off learning and practising on my own the stuff that interests me

What I've learnt at college until now is:

| Thing | Technology |
| ------ | ----------- |
| OS and Unix | C and Shell |
| General programming and algorithms | C |
| Object-oriented programming | Java |
| Data structures | C |
| Data bases | SQL |
| Architecture | Assembly (ARM) |
| Networks | |
| Some maths | |

So... would doing an internship make any sense to me or should I learn on my own and work on projects? In case the internship is a good idea, how could I find one that would be useful to me?

Thanks in advance for your advice. I'd appreciate them a lot"
8i6wlk,1,2018-05-09,I think I'm ready to quit my job but don't know if I'm overreacting,letsg3tdown2business,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8i6wlk/i_think_im_ready_to_quit_my_job_but_dont_know_if/,"I have been at my job for about 9-10 months now. It has been a bumpy ride. When I first joined up, my bosses (who are also my managers, as it is a small company of under 10 people) and I sat down to create a roadmap of what my job position would look like in the coming months. Unfortunately, due to a number of work-related crises (not involving me), some financial issues, and some other issues, we are not currently where we thought we would be.

Despite the lack of progress, or where we thought we might be, I still think that a decent amount has gotten completed. I have built and launched a new website from scratch, creating all of the content; I built all of our social media from scratch; I helped everyone in the office fix their business cards, created a lead generation plan for new clients, have completely revamped our database, have sent 500+ mailings out, took on a brief intern, and even managed to become specialized in my field during this time. 

My bosses, however, seem unfulfilled - but unwilling to discuss it with me. We set meeting times but they end up dodging them. When we do sit down, I have asked openly and honestly for feedback - what could I do better, how could I improve - and they say I need to figure it out on my own. This is peppered by their commentary that I ""sit around all day and do nothing"" and that my job ""could easily be outsourced.""

A few weeks ago, my boss and I sat down for a heart-to-heart, in which he apologized for the fact that my job was not progressing in the way we thought it might, and that he hoped I didn't feel lied to or cheated about my job. He hoped that if I were frustrated, we could use that meeting time to hash out some of how I was feeling. During this conversation, he apologized multiple times and said that they hadn't meant to not be able to uphold my job description. I understood, expressed a need for more/better communication, once again asked if there was anything I could improve upon, and we left it at that. I left the meeting feeling a lot better regarding my role.

Today, I came into the office prepared for a client meeting. I wore a business casual dress - it was actually the dress I originally wore to this job for a job interview. My hair is brushed, my makeup is done. I am wearing heels. I sat down and started my day. About an hour into the day, my boss proceeded to send me an email telling me that I looked dirty, that I looked like I had just rolled out of bed, and that I should go home at lunch and come back looking better. Apparently, this has been an issue that ""has been meaning to be brought up for a while,"" but that my boss feels I don't look good enough for the office.

I'll be honest - I do not dress business professional for work, as it has never been a business professional environment. When I was hired for the job, I asked the dress code, which was business casual. I wear dresses, nice jeans and blouses, no to minimal makeup, and shoes that are either boots or heels. I have never worn in t-shirts, shorts/capris, flip flops, or anything of the like. I do admit that I don't wear a lot of makeup, but I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts and allergic reactions. If I wear certain types of makeup for too long (ex: lipstick), my lips swell up. I have tried different types of makeup, and it all ends the same way. I even have Benadryl in my desk at work to take for flare-ups.

It hurts my feelings that the email was sent. I almost feel attacked in a way. I am not opposed to sitting down and having a talk about what they would prefer me to wear to work, and would have been open to speaking about it in the MANY times I've asked them what I can improve upon. But regardless, I don't think it's an appropriate conversation to have over email. Combined with the other comments that have been made about myself, my job, and my performance (not all of which have been put into the post), I am beginning to feel like no matter what I do here, it won't be right. The work I do, the clothes I wear - nothing seems to be good enough for them, and it is exhausting. 

I have a job offer that is willing to wait for me until September, and I'm so frustrated with my current position and the current way that I am spoken to that I am considering writing my two-weeks notice and giving it to them this afternoon, or tomorrow, or Friday. But I don't know if I'm overreacting or jumping away from something I should stay at.

tl;dr: How do I deal with hurtful comments about my performance and my appearance from my management? How do I know at what point it is right to step away from a job?"

I am 25 years old and in my 4th semester of my CS bachelor. In order to get my degree I have to complete an internship abroad. Since I study in Berlin I obviously can not do it here in Germany so I deciced after some weeks of research that Australia might be a good place.

During my research I have found out, that there is a high demand for developers in Melbourne. So if anyone of you just happens to be in such a company I would appreciate it, if you would send me the name of your company or hook me up with someone I can talk to, to convince you that it is not a bad idea to hire an intern from a foreign country for a time period of about 5 months.

When it comes to my skills I can say that I am very comfortable with the frontend and tools such as Git, Grunt. Also I am pretty confident with Java, so I would totally also do an internship based around software engineering and not web development.

Thanks and have a nice day everyone!

TL;DR

German CS student is looking for an internship in Melbourne, Australia and thought this sub is a good place to ask if there is demand for a foreign intern."

Hi all, trying to make a sheet to help my missus to track her hours at her uni internship.

She works Monday to friday,

* I need to have data validation to prevent #value errors whilst she's adding in times on her phone, i.e. she enters 9 \(am\) instead of 09:00.
* I want the daily hours to display in a standard 1 or 2 digit number format by calculating the difference between times
* Cell B3 needs to add up all the values in the hours column so she can see how many hours she's done so far \(she needs to complete 360\)

Any other ideas would be great, but I hope you guys get what I'm trying to accomplish, I think I'm close to it but I can't make all the necessary functions work together, it needs to be simple enough to use on a phone without causing errors, so kind of.. user proof I guess?

A little background of myself is I am 23 years old and graduated from college (Rutgers) last year with a BA in Economics. I live in Northern New Jersey and I have been working in sales for the past couple years, and I don't see a real future for myself in that field. However I am a pretty successful salesman and i figured I can apply some of those traits to another field possibly. I have some money saved up (around 10k) and am still living at home with my parents. So, thankfully I have little to no expenses besides my student loans which is close to 40k and I am paying about 450/month on that. Although I know I am still young, i want to get the ball rolling and start a successful career.

I am really open on my options of a career path. Possibly looking to get into a field that involves my degree but unfortunately all the jobs I have been applying to I have not heard back from. I think part of the reason for this is because I did not intern when i was in college and instead worked dead end sales positions. My GPA(3.1) wasn't the greatest as well. Is it possible I can find a company that will take me on as an intern even if i have graduated? I don't mind working for free if it will give me the valuable experience to prepare me for a full time position in that field.

 Also, I have been looking at getting into the real estate field. Real estate is something that has always intrigued me, as not having a capped income is lucrative to me. Maybe i go get my real estate license and become a real estate agent. If any real estate agents from NJ can give there input on careers in real estate I would be thankful.

Lastly, I was also thinking about maybe teaching myself a new skill. For example, learning coding and getting into the CS field. How hard is it to do this, and can I get a job in this field if I graduated with a Econ degree but learned to code later on?

Any other suggestions and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

He‚Äôs in here with me. He‚Äôs in this very room with me as I type this. Marcus wasn‚Äôt lying. You can see him just as long as you don‚Äôt actually look at him. The minute you look he‚Äôs gone. I‚Äôm sorry if this seems jumbled but he‚Äôs distracting and it‚Äôs really hard to type when someone is looking over your shoulder.

Let me bring you guys up to speed. Thank you for reading my last post I found all your suggestions helpful. I wish I had followed them.
 
After I typed up the post last week I decided I needed to do something. But I found myself stuck in a strange situation. Do I go to the police? I didn‚Äôt really have any proof of any wrongdoing, just some suspected wrongdoing, and even if it was ethically wrong was it illegal? Can hypnosis even be illegal? When I stopped and thought about it I realized I had nothing. I didn‚Äôt even know what made The Owl People‚Äôs version of the software any different. But I realized I could find out.  There was one way I could discover *exactly* what was in that thing.
 
The lab runs the VR software on HTC Vive headsets. A few weeks back the plastic on the side of one of the headsets snapped and rather than try to fix it the guys in IT threw the whole thing out, base stations and all. Well at least they tried to throw it out, but once something hits the curb it‚Äôs fair game, right? And just like that I became the lucky recipient of one duct taped Vive headset.
 
They watch the test machines too closely for me to feel comfortable trying the Owl People software in the lab, but I decided I could probably sneak the software out in a flash drive and try it in the comfort of my own apartment. Then I could see for myself there was anything obviously malicious in there.
 
Thursday, I woke up early and got to work before most of the devs but not early enough to draw suspicion. While most the guys were getting their morning coffee and catching up on their emails I snuck a small flash drive from my pocket and copied the ‚Äú_AVBAS_.exe‚Äù files. I didn‚Äôt think anyone noticed. I thought I was so clever.
 
I‚Äôve tried the simple standard version of the software several times. Normally you put on the headset to find yourself in a vast empty white expanse. There‚Äôs a single tree behind you to the right and large text in front of you that says ‚ÄúRelax‚Äù and behind that is the hypnotist.  The hypnotist is this massive white naked statue of a man. He‚Äôs at least 5 times as big as you, sitting cross legged about 20 feet away.  One of the devs told me that early tests showed that the software worked better when people had a person to attribute the narrator‚Äôs voice to. Making him a giant but then having him sit relaxed is said to give him a feeling of authority without being imposing. Maybe that‚Äôs true for most people but I‚Äôve always found his image more than a little jarring.
 
I rushed home after work on Thursday both excited and terrified to try this new version of the software. With shaking hands, I plugged the USB stick into my desktop and loaded it up. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. I live in a single studio apartment, and in one corner of the room is my bed. On the far side from that is the kitchen and the door. The main area in the middle is perfect as a VR space. I stood there with one hand on the headset ready to pull it off the second things turned weird. I looked for even the tiniest difference between this version and the standard version I had used before‚Ä¶ but there wasn‚Äôt one. This for all intents and purposes appeared to be the same A.V.B.A.S. experience that everyone got. This one had the audio script for improving self-confidence. Same narrator, same vast white emptiness, same tree, and same overly large ‚ÄúRelax‚Äù text.
 
I was partly relieved, and partly confused. Maybe this software had nothing to do with The Owl People. Maybe the way that The Owl People looked was just the way that college-level stress plays out in some people. I don‚Äôt know what I had even expected to find. Some voice chanting ‚ÄúKill! Kill! Kill!‚Äù or something? The more I thought about it the more ridiculous the idea felt. It still didn‚Äôt explain what was happening to The Owl People though.
 
When I went in to work on Friday I realized my network credentials no longer worked. There‚Äôs a strange shrinking panic you get around the third time you try entering your credentials and you realize that you aren‚Äôt doing it wrong. You‚Äôve been intentionally locked out. I felt a hand grab my shoulder. I turned around to see my boss staring at me with a look that told me all I needed to know. He told me I had been caught on security camera suspiciously pulling a flash drive out of my pocket and stealing information off one of the labs test machines. My brain had been so preoccupied with trying to get to the bottom of the A.V.B.A.S. mystery that I had completely forgotten that there were confidential medical records stored on those machines.  I tried to explain that I was just taking a version of the software to use at home. I tried to act like I really loved the software and just wanted a copy in hopes of getting a lesser punishment, but they said they had no proof I hadn‚Äôt copied down confidential information. They were letting me go.

Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out.
 
Everything was falling apart around me. I lost my internship, my friend clearly wasn‚Äôt doing well, and my one attempt at unraveling it had proven fruitless.
 
  I got to thinking that maybe the problem wasn‚Äôt the hypnosis machine. Maybe something else was going on with Marcus. I didn‚Äôt have to be at work anymore and I really needed a friend so I hit him up. The texts to see if he wanted to hang out were returned by a halfhearted ‚Äúyeah I guess you can come over here‚Äù.
 
When I got to his place I looked around and realized his apartment was cleaner than I had ever seen it before. Like, spotless‚Ä¶
 
This wasn‚Äôt like Marcus at all. He didn‚Äôt clean. He sat around all day in sweatpants watching cartoons and smoking weed. As nice as Marcus‚Äô apartment looked though, it was still obvious that he was not doing well. On top of the usual sunken under eye bags and bloodshot eyes, his face had taken on a strange puffiness. I caught a glint of clear marks running from both his tear ducts as though I had just walked in on him crying. His voice even took on the subtle vocal fry of someone trying to conceal his emotions. I asked him if everything was alright and, like always, he dismissed my remarks claiming he had no idea what I was talking about.
 
Talking to Marcus in this state was harder than I had imagined it. Every topic I brought up he ended as quickly as he could. He acted like someone who was late for another appointment and needed me to hurry up and leave so he could get going. I asked if he‚Äôd like to smoke. He said he‚Äôd rather not. I asked if he wanted to play some Xbox. He said he‚Äôd rather not.  We watched TV for a few hours and then I decided that maybe I should leave. Marcus jumped to help me out the door. As I was leaving I thanked him for hanging out, ‚ÄùHey thanks man. I know we haven‚Äôt seen much of each other lately. We should hang out more.‚Äù Marcus shook his head in agreement, but you could tell by the look on his face that he really didn‚Äôt care. He continued to move me toward the door.  

‚ÄúHey by the way man, I‚Äôve been meaning to show you, but I got one of those VR headsets from work you should come on over some time and we‚Äôll--‚Äú

‚ÄúDo you have that hypnosis stuff?‚Äù he interrupted.

I didn‚Äôt know how to answer this. ‚ÄúUhh actually yeah I do‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôve also got some really cool games that you should try.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm sure we could play those too, but first, I‚Äôd really love to try the hypnosis software someplace outside of the lab.  It‚Äôs been driving me crazy. I think there‚Äôs something in there‚Ä¶ something I haven‚Äôt been able to put my finger on. I think it‚Äôs in the room with all the numbers, but I‚Äôve never had a chance to just explore without the doctor breathing down my neck.‚Äù

The hairs on my arm stood up. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about? What numbers room?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know, the one with all the numbers everywhere. The one without the spirals or the giant. Every time I go in it‚Äôs a different room, but there‚Äôs something going on in the numbers room. I just feel it. I mean if you‚Äôre free right now I‚Äôd love to just--‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, I can‚Äôt right now,‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúI really need to figure out what I‚Äôm going to do about this internship thing.‚Äù

I quickly excused myself and headed home. I assured Marcus that I‚Äôd let him poke around in the software soon, but even as I was saying the words I realized I was probably lying to him. What *other* rooms was he talking about? In all the time I‚Äôve been testing the software, there has only been the one environment.
 
As soon as I got home I booted A.V.B.A.S. again to see if there was something I missed. I found myself in the same vast empty whiteness. The same tree as always, the same text, the same hypno-‚Ä¶ no wait. The hypnotist had moved. Instead of the usual sitting pose, he was crouched down on his hands and knees with one arm outstretched toward me. From his hand, he dangled a massive pocket watch a few feet from my face. The watch began to swing back and forth as the narrator read off his script in a booming echoey voice . This room and script were different from the other one, but it didn‚Äôt feel sinister, more like an extension of what I had already seen. Maybe this version of the software contained improvements that hadn‚Äôt made it to the other test subjects.
 
I *wish* I could tell you more about what happened next in this new hypnosis experience, but here‚Äôs the thing: I... I can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt remember it. I know I didn‚Äôt fall asleep or anything, I just can‚Äôt really remember what happened. One second the giant watch is floating back and forth in front of me and this voice keeps commanding me to ""breathe in, breathe out"" and the next second there‚Äôs a message floating out in space instructing me to take the headset off.
 
Freaked out, I ripped the headset off, partially tearing the duct tape. I had lost track of time and had no idea how long I had been inside. I put everything away and decided never to run that software ever again. Exhausted and shaken up, I called it a night.
 
Saturday, I woke up early and went to the nearby coffee shop to sit at my laptop and work on job applications. I needed to deal with the A.V.B.A.S. issue, but I also needed to be able to make rent, and job applications just felt like a more ‚Äúreal‚Äù issue at the time. As I sat there fixing up my resume and looking though job postings, I kept noticing people walking past me. I know that‚Äôs not unusual at a cafe, but I could swear that out of the corner of my eye they all had the same distinctive white porcelain skin as the narrator. They wore the same blank expression with the same 100-yard stare. They were all staring at me. My eyes darted around the room to catch their gaze, but couldn‚Äôt seem to find them. Every click of the keyboard grew louder and louder. I could feel their stares. The sounds of rest of the shop faded into the background. I grew so preoccupied with being the focus of their attention that my mind had wandered from the task at hand. I looked down to realize that instead of typing out my credentials, someone had written the words ‚Äúbreathe in, breathe out‚Äù like a hundred times across my page. Was it me? Had I done that without realizing it?
 
I slammed my laptop closed and got the hell out of the coffee shop. Even as I ran home, it was still happening. Anyone I could focus my eyes on looked fine but everyone in my peripheral vision, everyone was him. They were all him. Pure white statues all staring at me.
 
As I entered my apartment I slammed the door closed and locked it. I closed the blinds and shut off everything, but alone in the complete silence of my apartment I could tell he was there‚Ä¶ watching me. When I looked at the kitchen, he watched me from my bed. When I stared at my bed, he watched me from the kitchen. The knowledge that this might just all be in my head didn‚Äôt make it any less real.
 
I thought that if I could get some sleep, then maybe just maybe he‚Äôd be gone when I woke up. As I lay there in bed I could feel breath on my face. I knew that if I opened my eyes he‚Äôd be there. I laid there for what felt like an eternity and then I fell asleep‚Ä¶ I guess. I must have. Because the next thing I knew I was waking up.
 
Slowly I opened my eyes only to realize I wasn‚Äôt in my apartment any more. I was in some dark vast emptiness.  As my eyes began to focus I could just barely make out some text floating out in front of me: ‚ÄúIt is now safe to remove the headset.‚Äù I reached my hands up to feel the cold hard plastic of the Vive strapped to my face...  Sheer terror gripped me as my brain tried to make sense of my situation. I had woken up standing in my living room wearing that damn headset. Did I do this? Had I turned it on in my sleep? How could I have loaded this up and strapped myself in without waking up?
 
That all happened just a couple of hours ago but according to my phone, today is Wednesday. I laid down on Saturday around noon. I‚Äôm **missing four whole days**. I‚Äôm sick to my stomach. I don‚Äôt know what's happening to me.
 
The narrator is still here. He watched over my shoulder as I wrote this whole thing. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I just saw my reflection in the mirror in the bathroom. There are two large sunken rings under my eyes. I‚Äôm writing this here in case anything happens to me. I‚Äôm scared. Have you ever been in a situation where you can‚Äôt even trust your own mind? You can barely even breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out.
 
I can‚Äôt get my thoughts together. I can‚Äôt think straight and that damn knock knock knocking on my front door isn‚Äôt helping. I snuck a peek through the peephole earlier. It‚Äôs Marcus and the other Owl People. I thought if I didn‚Äôt open the door that maybe they would go away, but it isn‚Äôt working. His knuckles must be so raw by now. I guess I should go let them in. If today is in fact Wednesday then God only knows how long they‚Äôve been out there.

I am a 20 year old transgender female, currently residing in Indiana. Recently my pharmacy (CVS) accidentally outed me to my parents via a phone message telling me there was an issue with my prescription. 

Long story short, the past 6 hours have been very pressing for me. Currently the issue I'm coming across is that my parents helped buy me a Ford Focus back in 2016, and my father co-signed the car. Now I am being told they are going to take my vehicle away from me; since I financially right now do not have the money to pay for it. (My internship starts on the 15th, in which I will be getting money)

The car is signed in my name, with my father's name as the co-sign. The payments have ALL been paid thru my bank account (which is mine independently), with the exception of the initial down payment. 

Are they LEGALLY allowed to ""repossess"" my car from me, or report it as stolen if I take it to my internship?"

I do have 2 previous cs jobs and 1 job as a CS tutor. Although my most recent cs job I was fired mainly because I did not tell my boss in time that I was going to take off to study for finals. I did tell him a week in advance but I guess that‚Äôs not enough and the internship was unpaid. 

Anyways I don‚Äôt believe my old boss and me are on good terms. The workplace was toxic and I was going to quit in June anyway so it was unfortunate I was fired for wanting to study for finals. Boss isn‚Äôt cool enough to allow me to say I quit and honestly treated my fellow interns and I as slaves and everyone either quit or was fired besides one intern who is probably quitting soon. But yeah, if my new employers want to talk to my old boss what do I do? Do they typically ask for old employer references? Although the internship was horrible and I ended up doing things I was not promised to do E.G I interviewed to work on backend and was told I‚Äôd do backend but was doing front end, I still feel like I need to include the internship on my resume to have it full. 


TLDR: old boss was shitty and can‚Äôt use as reference but need the job on my resume so what should I do? Also how do I prepare myself for senior year to land a job at the big 4 tech companies as a software engineer or iOS developer?

8ib03o,140,2018-05-09,Landlord wants to charge us $500 more in rent because of extra roommate?,potatopotater,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/8ib03o/landlord_wants_to_charge_us_500_more_in_rent/,"So we're a group of 5 let's call us A, B, C, D, E \(all male\) who are going to be living in Markham, Ontario for this year because we all have internships for the year in the area. All of us have 700\+ credit scores.

While househunting, 3 of us\(A, B, C\) ended up signing a BRA with a realtor\(stupid, I know\) for a deal that didn't go through. So we 3 can't be on any lease for a few months until the BRA expires because we would have to pay commission to this realtor.

Finally, we found a nice house with 7 bedrooms for $3500/month with great location, so we signed a lease\(for the whole house\) starting May 1st. Only D signed this lease because of the BRA situation earlier, so D is the only one on this lease. \(E was not available at the time\)

Since the house has 7 bedrooms, we asked the landlord about having a 6th roommate, and she was like 'ehh maybe'. I take it she was worried about us rooming with just anyone, but I assured her that any new roommate would also have proof of income \+ good credit. She seemed to reluctantly agree.

Later when we brought this up with the landlord again, all of a sudden she says that if we want to have another roommate we will have to pay $500/month more in rent. So our rent would be $4000/month. We were like 'uhhh okay..' and we didn't wanna start a fight at the time so we just ignored it.

So we are each paying $700/month in rent which we can afford, but since this house had a lot more space than what we needed, we found another roommate F with a job and good credit. The original \(and in hindsight, stupid\) plan was to just not tell the landlord about this new roommate, but well, we're all dumb.

All of us except A have already moved in. A doesn't start work until later so he'll move in then.

Yesterday our landlord came in unannounced and noticed that we had F living there. She again tells us that if we want a 6th person living in the house we will need to pay $500/month more in rent. We didn't want to start anything then either, so we told her that F is only here temporarily because A moves in late. That was a white lie to diffuse the situation. 

I think this is ridiculous. Our lease literally says no more than 8 people can live here, and we're fewer than that.

Her arguments for charging us more in rent our as follows:

Our lease says it's a 'single family' residence that can live there, so the max 8 person rule doesn't apply because we're 'friends' and not 'immediate family'.

She said her landlord's insurance goes up if 6 people are living here as opposed to 5.\(but I'm sure it doesn't go up $500\)

Other details:

D is the only person on this lease.

The lease is not room by room, it is for the whole house, it explicitly says that in the lease. So she should have no say over who lives in what room.

There is a clause about immediate family so technically only D's immediate family can live here, but that makes no sense because none of us are D's immediate family and she knew we would be living there before the whole 6th roommate thing happened? So why bring it up now?

She's asking us for post dated cheques which I'm pretty sure she's not allowed to do?

Like I'm so upset rn, this bs is a huge waste of everyone's time. We don't needlessly want to pay $500 more in rent. Like it's a 7 bedroom house and there's 6 of us, it's perfectly reasonable. 

What are our options? Is what she is doing legal? How do we deal with this as quickly as possible? Because we have all just started jobs and we have that to worry about."

8iboh2,1,2018-05-09,MIA Family Since Collge,techwitch77,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8iboh2/mia_family_since_collge/,"I'm not sure where to start with this, so I guess I'll begin describing what my family's relationship dynamics were before college.

There was always a huge power dynamic between the kids and my parents. My parent's solely and strictly adhered to ""we're your parents, not your friends"" mentality throughout childhood, making confiding in them near impossible due to the lack of friendly, personal connection to them. When my next-to-youngest sister hit the rebellious stage, you can only IMAGINE how well this played out. Also being helicopter parents, they never hesitated to randomly invade privacy, even going as far to use work equipment to dump said sister's phone of all messages, pictures, etc., when they found out she was sneaking out of the house, as well as tracking her location 24/7 to current date (earliest incident happened 3 years ago). While her behavior has DEFINITELY warranted punishment and scrutiny, their ever-tightening control on her prompts her to act out even further. An endless circle.

While my father has done the most to be engaged in our lives (asking about our day, asking engaging questions about school projects, etc.), my mother has always been in her own ""little world"" online as well as with her friends and work. Additionally, talking with other family members, we all heavily suspect she has Type II bipolar disorder because of her borderline-physically-violent outbursts over anything. While the same sister reacted to this with equally-terrifying outbursts (professionally diagnosed with BP II), I hid in my room and kept my head really low in my textbooks, eventually doing well enough in school to get a lot of scholarships to a uni a few hundred miles away.

Finally free of the tight leash I was restrained to, I didn't do so well of a job of keeping in contact with parents when at uni. During my freshman year, I would text/call them on a weekly basis, but I now don't contact them at all unless it's to go home from uni. The only immediate family member that I talk to on a daily basis is my grandmother and youngest sister (12 years old), who both FB message me about their life and check in on me. They're both such sweethearts, so I always make sure to get back to them ASAP. Aside from them, my family isn't emotionally or financially involved in my college life. It kinda sucks.

This brings us to the current situation. After scoring a $40k+ internship this summer and getting a nice apartment within my budget, there's no reason that I needed to come back. But I decided to out of respect for my family... It's been a mess. Upon coming home, I was promised a late celebration of my birthday alongside my birthday presents waiting for me (was supposed to include a laptop and bookbag for work that starts in 5 days). To my surprise, neither has happened and they've attempted to play dumb about the entire situation. I ended up buying most of my birthday presents (both were necessities for my internship) because they still kept giving me ""maybes"" and shutting me down when I asked them about it. While I could afford it and really didn't mind if they couldn't afford it anyway (they just needed to tell me that), it just sucks that they couldn't be upfront with me or at least considerate of my feelings.

I don't know if my hurt is warranted because I know I'm in this weird transitionary period from childhood to adulthood, and I also hear a lot about how kids turn on their parents in their early twenties when trying to establish their independence. I guess I'm asking for advice on how to handle this situation, as it doesn't seem right to just leave them, ESPECIALLY my youngest 12-year-old sister who is constantly exposed to all of this. I desperately want to be her confidant and her protector, but it's also hard dealing with the emotional neglect and repression exhibited by my parents. What should I do?

TL;DR: feeling completely disconnected from dysfunctional family. Can't decide to eventually cut them out of my life after college or to stick around. Currently has a 12-year-old sister who is exposed to all of this, and cant leave her alone. What do I do?

I'm sure you get this a lot. I apologize. It helps me to ask questions and interact though.


I want to create a 2d game. I love messing around with pixel art, and I also love programming and video games. I am fairly experienced with development in general (did an internship at Siemens this semester working with c++).


My question is, what would be the best way to go about developing a 2D game. I don't mind learning another language, I can pick up quickly. But if c++ and opengl is a viable option I am down to use it. 


Is it worth it to go through the trouble of making your own game engine? Especially if I am planning for a long term (about 4 year) project I can learn with and work on. Or should I use an existing engine, like unity I see is popular. 


I love programming so if making my own engineer is worth the challenge, I'm willing to face it.

I understand I will still need to familiarize myself with the companies codebase, and my team has totally agreed that they want to get me to start looking/working on some code, but I feel I am at such a low level compared to them that I will not be any help whatsoever.

Any advise or comments about any section will be appreciated!

My background:

I am currently a dual degree candidate getting my MS in CS and MBA at a top engineering and business school (think Stanford/MIT/Berkeley) and entering my last year. Before this, I had been working for a few years in the SF Bay Area as a electrical engineer at a mid-sized tech company that made well known consumer devices (think GoPro/Fitbit/Roku) doing interesting work in both software and hardware. At that job, I was able eventually take on project lead/management role where I got to work across the company with hardware/software engineers and product managers.

Before that, I did my undergrad in EE at a top engineering school (similar caliber as my current grad school) with two summer internships in a big tech company (think Microsoft/Google/Amazon).

During my time in grad school, I was hyper-focused on getting my hand dirty on the CS side taking classes in data science, machine learning, and UI design/implementation, because I've hear a lot about how tech companies value a CS background when it comes to hiring PMs. Similarly on the MBA side, I've been focused on taking only coursework that aligns with common PM skills. For example, I've been taking courses in marketing and tech strategy with the hopes of getting an idea on how to find/evaluate user needs, conduct interviews, write user personas/stories, and think about product strategy. 

Because of a special requirement of my program, I could not recruit on my own to any summer PM internships. Instead the school matched me with a summer internship. Good news is that it is at another big tech company (think Microsoft/Google/Amazon). Bad news is that it is a data analytics/science internship (so no direct PM experience to work with).

Here are my strengths and concerns (feel free to comment on whether you agree):

Pros:

* Strong technical background and education

* Good hands on experience with building a wide range of technology (plenty of projects to show spanning 
electronics and software, even past patents from my work)

* Will have a CS degree

* Worked before at well known tech companies

Cons/Concerns (feel free to comment on whether you agree):

* Resume still looks too ""Engineer"" even with the MBA. Most of my accomplishments I can talk about are all technical.

* Lack of direct PM experience (no PM summer internship, which is the main way MBAs pivot into PM. Maybe could have done some part-time PM work at university start-ups but was too busy with coursework to take that on)

Plan moving forward (feel free to comment on whether you agree):

* Find a balance between my resume being too ""engineer"" vs too ""typical MBA"" (I know some tech companies get turned off by MBAs?)

* Find ways to take on PM-like responsibilities at my summer data analytics/science internship

* Find ways to network with PMs in my summer internship company

* Reading books that have been recommended to me about PM (Cracking the PM interview, etc.)

* Try to network with alumni from my school via Linkedin who are in PM

I know there are bigger tech companies that have a structure recruiting process for MBAs (Amazon's SPM and STPM roles come to mind).

However, I am more interested in trying to get into technical product management roles at smaller tech companies (Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, etc.). I have a feeling that these companies typically do not usually look for MBAs, but CS grads with previous PM experience.

What do you guys think? Are my concerns valid? Any comments or feedback is appreciated."

They casually asked me what my GPA was during the interview since I didn't have it listed on my resume, but the job requirement said nothing about having a certain minimum GPA.

I signed my offer letter at the end of March, and while it included some documents that I need to have for the first day in a couple weeks from now, it said nothing about a transcript. They haven't even asked me to undergo a background check either (which I think is a little strange, but could be explained since its an internship at a small company that requires me applying for Top Secret security clearance and maybe they think that if I'm willing to undergo that, they won't bother with a standard background check? Idk).

The reason I ask is that final grades release tomorrow, and I know I fucked up big time this semester. I'd really prefer them not know my GPA or grades now because it would probably raise some red flags. I'm hoping they won't ask at all, but my paranoia is getting the better of me right now.

I feel like most companies would have asked by now if they cared, but still. Since I haven't been asked for anything after the offer letter, I'm dreading getting an email within the next two weeks asking for it (among other things).

Internship 1 is on an android development team, working with Kotlin. Atmosphere is very laid back, everyone is around my age, seems like I would have a laugh working there. Its a small local agency. Not much support or structure for a junior, Im expected to teach myself as fast as possible. The guys who run it seem adept at business stuff, and would probably give me tips on how to run the business I'm about to set up myself.

Internship 2 is a more well established software engineering company (self described). They have 3 months of training for juniors, and a lot of the engineers are older and more experienced. They say they are more concerned with interesting problems than with money. They work primarily in C# and do business intelligence and business automation type stuff. They use UML and proper methodologies which Internship 1 don't. Office seems very quite and I probably wouldn't have much fun or get on with everyone as well. Though I feel I may become a better engineer working there.

My concern is that android Kotlin is transient and C# will serve me longer if I chose Internship 2, and I would become a better engineer as they do things the proper way and are more experienced.

On the other hand I think Internship one owners are beneficial to know, I would have more fun with the team, and I like the idea of being able to see what I'm building when working with android.

I almost hope I don't get offered Internship 2 so I don't have to decide :/

Thanks for the advice!"

8ifzxi,3,2018-05-10,Bringing on an intern with absolutely no experience - good idea or bad idea?,Power0utage,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/8ifzxi/bringing_on_an_intern_with_absolutely_no/,"**tl;dr: small business considering hiring an intern with absolutely zero CS/programming/scripting/development experience.  Trying to find out if it will be worth it for both of us.**

I recently met someone who will be graduating high school and pursuing a computer science degree. I asked them some questions about their background/experience and the overall theme was ""I have absolutely no experience with any sort of development, whatsoever, but I am really interested in learning.""

I was impressed by their soft skills \(very personable and friendly/seemed intuitive\), so I'm considering bringing them on board as a summer intern and am weighing the pros and cons:

**Pros:**

* Because they're a blank slate in terms of expertise, I could adapt the internship around our development needs
* Our company is small and needs help\*
* It would be fun to teach development to someone from the ground up

**Cons:**

* I have to imagine it will be a huge time sink. Basically, a chunk of my work day will be spent teaching. \*Again, we're a small company so we don't have a lot of time to spare.
* There's a potential that this person is just not cut out for programming.
* What if I'm a bad teacher and impart bad habits?
* **Here's the one that sticks out in my head:** what if they start developing and decide they don't like it? Isn't it somewhat suspicious that they have *zero* dev experience whatsoever \(even html/css\)? I got into programming because I like creating things and I had QBasic on my Windows 3.1 computer. Why haven't they taken any initiative yet?

I think that, if this were to work out right for both of us, it could be very valuable for the intern. The CS degree is going to teach the necessary stuff to make them a good programmer, but I have to imagine having some real world experience would also be a huge resume boon.

So I have a few questions:

1. Do you have any experience with ""blank slate"" juniors or interns?
2. What would a training outline look like? How deep do you go into the weeds?
3. What are the most important skills I can teach them?
4. What are the most valuable concepts I should teach them ‚Äì not necessarily quicksort or how GCC works since they're going to learn this at college, but things like version control, package managers, HTTP request/response, etc.
5. Homework/exercises/online courses/etc. that may help speed up the learning process?

Thanks for your advice!"
8ig06a,998,2018-05-10,I Worked at the Happiest Place on Earth,zmadel2,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8ig06a/i_worked_at_the_happiest_place_on_earth/,"Have you ever been to Disney World in Florida? Most people have at least been to the Magic Kingdom, the flagship park that puts out all the pixie dust that keeps people coming back. But have you ever been on the inside of that magic, making things happen?

Most people have not.

I was one of those magic\-makers at the Disney World Resort back in 2010. I had graduated with honors from Bemidji State University in Northern Minnesota after my fall semester, so I decided to finish off my college career by applying for the Disney College Program. For those of you not familiar with the program \(known as ‚ÄúDCP‚Äù or simply ‚ÄúCP‚Äù for short\), the Disney College Program is an ‚Äúinternship‚Äù opportunity for college students and recent college graduates. The reason I say ‚Äúinternship‚Äù is because the DCP puts college students in menial front\-line jobs so the parks can remain adequately staffed throughout the year. In most cases, these are known as Operations positions \(‚ÄúOps‚Äù for short\) because it deals with making the park operate smoothly and efficiently. However, most CPs don‚Äôt spend most of their time working for Mickey; most of it is spent having casual sex, drinking, and taking the party bus to downtown Orlando to any number of shady nightclubs.

Hardly what most employers would consider an internship, but it was fun.

If nothing else, I was getting away from most of the frigid Minnesota winter.

I received my acceptance notice from Disney in October, which was about two months before I officially graduated. From then on, everything I did revolved around the Disney Empire. I was obsessed. I re\-watched all the Disney movies I‚Äôd grown up watching. I watched POV videos of rides at the Magic Kingdom on YouTube. I met other CPs on Facebook. Together, we psyched ourselves up for the upcoming adventure we‚Äôd experience together.

Before I knew it, my graduation ceremony was over, I was the holder of a piece of paper worth approximately $80,000 in tuition and fees, and \(more importantly\) it was time to get to Florida. Wanting to have as much freedom as possible, I drove myself down to Florida\-\-about a twenty\-nine hour trip in all\-\-without fanfare. I stopped in Des Moines, St. Louis, and Atlanta before making my way down to Orlando. I stayed in cheap freeway motels like the Red Roof Inn, always doubting whether or not the bedding and towels were fresh. All too often, I found strange stains and hairs on the sheets, but decided to do my best to ignore them and just sleep. Most days, the driving wore me out enough so that I didn‚Äôt care.

After what seemed like weeks in the car, I arrived in Florida. I went through the DCP check\-in process, was assigned a housing facility \(Vista Way, voted the second\-easiest place to get laid after the Playboy Mansion\), and moved in. I also learned I would be working in Attractions at the Magic Kingdom, specifically the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. I would be a pirate guiding guests onto the ride, enforcing safety protocol, and controlling the ships as they moved through the water ride. It was going to be a fantastic winter indeed.

Over the next few months, my roommates, friends from work, and I did everything there was to do in Orlando. We started with all the free, safe stuff. Disney gives all their cast members \(employees\) free admission to their theme parks, so we utilized those excessively during our first few weeks in the program. There were fireworks, shows to see, characters like Mickey and Stitch to meet, rides to go on, food to try \(Dole Whip, so much Dole Whip\), and drinks around the world at Epcot‚Äôs World Showcase. But, as with all things, the novelty began to wear off. After the first month, we were tired of going to the parks. Not that we disliked it, but going to work outside of work was exhausting. So we decided to do exactly what intelligent college\-aged kids do.

We went out partying.

There was the House of Blues at Downtown Disney less than ten minutes from where we lived. There were buses that came to our apartment complex to take us to clubs in downtown Orlando. Plenty of lessons were learned on those buses. Let‚Äôs just say always check both sides of an attractive girl before you invite her back to your place. Sometimes that hot girl...is really a guy.

From there, we started seeing the rest of Florida. We went to beaches \(Clearwater on the Gulf, Cocoa on the Atlantic, Haulover in Miami\), we went to the Kennedy Space Center, we went to the panhandle, we went to the Florida Keys. Hell, we even used our cast member discount to go on a cheap Disney Cruise.

And we worked.

We worked a lot.

On average, I was scheduled fifty or more hours at Magic Kingdom pretending to be a pirate and avoiding reprimands and safety\-critical write\-ups. Basically, DisneySpeak for demerits. I didn‚Äôt mind the work, though, because I loved my job. I mean, despite the minimum wage pay, I was living the dream\-\-I was away from home for four months with absolutely no consequences, working in the Happiest Place on Earth, making money, blowing money, and having a great time doing it all.

Yo\-ho, yo\-ho, a CP‚Äôs life for me.

It was fantastic. The only part of it I truly disliked was closing the ride at night. It meant I wouldn‚Äôt get back to my apartment until the early hours of the morning, and it was downright creepy. The Magic Kingdom is a strange place to work to begin with. To get to work, you drive through the main gate to a backstage \(staff\-only\) area and park your car, then you walk in your costume \(uniform\) to a bus with your Disney ID, which a security guard scans, then you get on the bus, which finally drives you to the Utilidoors \(tunnels\) under the park. You walk into the Utilidoors and immediately sense something isn‚Äôt quite right. During the day, things are odd enough. The magic of Mickey and his friends is almost completely absent. Walls are stark white. Bright, fluorescent lights line the ceiling. Posters on the wall remind you to be safe. After all, ‚ÄúSafeD Begins with Me. No one gets hurt.‚Äù Offices are built into the Utilidoors, but they seem makeshift. Almost as if they could be vacated at a moment‚Äôs notice.

Almost as if they‚Äôre expecting something terrible to happen.

The only sense of Disney magic in the Utilidoors is when someone dressed as Rapunzel turns the corner and walks past you on her way to lunch.

And at night after I would finish closing the ride, my coworkers and I would walk through the Magic Kingdom to the Utilidoors, through the Utilidoors to the bus, and then back to our cars. But it was far too easy to get lost in those Utilidoors. I‚Äôve heard people refer to Disney World as the largest human trap built by a mouse. They aren‚Äôt kidding. There are maps in the Utilidoors, but they seem almost purposely vague.

The ‚ÄúYou Are Here!‚Äù star seems to cover half the map.

The ‚ÄúCoordinator‚Äôs Office‚Äù seems to be in three places at once.

The ‚ÄúMouseketeria‚Äù always seems to be a mile away no matter how certain you are you kept moving forward.

This is why I hated closing. This is why I avoided traveling alone in the tunnels.

Most days, I was fine. My coworkers and I would walk to our cars together, then go out to Perkins or Waffle House before returning to our respective apartments. But there were some nights that I had no option. I had to go to the bathroom. My coordinator needed to see me about something that kept me late. The last guest in the park needed to ask me questions, which delayed my departure.

Those were the times that I would brave the Utilidoors all by myself, always expecting someone\-\-or something\-\-to be just around the corner.

We used to joke about how strange the Entertainment cast members were. These were the extravagant, flamboyant, over\-the\-top people that were a dime a dozen, yet somehow all found each other at Disney World. They played Mickey and Minnie \(sorry, ‚Äúfriends with Mickey and Minnie‚Äù\), performers in shows, dancers, and autograph\-signers.

We used to joke about how they had probably been driven insane by their jobs and came to believe that they were actually the characters. Johnny actually turned into Mickey twenty\-four\-seven. Kate knew for certain that she was Snow White. And Disney, fully aware of the PR mess this would cause, kept them all locked up in the Utilidoors, just waiting for closing when they would be let out to prey on the CPs making their way home.

It was a joke, of course, but it didn‚Äôt seem nearly as funny walking through the Utilidoors at four o‚Äôclock in the morning.

Anyway, after four months of Disney, my program was coming to an end. I had survived the Utilidoors and everything else, but I still wanted more. So, like any well\-educated college graduate, I decided to apply to extend my college program through the summer months. I was accepted two weeks later and placed in a different location. I would now be working at Rafiki‚Äôs Planet Watch at Disney‚Äôs Animal Kingdom. I wasn‚Äôt terribly excited about that. Animal Kingdom \(or DAK for short\) has always been my least favorite park, and the Planet Watch always seemed so boring. It‚Äôs in the far back of the park beyond everything else. Guests need to take a rickety train from the back of the park through some backstage areas to get to a glorified petting zoo.

And that was where I worked.

At least the hours were better‚ÄîDAK closed everyday by five o‚Äôclock in the evening back then and rarely opened before eight o‚Äôclock in the morning. That aspect would be a welcome adjustment.

Sadly, none of my friends or roommates decided to extend their program, so I discovered that the DCP wasn‚Äôt nearly as fun after the first program was over. Sure, I made new friends in my new role, but that sense of comradery and friendship just wasn‚Äôt the same. There weren‚Äôt Utilidoors to brave at three in the morning, waitresses to abuse at Perkins, or children to yell ‚ÄúAhoy!‚Äù to. After the first month of my extension, I was more than ready to go home.

But I stuck it out. My parents had instilled the value of staying with decisions from an early age, and I guess that‚Äôs what kept me there. That and the fact that I had no other job to come back to in Minnesota, so this was as good as anything.

With only one week left in my program, I was closing down the Planet Watch at five\-thirty in the evening when my leader arrived. He told me that they needed me to help with a project in the kennels where the animals are kept backstage. Having no real choice, I accepted the task, hopped on a pargo, and drove to the kennels.

The kennel areas always gave me that same uneasy feeling as the Utilidoors. The buildings are the same stark white, are made of stone or metal, and have large numbers painted on them with the associated animal type. For example, ‚ÄúBuilding 16 Elephant.‚Äù The entire place seemed unnaturally sterile for a zoo, and there were rarely enough people around. The trainers were usually rounding up animals onstage \(in the park\), leaving the actual kennel area largely unattended. The silence of the place was uncanny. There I was in Disney World, and it was silent. No park music. No people. No voices. No radios going off. Nothing. Even the animals didn‚Äôt make a noise.

I pulled the pargo up to Building 15, where I had been dispatched, and walked toward the main entrance to the building. The door was propped open as usual, so this didn‚Äôt seem at all out of the ordinary to me. I walked inside and called out, ‚ÄúHello? Anybody here?‚Äù Walking around and seeing no one, I decided to wait a few minutes for their inevitable return. This sort of thing happened all the time at Disney regardless of where you worked. People were busy, no one communicated, and thus waiting ensued.

There was a large table in the middle of the room filled with unwrapped, half\-eaten Subway sandwiches and surrounded by metal folding chairs. It‚Äôs strange how backstage Disney World always seems so haphazardly put together like it could be packed up and moved at any second.

I took a seat at the table, put my feet up, and waited. I pulled out my phone, answered a few texts, made plans to go bowling after work at Downtown Disney, and played some games on my phone, completely losing track of time.

After forty minutes of playing around, I came back to reality and realized that the sun was getting gradually lower. Shadows were getting longer. Flies were picking at the uneaten Subway sandwiches.

And still no one had come back.

Annoyed, I stood back up and walked about the room. Even for Disney, taking this long was unheard of. That‚Äôs when I decided that I would give them five more minutes. If no one showed up by then, I would go back to my location, find a leader, and be cleared to go home. So, to kill the remaining time, I gave myself a tour of Building 15. It was a catch\-all area for animal food, storage, and small injured animals like birds and such. The layout of the room made everything easily accessible; you could see practically every kennel and storage area from the entrance to the building. It was very centralized.

Naturally, when I found a wall that had some give to it in the back of the building, I decided to push a little.

With some force, I pushed the wall further back, and it gave way almost immediately. The hallway formed by the movable wall revealed a door on my left side that led deeper into the back of Building 15. Deep inside, my gut told me no.

No, don‚Äôt do it.

But, being naturally curious, I did it.

I pushed the door back and stepped inside, closing the door behind me.

At first, I didn‚Äôt know what I was seeing. It was a room, sure enough, and definitely in one of the backstage DAK kennels. The walls were made of the same stone painted white. But in front of me was a sheet of glass that spanned from the ceiling to the floor. It was, for all intents and purposes, a glass wall. A metal table sat pushed against the wall with two metal chairs to accompany it. A metal door complete with a fingerprint scanner and intercom system was built into the glass wall on the left side of the table. I also noticed that there was another intercom on the metal table between the two chairs.

Then I realized what it reminded me of: a police interrogation room like the ones seen on television.

But why? Was this the mythological Disney jail?

I walked toward the table, trying to make sense of it. 

Inside the room beyond the glass was a daycare room. There was a small plastic play structure, blankets and pillows, a crib and mobile for babies, and books on the floor next to some blocks like toddlers play with. The ground, however, struck me as odd.

Instead of carpeting, it was metallic. Hay had been strewn about, but had become a hodgepodge from frequent movement. At one point, it may have been evenly spread across the floor, but now the true metal floor shown through in several spots. I wondered all the more what this was.

Something behind the glass moved.

Something was living in this room hidden away in the back of Building 15 behind DAK.

As it stood up, I noticed all too quickly what it was.

A human male, no older than ten years of age, completely naked. He stumbled a bit, rubbing his eyes, still coming out of his slumber. He looked around, his eyes wild. His dark, thick, curly hair was cut oddly conservative for his wild appearance. It seemed out of place. Dirt smeared his face, and he bent over as if he had a spinal issue. Most of all, though, there was something in those eyes I didn‚Äôt recognize for a moment. I later realized what it was.

He was feral.

His gaze was that of an animal. Behind him, something else moved, slowly standing up, apparently with great difficulty. This was a human female, probably around fourteen years in age. Her stomach protruded out as she turned to the side, and it was then that I realized she was pregnant. 

What, I wondered, could this be?

Looking down at the metal table, I noticed something new. There was a drawer beneath the table that pulled out. It was filled with files. Flipping through them quickly, I noticed that one file was in reference to a ‚ÄúChris‚Äù \(with quotations\) and one was in reference to a ‚ÄúPat‚Äù \(again with quotations\). Any cast member knows that Chris and Pat are the generic names for a cast member that has forgotten his or her nametag. But that wasn‚Äôt the files‚Äô purpose. Those names described the creatures I now saw in front of me.

And the purpose? It was written at the top of both files in large bold letters:

‚ÄúTo create a perfect fleet of cast members.‚Äù

I looked back up through the glass, wondering if it was one way or two way. Not waiting for an answer, I put my hand up to the glass and pressed it against the wall. ‚ÄúChris‚Äù turned, taking note of me for the first time since my arrival. Slowly, he made his way toward me. His dark blue, confused eyes met mine for a long moment, then he put his hand up to mine with only the inch of glass separating us.

Then he screamed. He screamed louder than I‚Äôd ever heard anything scream before. He beat against the glass, causing it to wobble slightly.

My heart shot up into my throat, and I immediately dropped the files and ran out of the room as fast as I possibly could. In my panic, I fumbled with the door I had foolishly closed. Throwing glances back to the glass wall as I struggled with the doorknob, I could see Chris jumping up and down and throwing himself against the glass. Finally, I was able to open the door. I ran through the main area of Building 15, back to my pargo, and high\-tailed it back to the zoom gates, where I could leave the park and get to my car so I could get the hell out of dodge. I didn‚Äôt stop to clock out, didn‚Äôt find a leader, just got the hell out. Once in my car, I drove as quickly as I could back to Vista Way, then ran to my room and locked the door twice.

I didn‚Äôt sleep all night. That‚Äôs the only way I know this wasn‚Äôt a nightmare.

I received a call from Disney Deployment the next day saying that I had not clocked out the day before. They also said my leaders needed to speak with me.

I asked what it was about, and they wouldn‚Äôt tell me.

I asked if I was being terminated, and they wouldn‚Äôt confirm or deny that.

Without any further consideration, I packed up everything I owned, got in my car, and drove back to Minnesota. I stopped only to sleep in my car once for four hours. Other than that, I drove straight through for twenty\-nine hours. 

I haven‚Äôt heard from Disney since, and I sure as hell haven‚Äôt been back there since.

I‚Äôm still not certain what to make of everything I saw. I still don‚Äôt know exactly what it was that I stumbled upon. All I do know is it scared me shitless.

We used to joke about how the Entertainment cast had been driven insane by their jobs and came to believe that they actually were the characters.

We used to joke‚Ä¶

Yeah, we used to joke."

8igke4,52,2018-05-10,The CEO of the company I work for threatened to fire me after I told him I would be pursuing another degree in addition to my networking degree. How do I handle this?,hANNAccat,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8igke4/the_ceo_of_the_company_i_work_for_threatened_to/,"I work for a small ‚Äòstartup‚Äô company (less than 20 people) in the space communications industry. I was brought on as a networking intern. When I was first hired, they promised me that they would be flexible and considerate of my classes, as I am a full-time information systems student. Also, they promised me that they would start me out at low pay ($12/hour), but that it would quickly go up from there.


Also, the company is so small that the CEO also acts as the day-to-day operations manager. So I directly work with him.
Also, some background on myself. I am currently an Information Systems student pursuing an Associates in Computer Network Communications and working towards obtaining my CCNA. Eventually, I‚Äôll continue my education and pursue a Bachelor‚Äôs.  Right now, I‚Äôm finishing up my 3rd semester and plan on graduating by the end of fall semester this year. 


The first months that I was there went smoothly. To begin, they assigned a small project for me to work on. The work was challenging, but I liked in and I learned a lot, I got along with all of my co-workers, etc. They were also very pleased with my work and decided to start giving me more projects to work on. But after 4 months or so, things started to change. 


After the project ended, I got assigned to other projects. I also started helping out other people with their work as well. Things at work seemed to be progressing well, and I was excited to be there. The CEO told me about an old server that they had that wasn‚Äôt being utilized. It sounded like something that would be a great learning experience and that I would have enough of an understanding to at least get it up and working. So I volunteered to help configure it. I quickly realized that I could not do this project on my own, so I asked one of my professors who happens to be a CCNP/network consultant to come in and give us some guidance. Based on what my professor told me and the input that I received from the CEO and other colleagues, I wrote up a plan. Once my plan was finished, I presented it to the to the CEO and he told me that this has already taken us too much time and that going forward with this plan will consume even more time that they can‚Äôt afford. I was so confused and frustrated. I will admit that my plan wasn‚Äôt perfect and that I could have done better, but it seemed like the CEO had completely made up his mind beforehand to not proceed with the server and then blamed it on me. After the meeting, one of my colleagues let me know that he thought the CEO was being hard on me and that he was being unreasonable, as I was only doing what I was told. I was so confused and disappointed. I started wondering if maybe I made a mistake going into networking.


After this, I became the scapegoat and was called out for every little mistake that I made by the CEO. He would single me out in meetings and embarrass me in front of my co-workers. He claims that it‚Äôs not personal and that it‚Äôs a normal thing in business. I was reluctant, but I took him at his word and hoped that his criticisms would stop eventually, but it only got worse. I started to dread going to work because I knew that somehow, I would be humiliated or lectured. Every little thing that I would do, set him off. Whenever he would do this, it would ruin my entire day. It feels like he‚Äôs just looking for any excuse to criticize me.


While this is going on, I began to explore other educational paths other than networking (possibly because of this experience?) While I enjoy networking, I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was something that I wanted to focus on. After lots of research, I realized that I would only take me one more semester to obtain my Associate‚Äôs in Web Development after I graduate with my Associate‚Äôs in Networking. It seemed like a win-win. I wouldn‚Äôt have to go for 2 more years to get a separate degree, but I would also be able to finish up my current degree without extending my graduation date. 


Once I reached this decision, I realized that I needed to take a second class in the summer so that I could take higher-level classes in the fall. When I realized this, I went to the CEO and let him know well in advance (keep in mind, summer classes don‚Äôt start for another 3 weeks). When I told him this he blew up. I honestly don‚Äôt remember much because my adrenaline was pumping, but this is what I can recall from the conversation.


I walked into the conference room where the CEO and one of my colleagues were working. The conference room leads out to the main office space, which is relatively small compared to most workplaces. So if someone is working in the conference room, you can hear everything that they are saying. I come in and I hand him a draft of a report that I had been working on. While I was there, I let him know that I would be taking a second class over the summer, but that it shouldn‚Äôt interfere with my work hours. He instantly got defensive. He asked, ‚ÄúWhy are you taking more classes??‚Äù I immediately knew that I had hit the switch and was overcome by dread. I responded, ‚ÄúUhh, well I decided to start working on my associates in web development, but I‚Äôm still working towards my degree in networking.‚Äù He started going on this rant about how irresponsible I am and that I‚Äôm not serious about my job and how dare I go into web development. Without missing a beat, he said ‚ÄúDo you even want to continue working here??‚Äù My heart was beating a million miles an hour, I was so surprised at his reaction. I would fully understand him getting frustrated at my schedule change, but to out right explode? I had no idea how to react. Tears started to well up in my eyes and I choked out ‚ÄúYes, of course I want to work here.‚Äù He continued by questioning by decision to even consider web development. ‚ÄúDid you even consider the job market, opportunities, salary, benefits??‚Äù At this point, I thought I was going to have an anxiety attack. I could barely even let out a coherent sentence to defend myself. I just said ‚ÄúYeah, of course‚Äù. I could tell he saw my weakness and he took advantage of this and told me that I‚Äôm a very confused person and that I‚Äôm not making good decisions in my life and that I would never be successful. I just shut down, I had no idea how to respond to this. I just kept quiet and waited for it to be over. 


This was all in front of my co-workers and I new that they heard the entire thing and I‚Äôm just mortified to even go back there after this incident. I‚Äôve been considering leaving for a long time now, but I was hoping to tough it out while I looked for other jobs.

That way, I can resolve the situation and leave knowing that I handled it professionally. 


How do I handle this discussion in a professional manner, even after all that has happened? Also, if anyone else has any further advice I would deeply appreciate it.

8igoy4,81,2018-05-10,The CEO of the company I work for blew up on me after I told him I was going to pursue a second degree in web development in addition to my degree in networking. How do I handle this situation?,hANNAccat,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8igoy4/the_ceo_of_the_company_i_work_for_blew_up_on_me/,"I work for a small ‚Äòstartup‚Äô company (less than 20 people) in the space communications industry. I was brought on as a networking intern. When I was first hired, they promised me that they would be flexible and considerate of my classes, as I am a full-time information systems student. Also, they promised me that they would start me out at low pay ($12/hour), but that it would quickly go up from there.


Also, the company is so small that the CEO also acts as the day-to-day operations manager. So I directly work with him.
Also, some background on myself. I am currently an Information Systems student pursuing an Associates in Computer Network Communications and working towards obtaining my CCNA. Eventually, I‚Äôll continue my education and pursue a Bachelor‚Äôs.  Right now, I‚Äôm finishing up my 3rd semester and plan on graduating by the end of fall semester this year. 


The first months that I was there went smoothly. To begin, they assigned a small project for me to work on. The work was challenging, but I liked in and I learned a lot, I got along with all of my co-workers, etc. They were also very pleased with my work and decided to start giving me more projects to work on. But after 4 months or so, things started to change. 


After the project ended, I got assigned to other projects. I also started helping out other people with their work as well. Things at work seemed to be progressing well, and I was excited to be there. The CEO told me about an old server that they had that wasn‚Äôt being utilized. It sounded like something that would be a great learning experience and that I would have enough of an understanding to at least get it up and working. So I volunteered to help configure it. I quickly realized that I could not do this project on my own, so I asked one of my professors who happens to be a CCNP/network consultant to come in and give us some guidance. Based on what my professor told me and the input that I received from the CEO and other colleagues, I wrote up a plan. 
Once my plan was finished, I presented it to the to the CEO and he told me that this has already taken us too much time and that going forward with this plan will consume even more time that they can‚Äôt afford. I was so confused and frustrated. I will admit that my plan wasn‚Äôt perfect and that I could have done better, but it seemed like the CEO had completely made up his mind beforehand to not proceed with the server and then blamed it on me. After the meeting, one of my colleagues let me know that he thought the CEO was being hard on me and that he was being unreasonable, as I was only doing what I was told. I was so confused and disappointed. I started wondering if maybe I made a mistake going into networking.


After this, I became the scapegoat and was called out for every little mistake that I made by the CEO. He would single me out in meetings and embarrass me in front of my co-workers. He claims that it‚Äôs not personal and that it‚Äôs a normal thing in business. I was reluctant, but I took him at his word and hoped that his criticisms would stop eventually, but it only got worse. I started to dread going to work because I knew that somehow, I would be humiliated or lectured. Every little thing that I would do, set him off. Whenever he would do this, it would ruin my entire day. It feels like he‚Äôs just looking for any excuse to criticize me.


While this is going on, I began to explore other educational paths other than networking (possibly because of this experience?) While I enjoy networking, I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was something that I wanted to focus on. After lots of research, I realized that I would only take me one more semester to obtain my Associate‚Äôs in Web Development after I graduate with my Associate‚Äôs in Networking. It seemed like a win-win. I wouldn‚Äôt have to go for 2 more years to get a separate degree, but I would also be able to finish up my current degree without extending my graduation date. 


Once I reached this decision, I realized that I needed to take a second class in the summer so that I could take higher-level classes in the fall. When I realized this, I went to the CEO and let him know well in advance (keep in mind, summer classes don‚Äôt start for another 3 weeks). When I told him this he blew up. I honestly don‚Äôt remember much because my adrenaline was pumping, but this is what I can recall from the conversation.


I walked into the conference room where the CEO and one of my colleagues were working. The conference room leads out to the main office space, which is relatively small compared to most workplaces. So if someone is working in the conference room, you can hear everything that they are saying. I come in and I hand him a draft of a report that I had been working on. While I was there, I let him know that I would be taking a second class over the summer, but that it shouldn‚Äôt interfere with my work hours. He instantly got defensive. He asked, ‚ÄúWhy are you taking more classes??‚Äù I immediately knew that I had hit the switch and was overcome by dread. I responded, ‚ÄúUhh, well I decided to start working on my associates in web development, but I‚Äôm still working towards my degree in networking.‚Äù He started going on this rant about how irresponsible I am and that I‚Äôm not serious about my job and how dare I go into web development. Without missing a beat, he said ‚ÄúDo you even want to continue working here??‚Äù My heart was beating a million miles an hour, I was so surprised at his reaction. I would fully understand him getting frustrated at my schedule change, but to out right explode? I had no idea how to react. Tears started to well up in my eyes and I choked out ‚ÄúYes, of course I want to work here.‚Äù He continued by questioning by decision to even consider web development. ‚ÄúDid you even consider the job market, opportunities, salary, benefits??‚Äù At this point, I thought I was going to have an anxiety attack. I could barely even let out a coherent sentence to defend myself. I just said ‚ÄúYeah, of course‚Äù. I could tell he saw my weakness and he took advantage of this and told me that I‚Äôm a very confused person and that I‚Äôm not making good decisions in my life and that I would never be successful. I just shut down, I had no idea how to respond to this. I just kept quiet and waited for it to be over. 


This was all in front of my co-workers and I new that they heard the entire thing and I‚Äôm just mortified to even go back there after this incident. I‚Äôve been considering leaving for a long time now, but I was hoping to tough it out while I looked for other jobs. Now I realize that it‚Äôs unhealthy for me to stay there any longer than I already have. I know that I must step away from this experience being the bigger person.  I‚Äôve already been there for 9 months and I don‚Äôt want to throw away valuable experience that I can put on my resume for future jobs.

I'm currently doing a marketing internship as part of my school program right now, so it's unpaid. At first I was really excited because I was learning a lot, but now I feel like all my work is stagnant. I'm not learning anything new recently and there's not always a whole lot for me to do either. It's very different from what I did in school (tbh, I liked doing what I did in school a lot more because we got to create whole campaigns instead of being just part of a part of a campaign). 

I don't know if I should ask to stay because I feel like in the end I may not be compensated well financially, and I don't learn a whole lot (at least not as of right now), and the environment is just ok. I don't mind the people I work with, but I don't love them either. 

Staying would definitely be the easier choice as I'll be graduating really soon and all my passwords/programs/emails are set up already. And I won't have to look for another place to work/already know the structure of the company. But I also want to work somewhere that gives me more tasks and allows me to grow more. 

Any advice? I don't want to not ask and then end up being unemployed, but I also don't know if it's worth asking.

I am a 22 Y/O that just graduated college last week. With this being said, I was hired by a large insurance organization to come on board in the mid June. My biggest concern with this lies within the background check HR is issuing next week.

A little background info: Over the summer going into my sophomore year when I was 19, I was arrested for misdemeanor trespassing being an idiot kid with a few other friends. Fast forward a few years to the summer going into my senior year, I interned with this same company I got hired with now. While being hired to be an intern, I had to complete a background check. A few weeks later after I completed the check, I received a call from HR stating that they had found the misdemeanor trespassing on my file. They asked if I could explain, and I told them that it was a stupid mistake I made when I was young. I still get hired.

Present: I am now coming up on this full time position background check, and for some reason, I am kind of freaking out. Do you all think that this background check is going to be more strict than the previous one? I'm not sure if its with the same company that pursues the checks or not. Are companies usually more strict on this kind of thing with full time employees than interns? I would just hate to lose this great opportunity. They have already paid for flights and accommodations to their HQ to train this summer. 

Additionally, I have not received any other charges. That misdemeanor is the only thing I have under my belt. 

I know I'm freaking out a bit reddit, but any two cents would mean a lot.

8iiuwb,0,2018-05-10,Question regarding short-term gig offer,ta69407,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8iiuwb/question_regarding_shortterm_gig_offer/,"Hi all. I've been doing part time front end work for free at a tiny startup. I'm probably stupid to work for free, but this was an easy way for me to cover the gap in my resume while I practice for interviews and look for a real job (I'm a recent CS grad).

Recently, this company offered to hire me full time as a freelancer for a set amount of money (haven't negotiated this yet because I don't know exactly what I would be getting into, and no benefits). This would involve a full time (40 hours a week, though honestly probably more) commitment over the next 3 months. 

I would be fully responsible for the back end development (from scratch) of a mobile app that would serve as the primary platform of this startup. There would be one other full time dev with me who's responsible for the front end. There are a couple part time people I could consult with for help, but I would largely be on my own.

I am familiar with the tech stack they want to use, but I have never worked on something of this scale before. I imagine that, if I accept, I'll be dedicating a lot more than 40 hours a week in order to produce something halfway worthwhile, especially considering I'd be the ""lead"" back end developer. I am a recent grad (&lt;6 months out) who hasn't worked as a software developer outside of an internship. 

What I am wondering is if this would be worth dedicating the next 3 months towards. The money is a secondary factor. Would I be more marketable towards future employers with this app under my belt? I graduated in the winter; should I fully focus on finding a more permanent job instead? I've been job searching since the end of February, applied to over 200 places and only received one offer from a consultancy (which I declined for a few reasons). 

Is this at all worth considering?"

8ijct1,612,2018-05-10,I just finished the last final of my college career. Here are some of the things I've learned over the past five years.,Neptune2284,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8ijct1/i_just_finished_the_last_final_of_my_college/,"**Academic**

* Don't freak out if you don't immediately love your major when starting out. I majored in criminal justice and for the first two semesters I was really unsure of my choice. But I decided to stick it out, and I'm very glad I did. 

* However, if you REALLY don't like what you're studying, don't be afraid of change! Do some research, decide what's important to you, and TALK TO YOUR ADVISOR. 

* Seriously, talk to your advisor. They're there to help you. If you're worried about a class, or need a change, a good advisor will have your back.

* Obviously you want to get good grades; that's a big part of college. BUT: Don't think it's the end of the world if you get a B-, or a C, or even a D in some cases. Take a breath. Calm down. You're not going to flunk out of college because of one bad grade. We've all had classes we struggle with (that was math and science for me). The important thing is that you try your best and don't let it take over your life.

* If you are having trouble with a class, like you're just not getting the material and keep struggling, talk with the professor! Most of them are more than happy to help you out. Also look for tutoring programs. I used one to help pass statistics and it saved my grade.

* While signing up for classes, if you know one of them is going to be more of a challenge, try to give yourself some breathing room. For instance, when I took statistics, I made sure all my other credits were criminal justice related because A) I knew that material well and B) they were more enjoyable. Spread out the misery, so to speak.

* Don't skip class unless you actually HAVE to, not because you WANT to. I shudder thinking back on how many times I skipped and what it probably did to my grade. Some classes, especially first/second year ones, also count attendance towards your points.

* I know the saying ""sleep is for the weak"" is popular, but don't take that to heart. Sleep is important. Putting off a project/studying for a test until the day before and pulling an all-nighter isn't going to turn out well.

* However, if you DO have to pull an all-nighter, try to get at least some sleep. Some people can run on three or four hours, others need more. Listen to your body.

**Dorm life**

I lived in a dorm for the first two years of college before getting an apartment. Here's some tips:

* Yes, ramen is cheap at first glance, but it's utter shit in terms of nutrition. It's also not as inexpensive as some people believe. A 10lb bag of rice, in the long run, will be much cheaper (and healthier!). Learn to use spices, even just basic ones. Here are some other cheap, relatively healthy foods and ideas:

1) Eggs

2) Fruits like bananas, oranges, etc

3) Potatoes

4) Frozen veggies

5) For breakfast: Oatmeal, healthy cereal, etc

6) Replace soda with tea, or even seltzer water if it's the fizz you miss. I've got a love affair with Safeway-brand orange seltzer now. Avoid energy drinks at all costs. They're 99% sugar and can wreck your body.

7) Seriously, learn how to season. A little bit of spice goes a long way. Cayenne, paprika, thyme, and garlic powder are some of my go-tos.

* Exercise. Even if it's just fifteen minutes a day walking, or a short jog, or doing a few reps of weights in your room. You feel 10x better and your body will thank you.

* It's easier to keep your room clean by maintaining a regular chore schedule than trying to clean everything up at once. 

* FFS, wear shower shoes/sandals. Communal showers are gross. Chances are some nasty-ass dude probably jerked it in there that morning. 

* If you've got roommates, be respectful. My first roomie and I were total opposites in terms of hobbies and habits, but we got along just fine because we respected each other, did necessary chores, kept the room clean, and was aware of each others' sleeping/studying schedules. Basically, don't be a dick.

* Try to be nice your RA's. I know some of them can be assholes (speaking from experience, I was one for a while) but they're just trying to do their jobs most of the time. Go to them if you've got an issue.

* Don't totally rely on meal plans if that's a thing at your college. Mine, if used as the college intended, would only get you one meal a day. Learn to cook basic stuff and you'll save a ton of money in the long run.

* Keep your goddamn music down, or wear headphones. Seriously.

* It can be challenging, or even downright scary to try and meet new friends, but at least give it a shot. I'm extremely introverted and it took a while to start meeting people, but it was worth it. Don't just hole up in your room all day.

**Work/school/social life**

* Working while going to school can be a blessing and a curse. The income is great, but if you're taking 18 credits at the same time it sucks. If you can, try to find a job with flexible scheduling. University/college jobs are usually really good about this.

* While it is possible to work full-time and go to school as well, it can SUCK at times. I did that this past year working midnight shift. There were a lot of days I was running off three hours of sleep. I also sacrificed any semblance of a social life. 

* The same guidelines above apply to internships. If you're having to bend over backwards and sacrifice your soul to make it work, you should ask yourself if it's worth it. 

* Sleep more than you study, study more than you party, and party as much as you can. It's a bit cliche, but it's true.

* You need to have a day or two off now and again to decompress. I've met people who dedicated themselves solely to schoolwork pretty much 24/7 and it wrecked them by the end of the semester. Conversely, think of college like a job. Do the work and don't slack off. It's all about balance.

* On the topic of parties: Be safe! Never leave your drink unattended. Have a sober driver, take an uber, walk, but under NO CIRCUMSTANCES DO YOU GET BEHIND THE WHEEL WHILE INTOXICATED. The same applies to any other illicit substances. Intoxicated/impaired drivers are the scum of the earth. Try to have a sober friend with you if you're going somewhere unfamiliar, or with people you don't know well.

* Have fun! College is supposed to be enjoyable. Don't torture yourself just because you think it's 100% about getting good grades.

* Mental illness is a big issue in college. Don't ever hesitate to get help if you need it, even if you don't think it's a ""big deal"". You wouldn't just tough out a broken leg or bacterial meningitis; don't treat your brain the same way."

I'll be a senior next semester and I haven't got anything to go for my resume except school work and one or two unimpressive projects, and whenever I get to the final stages of an interview, I think it goes well but I end up getting rejected. Over this summer I'll probably just take a small summer job at the library and study for the GRE or more interviews because I'm deadly afraid of graduating with no plan for the future. Even with this research, the professor takes a week or two to get back to me, and whenever I visit his office he tells me he's booked for the day and will email me specifics later, except now school's almost over and he hasn't given me a concrete plan of what I should expect. 

I guess as a lesson, I'd recommend if you're in Engineering to start looking for internships as soon as you can, even if you're a Freshman. I started looking as a spring semester Sophomore and it would've been better to have gotten way more experience. The only thing I can think of now is pushing off 'the real world' for grad school, but that's just more debt on top of what I already have, plus I'm not passionate about pursuing my degree (Computer Science) at the PhD level. 

Rant over, just feeling miserable and needed to vent this all out."

Would appreciate feedback on my plan:

-	go part time teaching
-	assist on projects in the ML research labs
-	work on my own projects to build a portfolio (I'm hoping to find real-world projects with actual clients)
-	apply for an internship or entry level role as soon as I have a few projects done (3-5 projects?)

My timeline is 1 year to get into an entry-level role.

Can this be done? Is this a good approach to gain skills and experience industry is looking for? Timeline reasonable? Should I abandon this idea as altogether and just go back to web devt?

More about me:
-	CS Bachelors, Masters in Information Systems
-	4 years as a web developer before I started teaching, but if I go back to industry would rather be in an area with a higher entry barrier (am I looking at this the right way?)
-	all the ML I've done so far is half of Andrew Ng's coursera course
-	I'm an extrovert so fairly strong at networking
-	likes long walks on the beach ‚õ±‚õ±"

This is my first ever job and I‚Äôm an intern for this great company where everyone is super nice and patient. They hired me knowing I did not have the most experience. 

The problem is that I‚Äôm 3 weeks into my job and I can‚Äôt do anything. I like programming but the language we are using is specific to this company and I‚Äôve only ever done basic stuff. I try and ask for help and people try to help but it gets to the point where I don‚Äôt even know what questions to ask. 

I feel like I just stare at my computer all day and I know I should be asking questions, and I do, but it seems everyone is busy and I don‚Äôt want to bother them. When I do ask, I either fumble my words trying to use the correct jargon (which I don‚Äôt even know is correct) or they give a vague response and I try to push and get a clearer answer but I never understand in the end. 

What I really want is someone to sit with me for an hour or two and just guide me because I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing or even where to begin. I feel like a burden on everyone. However, I don‚Äôt know who to ask or how to ask without sounding like I want to be given all the answers. I‚Äôm scared that the company will soon realize they made a mistake hiring me and I‚Äôm just so tired and overwhelmed and frustrated.

On top of that, it seems that everyone is coming to me for a small bit of help on their projects (like creating a test class or something for one of their classes), but the code base for each of these projects is huge and I don‚Äôt understand any of the code much less how to test it. I can‚Äôt even think of test cases because I don‚Äôt even know what the code is doing (white-box testing). 

The company is awesome though. I love the work environment but I‚Äôm scared people are going to start to dislike me because I can‚Äôt do anything. I want to be good at programming and help others out but I just cant right now. 

I have a meeting with my manager next week (monthly meeting) and I want to talk to him about this. He‚Äôs very nice and understanding but I just feel like such a waste of their time. 

I‚Äôm so tired. Everyone seems to know more about everything than me, even the newer interns

8il6mb,2,2018-05-11,Thinking about dropping out of graduate school and doing another undergraduate program,RadiantDare,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8il6mb/thinking_about_dropping_out_of_graduate_school/,"Hi everyone,

Basically, I've got a Bachelors in Science and am currently completing a Masters in Social Work. To be honest, I find the course to be boring, and really uncomfortable for a number of reasons.

After finishing my bachelors, I couldnt find a job in laboratories or research groups (Despite completing 3 internships at different labs), so I did social work because I want to help people but seeing the work being done I just want to get out.

I guess, I'm thinking of going into engineering now. It's technical, like Science, but it can be about helping people, sort of like social work, without all the emotional baggage. 

I guess, I just feel so stupid. I'm 23 right now and if I were to go into engineering, I would probably be 27-28 by the time I've finished and my resume is just going to look like complete shit because my previous volunteering/work experience was in medical labs, nothing to do with engineering. I don't know, I just feel like maybe I would be happier doing this, but if I'm in a room with people who just finished highschool, I feel like a fucking loser because I shouldve just done engineering at the start or something.

I don't want to reveal where I live, but there isn't any sort of like accelerated engineering Master courses or what ever, so it seems as though I would need to do the full degree.

Thank you for reading this, it really does mean a lot (and I hope I don't sound sarcastic, as I'm reading this back and it sounds like I am, which I'm not). In terms of advice, I guess I just want to be heard and want opinions on my situation because I have no one else to talk to.

First week soon done and this far it's going good. Im having no problems learning the ropes and the boss is super pleased with me. 
The only thing I'm struggling with is when other employees start's to discuss non work relating things. That messes up my focus. But other then that it's good. 

Internship is done in the end of may and after that I might get employment.

8imv83,2,2018-05-11,"Professionals and business graduates, can you please give me your honest opinion on this?",Hoanyelir,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8imv83/professionals_and_business_graduates_can_you/,"Hello,

I've recently graduated in Modern Languages in a small university in Italy. The quality of my education is below average but many people (fuck my parents, I'm talking about other adults, real world people) believe I'm fairly intelligent and that I can do a lot more. I volunteered in a number of projects, got to study abroad for a short amount of time and I have many interests. I'm 23 now and I need to start working, however. Never done an internship yet (we tend not to do them here in Italy but at 23 I feel like I can't take this as an excuse anymore).

My problem is that my experiences came in too late. I graduated in that course exclusively because I thought that it was the easiest and shortest way to freedom. I only wanted to get out from my little city and start working. Any job would have been fine. I had no prospect. I was dumb, I know.
I developed an interest for **entrepreneurship** and economics in general while following a crash course in web marketing, which I‚Äôm still attending right now (I graduated two months ago). It is poorly made but it introduced me to a number of concepts and well, perhaps my INTJ side finally is coming to the surface, who knows. I want to know how companies come to life, how they survive, how markets work and so on. Eventually I would like to found my own company, I have many ideas. Problem is, Italy is **not** a great place for young entrepreneurs and I don't have a lot of money to spare. Plus I'm scared that without the right knowledge, my chances of making it are significantly low.

This may sound like a giant excuse, but I feel like as I am now even if I started working for a company, **I wouldn't grasp the things I need to eventually be on my own**. I feel like I should get back to university and at least grab another bachelor, while keeping on studying and saving money on the side, trying to get people involved in associations and at least get some following in academic projects. All I did in the past years would be attending classes and burying myself in books. Again, I was dumb. Never again.

**My parents don't have a clue**. They work in the public sector. My mother probably never even wrote a CV, while the last my father wrote must have been in his 30s or something. I do not have a clue as to what I should do.

The thing is, I'm okay with gathering and categorizing knowledge from the web. Studying books on my own, trying to get a grasp of what it is that I have to do and everything. But I feel like I could spend some more time **right now** since I‚Äôm young rather than working full-time and spending a few hours in the morning to compensate for the lack of time.

I‚Äôm just scared that since I‚Äôm 23, getting back to university for another degree is a waste of time. I checked what MAs I could do and none of them really interest me. MAs in marketing require credits in economics which I don‚Äôt have, so I would waste a year to get those **anyway**. Might as well enrolling for a new bachelor this September at this point.

I met interesting people in this course, even people older than me, and only now I started to get a grasp of how tough the real world is. I feel like I‚Äôm really imprepared right now ‚Äòcause I don‚Äôt have any really useful skill. I don‚Äôt want to be just another employee. I want to change society, at least here in Italy. Again, I have ideas, but **I need to make them work and I need to know how to make money to make them work and make them become sustainable** (sooo many associations with people who don‚Äôt have a grasp of how economy works here, and they all happen to **scatter** as soon as the first difficulties come ‚Äì I do **not** want to be one of them). But I feel like even if I were to become good at something else and I would enter into a partnership with someone else (who would eventually have the role of managing money, finding new capital and so on) I feel like I would lose control of things. I‚Äôm scared of that. I will eventually need to trust someone ‚Äòcause I won‚Äôt be able to know everything of my company, but I feel like if I don‚Äôt know how to manage it myself, someone might take the upper hand someday.

**Sorry for the rant, but I really need some opinion with some adult. I would appreciate it if you were blunt with me. I need some honesty**.

**A huge thanks to anyone who will spend some of his time to write here**.

**Tl;dr**: please do read everything if you can, but here I go: humanities graduate out of desperation, I want to study economics and management to gather useful skills and get access to professional roles that will help me acquire the practical knowledge to found my own company. I feel like as I am now even if I start working, it will be significantly harder to do all this ‚Äòcause I will have to work full-time and study little by little every day, meanwhile if I were to dedicate the next few years to consistent studying (while perhaps allowing me some part-time job on the side), I would have a better foundation to move on and do shit. What do you think?

I had an offer lined up around January, but that fell through due to my boss leaving that company, and his new company not having any positions for a junior dev at the time.

I then lined up a second offer with a company I interned at before, and they were really enthusiastic about me.  However, just a couple days ago they contacted me saying upper management froze all open positions for an indefinite time.

However, one company I went and interviewed with just to see what was up, has sent an offer.  Its a consulting gig, essentially customers calls with a complaint about this particular software product we support, and we find out the issue.  We have access to see the source code, and its essentially finding where the error lies, which can range from networking problems, to some small slip up in the code.

I've had 3 software development focused internships.  Those offers were from said internships.  I've developed a fairly popular side project.  Our senior design project is going extremely well.  I've had 2 offers that went away due to unlucky circumstances, and I'm feeling like shit.  I'm debating taking this offer because its close to graduation, and I need the money to stay in my area.  I would still continue to look for jobs while at this position, and I have another side project in mind.

I'm just really worried if taking this position will make me look terrible to other people.  I don't have the luxury to keep interviewing much longer, I need the money to keep my apartment.  I've tried researching people who've been in my situation and can't find anything.  Does anyone have advice?"

I've been involved with both the Engineering Club and the Computer Club for the past two months, and I work an internship as a web developer. My end goal is to be able to go to grad school and obtain a Masters in Engineering. I've been keeping close with the university I want to go \(I'm in a state college\).

Are my  dreams over for me? "

I keep making mistakes and things keep getting fucked up. I haven't been able to actually start my experiments because of getting certain machines and things going wrong. I just feel that as time goes by and the more I have trouble getting data she gets more annoyed because she is paying me and I can't give her data. I wrote a review and a primary manuscript \(I'm 2ed author\) and I do paper reviews for her along with the post doc, but that's so minimal compared to getting data. The people in my lab..well..they are not that great. The PhD is super picky about everything, even when its not her business. When I was writing the review, she went to my PI to complain and say its not fair that I get to write and not her. If she is training me on something, she will tell me to hurry up and not explain why we are doing something and just follow what she did for her experiment. Every time I try to troubleshoot with the lab tech, she will just sit there or from her bench be like ""why don't you do this, its no big deal"". I do metabolism and she has a different focus, so I know what I need to take into consideration and I can't just do something without thinking about the effects of it on metabolism. If I make a mistake, she will always try to use that to make our PI see her in better light. I have only been here for 4 months for my actual masters and I did an internship before for 4 months. I just feel like no matter how much I read it won't be enough to know about my project, there will always be more and more. My PI said that during summer we have lab lunch and we will celebrate success \(publications etc\)...but I just don't want to go because I feel other lab members will get jealous or annoyed with me. I just wanna be alone at my desk. I just don't feel like I can make it no matter how hard I try. I feel like my boss is easier on the PhD because she has kids. She was allowed to not do anything but study for a course, but my boss got mad at me for wanting to study even though I wasn't doing anything that week and instead told me to read more papers. The PhD can get away with saying ""i don't know"" as an answer, but if I say it for anything then I'm told I'm not trying hard enough. I just feel so stupid that the PhD can get results and I can't fucking do anything without making a mistake. I just can't go on anymore. I just feel like no matter what I do, it will never be good enough. "

To those of you who are new and would want to know the full story, just click the word received above and it'll take you directly to the the first one. To make it short, I was fired and received or rather, stole an invitation (or at least I thought I did) that was misplaced on one of my boxes when I was fired. During the trip, several armed men and a scientist named Dr. Gru√´nb√´rg boarded the ship and announced that we were test subjects to a sick experiment by our government. 

I noticed that some of you have questions or corrections regarding the scientist's name. I decided to look for information regarding that and you were right, it is not a German name. I may have some thoughts regarding that, and I think that it could have been a made up name or as one user pointed out, I misheard it. The accent however, sounded like German, but I can't really tell much of a difference between accents and am basing it off from movies. 

Another user also pointed out that the experiment could have been more effective if the doctor didn't reveal that it was ordered by the government. This part would elaborate on that. 

I do apologize for not posting this the day after but I had to take some break and recuperate before continuing with an update. 

I also happened to notice someone following me since the story got published here and I had to lay low a bit, just in case my suspicions were correct. Anyways, let's get on with the story.


-------------------------------------------------------------


The man in black roughly grabbed my arm and escorted me towards the exit. It was difficult to walk around without stepping on any corpses so the man ordered to escort me had to tighten his grip around my arm to make me move faster.

While I was being escorted, I nearly tripped over the body of a woman riddled with bullet holes. I managed to stay on my feet but slipped on a puddle of blood afterwards, taking the man with me falling on top of a tangle of corpses. All he managed to say was *fuck*.

I fell on top of the woman's body and fought back the urge to vomit after seeing one of her eyes gone and the other almost falling out of its socket. Her left cheek was nearly gone and her blonde hair seemed to be scarlet due to being covered by blood. The state of the whole area and the corpses were nearly the same, with some being worse than it looked. 

The man lost his shit and knocked me out with the butt of his rifle.

I don't know how long it was but once I woke up, I was met with a massive headache and a sharp pain at the right side of my head. 

Damn it. I was covered from head to toe by dried blood and what looked like guts. I headed to the bathroom and took a shower without bothering to take my clothes off.  

After I showered, I chanced a glimpse at the mirror and saw the spot he hit me already turning black, and my right eye swollen but not enough for it to be swollen shut. I dressed up and just sat at my bed, staring at the wall in front of me, flooded with thoughts about the whole event.

A knock on my door brought me back to reality.

""Open up."" a man's voice said. It was followed by a hard knock and after a minute, I decided to open it. It was the man in front of me back at the line. He seemed okay except for his left eye. It was just black, save for his pupil, which was red. The first thought that came to me was that something behind his eyes were damaged from the commotion, then I noticed it. The left side of his face was covered by black veins, spanning from his neck up to his forehead. 

""The doc wants everyone in the dining area for some observations."" he says. 

I nod and follow him. The whole dining area was spotless. It was just clean, with no traces of blood anywhere, save for the bullet holes on the wall and some parts of the floor. 

Gru√´nb√´rg suddenly speaks from the stage. 

""Welcome, my dear lab rats."" he says, ""I have called you in for today to examine and perhaps observe the effects of the drugs on you, and it seems like some of you are already showing them. Fantastic.""

I look around the room and see that while a lot of people died from the shooting earlier, there are still a considerable amount of survivors left, and more than half is exhibiting symptoms or the effects of the drug. *Just what is this drug?* I thought.

""Ah, I see some of you are curious as to what this drug is."" Gru√´nsb√´rg says, scanning the room and finally meeting my gaze, ""To be frank, it was engineered to control any aggressive behavior that a human might feel.""

""Are there any unintended side effects?"" a woman's voice shouts from around the room.

""None that I have observed, but to be honest with you, this drug has only been tested on hamsters and monkeys."" he says, beaming with pride and something that seemed like excitement. 

""That is why you're all here. You see, you are the very first human trials since its creation."" he adds.

*Fuck*

We're the first ones. What type of sickos would do this to innocent civilians?

I must have dozed off for a few seconds because the only thing I caught in the doctor's monologue was: ""--what we're about to find out in this very instant.""

As if on cue, the man that called me out of my room suddenly falls over and have an epileptic seizure. Some of the other survivors do the same and a few seconds later, they stop and lie completely still.

""Magnificent. There's a side effect."" he says, ""The drug seems incompatible to some of you. It was a rather troublesome effect during the test runs on the animals.""

""Then what about the rest of us?"" the same woman's voice from earlier asks.

Is this woman a reporter of some kind? Or is she just simply curious?

""I'm assuming that the rest of you are either immune or the drug has fully worked on you, and I say, a congratulations is in order."" he says.

""But after we examine all of y--"" he adds but gets interrupted.

A guttural scream suddenly emanates from the seemingly dead man next to me. Suddenly, he rises with such energy, as if his adrenaline suddenly kicked in and he glares around the room, finally settling his eyes on a petite woman at the corner of the room, to whom I assume would be the one asking the questions earlier.

""YOU!"" he shouts, ""YOU TALK TOO MUCH YOU STUPID BITCH I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!"" 

He runs full sprint to the woman and tackles her to the ground. There was a sickening crunch and a shriek that followed as he suddenly tears the woman apart, limb from limb, like a bear to his prey. A huge silence follows until some of the people we thought had died rose and did the same thing to the people near to them. It was as if they were possessed, with some trying running towards the room and crashing their heads into walls, some laughing their heads off, and some just sob uncontrollably on the floor.

Gru√´nsb√´rg orders his men to open fire to the most aggressive ones but was disheartened by the sight of the others who were shot just rising up again and attacking them, angrier than they could ever be. 

I spent no more time in the room when three of them runs toward me, screaming obscenities and what they'll do to me. I broke out into a full sprint to get out of the room and found myself on the ship's deck.

I had no time to lose so I closed the door on them and felt relief. That was until I heard the thudding behind the door. The hinges giving almost giving way. The thuds grew louder and louder and suddenly  turning to cracks, as if they're just trying to force the door open, regardless of the state if their bones.

""OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!""
""LET US OUT!""
""GIVE ME YOUR MEAT!""

I soon found myself with nowhere else to go except the open sea. There were no nearby islands and no other ships in sight, but I thought that dying in sea is better than dying from the hands of these people. I do hope that I could find some lifeboats in this ship.

I tried to collect myself and looked around.

*Damn*, no lifeboats in sight. These sick fucks ensured that no one would escape. 

Suddenly, the door that used to keep me apart from the people inside flew off its hinges and moments later, the once surviving passengers of the ship poured out the doorway into the deck, staring at me. Those in front have their arms bent in impossible places while some have no arms at all.

""Fuckyoufuckyoufuckyou""
""Killkillkill""
""HungryAlwaysHungryhungry""

*Fuck this* I thought. I took one of those plastic beach chairs on the side of the deck's pool and just threw it out to the side of the ship and jumped after it.

The waves were hard to counter but I luckily grabbed on to the chair, took my shirt off, and tied myself to it before eventually passing out.

A day or so later, I woke up on the deck of a passing cargo ship, saying that they found me floating and lucky to have stayed afloat. 

I never knew what happened to the cruise ship and its passengers or Gru√´nsb√´rg himself, nor if the experiment was indeed conducted by the government or was just a ruse by that doctor.

Yesterday, I did manage to meet my old supervisor at the grocery store and he told that he'd been fired for no reason. He also managed to tell me that one intern might have screwed up by accidentally putting a free ticket to a first class cruise around the world. He thinks that the ticket probably belongs to the higher ups and taking it would be the greatest fuck you he would ever give to those sorry fucks.

He showed me the ticket and I was hit by a wave of nausea. It was set to leave tomorrow."

I didn't get an internship like my classmates, I didn't get to do the on campus college life stuff, but none the less, I made it through. Sure, I'll be paying the house payment that is my student loans for the rest of my life, but they say this degree is worth it.

8iry6m,106,2018-05-11,My Thoughts on the Application Process as a CS Major,MyLifeIsAgony,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8iry6m/my_thoughts_on_the_application_process_as_a_cs/,"Hey guys, I'm currently a HS senior who applied to several schools for computer science and thought that I would make this post to help future CS applicants (since a lot of you guys seem to be CS applicants). 

**Disclaimer:** I'm only a high school senior so you may want to take my thoughts with a grain of salt and everything here is purely my own observations and opinion (though I would say that I have done an extensive amount of research).

**A little bit about me:** I'm an Asian male living in California with high test scores and GPA and relatively OK extracurriculars (a few internships, nothing big). I was accepted to UC Berkeley (Cal), UCLA, UCSD, UCI, UCSB, UIUC, Cornell, and UMich. I was rejected from MIT, Stanford, USC, and Georgia Tech. I was waitlisted at Princeton. I'm currently committed to Cal.

Alright, on to actual content :)

**Prestige (Top overall schools vs Top CS schools):** CS is one of those majors where there isn't a lot of overlap between top overall schools and top schools for CS. A good amount of top CS schools are public schools and/or schools that aren't very high in undergraduate rankings. Even Carnegie Mellon, one of the  ""Big 4"" CS schools, isn't known for much other than their CS program. However, CS (and the tech industry in general) is a field where overall school prestige is largely irrelevant. In my opinion, you shouldn't factor in overall school prestige too much when deciding between colleges if you're set on majoring in computer science. Additionally, just about everybody I've talked to, including employers and students, say that after the first job, where you went to school doesn't matter. However, graduating from a good CS school will help you get a good first job. Of course the average person will see the higher ranked undergraduate school as more prestigious (including many of us here on A2C) and thus the obvious choice, but employers will know the top CS schools and won't scoff at a ""mere"" state school degree.

**Tuition, debt, loans, etc.:** Of course this is dependent on family situation, but most of the time, the rule of thumb is to choose a school where you won't have to take any loans. However, CS is one of the, if not the, highest paying majors for graduates straight out of college. In this sense, I think it's definitely worth it to take a reasonable amount of loans if it means going to a top CS college as opposed to a relatively unknown CS college. Of course if the difference in ranking is small, then choosing the cheaper option would probably be the right choice.

**Location (Importance of Silicon Valley)**: Location was a huge factor in my decision. Of course factors such as weather, urban vs. rural, etc. matter, but more importantly for CS majors, Silicon Valley should be a huge deciding factor. Silicon Valley leads the tech industry and going to college in close proximity to Silicon Valley is invaluable in terms of the internship and networking opportunities it provides, especially if working in a startup is a goal. I personally talked to a hiring manager at Google and the CEO of a small (&lt;20 people) but successful startup and asked them about their opinions regarding college. The hiring manager at Google (and I believe this is applicable to almost all big companies) said that as long as your school is ranked relatively high (in either CS or overall rankings), then Google will probably be present at career fairs. However, for the small startup, the CEO told me that he pretty much exclusively hires from Stanford and Cal. One thing that stuck out to me is that he said that ""I may not always make the right decision, but I'll never make a wrong decision"". For him, there's no reason for him to hire from schools outside of those with the best CS programs. Even though there may be bright kids from slightly lower ranked CS schools, such as Cornell or Princeton, due to the small size of his company and his relative lack of resources, there's no reason to take anything but the best. Small startups don't have the resources to recruit far away and will pretty much exclusively recruit locally, especially when two of the best CS schools in world are situated so close. With that being said, it's still definitely possible to work at a startup in Silicon Valley straight out of college without going to school in/near the Valley, it'll just be more difficult. Of course this applies for locations other than SV. For example, if you want to become an analyst on Wall Street, going to school on the East Coast would probably be the smarter choice (especially since the East Coast is more acquainted with East Coast schools and seems to care more about prestige than the West Coast).

**Berkeley EECS vs. L&amp;S CS (B.A. vs B.S.):** In terms of employment opportunities, though many people say the two are the same, I think that a B.S. does hold a slight edge over a B.A. when looking for jobs straight out of college. The hiring manager at Google told me that he thought a B.S. was slightly better (though the startup CEO told me that he didn't even look to see if the degree was a B.A. or a B.S.). However, this slight edge is insignificant enough (especially since in CS, your own accomplishments such as internships, research, projects, etc. matter a lot more) that I don't think it should be too big of a factor. With that being said, I recommend that people choose depending on their own goals and the strength of their own application. If you have interest in EE, then by all means, apply for EECS. Conversely, if you want to double major in CS and something else, apply L&amp;S. However, if you're only interested in software, I highly recommend that you apply for L&amp;S. If you believe yourself to be at the top of the top in terms of CS applicants (ie 4.0, perfect or near perfect SAT/ACT, papers published, leadership, national distinctions such as AIME, etc.) and are in state, then I think EECS is the better choice since you don't have to deal with the GPA cap. However, if you are even slightly below the top (such as me with only high GPA and test scores), then I think L&amp;S is a smarter choice. Even though I was probably competitive for EECS, I applied L&amp;S just to ensure that I would be accepted to Cal. One of my friends, who was also in the top 1%, had a near perfect SAT, had a paper published, is the president of 2 clubs, and had national level awards, was waitlisted from EECS. If you're smart enough to be at or near the top of your class and have coding experience on top of that, then as long as you work hard, the 3.3 shouldn't be too much of an issue. I only know one person who was unable to declare CS and he cheated his way through high school and probably shouldn't be at Cal anyways. However, if you aren't exactly a top applicant, then it's up to you whether you apply to L&amp;S or EECS. In my opinion, apply EECS if you absolutely must major in CS (though know that your chances of being accepted are slim) and apply L&amp;S if you would be fine doing another major (Cal just released a new major, Data Science, which could be a good alternative).

**Ending notes and why I chose Cal:** With everything considered, I think the most important factor is ""fit"". Even if one school is ranked much higher, if you can't see yourself being there for 4 years and would much rather be at another school, then choose the lower ranked school. The ""intangibles"" such as weather, food, culture, etc. are also important factors that many top applicants disregard that I think are highly important when choosing a college. Because of this, I think it's absolutely essential to visit a college before even considering it. When it came down to it, I was debating between Cal and Cornell since they're both top CS schools, but very different in terms of school experience. Even though Cornell is a prestigious Ivy and a private school with a lot of resources to offer, I ended up choosing Cal. For me, Cal's proximity to Silicon Valley was invaluable, especially after visiting a few startups and realizing that I would much rather work in a startup than a large company, and it was also the cheaper option (which my parents liked). I also chose Cal because they offer less hand holding and student support. While this may sound counter intuitive, I believe that the independence and self sufficiency that Cal forces you to develop are absolutely essential in a competitive environment such as Silicon Valley and I wanted to get used to it, especially since my current personality is rather introverted, not very motivated, and not very ""go getter"".

I'm a junior ece major and just finished my first co-op rotation. I learned a lot about working in a real office environment, dealing with co-workers, and meeting deadlines. However the experience has left me somewhat feeling somewhat empty. Like I did all this work to get into an engineering program, then grind through these college classes, and this is it... somewhat anti-climactic.

 Perhaps it is because I did not enjoy the internship as much as I would have liked. I wanted to do embedded systems/firmware development but ended up working in the testing department where on a good day I am updating firmware test scripts or soldering components that broke off old circuit boards back on, and bad days I am performing maintenance on old PCs or organizing materials. Definitely not ideal, but I am hoping a lot of it is just because I was a new intern. 

Despite this, I wonder even if I got my ""dream job"" I think that I would still want to learn and grow and advance in the field, and I worry that will not happen. I see some guys who have worked in this department in the same role for decades and think how unsatisfied that would make me. 

I'm now considering going to grad school and getting a PhD. I really enjoy learning new things in the field and working on personal projects, but the thought of going through all that school and work and being broke does not interest me much. However I figure if it means I can get a job where I will feel like my work is important it may be worth it? I am honestly feeling somewhat lost and could use some advice.  "
8is8p9,2,2018-05-11,Teach English abroad vs. get a full-time job,TonyPajamas72,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8is8p9/teach_english_abroad_vs_get_a_fulltime_job/,"So I am graduating in June with a marketing degree and am really trying to figure out the best option moving forward. I have a good amount of experience from over 2 years of internships with corporate companies and an agency, and I'm really happy with where my resume and digital portfolio are right now. The last few years have been pretty depressing honestly, and I definitely need a change of pace/scenery in my life. I've taken the whole career/school thing pretty seriously, but there's definitely a sense of adventure and social happiness missing from my life. I basically have 2 options right now: try to get a really cool job at an agency in a new city or teach English abroad. Let's go over the options:

1) Get a job in an agency in a new city: There are some REALLY cool jobs out there, if I can land a job in the music/events industry that would be amazing. Or just a vibrant, upbeat agency with an enjoyable work environment. Living in a new city would give me a sense of adventure, and I would most likely not have a hard time meeting some cool new people. This option would also be great for my career, and would teach me A LOT about different industries and different areas of marketing.

2) Teaching english abroad: I've wanted to travel extensively for soo long but have been kind of tied down with internships and responsibilites the last 2-3 years. This is a great time to take an opportunity that I might not have again in my life. I also think I'd love the teaching aspect of it, I wanted to be a teacher originally for my career and will most likely end up teaching college classes towards the end of my career. This would be a great way to figure out how much I actually love teaching and immerse myself in a new culture. I'd most likely be looking at South Korea, China, Thailand, or somewhere in Asia. I'd be open to other regions as well! I just don't know when else I'd be able to do something like that. I would be open to other ways to travel as well, it doesn't need to be teaching. That being said, I would definitely take the teaching job seriously if I did go that route and not just use it as an excuse to travel.

An important note is that my current agency internship is encouraging me to work part-time for them remotely in the future (mostly blog writing and social media management/ads), so I could still keep up with marketing trends and avoid the ""post-graduation resume gap"" that everyone seems so afraid of. I don't see a reason why I couldn't pick up additional remote marketing gigs for some part-time work while abroad as well if needed. Also, if I could land a marketing gig in a different country that would be the 100% ideal scenario, but I'm not sure how realistic that is this early in my career.

I've already sent out my resume to some places and am waiting for replies, I'm honestly being pretty picky with jobs right now but I know I kind of have to be at this point in order to be happy.

I realize it's pretty hard for people online who don't know my full story to give me accurate advice, but if you have any advice from experience that would be awesome, thanks!"

I was able to get an internship and was contemplating whether to retake some classes before I graduate in December 2018. I am currently sitting at a 3.359 (**Major GPA**) since I only took major classes at the University. I took all my core, free elective and some intro CS classes at CC and ended with a GPA of 3.56. Of course my GPA did not transfer and transcript reflects 3.359. I have 1 C+ and 3 B- but the rest are B or above. I am only taking 2 classes in the fall so I have the choice of repeating classes. Is it worth it? Goal is to get an internship during the fall or get an possible extension from the company I will be interning  at. The classes I have left are OS and Automata Theory from what I have heard they are one of the harder classes in the degree plan. If I get Bs I should still be above 3.3

Not sure if I'm just not super confident in myself, or if I should really be hesitant to put a language on my resume unless I'm familiar enough to code a full application with it.

I have experience in Java and VisualBasic, both from Intro classes. I can perform some basic functions with each and could almost certainly read basic to intermediate code in either language. I'm taking Codecademy's free course on Java to boost/refresh my understanding, and plan to do their course on Python + do some workbooks for it.

By contrast, I am exceptionally familiar with HTML and CSS, and have a pretty solid grasp on Javascript. I wouldn't say I'm a web developer that's gonna throw together SquareSpace quality sites, but I more than understand how to code and read those languages.

I'm looking at IT positions in the Cybersecurity, Sysadmin, and Network Admin fields, so I realize that knowing these languages might not be central to the job, but a lot of internships I'm looking at ask for coding languages ""as a plus"". How confident should I be before I put these things on my resume?

I dont know what to do, should I drop out of college or should I continue? I dont have the courage to drop out because I dont know what else will I do. I have been depressed since childhood. I am afraid of every person and I cant fucking talk to anyone. Everyday I think about suicide but cant do it because my parents would be devastated.

I belong to a middle class family, I hate to take money from my parents\( I live away from home\). I dont wanna tell them about my being detained once again.

Start taking tutions. I was a good student and remember most of the concepts. I can easily teach 12 grade level Maths and Physics.

Find an internship in programming. But apparently I cant because you need projects and all I have done is solve problems/competitive programming in C\+\+ and Python. And I stopped doing programming to prepare for GATE in Computer Science.

Try for a goverment job, IAS, PCS, SSC, Bank PO anything. Maybe I could crack some exams but I dont like these jobs as they involve public dealing. And I like programming.

Continue preparing for GATE. But I don't know if I could explain this 2 year gap tocompanies or even colleges. And I have little to no chance in PSU because my branch is electronics and many PSUs in CS want graduates in CS.

Today I went to the job fare at school and talked to the companies that were present. Since I'm passionate about Mobile development I was planning for sometime in doing my internship in Android. There was only one company who were looking exclusively for Android developers. They were interested in me and said insisted to sign a 12 month contract there itself. I was a bit hesitant and they gave me a 1 week time to decide. They said there are getting a few interns (1 or 2?). So, not much vacancies.

Majority of the listings were for web developer positions. Even though the main language I did was java I have worked with PHP, SQL, MongoDB, C# etc during various web dev projects. Many of these companies said that a basic understanding of these is enough and what they were looking for is people with ability to learn new things and correct attitude etc.  So, I got a offer from one of these  companies as well. 

It has a lot of alumni from my school and everyone is telling me that this is the better offer. They say that web dev stuff has more job security and I will be pigeon holing myself if I choose to do my internship in Android only. I live in South Asia and perhaps that's the reason for Android dev positions being rare.

I've been struggling alot with severe depression and frankly I've made a lot of terrible choices at college. It looks like I will be graduating on-time, which is good. I think I'm going to have to re-take a class I took this semester, next semester. Apart from that, I don't have any outside experience or contacts, and I'm currently a rising junior. Neither do I have an internship this summer.

It looks terrible and I've sort of accepted that, but what can I do to fix this? I plan to take most of the software engineering electives and courses in my junior and senior year, as I understand that taking any 'hot' electives like ML or AI are practically useless unless I plan to pursue a masters in said 'hot' subject. I can instead do networking, or architecture or cybersecurity, but I don't have any real motivation or understanding to do any of these and so I've sort of left it to the side due to the fact that companies in these sectors do not generally sponsor newgrads or those who cannot get security clearances.

My Plan:




**Summer 2018(this summer)**

* Microsoft's Entry Level Professional Software Developer Online Course(which comes with a capstone project which hopefully I can add to my resume since this course is very new)
* Read CTCI and practice DSA
* Additionally I may be exposed to some actual SE if someone I know decides to include me into their project.

**Fall 2018:**

* Operating Systems Class

* OOP class in C++/Java(not sure which)

* Introduction to Computation (inductions, proofs, etc..)

* Participate in Hackathon

**Spring 2019:**

* Algorithms

* Software Engineering (has a self-defined project)

* CS writing class (mandatory)

**Fall 2019:**

* Compilers

* Advanced SE 1

* Formal Language Theory(or intro to sec)

* Hackathon again

**Spring 2020:**

* Information Systems

* Advanced SE 2

* Could take project management but since its the last sem, don't want to overload

There are career fairs that take place every semester which I will go to as well.


Does this look OK? During the summers that I don't end up getting internships I will learn things like front-end dev(HTML/CSS/JS with nodejs and express) and practicing interviewing and building small tools or webapps to serve a purpose. Is there anything else that you think I should do? Any personal projects aside from the kinds I mentioned?"

First of all I know its a wrong sub\-Reddit but who could give me better advice than UNSW students? 

So, here we go. I am in quite a difficult situation. So, I finished my bachelors in Civil Engineering from UNSW last year \(Nov 2017\). During industrial training in last year of study , I realized that I was not enjoying the work. So i decided to change the stream and apply for second bachelors degree in software engineering. I wanted to do software initially but due to some reason, I didn't enroll in the degree.

After studying for 4 years at UNSW I am saturated with it and tired of the everyday travel as well \(especially Central to campus and back\) . With the light rail construction, traveling is worse than before.

So I lodged the application with UTS as my first preference , UNSW as second followed by USYD.

Yesterday, I was looking for software engineering reviews at UTS on whirlpool forums and here on reddit as well. I came across so many posts and comments indicating that education quality of UTS is poor and sub\-par compared to UNSW. A lot of posts are old though and I don't know the current situation.

I know UNSW is one of the best universities in Australia, especially in computer science. I have received an offer from UTS \(in this round\) and I believe I would get one from UNSW and USYD as well in next rounds.

I have a few doubts in my mind:

1\) Is it worth going to UTS for software engineering? especially if you can get into UNSW or USYD as well?

2\) is UTS education really sub\-par compared to UNSW or USYD?

3\) does 'university' have an effect on job opportunities?

4\) Also, what are your views on the diploma of professional practice? The 1 year internship thingy.

I really want to study at UTS this time as it is closer to home and part\-time work. Also, because of I am saturated with UNSW. But all these posts are driving me crazy.

Received offer from UTS. Found that UTs education is poor and sub\-par. Most probably will get offer from UNSW as well. Confused. what to do.

course rigor is very high but Grades not that strong: all As in freshman yr, 2 Bs sophomore year (AP world, and pre-calc), expecting 3 Bs junior year (AP Calc AB,Calc BC, and AP Chem)     so overall GPA will be around a 4.1 and class rank will be ~120/900  do you think I should take some summer classes or Dual enroll to raise the GPA by a little? 

rec letters will prob be decent and I am a strong writer so essays will be good as well 

ECs
published research paper, camp intern, teaching others SAT tips in a class, founded international reach non profit, created project to benefit charity, research in a lab, published writing articles in various media, private tutoring, all honor societies(not much involvement though)), beta club, few HOSA statewide awards last two years (not top 5)

Thank you so much I appreciate the help. any suggestions for Ecs and grades are welcome as well as well as college suggestions"
8ixsrp,2,2018-05-12,Best way to learn OOP coming from procedural programming?,bobbertnobbert,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8ixsrp/best_way_to_learn_oop_coming_from_procedural/,"So far the only real experience in programming I've had has been C and C#, and while C# is technically OOP, I basically just used it like a procedural language.  Currently, I don't really 'get' the concept of OOP, I understand that a 'struct' in C is similar to an 'object' but that is the extent of my knowledge. 

I recently got an internship and during the interview they asked me if I knew Java, I responded honestly that I had no experience with it.  They still gave me the job but told me I need to learn Java.  I've tried to go through a udemy course on Java but it's tailored towards complete coding beginners and it's a pain to drudge through the boring stuff.  I'm looking for a course/book/whatever to help me learn OOP without having to go through all the basics again.  Preferably something that is project based because I'm more of a hands-on learner.  Language syntax isn't really something I'm concerned about because that is available to learn through google, I'm mostly confused about the whole concept of OOP, it's benefits as opposed to procedural programming and how to use it efficiently."

I think I'm being salty, but I know this girl who went to Girls Who Code, where she learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you know anything about web development, these languages are the absolute basics a beginner could pick up in 2-3 weeks. Now she has an internship and position in a coding club at school and thinks she's actually a programmer. I just feel like it's unfair, because I learn all these and a lot more myself at home without a program to help me out, and because of that I won't get as much to show for it besides making a website for a school club(gonna ask another place I volunteered at too). Now she is talking about learning the basic back end like it's some complicated shit, but at that point it is still the bare bones of web development.

Sorry for this rant, but I kind of just hate how everything has to be publicize in the world, and the amount of connection a person has trumps over raw skill. But has anyone made their EC look more important than it really was? Or didn't make it seem as good as it should be?"

In high school I cared very little for school, I intended on playing my sport at the D1 level, so I assumed that would get me into college. However, freak accident happens my knee is shot, and I was out of competitive sports forever. At this point I realized I would need to get into a college with my terrible GPA alone. Did my best, but there was no recovering and I graduated with something close to a 1.8 GPA. I did quite well on the ACT so I got into a college despite my pitiful GPA. 

I began college at small liberal arts college in Minnesota. First semester comes and goes, I had some personal difficulties and ended that  semester with a close to a 2.0 GPA. I took winter break to recover and changed my major to economics and finance. This was a major changing point, I decided I did not give a damn about my past and I was going to be successful. That semester 4.0, next semester 4.0, this semester 4.0. I began to scour finical journals, participated in forums, read books, did informational interviews. Everything and anything I could to learn more about finance I did. I now have advanced skills in Python, R, Excel, and my SQL and SAS skills are developing nicely. 

Now I've made progress but here's my reality: I still have a 3.5 GPA, I go to an unknown school, and I did not land an internship this summer. Though, I do know that it can be difficult for sophomores, especially when you don't start applying until the end of March.  I do not give a shit about these issues, I am going to make it into IB. But I understand I need to keep playing catch up, so here comes my questions. 

\- What more can I do to continue to leverage myself? 

\- Should I consider an MBA right out of UG? 

\- I have an opportunity to intern next spring in micro\-finance in South America. Should I take this opportunity? 

\- What EC's should I add to my resume? 

\- And any other additional thoughts are greatly appreciated. "

For example, I applied for an internship a few years ago and got an interview. I went in to interview and the ""hiring manager"" (I say this because he was actually an engineer, the company was just so small they didn't have a hiring manager) was asking me about my personal projects, and he and I started talking about one of my personal projects and got into all the engineering details about it.

8izb8z,3,2018-05-12,Took an internship where the work is not what I want to do for my future career. Need some advice.,cshelpthrowaway123,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/8izb8z/took_an_internship_where_the_work_is_not_what_i/,"Short background, I went back to school for CS so I'm going to be 32 when I graduate. My goal right now is the typical ""get a high paying job in software engineering at a good/exciting company"". I have an internship at SAP doing software dev under my belt and my current internship is at Intel doing verification engineering. After this internship I have 1 term left of school.

Reason I took the Intel job is b/c my school only gives you 24 hours to accept an offer. I had a competing oral offer (to do software dev) just 2 hours before I had to decide on Intel and under the pressure I thought having Intel on my resume was the least risk path. I'm now regretting my decision since I've looked at the type of work I'll be doing the next 8 months, and it's really not something I want to be doing in my future career. I'm still writing code, but it's so different from what I'm actually interested in (software web/application dev).  

The thing I'm wondering most is how companies/recruiters will view this verification experience. Obviously having software dev experience vs verification experience is better (for the jobs I want), but if I make it explicit that I wrote code, am I still in decent shape for getting interviews from the companies I want?  

I've also considered looking for other internships and cutting my current one short by 4 months (since it's 8 months), although this would burn bridges and might cause trouble with my school. Or trying to pick up another software dev internship before I graduate, but I'm in my 30's and I really just want to get this show on the road. So if I can get full time interviews without doing that, it would be ideal. What would you do in my situation?"

As the title says, I think I might be relapsing and I am looking for some support until I can see my therapist. I've had SA since I can remember and it used to be so bad I had to be homeschooled. Eventually I ended up getting my GED at 16 and started working and supporting myself through college. Due to necessity (no family support) I had to take customer service jobs which were terrifying but I think worked as a sort of immersion therapy. I still struggled a lot and was on medication but eventually my SA was/is only really noticeable during confrontation or when I'm being criticized.  In fact, when I tell people I have SA they have a hard time believing me because I am the president of a club on campus, a peer advisor, have an internship, am doing well in my classes, am usually not too socially awkward, etc. I've been really happy with my progress. 

Until yesterday. Granted, I've been feeling more anxious in general probably due to the fact that I'm finally graduating college next month after almost 12 years of off-and-on attendance and a lot of my projects are coming to a head. My doctor even increased one of my medications to try and help. Anyway, yesterday I had an interview for a potential job for after graduation. I was really excited and nervous and had prepared and practiced for 5 days before the interview. I felt fairly confident going in. There were 5 people on the panel, including department heads. I just felt like that scared 16 year old all over again. It was a 45 minute interview. The beginning went okay but I think I became mentally exhausted about halfway through. To make matters worse, I am on a medication for migraines that is known for impacting memory, causing slowed thinking, confusion, etc. I began to struggle. I rambled. I reread questions. I asked clarifying questions on one particular question until one of the panel members said, ""this question is what you make of it"". Half of the panel members looked engaged, the other half didn't. One kept looking in his lap, maybe at his phone. I tried to stay upbeat and positive the whole time but it was really difficult.

Since I got home yesterday evening, I've been a mess. Replaying things in my head,  tearing apart my answers, wondering if I offended people, crying. I'm still having a lot of anxiety. I'm really frustrated with my performance and the fact that I prepared and practiced so much and that it didn't seem to make much of a difference. Now I'm concerned about whether or not I've made the right decision with my career path and if I'm a hireable/desirable candidate at all (black and white thinking, I know). Like I said, I'm going to be making an appointment with my therapist but in the mean time I just needed to vent to people who ""get it"". 

tl;dr: Been having more and more anxiety lately but I think a 5-person panel interview that didn't seem to go very well may gave triggered a SA relapse."

I've exhausted our school's curriculum and I'm itching to go. More details on my situation below (it's a doozy):

Asian Female, Massachusetts  
Intended major: probably physics, math, business (undecided)  
dream school is totally MIT  

GPA (estimate): 4.0 unweighted (weighted GPAs aren't released until end of sophomore year)  


PSAT10: 1470 (710 reading, 760 math)    
SAT (taken August before sophomore year): 1460 (670 reading, 790 math, 20 essay)  
SAT chem: 730  


AP's freshman year: chemistry (self-studied, 4), AB calculus (also self-studied, 5)  
AP's sophomore year: physics c mechanics (in school), physics c electricity and magnetism (self studying), BC calculus (in school). I expect to get 5's on all, physics e&amp;m might be a 4 but in that case I'd take it again next year (genuine interest in physics)  


This summer:  
Will be at Harvard Summer School to take Multivariable Calculus, and Intro to Theoretical Physics  
end of summer, I may be going to China for an internship with my mother's company  
looking for volunteering opportunities throughout the summer   
will be studying for SAT subject tests, retaking SAT, and ACT throughout the summer  
-planning to take SAT math II, SAT physics, ACT end of this summer  


My swim situation:  
So, I've swum club for close to 10 years now. I swam high school this year in order to get press (which I did in the Boston Globe)  
I'm top 20 all-around in my state, top 10 in the 200 free for sure  
I don't know how much people here know about swim, so I can add more info if anyone here's a swimmer  
Comparing myself to swimmers at MIT, I rank in the top 8 in the 200 free as well as the 1000 free (I'm a mid-distance to distance freestyler)  
I'd obvously like to get recruited or have swimming be a big part of my college experience  


School Extracurriculars  
Participant in school's math team freshman year  
Leading member of school's science team (science olympiad top scorer and team winner, science bowl A team (top 10 school), ocean bowl B team freshman year, Massachusetts Envirothon participant)  


Next year:  
Courses: AP American Studies, Chinese 5H (one level below AP Chinese), AP US History, AP statistics, AP comp sci principles, H biology (graduation requirement), Organic Chem ACP (TBD, thinking about being a classroom aide in AP physics or learning something on my own as an independent study, such as e&amp;m if I don't get a 5)  


I'm thinking about the prospect of applying to some colleges next year, especially more selective ones. I think that at my high school, it's getting a little difficult for me to be spending my time actually learning new things and that I'm ready to move up a level. I've been ahead of most of my grade academically since around 3rd grade, so I feel comfortable with being in classes and working with people older than me. My reasoning for applying early is that I'm both ready and possibly more likely to get into some colleges. I know I'll be pursuing STEM, and if my school doesn't have much more to offer, I think it's reasonable that I want to continue education in college earlier. I'd like to hear your opinions on colleges I have a chance at and advice on how to move forward!

Looking for advice.",woosicle,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8j0zd2/fiance_finally_got_a_job_offer_after_months_of/,"First of all, I feel a little weird posting here because I'm not a comp sci person. I have a liberal arts degree and work in the sports industry (still not sure how that happened, but I'm not complaining). I subscribed to this sub a while back because my fiance is a recent computer engineering grad, and I've found a lot of great advice and information on here that I have shared with him.

Four years ago my fiance was miserable with his current job and career path, so he decided to go back to school and get a second degree in computer engineering. I think it turned out to be a lot harder than he had anticipated and he really struggled through it all but eventually graduated last spring (May 2017). He looked for entry level software dev jobs for several months and became very depressed because no one was responding to his applications. He felt like he really screwed up by not getting an internship, because every company required some kind of related experience. He thought his past professional experience in his previous field would help but it didn't seem to matter at all. He also graduated with a pretty low GPA, and a lot of the bigger companies that hired new grads all required a 3.0 or higher.

After several months of applying daily and receiving zero interest, he decided to enroll in a bootcamp to learn more skills and gain some practical experience. He actually enjoyed bootcamp and learned a lot (maybe even more than he learned while he was back in college). He finished bootcamp a couple of months ago and has sent out tons of applications for entry/junior level developer and programmer positions since then. This time around he has actually received some responses, and he has had a handful of phone interviews. However, nothing seems to progress after the phone interview stage. He is starting to feel a greater sense of urgency now because he has been out of work for four years, out of school for a year, and he feels like if this goes on for too much longer his resume will be one giant red flag and he'll be screwed. His savings has been drained, and while I make a decent salary it's not enough to support us both long term. On top of this we are getting married next March, so it would be nice if he could have a job to help finance our wedding, ha.

Yesterday he received his first offer from Tata Consultancy Services. I've read about TCS on here and reviews seem to be mixed/leaning towards negative. My fiance is at the point where he just wants a job - ANY job - but the biggest drawback here is the position would require him to relocate to a city three hours away. Starting salary is also pretty low at $55K. He would get a $4K relocation package as well as decent insurance and pretty standard vacation/sick time. He's waiting on his background check to go through, but assuming everything checks out, he will most likely end up accepting this offer.

I'll be happy for him to have a job, but it sucks for us as a couple/family because I can't realistically move with him. I have a great job in an industry that is difficult to break into, and new city doesn't have nearly as many opportunities for me. Plus my current job has awesome benefits along with tons of paid time off, which I'll really need over the next year. 

My fiance is going to spend the next week or two applying to any place else he has missed, but it's looking like the chances of receiving any other offers are minimal. I have to ask - is this offer from TCS the best he can expect at this point? Will it be easier for him to find a better job once he has a year of related work experience under his belt? I guess I am just looking for some validation that he is doing the right thing and that this will help his career in the long run."

I‚Äôve been browsing up and down the this reddit page looking for advice about internships and I‚Äôve learned quite a lot how it works, and what managers want in an intern, so let me explain my issue... 

I recently got hired as an IT Intern at a relatively large company, doing IT for about 100ish users. I spend my day usually assisting and following around my manager/the sysadmin (it‚Äôs just me and him) to see how he solves issues throughout the site. This is also my first office job as well (only restaurant experience before). It‚Äôs been quite hard for me to adjust over, since I don‚Äôt have to constantly feel like I‚Äôm on my toes all the time, however the relaxation is probably what‚Äôs been affecting my work ability and just my mindset. I‚Äôm also sensing a sort of tension that developed between me and my manager as well, possibly due to my incompetence. 

After a few weeks, I feel like I‚Äôm just a nuisance to him since I don‚Äôt really have any technical experience, and I feel like I‚Äôm more bothersome to have there than actually having a purpose. Whenever I am given a task, it‚Äôs either super vague, or it seems like he expects me to know/comprehend the entire situation, when he‚Äôs only given me the basics. Then when I figure out questions throughout the process, I ask, and he makes me feel like I‚Äôm incompetent, and that I waste his time asking him. This makes me afraid  to even ask him the most basic of questions because he makes me feel stupid for not knowing. 

I also don‚Äôt really have much of an IT background other than a couple programming/high level mathematics/physics classes and just troubleshooting at home of electronic/computer issues. I‚Äôve taken up studying for the CCENT on my down time at work (I HAVE A LOT) in order to keep myself occupied. 

I understand the lack of a technical background affects how I work a lot, but I try to learn and absorb every single thing that is presented by way to understand how the company operates, and how to work in this environment. The way I think and operate is that I want to have an understanding of what his goals are, and what he‚Äôs trying to achieve for the company, and help him do that, whatever way that I can. 

I feel like my manager is detrimental to the development of my character, and makes me question if I want to stay in the internship. I have a couple more months since it is a temp position, so I do have room to improve. But I‚Äôm not sure if I can do it resenting my manager and having to work with him. 

Am I just being too hard on myself about this? And what can I do to improve in this situation. 

TLDR; Issues with my manager, how should I attempt to resolve the problem, or should I just wait it out and hope it gets better? "

8j2c3a,75,2018-05-13,How should I learn machine learning this summer?,Fossana,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/8j2c3a/how_should_i_learn_machine_learning_this_summer/,"Background: I'm going to graduate next semester with a B.S. in computer science and mathematics (statistics concentration). I have not studied machine learning before, and my knowledge of Python/R/Matlab is negligible (I know C, C++, Java, C#). I am interested in machine learning because I have seen many interesting applications with machine learning, and I expect it to be a growing field. I am also interested in game dev and cryptocurrencies.

I plan on studying machine learning for at least 4 hours a day this summer (started 5 days ago). So far I have been going through andrewng's machine learning course on coursera and doing the programming exercises in octave. I think my plan afterwards is to do a Udemy course on Python for data science and machine learning. I'm not sure what to do after that, but so far neural networks/deep learning interest me the most and stuff like neuroevolution. If I had a career in machine learning, I'd like to either come up with cutting edge machine learning techniques or apply machine learning to a problem that can have a big impact on society (e.g. self driving cars) without it being purely plug and chug (i.e. requires some innovation and problem solving).

Also by the end of the summer, how can I show in my resume that I have become proficient with machine learning? Should I do some machine learning projects? What would be most impressive, like potentially land an internship with Google or IBM related to machine learning or something?"

1. My friend recently graduated 2-year college with an AAS in computer information systems specializing in cybersecurity

2. They have worked before college but said they have no references from college or work that they feel they can put down (no professors they can list, no advisor)

3. They have not worked at all for the past 3 years (financial aid) and the work history before that is ‚Äúunder the table‚Äù and cannot be officially listed or referenced

4. The GPA is quite low at 2.6. This removes a lot of companies locally with 3.0 or 3.2 min qualifications.

5. No certifications yet. 

They want to get a tech job to build experience and afford the certifications like Security+ etc.

Where to start? My advice was to try to get a job with the Apple store or Office Depot Geek Squad etc. to start building experience, but to also apply for internships and other tech support hourly-type jobs immediately."

The question about how good I am at Excel is certain to pop up, and to be honest I don't know that much. I think I only know the basics regarding making a table ""look good"" and some of the basic, easy functions like SUM, AVARAGE \(and so on\) and I'd say the most ""complicated"" thing I know is VLOOKUP.

Not sure) this fall. 

Before applying, I was set on Computer Science as a major, and planned accordingly, however I have always been interested in Finance and somehow not pursued it. 

I am not completely ready to give CS just yet, but for now I am pretty sure my personality is not cut out for a typical CS role, I'd love to mix it up with finance.

Of course, like any other student, I'd like to aim high and be ambitious, and ensure that all my options are open, so I was wondering what could be a good major combination for me to perhaps maybe get a shot at IB in the future or Quant. (I am sorry but I have just begun to properly consider a career in finance so I'm not completely sure what sub field I'd like to pursue).

I am not in the Faculty of Management at my school and don't plan to transfer because I can't afford the tuition, arts is significantly cheaper here. So the following are major options (also things I am interested in) for me :

1. CS + Economics Double Major Concentration (perhaps can add a finance minor) 

2. Joint Honours Economics and Finance ( I hear honours econ is a nightmare and will be hard to keep gpa up) 

2. Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science (possibly hard to keep GPA up) 

4. Mathematics and Statistics 

Which would be a good choice to pursue a career in Finance, keeping options open? 

I would really appreciate any sort of advice for someone new to this whole career planning in general and especially for finance. Also, will not being in the Management faculty (also losing out on its career planning services) really hurt my chances of getting jobs/internships? 


I am really worried because I am also relying on internships to at least help me a bit to pay through college. "

Obviously I'm excited and eager to make that step, but I do have a few questions. I know some of this should be covered by company (and a lot of it is), but I'm more looking for first-hand experience. 

**Questions**:

* How do the responsibilities shift from a learning-focused internship to a semi-learning semi-production focused junior position?

* What is the expectation of a junior software developer as compared to a intern or software developer?

* How much should I be focused on professional / skill growth, and how much should I be focused on completing tasks at hand? In other words, should I focus on the work given to me and have the experience come with time, or still dedicate effort to exclusively building my skills? 

* Is learning at home / out of work something I need to be doing, or is it optional? 

* Is there any other 'standard' I should be focused on staying at or above, or anything I should make sure I'm doing to 'keep my head above water' so that I don't *lose* the job?^^imposter^^syndrome

FWIW, this is a front-end focused web application development role.

Honestly, I ruled the latter out at an early point, as well as Cal, primarily because people reinforced the rumor. Distance was a factor as well for UCLA, but the drive was not too bad. I was set on Davis, so I haven't put in much work to solidifying a plan for upcoming years at UCLA, but it seems much more possible now. However, the concerns I've had for Davis are still relevant, which is what I want to discuss.

&amp;nbsp;

My main worries are: (1) finding something to specialize in and (2) developing soft skills. Knowing that I didn't participate much in extracurriculars in CC, other than working as a tutor, I realize that these are some of my biggest flaws. The few possibly relevant activities/hobbies I‚Äôve been able to progress in outside of school are skincare, hydroponic gardening, and programming. Subsequently, my career goals and interviewing/networking skills are pretty meager. Of course, these things will fix themselves as time progresses, but it honestly seems like you need to hit the ground running in Fall in order to get good internships... which is difficult to conceive doing when I don't know what to look for or how to improve myself for it.

&amp;nbsp;

Beyond those concerns, I feel that I am adequately prepared to succeed at UCLA. I have a pretty strong foundation in math/physics, though I haven't taken a math class in a year from the way my multiple changes of major have worked üòÖ. I'll likely be taking a diff eq course over summer to refresh as per advice of Dr. Christofides at the engineering meet and greet. I'm interested in rushing/joining Theta Tau/AIChE as well. 

&amp;nbsp;

I would cherish any advice that current students, chemE or otherwise, could give me for my particular situation üôè

Here are some questions to help with answering:

1-Are Masters Degrees an absolute minimum requirement to acquiring RND positions, even as an intern?

2-Are there any positions (except for professors) where you can wholly(or at most of your time) focus on your research and nothing else?

3-While working on RND projects do you usually have responsibilities and tasks that have nothing to do with your research?

4-There are people who procure Patents and then sell them to commercial organization, are there people that do research and then present their proposals to companies in a similar fashion (not in competitions)?

5-Can you make profit out of research on your own time (during vacations or after work hours)?

6-How many publications are considered respectable when applying for RND positions or Grants for research(is the number of citations to our publications an important factor)?  

7-When an RND project's deadlines are missed once or multiple time what kind of compensation/punishment/consequences occur)?

I'm taking a fifth year because I changed my major/career track from biology/pre\-med after my 2nd year and also needed to take a semester off for mental health and other personal reasons. My resume isn't that terrible on the surface I guess. My university is relatively esteemed, my GPA isn't completely awful, I've had a few jobs, and I've joined a few clubs to keep myself busy. However anything below a 3.5 is usually considered very lackluster for econ majors and unfortunately, my GPA is not only a result of my poor performance in science classes, as my major GPA is lower than my overall GPA.

I've also had hardly any success with internships. I've applied to over 100 internships for this summer and have only gotten 7 1st round interviews with no 2nd round interviews or offers. As a result I'm sitting here with no plans for the summer heading into my last year and I have no idea what the future holds.

I, like a majority of people on this subreddit and in general, watch videos on YouTube pretty frequently, and I feel that well done YouTube channels really have the ability to pique and keep people's interest in certain subjects, as well as to give young people interested in the field an idea of the realities. Now, what I've noticed, and have always been disappointed in, is the general lack of channels based around engineering things like school, internships, and industry work. YouTube is rife with CS people(not saying they aren't engineering, per say, but they are a well represented segment) making really quality videos either from the perspective of students, or showing how exciting industry can be. Unfortunately, engineers seem to be not so lucky, and a search for videos on, say, mechanical engineering(my major), is liable to either turn up videos by people like ""Engineered Truth"" almost exclusively talking about how bad the industry is, or those silly videos with the terrible music in the background showcasing some wunderkind who's already doing groundbreaking work in undergrad. Either way, it's pretty discouraging to those looking into what to major in or what the future holds.

So, I'm making this post because I wanted to see what the general interest would be in a channel that would be similar to channels like Joma Tech or Jarvis are doing with CS in its mixing of an industry/major specific domain focus with a more general, light-hearted focus on things outside of engineering as well? Assuming it's well executed, do you think you would be interested in such a channel? I'm entering the harder parts of my major, so I would love to focus it on school mostly and on tips and tricks to be successful(I have been very successful as a student myself) and get internships, as well as to show the fun of school and interning. Later down the line, I would also love to showcase industry after I graduate.

Any input, negative or positive, is much appreciated."

I will have more free time during the summer than the first two semesters of the course though, and tbh really need some part-time work anyway. I had planned on just taking whatever shitty retail/service job I could find for some part-time work over the summer, but it just seems like a wasted opportunity. If I have to work anyway, surely it would be far better for me to be doing something I'll actually enjoy, and will help me in the future.

So does anyone know of any internships or job opportunities that could be open to doing part-time (2-3 days a week, based in Dublin)? I'll give a more detailed description of the stuff I know if it's necessary, but any full-stack work would be perfect. Really, anything other than dedicated front-end dev, where I would be working on code and practicing engineering skills would be fine. I know that almost all the work going is full-time, so I'm not optimistic, but hopefully someone here will know of something. Thanks!"

Right now, I can graduate with a BS in CS in 3 years, without summer classes. However, I would most likely have to drop out of my honors program. I can also double major in Applied Math if I stay for 4 years, but this isn't something that I'm set on doing. School isn't too expensive for me either- ~$10k a year.

What are some pros/cons of graduating early? Would an extra summer of interning make a difference? (I do have an internship for this summer at a pretty good company, though it's more project management than swe). How about if I instead graduated a semester early? 

How would this affect me if I were to go straight into industry, or if I instead went to grad school?

I just recently got an offer basically for this tutoring position for kids 7-14. The commute is very convenient and close to my house. The employer said we would be playing around with things like Unity, and 2D and 3D game development, making me think this could help me learn even more cool stuff and skills. However, i‚Äôm not too sure if we will get too serious about game development, and is probably just selling himself. From my research, the biggest things simply are just playing around with Scratch, games like Minecraft, and other robotics stuff like drones.

I also already have experience in tutoring kids to program from working for a different employer last summer, but the employer I had was pretty bad. It‚Äôd be great if I can just use this job simply to replace this negative experience.

For Sales, I applied to Best Buy as a computer associate. The pay is the same as the tutoring job I have, but the commute is a bit of a drive. Also, hearing from my friend working here (but at a different location), the hours are completely random too. I thought of this as a great idea though since I could add another soft skill with sales to my resume instead of just repeating another tutoring job.

For IT work like Desktop Support and Help Desk,  I just think of this a way to just get more involved with actual computer work. I read from this sub however that this doesn‚Äôt really help much either if you‚Äôre looking forward to be a developer. Some jobs are the same pay, while others are a little higher.

Any advice on what to do and what may be the best decision to make?  After looking again what I typed, I‚Äôm starting to lean towards the tutoring job. Biggest reason why is because It should be very easy to keep once school rolls by again next Fall since it‚Äôs literally right next to my house, and the responsibilities don‚Äôt look too stressful either.

8j9nl4,9,2018-05-14,Conflicted on how to spend my time this summer,TheArbitraryUsername,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8j9nl4/conflicted_on_how_to_spend_my_time_this_summer/,"So I'm a bit conflicted on how I should spend the next 3.5 months as a CS student. I'm currently a rising junior at a top-10 university, but I was unable to land an internship this summer. This wasn't too much of an issue, because fortunately I was able to start working at a research lab at my school that deals with artificial intelligence, crowdsourced and crowd-powered machines, and machine learning topics in general. The lab is very well-connected from what I've gathered. In the summer, the lab expects at least 20+ hours of work, and each student joins a specific project that they work on with a team. My goal for this summer is to boost my resume as much as possible in an attempt to get a solid internship for next summer.

At the moment, however, I'm also taking a class in the spring semester - introduction to computer organization. This class is a pre-requisite for the operating systems class at my school (which I hope to eventually take), and it's also a major requirement, but I've found the pace in the spring semester to be overwhelming at times. There are a lot of programming projects with compacted due dates, as well as long homework assignments, and all of the assignments seem to be due right around the same time. I've also personally been struggling a bit with some of the material when I initially learn it, so I've been trying to study it in my free time, but I've found that this has been leaving me with less and less time to actually work in the research lab. I've been noticing that the class is taking up more and more of my day (approximately 25-30 hours per week minimum), which gives me less time to work in the lab, so I've been considering deferring this class to the fall semester and just taking it then. Doing that won't put me behind schedule to graduate ‚Äì I'm still on time to graduate, and only opted to take this class now just so I could get ahead, but I don't really see the point in taking it now when it won't particularly get me too ahead in the near future, since it doesn't open up that many other classes anyways. I also think it's worth mentioning that I wouldn't consider dropping the class if I didn't have this research lab opportunity.

So, my dilemma is whether I should drop this class and go all in on the lab, using my free time to develop some personal projects (I've got an idea for a sufficiently complex iOS app ‚Äì just waiting on WWDC before I get working on it ‚Äì as well as potentially developing a reddit bot. I've also identified a need to build a personal website), or attempt to juggle the class and the lab together? Really, I'm just a bit nervous about being able to handle the increasingly growing time commitment that is this class with a lab that wants approximately 4-6 hours of daily engagement. 

Assuming I choose the former option, I'd have no issue with dedicating 30 to 40 hours per week into the research lab. I just feel like it's difficult for me to keep up with a spring-term class with compacted deadlines as well as a demanding research lab with extended summer hours. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks so much. Also, sorry for the wall of text lol.

**TL;DR: Work full time in a CS research lab this summer, with downtime dedicated to personal projects, or cut-back on hours in research lab in order to take an intro class in computer organization, which feels like more and more of a time commitment?**"

So if I wanted to specialize in something else other than software dev, at what point of the progression should I look for these specialized jobs?

Here are some other co-op related questions that are very specific to me:

I'm coming to Waterloo having completed two six-week internships at my local university. The first I had designed a curriculum for learning programming and written lessons on all the sorting algorithms to time complexity to dynamic programming. The second I will be doing sentiment analysis with data mining. I know my first experience isn't the most exciting but will these two internships count as a part of my co-op ""progression""? Will I be able to find slightly better jobs?

My aunt has offered a summer internship with the IT department of her company. My dad who had worked there before says their IT is crap and I won't learn anything, but if I can't find a co-op first year, would this be a good backup? If it matters, her company is in San Francisco."

Work experience:

* First internship at an affordable housing development firm at 19 ($10/hr) (Summer 2010)

* Worked during undergrad degree at personal wealth management firm for 2 years ($12/hr) (Summer 2011-Summer 2013)

* 2 years after graduation at a mutual fund administration company as a Pricing Analyst ($40k) (Summer 2013-Summer 2015)

* Moved to LA and hopped around a couple jobs in the finance industry until I finally had enough, then I failed starting a virtual reality company, and then a very close family member got very sick and I moved home to take care of them ($60k. immediate bump from moving to CA) (Fall 2015-Summer 2016) 

* (Family member recovered!) Now almost 2 years at current company (non-startup tech company in LA) as a Financial Analyst (started at $65k, current salary $100k) (Fall 2016-Current)


**Work Experience Summary**

I studied finance in school since I had always been good at math, however when I entered the real world and got some work experience, I realized I had zero passion for retirement planning, mutual funds, syndicated lending, corporate finance, and even financial markets in general. 


I left the finance industry and got involved in a tech company where I've been able to use my creative problem solving skill set to make some major and immediate changes to my department that have saved the company a lot of money and manpower. I want to stay humble about it, but when I first came into the position, all of their procedures were very inefficient and even produced inaccurate results in some use cases. I was able to create all brand new procedures and automate everything I do, resulting in 100% accurate invoicing/reporting plus it takes less than half the time to complete these procedures. My managers have recognized my ability to problem solve and currently have me going to different departments and automating their procedures via SQL and Excel Macros. 


In the same company I've also been involved with product managers, as I have written open letters (essentially white papers after conducting personal user testing and competitive analysis on my own free time) to the president and executives of the company expressing my opinions and views of where I see our industry in the next few years, how we can create new value for our consumers, and how we can create a competitive advantage. The move was kind of bold (some bottom level analyst telling the owners how to run their company), but the feedback from the executives has been very positive and they want me to get into product management when I have finished automating other department's procedures.  


**TL;DR:** I've done some cool things at a company that I fell into out of fate, have gotten 2 substantial raises in less than 2 years, and should get a couple great letters of rec from it. 


**Extra curriculars:**

* Self funded and solo started a company that I currently run that pairs business' with non-profits and helps them raise money. My company has worked with small businesses to Ellen Degenerous (briefly) to raise a couple thousand dollars (so far) from collecting pennies. (started November 2017)

**Undergrad school/major:**

* University of Colorado, Boulder

* Finance, 3.0 GPA

**Race/nationality:**

* White


**Sex:**

* Male


**GMAT Score:**

* 720 (46 Q/43 V)

**MBA Info**

Goal of MBA:


My life goal is to be able to look back and acknowledge that I dedicated my life to solving a problem(s). For me that doesn't necessarily mean the non-profit world, as I believe corporations can solve problems through products or resources. I'm trying to not be such a damn millennial and say I want to be an entrepreneur, but I do hope to have a large impact in a company that creates products or services that align closely with my ideas of how I think products and consumers should interact along with the role a corporation should play in society. I understand how hard it is to get to that level, so I feel personally that I need to further develop some personal attributes to increase my likelihood of getting there. 


**TL;DR:** My goals of a MBA is to learn. I want to:

* develop professional skills (networking, presentation, pitching, case studies, etc.)

* learn knew ways to approach problem solving 

* learn how to build teams and manage different personalities

* learn how all types of business' work (domestic, international, corporation, sole proprietor, etc.)

* develop an elite network of like minded professionals



**Target schools:**


I love LA. I want to stay here and I am really only looking at UCLA Anderson and USC Marshall. However, I would leave LA for an international experience. 


**Questions for you**

* Am I too much of a God damn millennial? Should I refrain from mentioning entrepreneurship as a focus? Should I tell them I'd like to develop my analytical and problem solving skills to become a consultant?

* Is a MBA right for me? Would I be better off spending the energy executing one of my business plans I've developed over the years?

* Is it even likely I could get into Anderson/Marshall's full time program given my lackluster performance at a not so great state school?

* I make 6 figures and I'm not doing the MBA for monetary reasons. Is it worth the debt for networking and self-development to the highest level?

8jfi3a,3,2018-05-14,Request for ticketing and inventory software recommendations,ragnarok189,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8jfi3a/request_for_ticketing_and_inventory_software/,"Hello /r/sysadmin! LTL;FTP and all that.

I've been a sysadmin for 11 years now and have used a variety of ticketing and inventory systems, but none are quite doing what I want them to do. So I'm going to describe to you what it is I want, and see if any of you wonderful fellow sysadmins have a recommendation!

For ticketing I've used Remedy, Footprints, RT, GLPI, and OTRS. For inventory I've used GLPI OCS, SnipeIT, and OTRS. 

What I want: I want a unified system that does both ticketing and inventory, though I don't need any kind of inventory system that does discovery or automated collection, I can have my interns type things in.

I want to have users in the system that can be the requestor/customer for trouble tickets/requests and I want those same users to be the owners/responsible party for hardware assets. I want to be able to see the hardware assets owned by an owner, and I want to be able to see the owner of hardware assets. 

I also want to be able to link hardware assets to trouble tickets, so that I can see the ticket history of a certain hardware. 

If possible, it'll also be nice to have locations that contain hardware assets that report their current status, so I can see if a certain classroom is unavailable because the projector is being worked in a trouble ticket, etc.

I know this sounds like a lot, so I'll add just one more requirement :D, it should be open source and free.

So, now that I've described a unicorn, feel free to shoot me down and tell me what I'm looking for doesn't exist. But, just in case something like this does exist and I've been living under a rock, please let me know so I can switch from OTRS (which is what I'm currently using that lacks some of these features, all though it appears to be the closest)!

Oh, and if it helps I'm a sysadmin and an IT manager for a university and we manage everything from classroom AV equipment, datacenter servers, user desktop/laptops, printers, basically anything that might plug into a wall or get an IP address."

I am not sure what exactly I've been doing wrong. I just finished my junior year of Aerospace Engineering, and I still don't have anything certain lined up for the summer. I've been waiting to hear back from one internship in Europe for a few months, but they keep not giving me a straight answer. I've applied to dozens of positions since last October and besides the occasional rejection, I usually don't hear anything back from them. 

My major GPA is around a 3.6, with a cumulative about 3.4.  I spent last summer as a research assistant at my University. I have a good amount of Matlab and CAD experience, and have done a fair bit of project work over the past few years.  

Is it normal to struggle this much trying to get internships? I know the process is extremely competitive, but I have put out so many applications (with cover letters too) that it's really disheartening to not even get a clear cut answer back. 

Any insight or advice anybody may have would be great, thank you! :) "

I'll be graduating with my bachelor's in computer science (and public relations) in three months.

I've been looking for jobs, but have been confused about which to take or apply for. I want to get into the security industry but am aware of the hurdles to get into it. I figure that I can try for junior front-end developer roles (after I build a few projects)  or just general software engineering and pursue that line while building up my skills to get myself a job in infosec. I have also considered maybe applying to internships in the infosec field and then attempting to move up from there?

1) I worked for this American company in San Francisco from June 2017 - March 2018 for 10 months  as a J-1 visa holder. 

2) It's a software developer job so based on my understanding, I'm not selling anything other than my talent. Do I still have to apply for GST/HST?

3) I'll definitely work as a sole proprietor (or is it better to work incorporated?)

4) I'll probably work at my parents' house. Can I still get tax benefits for hydro + other bills?

5) And this might be a dumb question but can I still use my SSN I got from my J-1 Visa for this role? or is there another 'work visa' -- or something similar -- i need to apply for prior to accepting this position?


I'll probably go see an accountant for taxing but I would love to know my ground before seeing anyone else! Thank you so much for your help in advance!"

* Also I am hesitant in putting down the last bullet point in my Achievements section. It was during my freshman year. I, unfortunately, do not remember a lot from that project, and I didn‚Äôt keep a lot of documents. Would it be wise to find something else to fill in that spot?

They were particularly interested in the research project I had done working on pedestrian pathfinding in areas of traffic that I had on my resume, and at the time I didn‚Äôt put too much it into other than the fact that I thought it must have been a good showcase of my knowledge/skills. As I‚Äôve had more time to ponder these past few days, I‚Äôve begun to grow more and more concerned as to what exactly the work I‚Äôll be doing this summer will be contributing towards. 

Why would a military defense company care about pedestrian path prediction? The only reasons I can come up with are those that are extremely horrible to imagine. I‚Äôll be honest, the offer is honestly pretty lucrative, and it would be nice to be able to help pay off some of my student loans, but is it really worth it? I like to think that I‚Äôm a good person, but if I do take on the internship this summer and the work that I do ultimately ends up being used to help kill or hurt people down the line, will I continue to be able to justify that belief?

My assignment is to take everything from a network share folder that has been around for 10 years, re-organize it, and transfer it all into SharePoint with discarding the stuff that nobody has accessed in years. We will be creating a backup just in case there's something odd that needs to be accessed that gets tossed. My personal thoughts are to just take the entire drive and put it on SharePoint so that the users don't freak out and we get a million calls, but it's not my taco stand and I'm not the boss.

I know that I can make a GPO and audit object access on the drive, let it log for a few months, and view everything in the event viewer, but what I would really love to do is somehow **graph that data** to see which folders are being accessed the most, which files in those folders are being accessed the most, etc.

- Possibly the summer MathCamp in Cambridge, MA

**SOPHOMORE YEAR**

Fall/Winter: Training, possibly more undergrad research

Summer: 

- Olympics

- Internship at tech firm or quant HF/prop shop (if the latter is even possible), if compatible with competing

**JUNIOR YEAR**

Fall/Winter: Internship at tech firm or quant HF/prop shop (if the latter is even possible)

Summer: Internship at quant HF/prop shop or tech firm (if the former is possible)

**SENIOR YEAR**

Fall:

- By now, if I'm lucky, I have hopefully gotten some Putnam-related accolade

- More undergraduate research, especially since I'll be more mature as a mathematician (and for the GPA boost) 

Summer:

- *[???]* (What should go here?)

I swear to fucking God, there is not a single normal single person in this fucking town. All I want is someone pretty, funny, can hold a conversation, and is nice. Not one of the common freaks that make up the single females of the millennial era. Just look at the disgusting shit on /r/Phillyr4r. Not ONE normal human being there. And this isn't just limited to that one trash subreddit, either. It's like that here in general. I swear, a single, nice and normal, straight, monogamous woman is so fucking rare nowadays. Everyone is either...

**A.** A lesbian (""queer"").

**B.** A ""poly"" freak cucking their boyfriends because they're selfish immature assholes.

**C.** A moronic SJW/feminist type with bad hygiene and/or obesity.

**D.** A Tumblrite ""genderfluid"" otherkin alt-lifestyle freakazoid with 47 genders.

**E.** A tranny (not even a passable one or anything).

**F.** Trailer trash, a hood rat, or some other form of ugly-ass, bottom-barrel female with bad tattoos, bad teeth, and stretch marks who refers to herself as ""queen"" or ""goddess.""

**G.** An entitled single mother who remains picky and entitled despite being one the lowest value women on the market.

**H.** Some combination of two or more of the above.

I can't imagine what the men are like in the modern dating scene, but with all the stories of dick pics (I'm a guy and even I don't understand that shit) and married men hitting on girls, I imagine it's probably not any better. I'm not even a conservative or any of that. I'm center-left. Yet I can't find one woman under 40 who isn't some whiny, immature cunt bitching about Trump literally everyday and how ""oppressed"" she is as a college-educated, left-leaning, Starbucks-drinking, iPhone-Snapchatting, upper middle class white woman living in 2018 North America trying to intern at Buzzfeed.

I don't even want a traditional housewife. Just somebody fucking _normal!_ Smart, funny, can hold a conversation, isn't a moron, isn't whiny and entitled and thinks the world owes her more than it's already given her easily, and so on. Being agnostic or atheist is nice, but I don't even care what religions she is (aside from Scientology or Islam, because fuck that shit!). I can also give back what I ask for, too. I'm not some incel asking for Kate Upton or any shit. I don't even really care much about looks, as long as she's an actual female, doesn't have facial hair, and bathes every day. I'm just sick of being single because everyone around me is such trash! The few, few, _few_ good women out there get ""a ring put on it"" like, instantly. And why wouldn't they? It's like, I have to go around to 18 year old birthday parties and shit just to find a potential single woman who hasn't been taken yet and isn't alt-lifestyle millennial trash like the above. (This is a joke, obviously. But the hyperbole stands.)

And yes, the irony of this while being on REDDIT, which is the hive motherbase of alt-lifestyle freakazoids, millennial trash, and social justice warriors, isn't lost on me. So I expect this to be downvoted to hell.

Still. I just wanted to bitch about this after spending just FIVE minutes on Tinder again. Fuck my generation. These people need to do us all a favor and never breed. Not that they'd want to, being fake lesbians and poly-freaks and all."

My wife and I moved in with my parents that live two hours away from where we were living. My wife was accepted into her masters program, two months later we found out we're having a baby. 

I was working full time and going to school, i ended up up transferring to the area where my parents reside. We had an agreement that my mother, who is a full time home maker for decades, would watch our daughter while i worked and my wife was at school (hour and a half commute one way - it's California this is typical).

We moved in 2 weeks after our daughter arrived. Fast Forward 8 months and two semesters in, and we still don't have a working babysitting schedule with my mother.  The first 3 months i was working, and my wife was telling me that my mother wouldn't show up when she agreed, or she'd say she was going to watch her and then not be available.

We talked to my mother and ironed out that my wife had to physically leave the house in order for my mom to consider it babysitting. She did as requested. 
I ended up quitting my job and going to school to finish my bachelors degree. I was passed up three times for higher positions, i figure i wasn't competitive enough so i need my degree. Also i would make more using my gi Bill due to the schools location (Vets Know what i mean with BAH in San Francisco, civilians just trust me i do). I also signed up for the Law school test in June since that's my routen

Sad to say we never had the support we were promised. Me and my wife are balancing our school and study time while watching our baby. My mom would watch her intermittently, some days she'll watch on time, or a half day late to the agreed time, or not even watch her. We invested in a white board to remind her, texted her times for the week, even reminded her physically when she would leave but it just didn't work.

My younger brother also had a baby and lives 3 blocks away. Whenever he needed my mom to watch his kid he would text her, and she be there for him. After 3 serious talks with my parents, and no solution available, me and my wife decided it's time to move out back to where we lived since her mom was capable of watching our daughter.

We broke the news to my parents just now and my mom stormed off to her room. She locked the door and was packing (we didn't know at the time). My dad, my wife, and i finished the conversation and as my dad was going to bed he closed his door behind him. Minutes later my mom comes storming out saying ""fuck you"" to me and my dad, and ""you get your dad all to yourself"" and ""it's divorce time mother fuckers"". The difference here was my father chasing her out the door saying ""have fun at your fucken weird sisters room"" (my aunts schizophrenic, refuses treatment, and lives with her son). Talked with my dad and he's said he's done with their marriage. 

*Sidebar: my mom has been in therapy for three decades. She doesn't take her prescribed medication, just switched to holistic medicine, and doesn't even take that daily. She says its depression but I've always had a feeling it was something else and she writes it off as depression. She's also had outbursts like this before my whole life, even sent me emails while deployed (remember, I'm a veteran) about how shitty of a son I am, and why i wasn't emailing her back (remember, i was deployed). She accuses my dad of infidelity weekly, says he doesn't like my sisters (their half sisters but he's been in their lives since they were 4 and 2), and constantly tracks him on his phone. 

During the conversation she mentioned she didn't know we we're moving in, she also mentioned she has bad memory, then it shifted into our cleaning skills and how horrible it was. Anyways, me and my wife NEED consistency since I'm taking the law school test and she's going to be starting an internship in August. The only option we have is to move BACK to where we have a solid foundation of support. We know this because my wife's mom watches our daughter when we go down and we're able to study for hours upon hours. 

I've been balancing our schedule here giving my wife majority of the time since she needs it for her masters program. Today i took our daughter all day as her finale are this week. I'm not trying to paint myself as a good guy and my mother bad, we just need supportive schedules and we don't have it here. Since my wife's off for summer, it makes sense to transition to a the new area

I just feel like shit this is happening and my conversations the catalyst. 

TL;DR moved in with parents to help watch baby, wife and I in college, moving out 8 months later because there's a no support ;parents fought and are now divorcing (per word of mouth)

Im a designer, so freelance can be really hit or miss. My family member works for a company down in Texas and I used to really admire the work of her boss. I‚Äôd followed their work for awhile and in January was given an (unpaid) internship for three months. I wasn‚Äôt thrilled about the absence of money, but they threw in a small stipend of $500 in the second month and commission based sales were options if I wanted them. 

For the design work, the two in charge gave inadequate detail in the design briefs. Everything I‚Äôve worked on has been due ASAP with no real deadlines set forth, no assistance or instruction followed by an email or two every hour after assignments were given asking if I was done. I don‚Äôt claim to be perfect at my job. I know mistakes occur, and I am definitely still learning. It‚Äôs my first job out of college. 

They offer cool event based perks, aka, hanging out with the occasional celebrity who is interested in the business. But i don‚Äôt pray at the altar of celebrity, so that means very little to me. I enjoy work, and work hard. Most weeks I‚Äôve been trying to reduce the learning curve by putting in well over 40 hours. I‚Äôve received no form of formalized training, everything has been on the fly. I‚Äôve done okay, but with no training, I‚Äôve obviously made a some mistakes. Nothing major, just an extra email to get all the details straight. But then a good number of times, the details change in the last 15 minutes before a project is due or I get new information that changes the work I‚Äôve done. As it‚Äôs a start up, I worked in the warehouse shipping items to customers because there was a need in help there, and that‚Äôs where my family member directs. 

Finally after my 3 month internship, I approach them to see if there‚Äôs a job or if I should just keep looking. I gave them ample time to plan a meeting, half the month, so we could schedule something in their chaotic lives. I asked for April 30th to be my last day and have the discussion. They blew it off, instead asked me to come on a work trip to do another celeb based event, and held the conversation up another week. The next Monday rolled around and nothing. Tuesday, we have the money talk, they explain what the job is, nothing really very design related, just the shipping lackey with ‚Äúspecial projects‚Äù. 

The salary we ‚Äúagreed‚Äù on is less than 30k, roughly $13/hr., they text from 8am-11:30pm every day. It‚Äôs exhausting. Sometimes it‚Äôs work related, other times it‚Äôs just to chat with the group. There‚Äôs just more work. Tasks pile on so high so fast every day that I never finish tasks, and if I do, they‚Äôre never good enough. 

So I was tasked randomly to find flights and I did one boss‚Äôs correctly, and one leg of another flight got messed up. They took three hours to make a decision in a group text to choose a flight. And the mistake was made when the travel site refreshed for the 10th time after they changed the plans and went back and forth a dozen times. Travel agent was never in my job description. And today my boss tells me that the mess up was bad. So bad. Even though they banked the money from the flight and just rescheduled. I offered to pay for the mistaken flight, and today my boss tells me I basically have the job because my sister is valuable to them. And that I have very little time to fix the mistakes or I‚Äôm canned. One week after being ‚Äúemployed‚Äù. No contract, so I‚Äôm dumb. I know. 

I don‚Äôt want to leave my family member high and dry because they all heap on too much work for anyone to manage. But I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre really interested in keeping me but realize that my family member will be upset if we part ways. But I feel anxious just going in knowing any mistake could be my last at this job. The fast doesn‚Äôt jive with the quality work, doesn‚Äôt jive with amount they pay. You get fast, good, or cheap. I feel like I‚Äôm being taken advantage of and have a sneaking suspicion they never truly intended to hire me to begin with, but used the free labor to make it through the busy season. Is it worth sticking it out and working myself to the bone for little pay, no gratitude, and undermining of the work I have done well? 

TL:DR‚Äîwork environment is highly stressful, unstructured, disorganized, with no training, lots of blame, but has cool perks. Boss tells me I‚Äôm only still there because my family member works there. Threatened to fire me a week after ‚Äúemploying‚Äù me. Is it worth it to stay and struggle or quit and apply elsewhere immediately? "

I'm in college right now, and my college provides students with 10 free counseling sessions. Once those are used up, we have to seek outside help. I used up all my 10, so I've had to turn to different sources. 

At school, I had an INCREDIBLE therapist. Whenever I left her room, I felt strong and light hearted. I improved so quickly with her. She was very kind and encouraging, and funny and relatable.

This new one I'm trying out, not so much. She's my first outside therapist. I've only seen her twice, but I'm already skeptical. Because she's made me feel like shit. I've felt horrible about myself since leaving, and it's actually leaked into today. I feel more depressed and anxious since going, than I did when I hadn't gone.

She was a little harsh - saying what I did was rude when I explained some tough social situations, and said that I was at fault for my struggling social situations, just as my friends were at fault.

When I talked about my fear of the future, and how I want to be an artist but it's hard to make money, she basically affirmed my fears and implied it's not wise to go that route. She didn't give me any hope - just basically said to me what EVERYONE says, that there's no money in art, even though I've made it clear that it's all I care about, that it's what I want to do. That one hurt me the most.

She also made me feel guilty that my parents can afford to support me through school.

I graduate in one semester, and never had an internship. When I said that, she made a face and a noise like ""holy crap, that's *really* bad. You need to figure your shit out.""

After I left her office, I cried in my car. I never felt that way with my past therapists, who were all kind and encouraging. Even if I was at fault for something, or I did something bad, they wouldn't say it straight to my face like this new therapist. They'd say it in a gentler way. My past therapists also always sat at attention, and this one kind of lounges. Which I understand needing to be comfortable, but it kind of makes me feel like I'm boring her.

Tough love doesn't work for me. I need kindness and understanding.

Is it too soon to give up, since I'm only two sessions in, or should trust my gut?"

**TL'DR:** Be kind to yourself.  Your little wins add up!  Sure, maybe you didn't get that job you wanted, didn't do as well in a class as you wanted to, didn't brush your teeth *again* ... but I am sure you did something small to make yourself proud.  Don't discredit those little wins.  Write them down, and let them inspire you to be better.  And don't expect yourself to be perfect, ADHD or not, no one is perfect... no matter how much we perceive others to be perfect.

---


I'm a perfectionist with ADHD, and whoever thought that was cool combo deserves a punch in the face.  Ever since I was a child, everything needed to be perfect.  More often than not, I never could live up to my own expectations because of my ADHD.


I'm sure many of you can relate to that.


Last week I was walking back to my apartment from my college campus after completely bombing a final exam.  I needed to get a 65 on the exam to get at least a B- in the class.  Unfortunately, I didn't study enough because I prioritized moving out of my apartment and finishing a 12 page paper for another class.  


I got a 59 on the exam and subsequently got a C+ in the course, **but funnily enough ... I wasn't as hard on myself as I used to be.**  I remembered to be nice to myself, and instead of seeing the negative and the imperfections, I took a deep look at how far I've come.


In December 2017 I was undiagnosed, and had just had the worst semester of my life.  I barely scrapped by with two C's and a D- ... I failed one of my classes and needed to withdraw from it.  I also withdrew from a course earlier in the semester because I was on track to fail the course.  


**So what do I have to be proud of?**

*  I sought out a diagnosis all on my own ... zero help from my family; I payed for every appointment and took control of my life, and for once actually followed through with something.  **Now I am medicated and developing good habits for myself.**


*  I didn't fucking fail a class!  I got two C's and two B's.  I was diagnosed in the **middle** of the semester and still managed to get decent grades, and I am confident that had I been diagnosed and medicated before the semester began, I would have had **all** B's... and hey maybe even an A.  I've improved so much, and my GPA has gone up a full point.


* I was open and honest with one of my professors about my struggles.  Last semester I didn't speak to any of my professors outside of class, this semester I explained to one of my professors how my ADHD affects me, and what he can do to help me in his class.  I was surely going to fail that class if I didn't speak to him.  After I asked for help, my grades improved significantly.


* **I've lost 33lbs since January.** Yes, *33 freaking pounds*.  I, a person with ADHD that struggles to stick to anything for longer than a week (and sometimes even a full minute), actually followed through with a change in my diet and didn't give up.  Even if I feel disappointed in myself because my grades aren't what I want them to be, I didn't get that internship I wanted, or, heck, I just didn't put my damn laundry away again... **I did something really hard and I stuck to it**


* And I asked for help.  I went to counseling instead of keeping things bottled up and exploding.  I'm learning to handle my emotions better, and I am starting to be able to talk about my feelings without bursting into tears while doing so.



So sure, I'm still mad at myself for not getting better grades... not starting to read that book I keep saying that I will... forgetting to make that appointment *again* ... being a little too impulsive with my purchases ... and so on, the list can go on forever.  **But here I am, I've completed so much in just the past FOUR months of my life.**



I'm not perfect, but I've improved.  I'm learning to be nice to myself, and I think that's something **all** of us here need to remember.  I see so many posts here of people beating themselves up.  Please remember to not discredit your little wins, because the little wins really add up.  We have ADHD, we are **not** perfect, **nobody** is perfect no matter how much we **think** they are from our outside perspective.  We cannot expect ourselves to be perfect.


So please, take some time to access your little wins (especially if you feel like you haven't had a 'big win' lately) and be proud of how far you've come since yesterday... two weeks ago... 4 months ago... a year or several years ago."
8jmzj0,0,2018-05-15,$2k/month selling premium denim jeans [side business],youngrichntasteless,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8jmzj0/2kmonth_selling_premium_denim_jeans_side_business/,"Hey - Pat from [Starter Story](https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview.

Today I interviewed Susie Shaughnessy who started her own premium denim jeans brand.

- Learned the denim craft working at Levis.
- Gained experience starting a small jewelry line with her sisters
- Friends helped her model the jeans and do a photoshoot
- Working to beat the Instagram algorithm

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

Hey ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm Susie Shaughnessy, owner and designer of [Crawford Denim and Vintage Co](https://crawford-denim.com/). The small-batch denim brand is a mix of New + Vintage apparel for Men + Women, rooted in classic Americana style. The new designs are influenced by the vintage collection but made to fit modern silhouettes. Each piece is crafted in California from deadstock or USA made goods. 

I‚Äôve been teaming up with some great friends to collaborate on designs in order to increase the reach of the brand. Selling the vintage collection monthly at Long Beach Flea Market has also helped introduce Crawford Denim to a much larger audience. These steps have incrementally increased traffic to the site and sales. 

### What's ****your**** backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area as the middle child in a large family. Our Dad was a long time high school football coach and our Mom managed the teams while raising the family. 

Every student was welcome in our home, making our house a constant hub of activity, sports and art. We learned early in life how rewarding working in service to others is and how to work well as a team. One person‚Äôs success is a reflection of the team‚Äôs hard work.

&gt; Having an alternate source of income will help minimize any lows in sales. It‚Äôs the insurance of making rent that allows you to focus on the brand or business that you are trying to grow.

I started my design career at Levi‚Äôs, working at some of the last US factories and learned from the true craftsmen how to build the iconic jeans. After years of designing for other American denim brands manufacturing overseas, I wanted to return to producing in the states. I did not want to lose the artform that had generated in California. Working with other small businesses + craftsmen, we can each benefit and help sustain our local economy.

I was looking at the [Slow Food Movement](https://www.slowfoodusa.org/) at the time of shaping my plan for Crawford Denim. Their movement to eat local foods in support of small, sustainable farms to reduce waste and eliminate pesticides were practices I wanted to employ in the apparel industry. Working locally reduces the need for gas for overseas shipping and using deadstock + vintage fabrics keeps them from landfills. These fabrics not only have great character, but were often created from cotton grown without pesticides or GMOs. 

While the head Designer at Old Navy, I started a small jewelry + crafts line with my sisters. It was a good introduction on how to set up an online business and sell in person. I was able to work on my skills without a huge investment for product inventory and develop best practices knowing eventually I would launch Crawford Denim. 

### Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

After designing several denim blocks, testing both deadstock and USA made denim; I made 1st samples with a small, local manufacturer who had been referred by my patternmaker. They are unique in that they sew nearly every type of product, sample in house and have low minimums. 

Having developed a good relationship with them over the years have allowed us to grow together. They still remain devoted to small businesses; keeping their costs reasonable, while still paying fair, livable wages. Using deadstock fabrics utilizes great vintage cottons and rayons that had been shelved, and keeps them out of landfills. 

The Men‚Äôs product did well immediately. The raw denim for the Straight Selvage and Skinny Jeans are still the most popular styles. There were some production issues with sizing for the Women‚Äôs denim, so we tried to solve the problems. After a couple of years of getting to know our female customer better - I‚Äôve changed the denim silhouettes all together. Using a different fit model, we‚Äôve modified the shape of the jeans and created more unique denim styles, evolving beyond the basic five pocket. 

### Describe the process of launching the online store/business.

Creating the visual story for the brand was the biggest goal. Without a big budget, I asked friends to model and photograph for me. We went to the Crawford family ranch with motorcycles + ripped around the area, capturing what was meaningful to me: friends, family, quality goods and the quintessential California lifestyle. 

Working in trade also allowed my friends to be able to wear the jeans + tops and give me feedback on the fit and fabrics. I was able to make some adjustments before adding the styles online. I created the site through Shopify which is an easy platform that‚Äôs highly customizable with secure payment options. Mostly friends were the 1st to purchase online as a show of support. I was fortunate to partner with [Seaweed + Gravel](https://seaweedandgravel.com/), a motorcycle and apparel store in Leucadia, CA. My customer base grew immediately as they are able to try on the product in person. Because of that experience, I offer free return + exchange shipping so buying online is a little easier.  

I put a lot of thought into the packaging of the product. Receiving a well packaged + thoughtful piece changes a consumer‚Äôs opinion immediately for a brand. The styles come in logo‚Äôd muslin bags with postcard from the lookbook along with the order receipt, tied together with denim selvage tape. Whether it is a gift for someone or for yourself, each of the boxes I ship are packaged like a present. 

I spent a year developing the styles and working on ensuring all permits were filed properly. I couldn‚Äôt afford a lawyer or accountant to file all the necessary forms, so I taught myself how to. Now I‚Äôm able to assist other small businesses on how to set up their companies in California. 

### Since launch, what has worked to attract new customers?

Before the algorithm of Instagram changed, I was making a sale with nearly every 100 new followers. Now, it is much harder to attract new followers, stay in the feeds of followers and convert to sales. 

Instagram has a few key tools that are useful to businesses. Connecting the account with Facebook allowed me to track the analytics of my followers: when they are scrolling, what types of photos or products resonate with them, even to what days and times of the week are best for maximum penetration of a post. I try to track this information weekly so to better present the brand to my current followers and attract more.  

Fortunately, I‚Äôve been able to continue to team with events, friends + shops who help promote the brand. I now work with a group of female makers + designers to try to beat the algorithm. I wanted to focus on developing my female audience and have them understand my products + the value investing in a quality denim jean. 

The pod group has worked in helping to grow the female demographic without depleting the male consumer. We each like + comment on one another‚Äôs posts within the hour that they are live. This helps override the algorithm + moves your post higher in the queue of the current followers. With more likes, Instagram will even push it to more non-followers as a recommended brand to follow. I will be launching the new women‚Äôs denim styles shortly, so I hope to increase the conversion of buyers utilizing this pod group + a friend who is an Instagram influencer. 

Promoting the brand through social media is a new method for leveling the playing field with much larger brands. Most followers are attracted to the idea of discovering a company, having insider knowledge and peaks behind the scenes. I have been resistant to share much of this information, because I want folks to be attracted to the product rather than a personality. But I am learning that by utilizing the Stories Feature on Instagram, I can share more about the inner workings and small batch craft that goes into the designs without the longevity of a post. The story is just a quick snapshot to entice followers without overwhelming the consumer. 

Participating in shows, pop ups and fleas has really grown the audience; building the number of consumer‚Äôs eyes on the product. Because denim generally sells more in the fall and winter, I try to keep folks involved in the brand with new shirts, tees and vintage during the spring and summer months. 

Two major shows I participate in are [Desert + Denim](https://www.desertanddenim.com/) in Joshua Tree, CA and the [Tennessee Motorcycle and Music Revival](http://motorcyclesandmusic.com/), hosted by the Loretta Lynn Family in Hurricane Mills, TN. These two events promote small, USA made vendors and makers. Having built the jeans with motorcycle riders in mind, allows them to try on the jeans and hop on their bike at the shows; illustrating how the gap at the waistband is minimized and the knees are comfortable even bent over long periods of riding.

Becoming a regular vendor at Long Beach Flea Market has also increased the number of local folks being introduced to the brand. The Crawford Denim and Vintage Co. booth is curated to the trends of the month, like a mini store - complete with a dressing room. 

### How is everything going nowadays, and what are your plans for the future?

I scaled back last year, trying to manage the changes in the country with fewer people buying high end product at small, local boutiques. 

Some of those businesses are no longer in operation or have moved away from USA made product. A percentage of those store‚Äôs customers continue to shop my product online. I only make the styles I can afford to. The goal is to keep incrementally growing the customer base and maintain steady, positive sales online + in select shops with more unique and limited edition product. 

After years of perfecting the fit of the jeans, I‚Äôd like to introduce the brand to more established boutiques with great online businesses in addition to their brick and mortars. Working with fewer but more strategic locations will help establish the brand name and product. 

I continue to sew the women‚Äôs smallest batches of styles and the customized product, which takes a lot of time. I gratefully have an intern to help during the busiest of times. Over the long term, I‚Äôd like to employ another full time person to help with all aspects of the business; design and sewing, customer service + fulfillment, photo shoots and website maintenance. Currently my sister Maggie steps into help, who‚Äôs assistance is invaluable! 

Since I also work with and consult for other small brands, my time is very limited. I am still trying to balance each work obligation + my personal time, maintaining a healthy lifestyle while meeting deadlines. My goal in having another employee that can share my role will enable us both to accomplish it all.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful  advantageous?

Kindness gets you far. Being a brand that works to partner + help other businesses really helps to showcase each one of us all together. We can have our own individual voice within a community, unifying us as makers. We have all pitched in to help one another. One brand or boutique‚Äôs success is a reflection of all of our efforts. 

&gt; Anything that could go wrong, did.

I worked with a larger company within the first year of business, that wanted to promote small California makers. I was nervous about overextending my budget and over taxing my small audience in the hopes of growing my business. Anything that could go wrong, did. 

Even though my product was well received, I did not have control over how the larger company displayed it online. The company‚Äôs marketing team decided that they didn‚Äôt like the project and very purposefully minimized it online. Trying to deal with multiple divisions within their organization as a one-woman brand was unevenly pitted and unrealistic. 

I luckily took some precautions within my contract to avoid major financial losses, but I am still trying to recover from those losses. It was a great lesson to listen to my instincts. It was also good to know not to overextend my customer‚Äôs or my own bandwidth. Just because they were willing to buy one piece, does not ensure they will buy all of your product month after month.   

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

I use Shopify for the website, Square for selling in person and Paypal + Venmo to invoice personal sales. 

I rely mostly on USPS ‚Ä¶ and have become great friends with my local post office. Shipping online through USPS is super easy and less expensive than any other carrier. 

I am just starting to use MailChimp to reach a broad audience of newsletter readers. I try to send out a monthly message, so not to bombard customers but also let them know where we are going to be popping up. 

Tumblr is a great vehicle in addition to Instagram for my showcasing the brand‚Äôs product through photography and inspirational images. I can tell a full story of what‚Äôs developing behind the scenes and influencing my designs. My Tumblr feed has been named one of the top denim trend blogs. 

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources for your business and why?**

I listen religiously to [How I Built This](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this). I am a big fan of the Ted Radio Hour, but How I Built This directly relates to all of the ups and downs of being a business owner. It‚Äôs a great reminder that being a small business owner takes a lot of time and endurance for all the ups and downs. Being hard working and ready for everything really is the everlasting message in each of their stories. Luck is what you make of it. 

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

Having an alternate source of income will help minimize any lows in sales. It‚Äôs the insurance of making rent that allows you to focus on the brand or business that you are trying to grow. It‚Äôs not easy, but every entrepreneur has had some source of steady income that can get them through the tough months. 

I built the brand around the brand, not around myself. It helps eliminate the personal emotions that can get tied to product ‚Ä¶ meaning that if folks don‚Äôt all love a photo on Instagram, it‚Äôs the style or the photo, not how *you* look in the product. 

I hardly ever show my own photo on Instagram or Tumblr. I focus instead on the product + showcase the folks and friends who embody the California lifestyle of the brand. The stories we can tell together through these visuals are most important in articulating the message of Crawford Denim and Vintage Co."

This semester was extremely difficult for me and I was more focused on passing my classes than securing an internship for the summer and I should have tried to look harder.


Would it be more likely that I would get an internship next summer? Should I work on several projects this summer instead ? I don't know if a project will help me as much as an internship. Should I keep looking for an internship even though it is the summer already ? I am willing to get a coding internship from a small company that can only pay me $10 an hour at this point. I just need to get my foot in the door. Since I didn't secure an internship this summer, would it make it harder for me next summer?

$Me - IT student, really really good with computers and networks already, couldn't take Senior/4000 level classes as a freshman due to some CompSci rule apparently.   

$Systems - Grouchy, didn't really fix anything to the public eye, somehow unstable DHCP using public IP's internally and 6 DNS entries per IP was a normal configuration.  

$ITSec - Had some very interesting ideas about network security.
$NetTeam - Smart, overloaded, at the mercy of someone else calling the shots.
$CIO - Got problems somewhat sorted out, definitely better than the previous 2 years.    
$Bradford - Actual name of the NAC, it's terrible and very forgetful implementation.      

This was the story, campus network generally was bad, when it worked, it was okay, but there were many days where no one could get online, sometimes it was the fault of IT, usually just DHCP dying, and lastly because of the magnetic attraction fiber has with heavy equipment - [as it is SCP-3709 compliant] (http://nn5n.com/index.php?language=English&amp;prefix=scp&amp;object_number=3709&amp;postfix=en&amp;page=object&amp;range=1-99&amp;page_type=current) it's great read and it explains why fiber gets cut so much.   

Problems would always manifest themselves in the Fall/Autumn semester which was the freshmen flood of new students.

I immediately recognized the problem even before I started - DHCP scope/pool exhaustion!
IT was informed promptly.  
IT did not succeed in improving the situation.  
Off and on the network would go, round and round IT would go, never to stop or make anything much better.      
  
One time, at a student banquet, we got to meet various upperclassmen and visit the job fair, one guy was talking in an IT group about the student who kept hammering on them to fix the internet.  
\*I introduced myself as that student*
He responded in a joking manner, so you're the one who kept telling me how to do my job!  
I have ideas, I know of ways that work, trying to help \*shrug*    
  
So, I applied and made it on a helpdesk position at the school, never did make it to Systems or NetOps, but I rocked that helpdesk and was assigned team lead to ~~boss around~~ teach interns what it's like to wrangle computers.    
  
A year or so later, a wild IT Security officer appears!
They host an open student forum about various concerns and making improvements for the campus. I ask about getting off of public addresses internally, she says due to various compliance reasons, they can't do that yet.    

$Me - Ooookay... can you at least fix DHCP to not crash every week?    
$S - Uhhhh, work in progress...     

A few months later due to $ITSec's decisions...     
$Me - Hey guys, do you have email?    
Jack - No...   
Steve [from a previous story about a jar] (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/75ycz9/tales_from_desktop_support_the_jar/) 
No...   
  
Jack inquires in the weekly IT meeting, $ITSec had changed system passwords without telling anyone and broke about 7 different and very important services. Including a firewall rule change that denied all email connections in and out of the College.    

That was a fun morning on the helpdesk, the phone never did stop ringing...     

3 month's later it's midterm exam week and as the evening progresses, the connections are dropping off one by one, not good, not good!   

I run over to the datacenter and inform them.   
$Systems- No it's not, what do you know kid?    
$Me \*internally* Apparently more than you...    
$Me \*externally* Watch, see my phone not getting an address?   
The network/DHCP is dying!      
$Systems- Bugger off!  

You guessed it, the entire network floundered for the rest of the weekend.      

A New CIO:  
 His arrival is announced in a very formal and professional way, like an esteemed scholar would write a sonnet at sunset. I email him with the eloquence of a Renaissance poet describing how there is more downtime than uptime and DHCP must be fixed to not ever crash under extremely high demand every fall/spring. He acknowledges it and says it will be prioritized accordingly.       

For a while, things did get alot better, then there was some political power struggle which drove off a good part of the IT team and that means all of the good people with great ideas left...     
  
Suddenly, a new NAC arrives without warning or surveying the students on what they want out of an awesome network. Bradford was unleashed and stomped out all hope of having a reliable, fast, or efficient network access.    

Me \*thinking* - You know what, since all web requests are redirected the portal, let me change my DNS to 8.8.8.8, BOOM! Bypassed!   
Next semester, all DNS requests are now forwarded internally through Bradford, you're welcome said the IT guys. ;)    

Well kids, it was fun while it lasted.   
  
Bradford was notorious to forget previously registered staff computers, three computers a week was the average where a professor would submit a request that they're not getting email/internet anymore.Can IT reach the computer remotely? Nope! What's the IP? Bradford Isolation network, figures \*rolls eyes*   

We had to submit port and computer exemptions all the time just to get computers imaged, staff online, and new systems deployed, it was a huge waste of time and $DesktopSupport had to bug $Networking quite frequently to speed up the process.    
 
They moved Bradford to wired only because of how much of a pain wireless was for the students, I would say that there was a 25% failure rate to get people online for the wifi. After $Net moved to a $HoneyComb PPSK, it dropped/dripped the failure rate down to 10% but for some reason, $ITsec did not believe in 802.1X/Radius even after multiple professional colleagues recommended it.   
  
Once again, the PPSK method was not presented or held an open forum for wifi modernization, they just announced, hey we're doing a thing, call the helpdesk if it breaks, may the odds be ever in your favor. During this time, they finally NAT'ed the wifi network, it only took asking them 4000 times and 15 years of prep time /s.    
  
Last in the whirlwind take, internet failures on the WAN side happened multiple times, and there was one outage that was $DeathStarISP's fault and was never disclosed what happened, because when you kill cellular + wired service for a large portion of the state, there's going to be a rather large and annoyed set of students needing to finish exams.    
  
Randomly one fine spring afternoon, the internet just stopped, and it wasn't DNS or DHCP like before. $RandomProf - Well, there goes the online instructional tools, powerpoint time!  
We get an announcement later saying there was digging happening in a nearby city, combined with the SCP compliant fiber and assorted heavy construction that goes with the project, they predictably they cut the only connection serving the school.  

Did they relocate the fiber away from the construction area?   
No....    

Did it get cut more than once?   
Yep! 4 times during especially busy parts of the semesters.  
  
Did they learn their lesson and get a second connection?    
Eventually...    

Throughout all of it, I learned what not to do, I discovered some new things, aced senior level Networking without ever having to study, and sharpened my tech support skills tenfold while repairing friend and company computers/figuring out the kludgy network design/asking why on earth would you do it this way?‚Äã  "

I'm in my 2nd year of university in the US (east coast), transferred to a university after 2 years at a community college (4 total years in college so far). I'm 22 years old. I started as an IT major at the community college, but went into CS at the university as I saw it had more job opportunities (so I lost a semester or two taking irrelevant classes). I have a 3.153 GPA so far, just recently went into the computer security track at school and it will now be a total 6.5 years in college before I can graduate (some future classes are only offered in the fall, so spring 2020 I have no classes and it delays my graduation by a semester). I am an average/sub-average student, I get As in project-based classes, Cs/Bs in Comp Sci classes with tests, and Cs consistently in math classes. I put effort into studying but I just can't seem to make my grades reflect that. I try to work on personal projects in Java but rarely find the time. I also work as a lab assistant for the CS department at my school. I just recently got a ""casual employment"" thing lined up for a defense contractor on the east coast.

I'll be real, I went into CS for the lucrative income opportunites. Being low/mid middle class and surrounded by rich people in middle/high school lead to jealousy of the rich developing at a fairly young age. I come from a family of artists, and I had no experience in Comp Sci entering into the degree.

So now that you know my background, I'd like to say that I'm concerned that my track record is really far below average. I'm stressed that I won't be able to compete with other CS students, and I often compare myself to other people in my major (in my head, not vocally), always finding myself coming up short. I'm surrounded by people who just know what they're doing, know all the material, have great gpas, and have internships with places like NASA or SpaceX. I feel like more of a failure because it's taking me 6.5 years to get a degree with such a low gpa. Any words of advice and/or comments from much wiser CS graduates or professionals would be greatly appreciated."
8jo6x2,7,2018-05-15,Really unhappy with my internship; they're encouraging me to apply full time and I have no other job offers. Help?,cs_throws,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8jo6x2/really_unhappy_with_my_internship_theyre/,"*going to be as general as possible to maximize anonymity*

Just graduated (yay), so I'm currently on the job hunt.

Some background: I took an internship last summer doing work that I knew I was going to enjoy, and throughout it I was pretty happy with the work I was doing because I was interested in working with the proposed tech stack (mobile dev basically). Note that this was not a SWE role, but rather a mobile app dev position.

Before I left to return to school, I was offered a chance to be a remote intern and I took it because the pay was great and I set my own hours. However, since then, I've been placed on different projects completely unrelated to the original. My current project is mundane and the tech stack is completely unrelated to the original work, which I'm not particularly happy with.

The problem: Recently I was told by my mentor that if I took a full time role, it would be very unlikely that I ever work with the original tech stack (basically, almost never do mobile dev). The work that was described to me sounded boring and frankly I'm not interested in doing it. I'm also not very well versed in what I'm supposed to be doing (certainly not as well as mobile dev), so most of the time I sit around trying to figure basics out or troubleshoot rather than get meaningful work done. It's chill, but also really boring.

Important note: I would not be able to remain remote if I became a full time employee. I would have to move.

I've been continuously encouraged by my mentor to apply full time, especially since I just graduated and they know I have my degree, but I honestly don't want to work here. I feel like it'll be a career killer, and the slow pace the organization moves at is almost driving me nuts. I'm applying to other places in the mean time, but I just had a bad interview and I'm not feeling too great about that...

Should I just be an adult about it, suck it up and apply anyway? Obviously it isn't guaranteed even my internship will give me an offer, but if they do, should I just take it and quit when something better comes up, no matter how soon? I'm also in the interview processes with other companies, and plan on taking any of them over my current place if I'm given an offer.

Thanks!"

I will be graduating soon with an IT Degree (with business) and am looking at internships before the degree is complete. I have worked in university environments in office assistant jobs, computer lab technician jobs, and my current job is university help desk/support.

I want to know if you guys would recommend an ideal environment to learn about IT and help desk? I'm looking for decent training, everything else I will learn on my own until I get up to speed. I would be fine working 40 hour work weeks and whatnot, just want to finish up the degree. 

Some Industries I would like: Anything from a technology company, corporate health care such as Kaiser, and everyday businesses (Medium to large). 

Question: Should I avoid school district IT work? The reason why I am concerned is because I want to make sure my skills are a.) current, and b.) relevant. 

Strengths: Communication, lots of past job experience, customer service and being professional.
Weaknesses: Awkward at first, aloof, poor GPA (mostly from business classes, not IT classes). 

TLDR; What is the best environment to learn a LOT about IT from the ground up? Healthcare? Tech firms? Should I avoid public school districts? Location: Southern California

Thanks for help."
8jomj7,3,2018-05-15,Twin brother credit mixed file,pfchelppls,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/8jomj7/twin_brother_credit_mixed_file/,"tl;dr when entering my credentials along with my sin# into any credit check (whether I do it on credikarma or Transunion or a cc company checks) my twin brothers credentials show up along with his sin. Basically credit bureau either doesn't know I exist or they think I am the same person as my twin. 

*note, me and my twin have very similar names (2 letters apart), the same address, similar phone numbers (2 numbers apart), same date of birth (obviously), and similar sin numbers (only last 3 digets differ)


Hello, I'm 21 years old student and my credit seems to be messed up.

A year ago I thought it was about time to get a credit card, I didn't have a proper income since I was a full time student at a uni in Ontario. I had osap, financial support from my parents, my own saving and a part time job for the summer. I applied to BMO's student card and was rejected. I thought it was super weird since it was a card made for students/no credit. I thought it was cause of my lack of a real job and continued to use the PC credit card I was cosigned under my dad for my purchases.


Fast forward to this winter, I tried to open a tangerine chequing account because they had the $50 per referral promo going on (me and all my housemates did it togather to have more takeout money for exam season) but upon account creation they said I needed to submit something called a proof of sin where I had to go to a service Canada with my passport (expired) and send them the document to prove my sin number is mine. None of my roomates had this happen to them, I asked them and said it was just a random check. I didn't have time to renew my passport, wait on that then go to service Canada all while studying for exams and by the time exams were done the promo was over so to this day my tangerine account is in limbo.


Fast forward again to now(summer '18) I have a well paying full time summer internship, so I thought I would take a crack at applying for my own student BMO credit card. Well I applied (according to their site it only take 60 seconds to be approve or rejected) and they couldn't approve me in the 60 second and I'm gonna hear from them in 10 days. (the same exact thing happened to me last summer) I thought no way my credit can be that bad, all my expenses are paid with debit, all of my bills are paid in full every time under the credit card cosigned with my dad and I have a real job. 

So I make an account on creditkarma, I put in my name, phone, address, dob and sin and it wouldn't let me sign up, I retried the signup without my sin and it went through to the next page where it asks information about me, one of the questions was ""what are the last 4 digits of your SIN"", none of the options there were mine so I clicked a random one and it went through(??).
On the page I see my twin brothers name, my twins phone number along with mine, our address (live together) under account credentials. Under credit accounts I see my fido bill, my student loans and his student loans along with all the attempted credit card/bank account opening I made with BMO and tangerine and also a score of 620.

I called Transunion and had him log me in with my credentials on his system and... My brother name, number sin and those 3 accounts show up, he informed me that we currently have something called a mixed account and I need to mail them to have this fixed.

I have drafted up a letter outlining the situation as well as my info and his info, I'll send it with two forms of my ID and two forms of his ID.

Is there anything else I need to send I can't find an official form online that fits my needs, they're all about fraud. My situation is basically Transunion either doesn't know I exist or thinks me and my brother are the same person. Will they accept a regular printed letter without a form from their website? Why is our(?) credit score so low and if it's because of the mixed account thing will it recover once I get my account seperated from his?"

They have experience with C++ and a little bit of Java. I'm wondering what books you would recommend. 

This person will be working on web applications. These web applications are primarily ASP.NET MVC web applications, but there is one web service application written with ASP.NET MVC Core 2.0.

The intern will be with the company for roughly 3 months. After they leave, the books will stay with the company and possibly (hopefully) be used to teach C# to people with multiple (10, 15, 20+) years of experience in Java and various other languages. We are going to terminate a contract with a third-party company and will be needing to rewrite (most likely in C#) an entire web application (that still uses JSPs), so these books will be used by other member of my team.

The book I primarily used to learn C# was written in 2005 (I read it 3 years ago, so it was dated then) and I'm not too sure what has come out since then that would be good. 

I do know Jon Skeet has published a couple C# in Depth books, but I'm not sure if those would be good for an intern with no C# experience, however, they may be good for the other people (and me)."

So I am in my final year of university (Communications), and I did an internship which already ended (about two weeks ago). I was at news and opinion website covering events and writing about them, doing interviews and some design for banners, etc. 

Now, the website is independent, 3 people created the website/idea, and they have some people write columns (no idea if they get paid, they are mainly writers that work on city newspapers, so maybe they just do it for fun?) and they have mainly people who are doing internships and other people that help around (without getting paid, to my knowledge). They don't seem to earn a lot of money, that's why I mention this. 

Before my internship ended they told me they would like me to stay in a paid position, they are launching a cultural website and I was told they wanted me to be the web editor. They didn't mention exactly what I was going to do and I didn't ask because it's still in the process and they have a lot more to work on. I said yes, they said it would probably launch in June. Once my internship was done, my boss let me know and said ""but we'll keep working"", and because he told me before what I just said, I was just like ""okay"". Since then he has asked me to cover about 3 events, edit some pieces to be ready to publish and asked me if I already had a person in mind for the next interview. I did all of that, and I don't know what to think. I am not getting paid to do that, and he hasn't mentioned anything about paying me, which makes me think they'll just pay me when they launch the website. I don't know if they think i'm just helping around because I like it or what. 
I don't mind doing the work, but it's just weird that no one has mentioned me anything about my pay, and I don't want to be taken advantage of. 

But also, maybe that's just something I need to do? I mean, many people have to work for free to get started, or volunteer. I mean, is not like this is my dream job, but I'm getting experience and it could be good for my resume (I have worked before in many things, just not related to my degree). I am interested in being the web editor, but also the way they work sometimes drives me nuts because it's a small company and they want everyone to do a bit of everything. Just a few hours ago my boss called me to say that he had 3 new interns doing (all of them) what I normally do alone, (going to an event, doing interviews with the organizers, writing about it and taking pictures and video). And he said he also asked them for ideas about how they want the website to look, and he has asked me the same thing before, we are not a web designers.

Anyways, this is too long already, i apologize, my main concern is to keep working for free. I don't know how to bring it up, I don't like feeling used, but I also don't want to be spoiled, maybe it's something I just need to do.

Thanks."
8jpwct,267,2018-05-15,The Time Lead Cut Traders off from Profit,charish,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8jpwct/the_time_lead_cut_traders_off_from_profit/,"So, this is one that I remembered after conducting an interview yesterday for an IT intern position where the chat at the end became more relaxed and I started remembering some of the more hilarious and frustrating times at my first job post-graduation.


***Background***

My first gig out of college was working for an international, multi-billion dollar news agency (henceforth known as **$EvilCorp**) that also had a financial division that provided an application for ~~a bunch of spoiled, over-grown brats~~ finance folks to do trades, calls, puts, research and analysis, view ticker info, etc. I helped support the back-end which consisted of about 3,000 Linux-based market data servers around the world located at customer co-los or our data centers all being fed from said data centers by dedicated circuits (ISDNs all the way up to OC48 connections) at a Tier II/Tier III level. In other words, we dealt with issues that affected multiple users at a client or multiple clients --- or as I liked to call the group I belonged to, ""The 'shit hits the fan' extinguisher."" Despite the stress and starting to grey at a young age, it was fun (most of the time) as hell and I learned more there than I did in college.

We were a 24/7 shop due to the global nature of our industry and the various exchanges around the world. My shift was from 7am to 3pm which I both loved and hated: the quiet before the ~~daily shitstorm~~ trading day started, avoiding rush hour on the commute, lack of sleep due to being constantly on-call, starting to grey within my first year there, and leaving the office before the average Joe/Jane in the professional world. It meant I could avoid the crowds in bars after a hard day most of the time or the end-of-day rush hour to get home.

Finally, we had a monitoring system with a GUI written in [TCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl) back in the 90s with a Java back-end. As crappy as it was even on the best days, it was pretty damn thorough. We had alerting set up for the servers on everything from resource utilization to process' statuses to thresholds of bad web requests (400s and 500s, namely) to hardware as well as the network side of things which consisted of both the client dedicated circuits and our data centers' infrastructure. There was barely anything that we didn't know about and that which we didn't we simply wrote new hooks and rules for alarm triggers. The alarms that popped up were all color-coded according to severity, which was very hipster-y of us since the U.S. would go on to use almost the same exact scheme immediately after 9/11 (take that, [Tom Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Ridge)!). This monitoring system was more or less our sun and our team revolved around it.

***The Characters***

$Ego = ```whoami``` (a.k.a., me)

$Cyril = echo ""Older co-worker close to early retirement who worked the same shift as me. Huge fan of Archer and a lively fellow.""

$ISPTech = echo ""Random ISP tech on the phone.""

$MS = Our monitoring system. Not a character, but at times it seemed to obtain sentience for brief periods for the sole purpose of spiting us, the team.

$Hammond = echo ""One of the two dayshift managers. A Ukrainian guy not much older than I was, he was a hard-ass but one of the most techie guys I knew both in and out of $EvilCorp. Also my mentor during this time with a tough-love friendship.""

$Troll = echo ""One of the evening shift managers, even though he came later in the morning than the morning managers. Laid back guy who loved to troll the other managers and subordinates, sometimes too much. But, all in all, we had plenty of laughs with him.""

***The Story***

I walked into the office at the unholy time of 6:30am when I spoke two words worth of greetings to my two overnight colleagues through a stifled yawn and bloodshot eyes. As per my built-up morning routine at this point (9 months after my start date), I dropped my messenger bag off at my cube and shuffled my way to the office kitchen to make myself some chai which I consumed two cups of before making a third and going back to the main floor. Being on the dawn shift that takes over from the graveyard one, I always chatted with the overnight shift about life, love, and setbacks... and also the hand-off for any outstanding issues, tickets, or calls that might have arisen during their shift or that carried over from the day before. Luckily, our monitoring system and all else was quiet aside from stuff that was up there for the last 24 hours plus so the overnight analysts said, ""Kthxbai,"" and bolted for the elevators to sleep in their own ~~coffins~~ beds.

A few minutes after they left, $Cyril strolled in through the door, chipper as ever at this unholy hour with his poor imitation of The Count's laugh. We both finally got settled in our adjacent cubicles and started combing over everything the graveyard shift passed on to see what we could actually make progress on at 7:05 in the morning. There wasn't much apart from a few follow-up emails bugging a variety of clients' techs for the latest status of action that they had to take on their end before we proceeded further (read: telling them to do their jobs so we could do ours and meet SLAs before being scorned for not doing so). Some time later, though, was when things *really* began to pick up.

&gt; $Cyril: Hey $Ego, uhhh, is $MS spazzing on my terminal or is this legit?

My head swiveled to the third monitor on my right that was hooked up to a thin client from where we accessed all our servers and networking hardware via SSH as well as where $MS was on display. The monitoring system was bleeding red, pushing all the less recent alarms out of view in its narrow window like a messenger wading through the crowd warning of the marching Persian horde. The alerts were for a slew of circuits, all in all about 20. Now, most of our clients had redundant circuits so these were a mix of primaries and secondaries that went down but there were a few smaller, stubborn ones that only had one line for their feeds so these guys were down hard. $Cyril and I broke into instinctually into our ~~Spartan~~ job training and started pulling up site diagrams, remoting into routers to test connectivity to make sure there weren't any false alarms. Unfortunately for $Cyril and I, they weren't false positives, *but* there was one silver lining in all of this: most of the circuits had a common ISP. The ones that didn't, in these cases, were usually assumed that even though the circuit was managed by another ISP, they probably had a hand-off to the affected ISP somewhere along the path. Once we confirmed that the lines were actually down, $Cyril and I flipped a coin to see who would get stuck with calling the circuits out to the ISP. Needless to say, I got stuck with the task.

I started creating tickets for each circuit under every &gt;affected client in our CRM/ticketing system, Siebel (if you've ever used Siebel, you may think of it as the digital devil incarnate of ticketing systems much like my group and I did). There I was, cloning and editing tickets while on hold with the ISP when, after creating the second to last ticket, I finally got a human being on the phone.

&gt; $ISPTech: Thank you for calling $ISP, can I get your company and circuit ID?

&gt; $Ego: Hi, this is $Ego from $EvilCorp. We're seeing a metric ton of circuits that went down about 15 minutes ago. **starts listing off the circuit IDs**.

&gt; $ISPTech: Is it alright if we do some non-intrusive testing?

&gt; $Ego: Think it's safe to say that this is something larger.

&gt; $ISPTech: ... Right. Is there an internal ticket number I can reference?

&gt; $Ego: **finally getting around to creating the ""master"" ticket to which all the previously created ones will be linked to** Ticket number from our side is 0123456789.

It was 8am now by this point which the time that $Hammond walked into the office, almost passing by me and $Cyril when he paused to look at the giant 80-inch screen that loomed over what we called ""the platform"" (I'll explain this later) with a raised eyebrow and his coffee halfway to his mouth.

&gt; $Hammond: Is anyone ---

&gt; $Ego: **raises hand**

&gt; $Hammond: Do we have a hot topic? (*Aside*: ""Hot topic"" in our nomenclature was basically a master ticket to which multiple tickets of the same issue for different clients were linked to)

&gt; $Ego: It's 01234556789; I'll email it over.

&gt; $Hammond: Have the clients been informed?

&gt; $Ego: I just got off the phone with $ISP, so I haven't had a chance to. We do have a few single circuit sites that are down.

&gt; $Hammond: $Cyril, call the sites and see what shape they're in.

Phone calls and emails went out to the affected clients to let them know what was going on. Naturally, the ones who were in single circuit sites were in a panic and we (me and $Cyril) had to calm them down and manage their expectations to let them know that this was out of our direct control, thus they would ~~have to untwist their drawers~~ be patient. Privately, though, we were thinking, ""These folks are idiots for not having any redundancy."" Now, because this impacted so many clients, it was unofficial policy to ~~pester~~ follow up with the ISP(s) on an hourly basis for the latest status and possibly see if there was something that we could do from our end to alleviate the issue in the interim. If you've ever worked with an ISP in a B2B capacity, this tends to be near impossible as they'll insist that their techs are working on the issue along with few technical details about the problem. Fast forward to about 10:30, we finally received an update that was worth communicating to our clients: they had found an above-ground backbone line that had the issue and they were dispatching techs to the site to fix it up.

Okay, fine. So, me, as the owner of the issue/master ticket, got to twiddle my thumbs even faster. While looking at $MS some time later, the open cuts in my day known as the red, critical alarms began disappearing in semi-quick succession. I reached out to $ISP to get a root cause and the conversation went like this (paraphrasing as this was years ago):

&gt; $Ego: Hi, this is $Ego from $EvilCorp calling about ticket $ISPdigitdigitblahblah.

&gt; $ISPTech: Give me a moment to get it pulled up... Reading through it now...

Then $ISPTech starts bursting out in wholehearted laughter.

&gt; $Ego: ... Dare I ask the root cause?

&gt; $ISPTech: So, the trunk line that was affected was severed by a stray bullet.

&gt; $Ego: **face starts contorting to avoid bursting out into laughter at this point** Well... that's a new one.

After I hung up with $ISPTech and started updating my ticket, $Troll walks over to get an update ($Hammond was down for a smoke which, sadly, I couldn't join him for; our smoke sessions served as unofficial meetings and status updates and general chat).

&gt; $Troll: So what did $ISP say?

&gt; $Ego: A bullet cut the fiber line.

&gt; $Troll: ... Let the clients know, but be more, uh, euphemistic about it.

The final calls and emails went out, but I couldn't resist the constant muting of my phone to try and contain my laughter. The clients that were affected were on the opposite side of the country, hence why they were impacted the most.

TL;DR: None. Read at your own leisure. :)

So, I was going to school in MT, Rocky Mountain College, probally one of the worst CS programs in the nation, and after two years of being jerked around I made the choice to move back home to Columbus OH, and try my hand at a diffrent school. 

Well, upon leaving rocky added a $3000 balance to my student account for various things, (mostly family housing), and now I am unable to even start a transfer process until it is paid off.

I am 27 years old, married, with two kids, and the sole-earner for my family. I really don't know how to get around this, I have been putting every ounce of myself into making a career of this, and I feel like this is really going to mess things up for me...

I would obviously like to aply for entry level software developement jobs. I have worked for a single small startup for a semester as a internship at my previous job, as a junior full stack developer where I really got to show my talents and learned allot about how capable I was to preform this kind of job.

I am a bit initmiidated by a big city job market, as Billings MT is really light on options, and it's easy to spot things that are a waste of time.

What I want to know is should I send out my resume, for these jobs, or wait. I am worried about making myself look stupid or bad in the eyes of possible employers, however I really need to start earning. I do feel I could be a capable developer in my current state and would like to get to work, however I don't see many people taking me seriously with my current resume.

TLDR: Moved from MT to OH to transfer schools, blind-sided by a housing charge that has my transcript on hold, can't pay in full so I can't transfer schools, need to find work but unsure if I would simply hurt myself by putting myself out there."

So I am in my final year of university (Communications), and I did an internship which already ended (about two weeks ago). I was at news and opinion website covering events and writing about them, doing interviews and some design for banners, etc. 

Now, the website is independent, 3 people created the website/idea, and they have some people write columns (no idea if they get paid, they are mainly writers that work on city newspapers, so maybe they just do it for fun?) and they have mainly people who are doing internships and other people that help around (without getting paid, to my knowledge). They don't seem to earn a lot of money, that's why I mention this. 

Before my internship ended they told me they would like me to stay in a paid position, they are launching a cultural website and I was told they wanted me to be the web editor. They didn't mention exactly what I was going to do and I didn't ask because it's still in the process and they have a lot more to work on. I said yes, they said it would probably launch in June. Once my internship was done, my boss let me know and said ""but we'll keep working"", and because he told me before what I just said, I was just like ""okay"". Since then he has asked me to cover about 3 events, edit some pieces to be ready to publish and asked me if I already had a person in mind for the next interview. I did all of that, and I don't know what to think. I am not getting paid to do that, and he hasn't mentioned anything about paying me, which makes me think they'll just pay me when they launch the website. I don't know if they think i'm just helping around because I like it or what. 
I don't mind doing the work, but it's just weird that no one has mentioned me anything about my pay, and I don't want to be taken advantage of. 

But also, maybe that's just something I need to do? I mean, many people have to work for free to get started, or volunteer. I mean, is not like this is my dream job, but I'm getting experience and it could be good for my resume (I have worked before in many things, just not related to my degree). I am interested in being the web editor, but also the way they work sometimes drives me nuts because it's a small company and they want everyone to do a bit of everything. Just a few hours ago my boss called me to say that he had 3 new interns doing (all of them) what I normally do alone, (going to an event, doing interviews with the organizers, writing about it and taking pictures and video). And he said he also asked them for ideas about how they want the website to look, and he has asked me the same thing before, we are not a web designers.

Anyways, this is too long already, i apologize, my main concern is to keep working for free. I don't know how to bring it up, I don't like feeling used, but I also don't want to be spoiled, maybe it's something I just need to do.

Thanks."
8jq1tv,223,2018-05-15,Emily's Envy,Rakushasu,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8jq1tv/emilys_envy/,"Emily always aimed to be at the top. She just had to be number one. There was only one problem: Her sister Heather.

Heather had it all. She was pretty, smart, athletic and by far the most popular girl in school. To top it all off, she did it without even trying.

Emily herself was pretty and smart too, but Heather was on a whole different level. She always outshined her younger sister.

I got to know the two of them when I was in second grade. They moved into the house next door with their dad. It was only natural for us to become friends. Especially Emily and I became pretty close, considering that we were in the same grade.

It‚Äôs hard to say when Emily's envy began. It might have started during middle school, but now I think it did much earlier.

Emily never showed it openly. In front of her sister and her father, she wore the mask of the ideal younger sibling. She pretended to be happy for her sister, to even admire her. Deep inside though, she was furious.

I knew because Emily and I had become best friends during middle school. One late afternoon, when walking home together after school, she told me all about it.

""She is so goddamn perfect, it's unfair!""

""Who is?"" 

""Heather! It's always her. Today as well! 'Oh Emily, one day I am sure you are going to be as pretty as your sister' Ugh, how I hate it!""

""Oh look who is talking!"" I said laughing. ""You are stunning yourself.""

""Oh shush, Lizzy! That's not the point.""

""I was just trying-""

""Just stop. Don't you think I know that?""

I didn't say a thing.

""How many times do you think I have to hear how I am *almost* as perfect as her? How do you think I feel when a guy I like asks me about her? I am sick and tired of it!""

Soon she was ranting to herself. There was no point to say anything. Instead, I kept walking next to her.

It was only the first of many similar rants. 

Heather graduated at the end of the school year. She didn't move on to university. Instead, she followed her dream to become a professional dancer.

It seemed Emily's time to shine had come. Finally, her sister had left the throne to her. At least that's what Emily had thought.

Emily might have made it to the top, but Heather's shadow was still looming above her. Guys only talked about how they'd kill for a chance with Heather. The trophy case still showed Heather's many accomplishments. Even the cheerleaders aspired to be just as good as Heather. No one talked about Emily.

Two years later Emily and I graduated as well. The close friends we were, we decided to attend university together. Emily majored in fashion design, while nerdy little me went into the science field.

We even moved into the same dorm. Sure, we weren't roommates, but we lived only one floor away from one another.

It was during our second semester that Facebook's popularity exploded in Germany. I was quick to sign up. I had been on Myspace for years and had been a member of a few other online communities. It was only natural. 

Emily was more reluctant than me. Only after I annoyed her for weeks did she finally sign up. She was quick to discover that her sister had a profile too.

Every once in a while, when I turned up at her room, I'd find her glaring at her computer screen. She'd be going through Heather's profile.

She never admitted it, of course, but I knew she was stalking her sister.

When Facebook launched the fan page feature, I played around with it a bit. I suggested to Emily that it might be a good idea to create one for her designs. At first, she was against it, but once I pointed out the advantages, she gave in. To her and even my surprise, she got quite a few initial fans. After some weeks this number had grown to more than a hundred. Two months later it was above a thousand.

The next time I came over to her dorm room, I found her on the phone.

""Oh, you have no idea how happy I am. I mean, that is more than a thousand people. It's unbelievable. Who would have guessed that I'd be so popular?""

When Emily saw me, I pointed at her and then at the phone to get her to tell me who it was. She looked at me confused for a few seconds before she understood.

""Oh, it's Heather!""

I frowned for a moment, then I said a quick hello and found myself a place to sit down.

""Yeah, Lizzy helped me to set it up.""

""No, I think that's not it. It might just be talent, you know?""

She laughed into the phone. It sounded so fake and empty.

""Oh? Yeah, I guess. I mean, of course. I am happy to help.""

Her voice was as sweet as honey and her face distorted into a smug smile. It made me cringe.

""Oh, it's not hard at all. I could even invite a few of my fans to like your page.""

I sighed as she said this. Emily noticed and stared me down. I only shrugged in annoyance.

""What‚Äôs that, Heather? Yeah of course. Well, Lizzy is waiting. I got to go, sorry.""

I looked up at Emily who was beaming. Not at me, but at herself. I couldn't remember the last time I'd seen her that happy.

""What was that all about?"" I asked her. 

""I told Heather a bit about my fan page.""

She said it in the most innocent of voices.

She told me she had called Heather because she missed her. She was the only family she had left after all. The topic of the fan page came up by sheer accident. Once it was out though, Emily had to tell her sister all about it. After a while, Heather wanted to know more.

""I had to offer her some help, you know?""

I nodded, but I knew what this was about. For the first time, it was Emily who was more successful. She'd mentioned it a few times. 
Now she was the popular one, and Heather could use her help. I could see how she relished the feeling.

Every time Heather called, Emily was in a state of bliss. She'd answer the phone in the same sweet voice as before. It didn't matter where Emily was or what she was doing. We were at the bar? She'd rush off to the toilet. We were in the study hall? She'd leave for half an hour. Even when the two of us were having a movie night or hanging out with friends, she'd always rush off to answer the phone.

I tried talking to her about it, but she'd shrug it off. I was imagining things, she said.

It was a few months later when I returned to the dorms one evening. There was a ruckus going on. A crowd of people had formed on Emily's floor. From the stairs, I could hear someone yelling and screaming.

When I got closer, I saw people standing in front of Emily's door.

""That freaking bitch! Why the hell is it always her! It is always- Fuck!""

It was Emily. I could hear more curses, mixed with the sound of things breaking apart, from behind the door. I tried to open it, but it was looked.

""Hey! Emily? What's going on?""

I knocked on the door. First only a little, but then harder.

""Are you ok? What is-?""

Suddenly the door unlocked. Anger distorted Emily's face. Her eyes were puffy and bloodshot from crying. The room behind her was a mess. The floor was littered with Emily's belongings and the remains of her various designs and sketches.

""W-What the hell are you doing?"" I asked confused.

""You,"" she started. Then she took a step towards me and pushed me back.

""It was your goddamn idea!""

""Wait, what are you talking about?""

""I am talking about the stupid fan page! If you wouldn't have forced me to put this thing up, then Heather would never-""

""This is about Heather?""

""Of course it is! Not only is her page more popular than mine-""

I cut her right off.

""First of all, you were helping her all the freaking time. What did you expect? Second of all, who cares?""

""I fucking care, Lizzy! I can't freaking deal with her anymore. Why has she always got to be better than me? Can‚Äôt she let me have anything!?""

""You know why? Because Heather doesn't care about popularity or being better than others.""

That was the last straw. Emily went forward and pushed me once more, this time, hard. I tumbled backwards and hit my head against the wall.

Without another word, I turned to leave. I made my way past the crowd that had been watching and went back to my room. When I tried to see how much better Heather page was doing, I saw that Emily had deleted hers already.

I didn't speak with her for almost two weeks. One morning she called me out of the blue. I was reluctant to answer. I didn‚Äôt want to have any more insults hurled at me.

""Heather was in an accident!"" she said in an agitated voice before I could even say hello.

""Wait, Emily, what happened?""

""I don't know. I am not at the hospital yet!""

""I am coming too!""

At the hospital, I gave Emily a long hug. It didn't take long for us to find someone who was able to tell us what had happened. On the way to one of her performances, a car crashed into Heather's. One of her legs was almost crushed in the collision, and she had to be taken to the emergency room. The doctors were able to save the leg, but it was paralyzed. There was the possibility that Heather might walk again. Anything else was out of the question.

When Emily heard the news, I thought I saw the hint of a smile on her face. It was only there for a moment before sadness and tears replaced it. We hugged each other, waiting until the doctor allowed us to see Heather.

Heather didn't look up when we entered the room. It seemed like all the life had left her. When I saw her like that, I started crying. I couldn't hope to understand what was going on in her mind right now.

Having your dream taken away in a mere instant would drive anyone into depression and a state of apathy.

Emily visited her sister almost daily. During that time I didn't see much of her. The few times I asked her if we could get together, she declined. She had to take care of Heather, she said. 

""She's my sister after all. It shouldn‚Äôt matter what happened before. We only have each other, Lizzy. Since dad died, there is no one else.‚Äù

Once Heather was released from the hospital, Emily moved in with her in their old home. She said she'd take care of her sister and assist her in her daily life. To do that she took a break from university and left the dorms behind.

Heather was still in the same depressed state when I visited them the first time. She‚Äôd talk to me, but I felt a deep sadness in her words.

As the weeks passed, she started to improve. During later visits, I saw Heather smiling, and Emily, in turn, seemed to be happy. It had been ages since I had seen true affection between them.

I visited the sisters quite a lot during that time. At first, I was only there to help Emily move, but this initial visit was enough to rekindle the old friendship the three of us had shared. We spent countless evenings talking about the fun we had had together as kids and teenagers.

In time Heather's leg got better, and soon she was well enough to handle her daily life on her own. It allowed Emily to work on her fashion again.

One evening, when Emily was working on a new piece, I had a long talk with Heather. She admitted that she still didn't know what to do with her life. With a sad face she looked down at her crippled leg. I was quick to suggest that she could try to help Emily with her fashion. Maybe the two of them could do it together? Heather protested. There was no way she'd be any good at it, she said. She'd never even tried. 

In the end, I still urged her to talk to Emily. I‚Äôd not be around for some time due to a paid internship at the other end of the country. It would give her enough time to work on some fancy cloth, I said laughing.

It was two months later that Heather killed herself by jumping out of a window. I instantly made the trip back home.

No one understood what had happened. When I heard about it, I couldn't believe it. It came out of nowhere. Heather had gotten so much better, hadn't she?

At the funeral, Emily told me in tears that Heather had never gotten over the fact that she couldn‚Äôt dance anymore. Sure, Heather always put on a happy face, but eventually, it got to her. 

‚ÄúI should have seen it coming,‚Äù she said to me with tears in her eyes.

During the gathering after the funeral, Emily revealed that she'd name her new collection after her sister. It was to honor her memory, she said.

In the month to follow the collection turned out to be a huge success. Not financially of course, but the positive reception was overwhelming. Many people, both friends and strangers, urged her to put them up for sale online.

Emily's career in fashion was going well. That was until I uncovered the truth.

By now my internship was over, and I was living in the dorms again. One day I couldn't access my Facebook account. 

To restore my password, I had to access the email I used to sign up. It was an old one I didn't use anymore. When I logged in, I had a look through the emails. It was all spam, except for one by Heather.

For a moment I got goosebumps until I saw that Heather had sent it almost half a year ago.

I had no idea why she'd sent me an email. With not a little anticipation I started to read.

Heather thanked me for urging her to work with Emily. At first, she was happy to support Emily here and there, but soon she enjoyed it a lot herself.

In the next paragraph, Heather said she'd started to work on a few pieces of her own. She couldn't wait to show Emily, she wrote. Before that, she wanted a second opinion.

Attached to it were a number of pictures. When I looked through them, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. They were almost identical to Emily's new collection. The one she named after Heather.

I was furious. It couldn't be real. Only minutes later I was on my way to Emily's house. The same house in which Heather had killed herself.

When she opened the door, I confronted her about it straight away. She denied everything of course. It was bullshit, a fake, an email sent by someone else. Why did I even believe something like that? I should have called her instead.

The more I pressured her though, the more the story changed. At first, Heather had never talked to her. Then, she admitted that Heather had helped her a little. Suddenly, one of the sketches was by Heather. 

Finally though, when she had enough of my questions, she confessed everything.

""It was always just her. Heather this, Heather that. Everyone only talked about her. How she was oh so perfect. And then poor, little Heather had her accident.""

As she stood there, I saw the same smile I'd seen in the hospital. It hadn't been my imagination.

""But you know what? Once her dream was shattered, she couldn't help but barge into mine. Finally, I'd found something I loved. Finally, there was something I was good at. And you know what? You know fucking what, Lizzy? Here comes crippled Heather again.""

She was pacing left and right in anger, not even breathing as she spat out her sentences.

""Oh, how innocent she asked. *Lizzy said I should try fashion. Maybe I could try it on my own. I just want to see how things turn out.* And guess what? Things turned out amazing!""

She threw her arms up in frustration as she said the last sentence.

""Heather's designs were better than anything I ever did! Anything!""

Emily laughed for a bit and shook her head.

""She didn't even know what she was doing half the time. *Am I doing it right, Emily? Do you think this works?* Oh, it did, Heather. It was fucking great, Heather.""

She turned towards me again and took a step in my direction.

""Can you believe it, Lizzy? Can you?""

""I, I don't-""

""Of course you don‚Äôt. I couldn't either. But yet again Heather was better than me. Same as always. This time I wouldn't let her get away with it. Not this time.""

Emily still stared at me, but now her mouth twisted into a mad smile.

""You know what I did when she showed me her finished pieces? I laughed her right in the face. *Sorry Heather, but dear lord, those are terrible.* That's what I said!""

With that Emily started to giggle.

""I told her I had to hide them away before anyone could see them. *We wouldn't want people to think that not only your leg but also your arms are paralyzed, wouldn't we?*""

And with that, she broke into bouts of laughter, right in front of me.

""Oh, you should have seen her face! It was, it was-""

She had to break off to catch her breath. I just stood there, overwhelmed by this mad, insane rant.

""It was the best thing ever! The oh-so-great Heather was crying right in front of me.""

""It felt so damn good,"" she said, face red, beaming at me.

""After that, I kept urging her to help me. It was the least she could do, I said. Maybe she'd even learn a thing or two. And innocent, sweet little Heather agreed. Oh, how I enjoyed tormenting her. *This is no good, Heather. What are you even doing, Heather? Oh god, you are ruining everything, Heather.* Oh, how the tears kept flowing. She couldn't take it for long.""

""Don't tell me because of that she-""

""Killed herself?"" she finished my sentence.

""Of course! And you know what? I could have stopped her. I heard how she dragged herself up to the attic. I heard the creaking of the floorboards above me. I could have run after her, Lizzy. I could have told her I didn't mean any of it.""

And finally, her face distorted into a cruel smile.

""But I didn't. Instead, I leaned back in my chair and closed my eyes. Ten minutes later, I heard the impact.""

Now I saw the tears that were streaming from her eyes.

""Emily, you,"" but I broke up. 

""I was... I mean... I was *so* happy, Lizzy. Finally I could be the popular one. Finally it would be me!""

She stood there, smiling in a state of bliss. Then her face turned hard again as her eyes focused on me.

""If it wasn't for this one damned email,"" she spat out.

""Things would have been perfect. But you had to read it, didn't you, Lizzy?""

She took a step towards me, then another.

""But you know, Lizzy, no one has to find out about anything.""

As she moved closer towards me, I took a step back.

Then it all happened at once. Emily broke into a run. She rose her arm, and I saw something flash in her hand. Without thinking, out of sheer instinct, I raised my arms to protect myself. A piercing pain shot through me. I screamed out loud. Blood was running from my arm, and I saw the bloody pair of scissors Emily was holding in her hand.

I could see her shaking. Her eyes darted from my arm to the scissors and back.

""Lizzy, I-I didn't mean,"" she started.

""Get the fuck away from me!"" I screamed at her. I ran from the house and to my car. 

I made it to a nearby hospital. Thankfully it was a painful but minor injury.

Once I was back home, I revealed the full thing. I sent Heather's email to everyone I knew. Then I shared not only the email but also all the things Emily had confessed to me on social media.

It didn't take long for people to turn on Emily. My phone rang day and night. Calls and texts by Emily kept flooding in. I ignored them all. It wasn't long before praise for Emily turned to condemnation.

There was a lawsuit, but nothing came to it. Suicide is a divisive issue here, and my story could not be proven by one email and a minor injury I had failed to report. It was ruled that the driving force behind Heather's suicide had been her ongoing depression. 

I don't know what happened to Emily after all that.

For a while, random accounts posted spiteful comments on my Facebook profile. The same happened to a memorial page Heather's friends had created. Everyone knew it was Emily. 

After a while, things got quiet about her. Some said she moved away. Others said her guilt finally got the better of her, and she followed her sister into an early grave.

If she is alive, I am sure her envy still torments her. [Even now.](https://www.facebook.com/r.rehnwriter/)

Last week, I went to a career service to do a mock intervew (for my class) and the lady who interviewed me liked my resume and said this is the type of resume they look for because it's simple but informative. I don't think my resume is that shitty considering how bad it was before I discovered this sub. But I know I can improve it even more and I need to know how I can make it more ""internship appropriate"" if that makes any sense. I need to add my gpa but the reason why I excluded is because my gpa isn't that good (2.8-3.0) and I don't know what my major gpa is.

For the skills section, I'm wondering if I can add ""familiar with SAP and SQL"" I took accounting information systems this semester and I got to mess with sap, sql, excel vba, and power bi. I didn't certifications or anything but did become familar with those software. Can I still add them to my resume or would it be too much?

8jr7jk,1,2018-05-15,"Should I listen to my dads advice and find some place cheaper, despite the fact that I can afford the apartment?",ynot269,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8jr7jk/should_i_listen_to_my_dads_advice_and_find_some/,"Im a graduate looking to move to raleigh/Durham in July for a job. Job pays pretty well for the area so I'm thinking of living in downtown and enjoying my 20s, the apartment I'm looking at is 22% of my estimated monthly income, for reference the apartment is 1580 (includes a lot of amenities and cable/internet/trash/etc I only need to pay for utilities like water and electric outside of the 1580).

From what I'm told and my research raleigh / Durham / RTP is a very cheap area so my dad was I suppose understandably frustrated with me considering an apartment for 1500 when I can easily find one 500-800 (his words) in that area. 


The problem is I want to live down town, I've never really been a social guy but I want to enjoy my 20s, make friends, and date. I have a few friends now but I didn't really enjoy college, I worked hard to get the job I got, but I barely went to parties, didn't really have the college experience since I commuted, but that's besides the point. So I recognize that 1580 is a high price tag but I'm interested in the downtown life, being around bars cafes stuff to do in walking distance etc. during my summer internship in Boston (which is my inspiration for choosing downtown Durham) I really enjoyed the fact that everything was in walking distance, I liked that I could essentially take the T in, or walk to a bar.


Which leads me to my next point, I've already done some apartment scoping, in fact I have an apartment on reserve but I haven't signed the lease yet. I have 20 more days to decide but this one is decent like I mentioned there's a bunch of stuff included and there's a gym which is great.

I'm tired of being this introvert who lives carefully, I want to enjoy my life, go out and have fun, etc.

In the past I've been pretty self conscious (which contributed to my aversion behavior) due to my weight but I've been working on that so I'm confident that I'd have fun down there.

I can see my dads point since there are definitely much cheaper (like 500-900) places with similar if not better amenities, however these are essentially out in the country / away from downtown life/ the nearest bar would probably be a 10-15 minute drive/uber. I'd prefer for all of this stuff to be in walking distance (hence me wanting an apartment downtown). Im not even sure if I'd do it for my entire time here, I'd probably do the lease for like a year to establish myself and then consider moving away, but for now I want to live my life. 


And I'd try to explain this to my dad but I'm a first generation Asian college kid, my dad isn't necessarily fob, (he's been in America since the late 80s), but he has very traditional values. He wouldn't understand me wanting to live downtown near bars and cafes. He wouldn't understand my affinity for a more loose western life style, which again I can afford.


Tl;dr traditional Asian kid wants to do right by his father and follow him, but also wants to enjoy his life and live an a luxury apartment in downtown Durham ( that he can afford), dad is saying no because there's always cheaper. "
8jrdjm,1,2018-05-15,Should I take an offer with my old environmental consulting company? I need a lot of help.,xiaga,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8jrdjm/should_i_take_an_offer_with_my_old_environmental/,"So sorry for the novel, there's a lot to the story. 

Background information tl/dr: I got a job offer in the same small town I have a lot of emotional baggage in. I'm freaked out but this could be a good stepping stone.

I moved to San Diego after finishing college in 2014 with my then very serious boyfriend. I got a job at an environmental consulting firm working as a low level admin person standing in for someone who was on leave. 

I worked there for about seven months when a colleague reached out to me about a promotion to actually get into a position that would utilize my skills and background. In order to go for a higher up position I had to forgo my current position.  When I didn't get that I ended up having to leave. About a week later my then boyfriend broke up with me.

I was so devastated that words really don't encompass the destruction that happened to my soul. Being so young and having everything I was building ripped out from me felt like the world had ended. He stonewalled me and eventually waited me out until I left our place with nothing but a suitcase and moved in with my parents.

Fast forward to now, 3 years later and for better or worse I decided to come back to San Diego on a whim. My coworker from that same company I worked for put a word in to the manager and got me an interview. I've been offered a position there to organize/scan in their biology library and act as a field biologist as needed eventually having the opportunity to move up to be a biologist with the company (from what I can gather? Somewhat unclear.) 

The offer they've given is $22.50 an hour plus benefits (if full time) which is below market rate for a biologist position here. I spoke with the hiring manager today and she said it can't be negotiated. She did offer that they could hire me on as an ""as needed"" biologist -- there would be no commitment but the hours would be uncertain (possibly none come spring/summer) if I go that route but that way I wouldn't burn bridges if it wasn't a good fit. She explained a lot of biologists there start that way as well. 

She wants to hear back from me tomorrow. 

I have a degree in geography with a minor in ecology with 2 years of experience working as an intern in the field while in college but I really haven't worked in a serious, industry position since so I feel like I should be happy I have an in...but I can't stop crying and have no control over my body's panic reaction to this whole situation:

- my ex and I's old apartment is 3 blocks away from the company where he still has his life and new girlfriend.

- I wasn't happy at this company before (I don't know why exactly, it could have been the position, it could be my values...maybe I don't have a good head on my shoulders about it).

- I haven't been able to sleep thinking about this. 

- it's an hour commute both ways.

- I'm already homesick. I feel like I made a mistake coming back here but I felt stuck where I was.

- I want to do more with my life to help the environment and to make a good living. This is in the ballpark but not quite. Part of the reason my ex and I split up was because I wanted to Pursue ""bigger"" things but I haven't done that yet because I don't know how and I've been uncreative. 

- everything in me is screaming at me not to take it but I could be sabotaging myself. I wish I had a better offer/situation.

However... this could be a really good opportunity for me to make money and support myself so that I don't have to live at my parents anymore which was killing me‚Ä¶ I don't have to stay there and it would allow me to transition into something else while I'm paying the bills.

I feel like an idiot for not just charging for this because it's what I wanted for so long but I can't help my whole being's reaction going back to how I felt after all the trauma that went down there 3 years ago. 

I'm here now with rent to pay and bills. 
I have no other job prospects and I suppose I could go through my savings but I really don't want to because I don't have to. I want more for my life but I haven't been able to be creative enough to get anything else going for myself the last three years. 



Any advice on what to do? 

1) should I take the job? 
2) if I do should I come on full time and get the benefits and solid pay and risk burning bridges when/if I leave?

All of this aside, I have rent and bills to pay and this is the offer I have. I've been out of work for 3 years so $30,000 a year, though low in SoCal may be something.

Can I think of this in a way to where I can get through this? Should I scrap this altogether and do something else?

TL/DR I got an offer at the same firm I worked for years ago doors down from where my ex lives.

Any and all thoughts appreciated. Please forgive my ramblings.

8jsuc0,54,2018-05-16,"Students of /r/India, what if I provide you an opportunity in the field of Agriculture? Need inputs",NAMO_IT_CELL,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8jsuc0/students_of_rindia_what_if_i_provide_you_an/,"For the past few months, my friends and I have been working on making Agriculture profitable and accessible to everybody. We have seen a lot of people who're skilled in other fields wanting to take up agriculture. Sure, there are education programs that help you get a degree, but that degree has little to know value when it comes to practice. If one could learn by practice, and by observation they can be better and with the power of the internet, you don't really need a degree and nobody really cares that much about your degree in such a field.

Coming to my main point, I have interacted with students across schools and universities and there seems to be some rare interest in agriculture. One of the few things that is stopping them is rural life, lesser pay, huge initial investment, etc. Also one of the reasons are that you can't try this field without a huge investment. So, what I am looking to provide is such an opportunity.

If everything goes right, by this time next year we will be kick starting an internship program. Currently, I am talking to farms in and around Bangalore along the borders of Tamil Nadu to see if they can help us facilitate such a program until our fields are ready.

You will have options where you can either get into actual farming or you can organize farm tours. You will be working in an actual for\-profit farm where the produce is intended to be sold for profit and money making is one of the main priorities. So, its not some rich person's retirement and this makes the internship really serious. I am not that knowledgeable a man in this field , but the farm owners and workers will assist you. Your tasks can be as simple as watering and monitoring growth and yield or taking care of dairy animals or milking cows and selling the milk or accompanying to fairs where the produce is sold. If you're interested, you can also help develop irrigation systems, organic pits, etc. Or, if you think you won't be good at this, you can be a tour guide and explain about what the farmer there do to make the food poison\-free, what techniques they use and what kind of investment they've done. Currently, I am keen on the first part.

What will be in it for you?

You'll get a stipend of 15k/month for the farming thing and 10k/month for the tour guide. These rates are not final, but somewhere in this price range. You will get an opportunity to live in a working farm and experience rural life. The locations we looked at so far, Jio was only fast enough to browse the internet and watch Youtube at 240p. You will essentially be partially off\-grid and spend more time with the Apple Apple and not Apple iPhone. You will get a hands\-on experience and access to guidance from people who've been in this field since when organic farming was not a big deal. I have people who've experience of 30\-35 years and 3 generations into farming, so a combination of their knowledge with the knowledge of young agriculturists who left their high\-paying management jobs to take up field work can give you a better insight. A part of this will also be education of government schemes, the hardships faced and stuff like that. We will have contacts so you won't be fooled and you will not have to bribe your way through to get the benefits if you wanted to get them. You will also help traditional farmers and educate them about how they can be more efficient.

We will be covering food, travel and accommodation for you in exchange of 8 hours of work daily. Out of these 8 hours, you will be working in the field for 4 hours and 4 hours would be reading, discussions and debates. This need not be about agriculture, can be about anything. I want students to sit and talk \(and get paid for it!\).

Currently, I am only looking for students who are in the pre\-final year of graduation \(provided you have a 6\-8 week break\) or someone who is in 12th in 2019 and will have holidays before starting their further education to answer. The reason for this is, short term doesn't work out for me. So, if you come for a week and leave, I will be at loss covering your expenditure. I need at least 5\-6 weeks of you being present on the field and this is too much to expect from anybody who is working I've a set of responses I got from talking to some students from colleges and schools in Bangalore. But I also want to hear from you.

The others can list some pros or cons about this program. As of now, nothing is clear. We are still in the market research stage, you can ask me questions and I will try to answer them for you. :\)

Thanks.

EDIT : I am currently travelling and in an internet\-scarce area so my replies will be slow. If you feel you do not want to comment in public, please do PM me! I will get back to you ASAP!

**TL;DR** :

For who :

Students graduating in 2020
students who finished 12th and have summer holidays during 2019.
What :

Full-time opportunity to work at a farm as a farming intern or tour guide
What do you get :

15k for farming intern, 10k for tour guide.
Free food, accommodation, travel expenditure.
What should you do :

8 hours/day.
4 hours of actual farm work
4 hours of research, talks, debates or just socializing.
What do you take away?

Farming experience
idea of how much it costs and how much it gives
idea of government schemes for farmers and how to avail them
self-sustainability with minimum investment
how to market your produce.
expert help with experts indulging in all types of farming like ZBNF, Organic Farming, Permaculture and traditional farming.
Basically somewhat like a seed-to-stores experience where you will do a little bit of everything."

I'm a grad student here working on a device that captures biomechanics. My last undergraduate got an internship over the summer and won't be able to help me code. Therefore, I'm looking for a new undergraduate to work with. I'm looking for someone with coding experience (Python, C, SQL would be a bonus). The bulk of the programming has been completed and we are on the final stages of device development. You do not have to come into a lab to program (can VNC through your computer at home). You're welcome to participate in collecting human subjects data but that would require you to complete IRB paperwork.

Unfortunately there is no pay, but I can get you credit for research if you'd like (through BioE). One benefit is that this project should conclude by the end of this year and publications will follow shortly after. If you choose to stick with the project through publication, I will happily include you as a coauthor.

It's a **very small** company with a casual work environment, seems pretty hospitable. However, the position only pays $10 an hour. I would likely be their only intern, the whole software team is less than 5 people.

I understand it's my first internship, but this would keep me busy ~8-6 5 days a week, while spending $50-60 a week on gas. Money isn't a big deal for me but $10 still seems criminally low considering my skills and the position, lots of my friends make more like $20 an hour at their internships, some even with housing and benefits. However, this is my only offer and I'd like to get some relevant experience. 

I'm really stumped and I need to respond soon, does anyone have any advice?

Edit: I'm taking it"
8jw63d,2,2018-05-16,I fucked up in my leadership role. How do I move forward??,brown-bear-cuddles,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/8jw63d/i_fucked_up_in_my_leadership_role_how_do_i_move/,"So here's the thing. Last summer I agreed to be a community service director to this new amazing org at my college. I took on the role even though it wasn't the one I wanted but I was happy to be a part of it regardless.

The first few months started out okay but I had also added a shit ton of activities to my plate including internships, a job (bc I'm broke and dorms are expensive), and taking awfully hard classes (my school is extremely competitive bc everyone and their mother is trying to be a doctor/lawyer/overlord).

My mental and physical health took a drastic turn (and when I say drastic I mean drastic) and my role as the community service director started plummeting with my not creating projects on time and the other members picking up my slack. I apologized before Christmas break with the promise that I would do better in 2018.

Well you probably guessed it, it didn't get better. My physical health was getting worse (high blood sugar causes a lot of shit to happen,what a surprise), I selfishly kept prioritizing my academics, personal issues, and other responsibilities, and it felt like my promises were empty as hell. Everyday I'd wake up in a literal panic just predicting that I was going to screw up again.

Now it's the end of the school year, I fucked up in my role and I just want to move forward into the next school year. This last quarter has been my healthiest mentally. I've been seeing doctors and therapists more but on my own I've come to accept that I didn't do a good job in this role and I've made some bad impressions with the club directors.

All I want is some advice on how to make amends with them and apologize for what I did and didn't do. I'm honestly terrified but I'd rather do this than avoid them for the rest of college because their all really amazing and are great at what they do. Event directing just wasn't my thing even on my best day.

I most likely will not be doing this role again but I would really appreciate it if all of you could give me advice on how to make amends with the leaders of this group.

**Note: I am in no way blaming anyone but myself for my poor performance. I did a shit job and I'm owning up to it. Thanks for reading!"

8jw7w9,1,2018-05-16,At a crossroad and have decision paralysis.,alt-tuna,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8jw7w9/at_a_crossroad_and_have_decision_paralysis/,"Guys, I'm at a crossroad and need some advice. I'm also over caffeinated and my head is spinning so I apologize if this is long-winded. I need to tell the backstory for context.

In 2002 - 2005 I attended a for-profit school for photojournalism. I was promised I would be making a $100k within a couple years of graduating and/or working for NatGeo [dream job]. I was already working as a portrait/wedding photog and ran a small craft business as a rave vendor/promoter. Hustle flows through my veins like blood. But my passion was journalism. The school was in Santa Barbara, CA. I grew up in a trailer park in northern central CA - farm town armpit. I was sold sink, line and hooked. The photography education was top notch though they ended up firing most of the good teachers within a year or two of me graduating, however, any of the GE classes were a joke especially for what was to be a BA. I met my now husband. I graduated at the top of my class and interested in NYC at one of the top [at that point] documentary news agencies [Blackstar] Was invited to intern at VII but ran out of money that I didn't have [student loans] Well I ended up leaving school with $137k in debt. Hubs was a year behind me, but realized he did not want to be a journalist and left school when I did. Most of our loans were private loans. The school didn't explain the difference, would fill out the forms for you and you basically went in and signed them. I know, so stupid. Hubs interest rate was at 10% mine was roughly 6%. Together we left with close to $300k in debt our parents stupidly co-signed though our single moms were on the brink of retirement and made only about 30k a year.

It's now the height of the market crash and newspapers were folding left and right oh and it turns out most full-time veteran journalist only make about $40k a year. We called our services and told them we were struggling. They were happy to help by putting us in forbearance for a year. What they didn't tell us that it would tack on another $60k of debt combined. A year later there was a class action suit against the parent company of our school CEC for fraudulently misleading students into taking out massive debt. They settled and we got a measly $1500 each. Not even enough to cover one month's payment. Also made it so we couldn't sue again...

Here we are 13 years later. We have paid over $200k to the banks, but thanks to the compound interest we still owe over a quarter million and growing instead of shrinking. We've met with lawyers, we have tried pretty much every ave available. We have applied for the Borrower Defense for Repayment but DeVos has pretty much froze that program. However, our fed loans [about $60k together] have been put into a systematic forbearance while they investigate our claims. A little reprieve, but if it doesn't work we will be forced to pay the debt plus accrued interest.

Roughly 18 months ago, my step-dad offered to cash out some of this retirement savings and sold some family property in order to lend me the funds to negotiate a payout because I was just done and wanted to just default and wait out the statue of limitation of my private loan. My [narc] mom decided she wanted to be in charge of the negotiation with them since she was the co-signer [I stupidly agreed] and they did agree to reduce the $128k to $80k if they could pay that week. I made her promise to get it in writing, which she did not. Of course. After they cashed the check they left the balance on. My lawyer adviced to default. They are now suing. I was served the papers a few days ago. Even with all that debt I was able to maintain a credit score of above 700. Within a month of defaulting it was 500 and now with the lawsuit, it's in the low 300s.

About 4 years ago I started doing tons of research on CEC [the parent company of my school] They have been sued for millions of dollars several times over, had to sell/close most of their schools after the Obama for-profit smackdown. I have discovered that my school dean was getting kickbacks. All kinds of shadiness in order to produce a documentary. Think Netflix Dirty Money. I've had few partners that have all but ghosted me because well, this shit is so depressing and most of us are struggling hardcore. There is so much shadiness and too much for people to handle so once we get back into it they ghost. This has happened three times. Hubs and I are on the lucky side as we have built a relatively successful photography business. We work our asses off and are treading water, however, have no savings/retirement/rainy day. We are paying about $2600 a month towards our debt and its growing, not going down. [curently owe just over a quarter million]. We will be in our 70s when our last payment is made as of right now.

The last two years have been hard. MAJOR depression that mostly stems from this. Add in Trump and watching DeVos basically undue every Obama regulation that was supposed to help us. Add in Trump being prez and my marriage on the rocks there were times I couldn't even function. Our biz took a major hit, but we survived and I'm back working at full throttle and we've made up for it already. Though we did rack up quite a bit of CC debt in the process. Also dealing with a host of autoimmune/chronic pain issues and shitty self-employed healthcare options. Becuase we are a small business we pay income tax on the $30k we take out of our business every year so that is roughly another $10k or so we have to pay the IRS every year for the foreseeable future. 

Hubs DOES NOT want to have any part in the documentary. He doesn't want to talk about our debt. He doesn't want me to socially highlight it. He does not want me to waste my time working on a documentary that he feels will do nothing to ease our situation and the wasted energy should go towards our business and our family. He's ashamed and also a pessimist. A year into marriage counseling and trying to climb out of the depression, I shelved the doc. I was/am just exhausted. Though, I have kept up with DOE news.

Last week DeVos dismantled the investigation team. And the ex-VP of CEC was put in charge of overseeing the BDTR program!! They also dismantled the FBCP student lending department. We are pretty much screwed as far as the gov helping. 

Here is where the crossroads comes in. I think part of my depression stems from being a victim. It doesn't sit well with me. I feel like I need to be actively doing something to fix it. This past weeks news, plus being served the lawsuit has me spinning. I finally got into a good place with work and hubs and I are playing nice [most days]. I also have my hands in a few other social activism things like trying to get my kid some recess at her public school [another source of depression, not being able to afford to put her in private or move to another better district thanks to the SL debt]. 

I also have an opportunity to get this info into the hands of our state AG [Maura Healey] Who is suing DeVos due to lots of the issues I'm struggling with. And an old client turned friend used to work with Elizabeth Warren and said if I ever needed her connection she would put us in touch. I also found out I Harvard Law has recently set up a free legal service to help people defrauded by the for-profit scam.

I feel like this is pulling at me like a super magnet. Do I go against my hubs/bus and throw my energy into this project that might not, but possibly could, help us or at least others? Doing it alone, since I can't even talk to hubs about it and don't trust bringing on other partners that will ghost. Or so do I suppress it and just trying to build up my marriage and business. Hubs philosophy is: keep our heads down, work hard and take one day at a time. I don't want my marriage or business to fail. But I also can't sit back and be a victim either, especially since I'm sitting on all this information via the research I've already done. 

If I go forth, here are a couple options I have after I organize my research into something palatable. First, find the funding, hire a team and shoot/produce the project myself. Possibly opening up opportunities for more journalism work. My name/work is acknowledged. Two, turn over my research to Netflix dirty money/Vice/HBO and have them do the heavy lifting. I'm not sure how all that works, but chances are my name/impact will be pretty small. Though I will get the story out. The likes to overfill her plate, hustler in me is more inclined to the first option. However, it will take LOTS of work to accomplish. Open to other ideas as well!

OMG if you read this far, you are a saint, I love you and thank you!!!"

8jzark,278,2018-05-16,There is hope!,daft_twit,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/8jzark/there_is_hope/,"Now that I've graduated, I wanted to tell everyone at UIUC that there is hope. It can seem really bleak and daunting, when you fail a course or just don't do well overall, and I want to tell you all that it can and does get better.

I studied ENG here, and really struggled since the very beginning. My first semester's GPA was a 2.48, which went to a 2.44 to a 2.4 consecutive semesters. I failed MATH 225, got C's and D's in my pre-req's (PHYS, MATH, TAM), and was on probation for 3 semesters. I never got an internship or research project, and a particularly painful memory was when I was applying to a position and they wouldn't let me submit the application in the first place because my GPA was ""not a valid number.""

So I took a step back. Went back to community college for a semester to re-do my fundamentals (which were heckin easy compared to UIUC's, even if it was Calc 3 and Statics), worked to rebuild some finances, and  then came back and did a bunch of grade-replacements. My grades didn't really have a huge improvement (highest semester GPA so far is a 2.68).

But basically 90% of students worry about is getting a job, right? I was there - low GPA, hardly any real ""connections,"" all my friends were high-achievers, etc... things didn't look good. Career fairs would come and go and all I got was info sheets and fidget spinners. So I decided to really start pushing the job angle, since my grades weren't going anywhere in a hurry. This is probably my most relevant advice; go to the career center. Get your resume checked, cover letters, elevator pitches, etc... If you're not a people person, just take a few minutes to learn how to fake it; if The Zucc can do it, you can too. Be aggressive when you're applying, follow-up email recruiters at the career fair, apply beforehand and know what positions they have, and just keep applying everywhere. Focus on your project work if your academics aren't helping. 

This past spring semester, I got 3 interviews, 2 of which turned into full-time offers. One of them, the one I took, was directly in my field of study, with an at-average starting salary, with benefits and a start-bonus. From a company that listed their minimum GPA as 3.0. 

So there is hope. Your grades might suck, you might not be in an organization that allows you to establish connections for that ""inside track,"" and you might feel that you're just unemployable and your apps go straight in to the trash. But you're a Fighting Illini, not a ""Surrendering Illini."" Things might seem hopeless and pointless, but they're really not, and you too, will succeed.

TL:DR - C's can get more than just degrees"

8jzpv2,6,2018-05-16,I'm about to become an interim SysAdmin in a couple weeks with very little knowledge. Need some words of encouragement.,sesoom,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8jzpv2/im_about_to_become_an_interim_sysadmin_in_a/,"Background:

There are two people in our IT department at the company I work for: me, more of a programmer and data handler and ""ERP guy"", and my coworker, who is a sys admin. We have about ~150 users, couldn't tell you how many total devices, and spread out over four locations. One location which we manage exclusively remotely as it's nearly a thousand miles from our headquarters. The other two are within a couple miles of the headquarters, so we're able to get there quickly if needed.

Until now, we've had very little cross-training with each other. We both do help desk together, but as far as our specialties go, neither of us are super familiar with each other's work. 

The time has come where my coworker let me know in secret that he plans on putting in his two week notice very soon as he has accepted an offer at another company. I wasn't surprised - I read through some of the threads on this subreddit for fun and I feel like my coworker can definitely relate to a lot of the struggles everyone here faces. I'm glad he's able to move onto a place that'll (hopefully) be less chaotic and frustrating. I could tell he was getting really burnt out.

Now he let me know this because we've been working side by side for three years and like each other a lot. Although we never got together outside of working hours, I'd still consider us friends. He says he wants to cross-train me as much as possible in the next week and a half because he wants the transition to be as least stressful as possible for me. I am extremely grateful for this. I am kind of excited to learn a lot of this stuff. I am basically starting from nearly scratch. But I'm genuinely really scared.

My networking knowledge is virtually nonexistent. My hardware knowledge is also pretty limited (especially with networking equipment like physical servers, switches, APs, etc.). Never worked with VoIP. Never spun up a VM or configured one. Have used Linux sparingly (we have a couple Linux servers, rest is entirely Windows environment). Don't know jack about AV or security in general. I basically don't know how to administrate systems whatsoever!

I am mostly scared because I feel like it's going to be expected of me to know how to do a lot of this stuff right off the bat while maintaining my current projects. I think our boss (CFO...) is under the impression we're more cross-trained than we actually are. We had been practically begging to get a third person to work in our department (either an intern to help clear help desk tickets so we can work on projects without distraction or an actual IT manager we could report to and also help with bigger projects), but it has been more than a year and a half with the manager position open because they haven't been too eager to fill it. Now it's about to be only me, and I'm not certain how long it's going to take them to find a replacement. I have already felt very overwhelmed with my workload recently, and I'm afraid this is going to burn me out way too fast. I am trying my best to mentally prepare myself for a month or two of absolute hell, assuming they can find another sys admin in that time.

Anyone got any advice for someone in my situation? I'll take anything."

He asked questions about projects I‚Äôve done and I couldn‚Äôt even answer those. The interview was a train wreck one hundred percent. I‚Äôve never felt worse in my life, I even cried a little bit when I sat in my car. I was absolutely devastated.

The call was from my number two option, telling me they want me to start Monday and actually be paid for my work. The moral of the story is eventually everything will fall into place, so relax don‚Äôt stress about finding jobs, about being rejected. Everything will find it‚Äôs way. The number one advice I‚Äôve seen on this sub is to delete this sub. This only causes unneeded stress to our already stressful lives. Believe me, everything will fall into place, it just takes time. With that, I say delete this thread, enjoy college cause your only there for 4 years.

My past internships mainly centered around business/finance. However, late junior year and senior year, I became very interested in computer science, and pursued minors in computer science and data science through the Engineering School at my university. I got As in all my classes and over the past year, it has become very clear that computer science is truly a passion of mine and that I want to pursue a career in the field in a technical capacity. 

I was recently accepted to a masters program at the same university in Data Science (at my school, the Data Science degree consists of all CS classes, just with a greater emphasis on ML/AI and statistics), as an internal admit. I'm now debating on whether or not I should do this program. I have a finance job right now, but I strongly wish to pursue tech instead and am prepping for coding interviews/already have a couple interviews at large companies. Seeing as I want to pursue tech as a long-term career, I was wondering about what the value would be in pursuing this masters.

As a pro, it is from a Top 10 university in Computer Science and I'm unsure if I would get into another Masters program of a similar caliber if I walk away from this. Although I know you can get a software job without a degree, I wonder if putting in an extra year now would be worth it in the long run if I wish to solidify my career in the industry, especially if I want to work in specific areas of software (like ML). I also come from a nontechnical background (despite my minors) although I do think I have strong enough algorithmic knowledge to pass coding interviews. I would also really enjoy doing the masters and taking the classes and it would give me access to on campus recruiting in tech for an additional year (I could not really take advantage of tech on campus recruiting in the past as I had not taken enough CS courses). As a downside, there is obviously the cost as well as the lost work experience for a year, although I would try to keep recruiting and delay job offers for a year.

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!"
8k223f,1,2018-05-17,Post-graduate internship followed by full time job - what should I do?,Lapqpq,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/8k223f/postgraduate_internship_followed_by_full_time_job/,"I am currently working on an internship I love and have a full time job with a different company lined up after. I am currently deciding if I should cancel on the full time opportunity and stay at the internship company. I understand I am fortunate and this is an embarrassment of riches situation, but it is really stressing me out and I need help.

**The Job Search**

Ok so like many students I was job searching last fall. During my search I received a great offer from Company A, an oil and gas company, for full time employment. I accepted and then withdrew my applications from all other full time opportunities. Two weeks later I interviewed with Company B, an aerospace company and my dream employer, for a post graduate internship. To my surprise I was offered an internship which I accepted. I arranged it such that my start date at Company A was after the completion of the internship. I have been truthful in communications with both companies, and they do not know about each other yet.

**Salary and Cost of Living**

Current salary at Company B is ~70k and I would anticipate a modest raise upon being converted to full time (raise to ~85k from what I gather from GlassDoor). The salary at Company A is ~100k with a significant signing bonus. Both companies have great benefits. The cost of living near Company B is 30% higher than the cost of living near Company A. I have some amount of student loans between 42k and 62k.

**Possible Outcomes**

Outcome 1 - I do nothing. I complete my internship at Company B and being working full time at Company A. I will make more money, but I am unsure if I will like my job as much.
Outcome 2 - I cancel on Company A after receiving a full time offer from Company B. In this situation I will make less money, but have a job I love.

**Questions and Considerations**

I know it is ethically wrong to go back on a commitment, but what would be the professional consequences? I know I would never be able to work at company A, but that might be something I am OK with. Could I use my offer from Company A to negotiate a higher full time salary from Company B? Could I tell Company A about my offer from Company B to accelerate the offer/no offer timeline? Is the job satisfaction risk ever worth the monetary difference? I do anticipate liking Company A, but I do not know for sure. What information can I gather to made this decision easier? How would I manage the offer timeline? I might not get a full time offer from Company B until days before I start at Company A.

Thank you in advance for you help."
8k29ew,119,2018-05-17,It's In The Bag,writely_so,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8k29ew/its_in_the_bag/,"Anyone who has stayed in a group living setting in college knows that roommates come and go all the time. Dropouts, transfers, and plain old fashioned flakiness lead to that guy who always took your spot on the couch being just another person you used to know.

That‚Äôs why none of us were particularly concerned when Frank was suddenly nowhere to be seen. There were five of us staying in the big, old farmhouse which was now a frat-style shared living space. I hadn‚Äôt known Frank all too well myself, he‚Äôd been a quiet dude who mostly came home and stayed in his room. He always did his dishes right after he was done with them, which made the rest of us think of him as more of an adult than we were, even though he was a Freshman too. 

When we actually all discussed the fact that Frank hadn‚Äôt been seen for a while, he must have been gone for a week already. Our disparate schedules and frequent change-ups meant that we‚Äôd often go several days without seeing a certain housemate. No one thought it was particularly odd that Frank wasn‚Äôt around. I think I remember thinking at one point that he must have gotten a night job.

So yeah, when we all kind of noticed that the others had also noticed Frank‚Äôs absence, we laughed about it. The dude was sticking us for rent, we felt sure of that. But we weren‚Äôt shocked. Dude had probably decided college wasn‚Äôt for him after all and moved back home. It happened all the time.

But then Joel noticed that Frank hadn‚Äôt been active on Facebook for a couple of weeks. That was odd - Facebook was the only way we all could really communicate since we were never home at the same time. We had a group chat, and if something came up that the others needed to know about, we‚Äôd post it there. Usually these types of messages brought a chorus of ‚Äúkk‚Äù, ‚Äúcool‚Äù, ‚Äúword‚Äù, and your pick of any number of other succinct messages which just amounted to ‚ÄúOk I heard you, now stop making my phone vibrate‚Äù in the end.

But Frank hadn‚Äôt participated in our chat for just about two weeks. That was actually pretty strange. Michael had a class with him, and said he‚Äôd check with the Professor the next day to see if Frank had been attending. Those lecture halls were so crowded, it was often not possible to see any friends you might have unless you sought them out.

We all parted agreeing to do what we could to establish contact with the guy. If he‚Äôd just bailed on the house because he noped out of college half a year in, that was fine. Like I said, it happens. We just wanted to make sure the guy was alive.

Well after our attempts to establish that contact all failed, we decided we‚Äôd better get in touch with his family. I reached out to his mom on Facebook, and was almost immediately informed that she hadn‚Äôt heard from her son in some time, and thought he was angry with her for some reason. She became disturbed pretty quickly when I told her we hadn‚Äôt heard from him in at least a couple of weeks, and police were contacted that day.

The investigation was pretty open and shut. Unfortunately there‚Äôs not much they can do about an adult who decides, of his own free will, to just disappear. Debts are a civil matter, and they didn‚Äôt have any good leads. Frank was, as we‚Äôd always figured, a loner. No close friends and certainly no girlfriends to speak of. We did see him have one guy over every now and then, but they would just go in Frank‚Äôs room and hang out for a few hours, then the guy would leave. Frank never introduced us, and the unspoken rule of the house was ‚ÄúLeave my shit alone and I‚Äôll leave your shit alone.‚Äù Shit, in this case, extends beyond the physical.

But yeah, the cops pretty much told us to pound sand. They said they‚Äôd follow up in a couple of weeks to see if anyone had heard from Frank, and asked that we call them immediately if we did hear from him. We all shrugged our shoulders and thanked the officers for their time.

Several days went by, and at this point we figured he was in the wind. That or, as Allen suggested in poor taste, he might be dead somewhere. Lying in a ditch, throat slit and wallet taken for the full $25 dollars it was likely to contain. They‚Äôd get some use out of his library card, maybe. We told Allen that he was a dick, and he should keep shit like that to himself. Or better yet, don‚Äôt think it at all.

We asked his mom what she wanted us to do with his stuff. She told us that she didn‚Äôt have the money to come get it (Frank had been attending on a full ride scholarship), and asked if we could hang onto it until she came up with the funds. We thought about it, but decided that it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to ask us to do that - the room being occupied by someone who wasn‚Äôt paying rent meant we each were gonna be out another $200 each month. She understood that, and asked if we‚Äôd be willing to sell a few of the items so that we could use the money to rent a storage unit for a few months. I thought that was fair, so I agreed to look at his things and pick a few things worth selling.

I picked a couple things - a DSLR camera; a laptop (we backed up the data first), a mini-fridge, and a game console. Nothing that we deemed to be crucial and irreplaceable, but valuable enough to make sure the storage unit was covered.

As we were moving Frank‚Äôs things out of the room, I realized that the couch he had in there would be an upgrade from the one we had in the living room currently. The guys all agreed, and thought it was only fair since we were going to all this trouble for a guy who was stiffing us out of hundreds of dollars, so we put our couch into his storage unit and his couch into our living room. Don‚Äôt get me wrong - the thing was not a nice couch. It was musty, smelled of beer, cigarettes, a hint of piss, and more than a little bit of old food smell, but it was better than ours.

After that, the room was empty and we were posting ads around campus, on Craigslist, here on Reddit, and just about everywhere else so that we could get that vacancy filled as quickly as possible.

We had a reasonable candidate just about a week later. He started moving in that following weekend, and he seemed like a good enough dude. Low-key, not a partier. The kind of guy we wanted. We were in college and having fun, sure, but us guys in that house were of a more serious bent, and were looking to make things happen for ourselves.

That‚Äôs why no one was home that Sunday except for the new guy. His name was Larry, by the way. Tall guy, athletic, good tan. Definitely a ladies man. We‚Äôd talked to him about that - we were ok with having girls over, of course, but nothing that became a nuisance.

Apparently he decided to test that theory that very first Sunday. His girlfriend insisted on coming over to see the new place he‚Äôd be staying, and from what he later told us, she was all over him as soon as she realized no one else was home, or going to be, for quite some time. They started making out in his room, and he got up to close the door. She asked why he needed to bother, and he said it was a force of habit or something. She told him that habits are fun to break, and insisted that they take things downstairs.

Clothes were shed along the way, and the intrepid lovers got down to business. In any case, they proceeded to have sex upon any and all surfaces available to them. We‚Äôll skip the details, but the end result is that the couple, well, they found Frank.

During an attempted display of power, Larry lifted his girlfriend off of the table they‚Äôd been copulating on, and carried her over to the couch. He then turned around and plopped down with her on top of him. The force of this plop, as well as their combined weight, was enough to lead them to the gruesome discovery.

You see as their weight came down, they felt something pop and were immediately overcome by an unbearably awful stench. The girl screamed, and Larry jumped up, so overpowered by the odor that he dropped her to the floor. He then turned around and looked at the couch. He told us later that his first instinct was that the couch was a pull-out, and he‚Äôd broken it somehow. But the smell - oh my fucking god that smell - made him realize that this was something else entirely. 

While his girlfriend was vomiting on the floor, Larry pulled back the couch cushions and nearly jumped out of his own skin. Staring back at him from the left end of the couch was the mutilated, rotten face of Frank Hotchkins. Encased in a thick rubber body bag, Frank had apparently been undisturbed by single individuals using the couch for the brief intervals we did while we were between things to do. But the force caused by primal needs of our new houseguest had caused the gases from Franks rotting corpse to rip the bag open. 

Larry promptly vomited all over himself, his girlfriend, his clothes as he stumbled his way back into them, and the phone as he called 911.

He described the scene to us, and said that it was burned into his eyes and that he saw it every time he closed them. Frank‚Äôs face and chest were a disgusting, bloody mess. There were lacerations all over him, and one of his eyes had been gouged out. The body was in what was described as an advanced state of decomposition, and the police said they had never seen anything like this before.

The rest of us trickled home at random times throughout the night, and were astounded to see that there were police surrounding our house, crime scene tape in front of our yard, and a local news van parked on the curb. Needless to say, I was completely fucking shook by this whole thing. I‚Äôd sat on that fucking couch! I‚Äôd eaten on that couch! I‚Äôd...fucking jerked off on that couch once! What the fuck!

This new lead gave the police a whole new avenue of investigation, and they pretty quickly figured out what had happened. That guy who we‚Äôd seen Frank have over? That was his heroin dealer, apparently. And Frank had gotten in pretty deep. Toward the end there he‚Äôd been skipping classes, not eating or sleeping, and apparently was also suspected of a shoplifting.

Anyway, the heroin dealer had come to collect in the middle of the night, and ended up killing him during the altercation. He said the body bag was something he found in Frank‚Äôs room. That made some sense, Frank had an internship at a body harvesting place. The bag was found in the closet while he searched for a blanket. He stuffed the body into the bag and the bag into the old, broken couch. Replaced the cushions, and then he just dipped out. Said he figured they‚Äôd pin it on one of us. The guy was really smart, you could tell.

Now, I will tell you this because I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre wondering. There was a fair amount of questioning as to how we all missed this. The answer is fairly unsatisfying, but true. Because we were all extremely busy college kids. We were running around and usually not even home most of the time. Allen claimed he‚Äôd only sat on that couch once, and it was when we‚Äôd first brought it down. I‚Äôd sat on it a number of times, and as horrifying as it is to say, I definitely thought it was a strange couch. It seemed to be cushioned in a weird, airy kind of way. Yes, I can distinctly recall thinking that. Jesus fucking christ, right?

That said, it never occured to me that something was *wrong*. I never felt like I needed to investigate. It was very common to smell weird and often disgusting things in that house. We were five guys, after all. And I don‚Äôt know whether I should be thankful or not, but that bag was the real deal, and did a lot to contain that smell. I never even caught a whiff of something that made me think ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a dead thing‚Äù.

Personally, I will spend the rest of my life thankful that I‚Äôm not Larry. And I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever feel the same way about sitting on a couch.

The reason why I want to job hop is so I can make more money and been wanting to do more development work. I've been moved primarily to oncall support for the past year or so due to company migrations and low resouces but used to do automated testing for webservices and UI, moved to webservices and some back end development. I asked a few times to move to different teams to do more development work but been denied. 

The reason why I haven't been motivated to switch lately is because I'm worried I may not get as much PTO with my next job, worried I might not be able to work remotely, and losing a low stress job. I have a good work/life balance right now, and satisfied with most parts of my life except for work.

I gotta say, I find women recruiters more pleasant in general and easier to talk to.

I'm still not good at negociating the compensation and have this tendency to accept whatever the company is offering.

She didn't fix a start day and told me to come whenever I get my required documents.
This was kinda good and not good,  because I unconsciously try to delay and find excuses. I was very anxious moving out to another much bigger city, and find housing. I spent next couple of days over masturbating and sleeping too much which is something I can't help whenever there is a big change in my life.

I was hoping she will never contact me back, and I found a couple of reasons why this internship was a bad idea. I've been doing Cbt/Rebt (self-help) for some time now, and it made me eventually  realise this is just my fear talking.

I got an email if I was still interested, I confirmed my interst and told her I had everything and I was ready to start.(I still regret letting her doubt my commitement though)

However, my first job was a ‚ÄúStudent Tech Assistant‚Äù in the IT sector of the university. I stayed at that job for about 18 months, and for the past 6 months I‚Äôve been an ‚ÄúInformation Security Specialist‚Äù (kind of a promotion) in the same organization, just different department. 

Does it hurt my future since I don‚Äôt specifically have an internship in some outside company? Or does it just matter that I‚Äôm getting experience? (I‚Äôm learning a lot in my current role)

I have a 3.2 GPA, which is just about the average in my major. I‚Äôll keep applying to internships and try to land one somewhere, but I‚Äôm beginning to freak out quite a bit.

8k4x1i,1,2018-05-17,Do I check in?,9percent,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8k4x1i/do_i_check_in/,"Hi All!

I'll try to make this quick: Had a wonderful internship last summer with a very well known company. In leading up to my graduation from University, my direct supervisor reached to out to me about applying to the (recently opened) Executive Assistant to the VP of our Department position. 

After a quick and easy phone screen through corporate HR, I waited like a week and a half until a finally got an in-person interview two weeks ago. I walked into the interview and the VP (who I obviously know and worked with) told me that this is my job to take or not take and then we just talked through each of our goals for the position. As I was walking out he said he still had to interview a couple more people last week, but that I was far and away the front runner. 

And then I haven't heard anything since. I was assuming I'd hear something this week because I thought he was finishing interviewing last week, but nope. I checked in with my boss to see if she knew anything and she said that he still had one more interview, but that he too wants it wrapped up. So, first of all, should I be concerned it's taking so long when I kind of thought this would be settled by now? Second, I emailed HR checking in on Tuesday...should I email the VP directly checking in? That either screams desperation or shows just how interested I am, and I don't know which it is.

Thanks!"
8k51g0,106,2018-05-17,Tips for every Computer Science related major,iVtechboyinpa,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/8k51g0/tips_for_every_computer_science_related_major/,"1: ALWAYS apply for internships. It doesn't matter if you're a freshman or junior. It doesn't matter if you don't get the interview or if you don't get the job. The only thing holding you back from getting an internship is yourself. Yeah, a lot of it is gonna be hit and miss. You might go months without an interview or an offer. But don't let that discourage you. You're still in school and have a ways ahead of you. Even if you already have a job or internship, keep the applications rolling out. Get your name out there, get the interview experience, especially for CS majors. Programming interviews can be hard if it's your first time taking one when you're actually trying to get a job \(been there, done that\) so take the opportunity to mess up while you can.

2: Don't squander your opportunities in school to network with professionals and peers as you never know what can happen when you get out of college. That one person that you decided to do a project with or that one person that you talked to about a career opportunity might remember you and pull some strings. Remember, connections are key.

3: Take classes that align with your interests. Don't just take a class for an easy A, or take a co\-op class because it counts for credits. You're paying for your education, so why waste your money? Learn as much as you can. The only exception to the co\-op class is if you can't get an internship any other way and the class will help pair you up with an organization or company. I personally advocate having an internship in addition to your school work, rather than as part of your school work. I find it more beneficial that way, but every body's cases are different \(say, dual majors or those that need to work to make end's meat.\)

4: If you're a CS major, and you want to better yourself, definitely take on some projects. You don't know what to do? Trust me, I didn't either. Then it dawned on me \- I want a way to read comics on my phone, similar to Manga Rock. So guess what I'm working on right now? Literally all it takes is one small lightbulb to go off in your head and there's your project. Many employers will ask for a GitHub link to see your projects, and those that don't will appreciate it. Learn by doing. That's how we should be learning in this field.

4.5: On that note, when working on a project, use GitHub from concept creation to development end. What I mean is that, from the first line of code you write for the program, commit it to GitHub. Why? Threereasons:

A \- you can track your own development process from start to end

B \- employers can look on your GitHub and see not only the work you put into your project from the beginning, but can             see the way you thought and how you solved issues.

C \- Learn not only to comment well, but to use an effective naming system as well as the correct spacing! You want your code to be readable to not just yourself. If someone were to pick up your code who knows NOTHING about your project or code in general, they should be able to pick up on context clues \(your naming system if they know code\) or read your comments like a book \(if they don't know code\) and completely understand your application. It also helps when you come back to it after not having worked on it for a while to refresh your memory. Too many times I went back to previously written code and asked myself what I was thinking.

5: Balance. This applies more generally to any college student. Adding this one in because of u/Tazzure. It's not impossible to balance school, social life, and maybe a job or two. It just takes a good plan of attack on your part. Just like you plan before you program, and you plan your courses, plan out each semester of your life in college. How you're going to achieve A and B.

One of my personal policies is that I must always have ""Me Time"", which is literally time just to myself. No work, school, or other people \(although if you chose to include them that's up to you.\) It's my time to do whatever I want to do. Sleep, think, meditate, program \(for self pleasure\), watch a show, or play a game. The biggest thing in college is to not give up the things that make you happy; the things that make you, you. That's where you end up hating college and subsequently life, because it ends up taking over and you lose all sense of self control \(been there, done that.\) Yes, college is important, just as work, your family and friends, and anything else you deem important. But, out of 24 hours in a day, you can spare at least a half hour to an hour for yourself. And trust me, you will want to, and when you do, you will appreciate yourself for it. Don't lose sight of yourself in the pursuit of bettering yourself, otherwise you get lost in the complexity that is college and life.

Everyone please feel free to chime in to add or correct me."

I'm currently a networking intern, so I'm currently learning about all of the networking aspects of what I would need to know. I believe my next move will be to try to find a dev internship, so I have a better understanding of the development progress, as well as improve my skills as a programmer. 

Is this approach (having experience in both networking and development) the right approach for a future in DevOps? If not, what should I be doing differently? Also, any resources for learning about processes/technologies related specifically to DevOps that you could recommend would be awesome.

I absolutely love programming and I'm very good at it.  Ever since I was a kid I wanted to be a game developer, however I gave up on it because I thought I can just make games on the side and not deal with the horror stories I heard about working in the industry.  I've interned at quite a few companies and while I still enjoy business programming, I feel at times it isn't complicated enough for me to have a lot of fun with it nor am I as interested in the end product.  I also have interest in working in medical applications of computer science, artificial intelligence, and systems level programming. 

I really am passionate about video games as a medium and love the whole programming side of game mechanics.  I would even be okay with working on a physics or graphics engine, actually I would love that.  I worked on games a bit when I learned programming at my technical school in high school.  At every internship I've done I've had no problem with doing a bunch of work, I honestly prefer doing work as opposed to just sitting around. 

Enough about me, I have questions that I would like to see a few of you answer that could help me make a decision: 

How stable has your job been?  If you were laid off, how long was it before you found something else?

Does game development pay well enough to live comfortably?

How often do you work crazy hours?  Are you paid for the hours above 40?

What do employers look for in interviews?

Are there companies that offer internships?

I have been planning to retire by 45 for quite some time now. There has been a change in circumstances which is why I am moving up my retirement date. 

For context, I am a British trained lawyer licensed to practise in Singapore. I received an MBA from Insead in 2009. I am fluent in English, Mandarin as well as German. 

As stated above, I have been planning out my finances since I started working to ensure that I would have enough savings by 45 to retire comfortable. However, I lost my both my parents unexpectedly last month and would like to bring forward this event. Obviously since I am leaving my job 6 years earlier than planned I would have to compensate by making some extra somehow. This is where it gets slightly iffy. 

I have been with my firm since my days of internship, I completed my training contract with them and eventually started full time there as well. It is a small domestic firm that is very Singapore centric. This will surely handicap my abilities to work overseas. In addition, I do not wish to go through the process of qualifying for practise in another country again. 

The end goal was always to move to Germany, however in light of my current situation I may need to adjust my goals realistically. I will be cross posting to r/personalfinance in detail, but for now, my approximate financial situation is as follows.

I have about US$1.6mil in savings. I am in the process of inheriting a house valued to be around US$465k. As soon as I gain citizenship in another country I can withdraw my government savings of US$65k. 

Assuming I live to the full average life expectancy of 86, that would leave me with 46k a year BEFORE buying a house. I would expect that number to markedly decrease after factoring in my housing situation and other hidden costs of moving. 

I am very open to suggestions however I do have a number of baseline requirements. 
Safety - I would like an area that is safe for an Asian woman

Access to medical care - I am diagnosed with a form of medical anxiety and would require a place with adequate medical facilities to deal with this. 

Pets - I currently have 2 cats (domestic) that I would be bringing along with me when I migrate. I am aware that certain countries have very strict policies when it comes to bringing live animals. Leaving the cats behind is NOT an option. 

Taking into consideration the aforementioned conditions, I would love to hear your advice. Thank you in advance. "

I couldn't get an internship in the US for this summer despite getting a few interviews, so my parents got me a gig at a company where I'd be working in Beijing through a family connection.  I reluctantly took it, because I'd be able to visit and live with family \(my grandparents\) while there.  But the company, since they're based in China, doesn't really have an online presence outside, so I'm slightly worried about how that will translate to being able to at least get an internship for next summer.

Today, we had a discussion regarding that, and they also want me to give up my next spring semester so I can go back and intern for a company in Shandong, because it's a cybersecurity type position.  I haven't even gone for the summer yet, and they're adamant that I go and suspend my undergraduate studies for then.  I told them I didn't want to go during that particular semester, because it would be the last time I would get to see and have classes with some of my college friends before they graduate, and am open to doing it a year from then, when I will have graduated, but they said I can't defer because my cousin would be there \(who is studying at UIUC, did this, and has internships in the US for the summer\) and I wouldn't be able to handle the area on my own.

They're fixed on this because I haven't been able to get an internship despite trying for two years and trying to do projects here and there for my resume.  I haven't told them about my plans to go to grad school though to study data science, which is what I'm interested in ATM, but they seem to be fixated on me getting as much internship experience as possible, which seems crazy to me as most of my other peers seem to have maybe one or two internships before graduating.

I'm grateful for the fact that they're getting me these opportunities but I feel like I'm being forced one way and not allowed to do things my own way.  Whenever I try and counter though, my parents keep telling me I'll be in a very tough reality for finding a job in the future and that I'm throwing away my career ""for a few friends.""  At this point, I'm wondering if I should just get a developer job or a research position with a professor on campus \(which I originally planned to for this summer, but my parents convinced me to go their way instead\).

Any advice here is appreciated.  I don't know what to do.  I want to be successful in my own way but not burn bridges with my parents."

How should I handle this?,cscareerstruggles,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8kaasc/internship_told_me_that_id_be_working_with_apex/,"I wound up accepting an offer in the Fall and have been excited to start. During my interviews, I made sure to ask about the type of responsibilities their interns get and was convinced that I would be gaining good experience here. Just recently, I was told that I will be working on an app that is built on top of Salesforce / APEX. I've read here on cscareerquestions that picking up APEX will not help me become a Software Engineer and now I'm very worried. 

I'm about to graduate in December so this will be my last internship opportunity. What's even worse is that my only other internship before this was not Software Engineering (it was the only offer I had at the time). Because of this, I made it a huge goal to get SE experience this Summer, but now it doesn't seem like that will happen. I will even have to commute 1 - 1.5 hours for this, so I really wanted to make sure it was going to be a good learning experience.

I was thinking of contacting HR about this to see if there is any way for me to get switched onto a team that actually lines up with my career goals, they even have their main office 45 mins from me which also holds SE teams.

I don't want to end up losing this opportunity since it's all that I got now, but at the same time I feel that I really need to gain actual SE experience. Does anyone have any advice on how I could best handle this situation?"

One of them included desired salary. I responded by giving a range starting from the mid 30's/hr and explained I got there from my current salary(Big N internship) and research on the company itself.

I got a response with the person highlighting the range and telling me it's not going to work out since it's not a full time time opportunity but an internship.

So after doing some research, I discovered that I kinda messed up by revealing my range right from the get go. In any case, after I received the email the recruiter viewed the email about 10 more times(I have software that showed me this). I think the recruiter might think I might come back with something lower since I invested some time answering all the other questions.

I'm okay with not getting the internship. But I also want to get some experience with this and see if I can get the recruiter to come around if possible. Anyone experienced with this kind of thing let me know how to proceed to get the best deal. "

The interview and everything went very well and I knew the odds were in my favour but seeing as they've been taking ages to reply I was still applying for other positions. In the meantime got an offer from a small, local company in my university town. Funnily enough the pay was better and the people there extremely nice and welcoming, loved the company culture, accepted their offer in a heartbeat, praying that VW never gets back to me or rejects me. Unfortunately (fortunately?) today in the morning VW did get back to me, application was successful, I'm supposed to start next month. Problem is, all the formalities at the smaller company are already sorted and I really did want to work there. Now I'm not so sure. Literally yesterday I was on a call to them talking what projects they'll have me work on etc. 
What the hell do I do now?! 
The smaller company offers better pay, flexibility with working hours, good mentorship (well experienced with taking students from my uni), the people there are friendly etc. and they frequently hire students to work with them during their studies if the internship goes well.
Volkswagen, however... Well, it's the largest company in Europe, would give me a chance to live in Germany for the summer as well as learn the language and a pretty decent name for my CV. 

Now, I'm almost certain I wanna pick VW for the sake of it being a major corporation but I feel incredibly guilty thinking of reneging the small company's offer.... and maybe it's stupid, but I must say the personal approach of the smaller company compared to VW's cold, automated response telling me to go to sector this and that on this and that day to start bothers me quite a bit honestly. Don't know if I'm the right fit for such a rigid, corporate culture, but then again it's only 3 months anyway?

EDIT: I'd also like to add that personally I'd rather work for the smaller company. But carrer-wise, I'm seriously worried that it'll hurt my chances of getting a good job next year when I graduate. If I picked VW it'd be solely for the big name."

**Education: Master's in Marine Conservation** (Master of Professional Science) from University of Miami with very little experience; *Bachelor's in Environmental Biology.* Hubby has no degree beyond H.S. diploma but would like to finish his computer science degree (aspirations of working remotely)

**Budget:** Working on it, just got a second job. Looking to move sometime early next year if we left the country. We could have a couple grand saved by then, and of course whatever profit we gain from selling our possessions/cars, **we maybe could scrape together $8k.** Obviously we would want to visit first so some of the budget goes towards that and the rest to moving expenses. I would need to have a job lined up for myself in order to make this realistic, but if my salary is decent enough hubby could take his time finding employment/possibly going back to finish his degree.

**Language skills:** I am moderately proficient in **Spanish**. I can understand a lot from context, but have trouble finding the words to respond sometimes. I definitely need to practice, and this is a big goal of mine for the rest of the year.

**Other considerations:** Living near the ocean is preferable, but not critical to my career. I would definitely entertain the idea of working at a research center/office, at least to start. Also, we have a cat that we would like to keep. Minor detail, but I know a lot of countries have quarantine laws.

Clearly there is a lot going on with our situation... We moved to FL from NY (where I was born/raised and hubby lived for 9 years, WI resident previously) so I think we could do it. I like Florida's climate but not the political atmosphere of the US South. Too many Infowars types out here.
Given my field, I could possibly go to the West coast but I've been there a few times, sooo expensive and I'm looking to entertain some international options in my career search.

I recently visited Iceland and loved it except for the fact that it gets so dang cold in the winters. Iceland is so pleasant, environmentally and kid-friendly, pays a living wage... I love everything except the dang climate. (Obviously it's Iceland, and not representative of all of Europe, but I have only been there and to Italy, both for a week during spring). 
We went on a fishing tour and I met a lady there with the same degree I just earned, her citizenship is in Italy but she works summers in Iceland on the tour boat, educating people about the marine environment. The pay is not great but that is literally my dream job: to be outdoors, educating the public and spreading awareness for marine conservation. Research is cool too, I did a lot of it in my recent internship. I currently work at Aldi (discount grocery store, founded in Germany but rapidly expanding in the US) and I meet so many cool international customers. They often remark about my personality and how I am pleasant, easy to talk to.

So... suggestions??

**Edit: After doing a bit of reading and considering how much a visa costs, I think a more realistic goal would be to travel/scope out a new country of residence in 2019 and actually move sometime in 2020. In the meanwhile, I could obtain work in my field here in Florida which will help me in finding a job wherever we decide to go.**

**I have a few questions:**
*Would my husband be covered under my work visa, or would he need to obtain his own to be able to stay in the country (in general, obviously this varies by country). Should he apply for a computer science program and obtain a student visa? How hard is it to get a job offer in, say, Norway or Australia as a US citizen? Having an offer of employment is the condition for the type of work visa I am seeking, I believe.*
Advance apologies for my na√Øvet√© and idealism, I am just beginning my search.

2. Also do you think doing these two masters will be spreading myself too thin because they obviously seem very intensive. I intend to apply to Phd after these masters.

4. Are you aware of any other schools that will let me do such two masters together and thus save some monies?

I graduated high school two years ago, school was shit for me, because it was a private school, full of snobs and spoiled rich kids, it was all about appearance, just horrible. I had my friends there but after I hit puberty I knew that we were too different to actually have a healthy friendship, so it became incredibly superficial. I had a very intense depressive phase that lasted till the end of school because I couldn't find someone that was like me. I went to a therapist for 3 years, so when I graduated I was pretty positive about everything that was going to come. Did a gap year, travelled alone through Ireland and the UK with my car and did a 180. I loved talking to new people, going out, just having fun (there was a guy that told me that I was glowing and thinking back I thoroughly agree with him). I think that it was the first time I really loved myself.

After my gap year I decided to move to another city because I had to many bad memories of the one I grew up in. I started studying computer science but realised pretty early that this wasn't for me. I also had problems with finding some friends. I am not shy and usually get along with everyone but it seems that I just forgot how to make friends because I can't get the friendship to a deeper level and it just stays at this weird superficial level where it eventually just ends. So after I quit uni every contact broke away. I started an internship at a music publisher a few months ago (full time + 3h commute per day). I am not very stress resistent and on top of that I usually realise that I'm stressed out when it's way too late.

And thats what exactly happend. I'm overstressed, living in a city where I have no one to talk to and getting pretty fucking lonely because of that. I'm slipping into this depressive phase again and I feel like I can't do anything about it. I still have a few months here before I can move away but I really don't know how to bridge the time. I want to go back to the time when I was happy so bad. I'm currently trying to meditate every day (still a beginner, so I can only do 10 min) to calm down a little bit, setting little goals for every day and reading a lot about self care. Still I feel like the time I have left here is going to be as shitty as it can get and I really don't want this to happen.

So here is what I am asking for: How can I calm down and get a more positive look on how things are rn? How can I make the time I have left more bearable? How do you actually make friends? I really need to improve on this one because it's not going to get any better."

Background. All of this is happening in Europe and english is not my first language if it is relevant.

1) So I am graduating from my second degree, this time in graphic design, that means I am an older student. I'm done in 3 weeks. 

2) I struggle mostly with doing one thing at a time, organising my life and decision making. I tend to use a lot of unproductive hours for worrying as well.

3) My Adhd prone brain is really impulsive. I have a lot of great stories to tell and they brought me very far, but I am very very tired from studying and working at the same time and I am longing for comfort and stability.

The problem:

So I applied to some jobs / internships at the place where I live and I ended up with some very different offers on the table.

I got an offer for a full time in-house digital designer position in a international tech-ish company. Think airbnb, thought not so big, the principle is similar. The work itself is mostly focused on fast production and very little creativity involved.

Another offer is an internship at an award winning company which I am really motivated to work at. They are offering me a low paid 6 month internship starting in the autumn. They mentioned the possibility to get hired, just before they hired another junior designer and since the company is not that big I don't really know how big are the chances to get hired there. That means student economy and no guarantees for the future, but more time on my hands to work on personal projects, creative challenging environment, contacts and so on. 

I somehow managed to combine both for now, making the first offer into a summer intership, but we decided to have a follow up talk in a month, meaning I have to decide what to do by then. And I can not choose / stop thinking about it.

This is a really hard choice to make since both ways are the absolute opposites, and are potential life changers, but maybe I am just overthinking.

Should I choose comfort and most possibly huge regret in the future or creative challenge, growth, uncertainty, and instability?

If there's people here in creative business, people with similar experiences or any people who can relate or give and share their perspectives, I would really really appreciate it!

Need some pointers/advice.",clockedIn223,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/8kh4dw/just_landed_aninternship_for_full_stack_web/,"A little bit of background information I am currently a senior at a 4-year college pursuing a degree in computer science. I have never been taught anything web related in school (not because I don't want to, but because there is only 1 web development class offered that never fits into my schedule) and I more or less self-taught myself everything. I dabbled a bit in app development, but once I started doing web development I knew that's what I wanted to do.

I have made some sites myself mostly using HTML/SASS/JS/JQ/Bootstrap front-end and all the backends I made have been with PHP and MYSQL. I used the XAMMP windows GUI with managing the databases when I am working locally.

More recently I got an internship where I was supposed to do Full stack work, but the employer thought I knew the MEAN stack (which I don't yet and I told him in the interview) so for that internship I was basically doing front-end Angular 4, and other misc things like converting HTML --&gt; email supported HTML (never again).

Fast-forward to today I got another internship working as a web developer for a local leader of non-profits communities. I had my first in-person interview with the employer in question a few days ago, and they said they assembled a great team of students to work on this project. Keep in mind, I still don't know what I will be making at that point as the internship listing was very vague and didn't really specify anything. I came to meet the employer and the team and we discussed what they wanted to achieve. Again the employer gave a very broad description and left me and all the members of the group confused. To make it worse she assigned the graphic design part of the project to an accounting major (!) who claims he has no idea how to design anything. The other guy applied for the data gathering/ database position but he is just a Math major who doesn't know SQL/mySQL and just plans to enter all the data in excel and let me parse it.

Needless to say this all seems very unprofessional, but I am eager to get more experience (yes it is unpaid) so should I take the internship or cut now?  

If I did take the job what technologies would you propose I use for making site that would have some sort of user login system? I know it can be done with PHP etc... But I want to expand my breadth of web technology/libraries and use something more relevant so I was considering using the MEAN stack.

Once I graduate High School next spring, I planned on working for a year to build up some cash and take the remaining class or two for my Associates degree. I then in the fall of 2020 planned on going into a dual major program at a Uni near me for Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, a good plus of this is you get 3 semesters of paid internship to help keep at least a little bit of a stable income and this goes towards your degree. So 4 1/2 years is really like 3 for a dual major plus I'll be transferring a ton of electives and classes so I don't have to take some every semester nearly. I won't be able to rely on my parents, despite them making a lot of money, my Step Dad never went to college and always though working the max amount of hours you could the moment you could get a job was the best thing to do and my Mother doesn't want to help because my Grandparents didn't her when she went to college when she turned like 23 (yes, she's mad because they didn't help her because she already had a stable income, 2 children, 1 of which my Grandparents were the legal guardian of and never showed them much of any support towards them doing that and ha a history of not completing things) AND they want me to buy the car THEY ""GAVE"" me as a gift for my 16th birthday when I turn 18. Now this isn't all that bad... but they showed it off in front of the whole family as if it was a gift and then I heard them talking about their ""plans"" with their car when I turned 18, I never knew about this until like a year after owning the car. I know I can rely on my grandparents for some help, they would never not let me live in their house and would always make sure I had food because of how much I do for them. Despite working now and working at most for about about 14 months once I graduate HS to build up money, they want me to buy one of their cars the moment I graduate, give my car ""back"" and probably are going to attempt make me pay rent. The day I turn 18 they'll likely never provide me with a meal again and it scares me. I can pay insurance, I can pay for gas, I cannot pay off a $5,000 car loan on top of that while going to school year round, full time at 13-17 credit hours a semester in a DUAL engineering program. I don't want to leave my house on bad terms but every week it just gets worse. It's the constant lies and secrets that they keep from me that make me not want to ""buy"" their car (likely because they just want to buy a new one) and the fact that it was kept a secret that I had to give the car back. It's the fact that my Mother talked to my Grandma about the situation and I hear them in the living talking about how much my Grandma ""agreed"" with them but when talking to my Grandma, everything I said sounded insane to her and makes me wonder if my Mother just wanted me to hear that and not question it. I have 0 clue how financial aid works or how I'd be able to take what I earned over the course of next few months and that year I'll take to work and finish the remainder of my degree and make it last with the 3 full semesters of paid internships. And it's all because my 16th birthday gift really wasn't a gift. "

I am a current Computer Science junior with a 4.0 gpa who was offered a dream internship at a big defense company. They need me to obtain a security clearance before I work there.

I flew straight and never did anything stupid like that again. I ended up getting my felony expunged/sealed so I am legally able to tell an employer I have never committed a felony.

I scanned over the SF86 form and realize that I still have to mention my crime. However, the SF86 also has a specific section for Information Technology tampering, Section 27. So I technically have to mention it twice.

My Questions:

1) As of now I haven‚Äôt told my company that I have a record. Should I tell them? They are sponsoring my clearance, but I don‚Äôt know if I have to tell them because of my sealed record. I don‚Äôt want to tell them if I don‚Äôt have to.

Should I get an Atmel ICE? The way I see it, it's the simplest and best supported programming / debugging solution out there. I've used them at my internship and they seem pretty straightforward.

I'm getting my master's degree in a few weeks time so I've begun looking around for jobs, and I've made some observations:  
- There are lots of Graduate Developer jobs  
- There are lots of IT Consultancy jobs
  
I come from a background of business, and have worked in electronics retail for a long time while studying. I really like engaging with customers and sharing my passion for things, but I dislike company policies that place targets over customers. Don't get me wrong, I know companies need to make money, but when a company wants you to sell things to a customer that the customer doesn't need, just so you can meet targets, that's when I think something's not right.  

I like programming and I like IT. I'm okay at programming, not the best, but I've got a solid foundational knowledge in many things, and have studied other programming languages as part of a developer internship I did. I consider myself to have quite good people skills based on my older jobs in retail and I'm trying to find something that matches that.  

My question is then this: Are there any suitable jobs that do not involve sitting at a desk and programming 40 hours a week, but rather something that mixes this with something more sociable/customer-facing? I'm at a bit of a loss what kind of jobs that might be..  I'd definitely like to stay in the area of technology and computers, but I don't mind so much what area it is, more that the work itself is interesting.  

Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"

8km8bo,2,2018-05-19,At my wit's end!,GarnetElf,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8km8bo/at_my_wits_end/,"So, I had an interview yesterday for an IT internship. I doubt very seriously that I will get it. Here's why. Sorry in advance for the wall of text. 

So, I interviewed with three men. Two of them seemed to be understanding of where I am (very entry level) and gave me good feedback. The head of the IT department was visibly less than impressed with my knowledge. I don't blame him on that. I'm a senior for my Bachelor's and our focus for my degree relies on programming for the most part. I have not had much outside experience with either programming or IT other than the small projects that I do for myself or others. 

He told me that they were looking for an experienced person for the internship. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that the point of an internship? To gain experience? Anyway, it became obvious that they were looking for someone with a lot more experience and direction as to what they want to be. The director interrupted me several times and spoke over me, which I found frustrating. I am a generally soft spoken person, so that's common. He kept joking around and told me that it was because he felt that I was uptight. Now, I went in there a little nervous but not extremely so. I made sure that my demeanor was professional and respectful. I made eye contact and made sure to explain myself to the best of my abilities and actively listened to what they were saying. But I'm uptight? Sorry for trying to be professional and hoping that you'll take me seriously. 

Before the interview ended, the director if the IT department  asked me what my long-term goals were. I want to teach CS, but I need something in my field until I get my Master's. I told him that I would either like to program or help desk for a while. He absolutely did not like that I said I would like to work help desk and told me that I should change my mind. I told him that I had also looked into becoming a system administrator if I took the more IT route. He started grilling me on what kind of sys admin I wanted to be, and I honestly told him that I was still researching that. On the final note, he told me that I really needed to decide what exactly I want to do. I told him that I can do a little bit of everything and I am willing to learn to do anything. The director didn't like that. 

It's true that I'm not sure what exactly I'd like to do. I have very little hands on experience other than the little I am able to do in my free time and what I do at my university. How am I supposed to know exactly what I want to do yet? 

I can't get an internship because I don't have experience. I can't find a job in my field because I don't have experience. I can't even find a job only requiring a high school diploma because I don't have experience doing that exact job. What exactly am I supposed to do to gain that experience? "
8kmfaw,2,2018-05-19,Confused about my career,Synosis1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8kmfaw/confused_about_my_career/,So this is my first time post here and taking a break from studying discrete math (fuck this stuff).

8kmsl8,1913,2018-05-19,Something happened in the psychiatric ward,misterdoctor6,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8kmsl8/something_happened_in_the_psychiatric_ward/,"I‚Äôm a medical student and in the last two weeks I‚Äôve been attending the scheduled internship in Psychiatry.

I happen to be very interested in the subject, to the point of considering it as a career path after graduation, and as it happens I‚Äôve gotten into probably the best department I could have ended up in; or the worst, depending on your point of view.

It is a sort of intensive care unit, but for psychiatric patients; they basically get the worst cases, patch them up as best as they can and send them to an appropriate structure.

Everything is locked up and strictly controlled, as we get a bit of everything, from those at high suicide risk, to those suffering from bipolar disorder, to schizophrenic people talking to God, who, incidentally, is always their father. The problems with these last ones come when this ‚ÄúGod‚Äù tells them to beat up other patients, as, obviously, they are infidels.

Things went on, with ups and downs and the usual problems tied to the profession, such as the guy who walked in and went on to casually announce that he was carrying a number of knives inside his suitcase, or the ex\-convict who insisted on coming in the Doctor‚Äôs office because he disagreed with the therapy and decided to sit beside me while vehemently arguing with the on\-duty psychiatrist.

I kind of hope I was still there, sitting beside the ex\-convict and trying to make myself basically invisible.

Five days ago, a middle\-aged man, I‚Äôll call him Mr. R. for privacy‚Äôs sake, came in. He did so of his own volition.

In his own words, he ‚Äúreally needed for them to be silent for a while‚Äù.

R.‚Äôs appearance was a bit peculiar, balding and stocky he had a sallow complexion and wore ill\-fitting sunglasses. Like, always, outside as well as inside.

His mannerisms were unconventional as well: twitchy and nervous, he always seemed to be on the lookout for something.

Some might think that it wouldn‚Äôt be so strange to see someone behaving like that in such a place, but most patients usually looked lost and confused, unfocused, as if they had too many thoughts at the same time, or not enough at all.

He was nothing like that, he at most seemed slightly distressed.

I was given the opportunity and privilege to attend Mr. R.‚Äôs first session, as proposed by the doctor and under the patient‚Äôs agreement. He agreed.

It‚Äôs safe to say that I was absolutely fascinated by his case.

You see, most schizophrenic patients start suffering from an early age, usually around 16\-18 years old, from auditory hallucinations, which can take different natures.

Some insult the person, constantly degrading them to the point of driving them to suicide, some tell them what to do, and can be rather dangerous.

Another common characteristic is that the patients are completely unaware that the voices only exist within their minds and only they can hear them.

R. was an exception in every respect.

First of all, he introduced his case by stating clearly that he was aware that the figures he saw, he was the only one who saw them.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the sickness that makes me see them.‚Äù, he said.

That‚Äôs right, he didn‚Äôt just hear, he saw things. Not people. Figures. He called them ‚Äúdemons‚Äù, four of them.

He could even describe them in detail, citing horns and claws, and cold, dark eyes that looked like pure void. They could even turn to a more draconic appearance when they turned more hostile. They could even ‚Äúwear other people‚Äôs faces as their own‚Äù to trick him.

The first time they appeared it was in his mid\-thirties. As he came home, he saw them trying to possess his mother, and they tried to use her to kill him, he said.

They hadn‚Äôt left him since, and only meds seemed to keep a hold of them and at least make them silent.

He kept telling us about them, adding details and stories each time, until yesterday.

Then, something happened.

During our third session the psychiatrist asked him where those demons were.

R. silently pointed at the windowsill. The very same windowsill I was standing next to, silently taking notes.

‚ÄúAre they telling you something?‚Äù asked the psychiatrist.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ they‚Äôve been silent as of late.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo they do something? Are they doing something right now?‚Äù

R. looked around, a bit in distress, but eventually nodded.

‚ÄúWhat are they doing?‚Äù

When I didn‚Äôt hear an answer, I looked up from my notes. R. was pointing directly at me.

‚ÄúWhat are they doing?‚Äù repeated the psychiatrist.

‚ÄúThey are looking at him. Staring.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a shiver run down my spine. I knew those were just hallucinations, but his finger pointed at me. His‚Ä¶ face \- *It was the stuff of nightmares.*

‚ÄúSometimes in the last few days they disappeared. When I find them again they‚Äôre with him. They‚Äôve been following him.‚Äù

The psychiatrist glared at me with a furrowed brow.

‚ÄúDo you know what they want? Do they want to use him to do you harm like they did with your mother?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, not at all. They don‚Äôt want to hurt me.‚Äù

Today R. came directly to me as I was getting ready to go home, taking off my white coat.

He took off his sunglasses and looked at me with those eyes, dark and endless, as if made of pure void.

‚ÄúThank you, doctor. Finally, I‚Äôm free.‚Äù

I‚Äôm writing this, sitting at my desk, a mere half hour later.

I‚Äôm writing this to make sure someone knows what happened, and that I‚Äôm not crazy.

Because I can‚Äôt see anything, nor hear anyone. But I can feel their breath on my neck."

Before that, I was working on an internship at the same company the past fall and based on that they asked me to come back. We already had an oral agreement that the contract would be continued after summer and we already have a date agreed on about when I'll continue in August. The contract itself hasn't been made yet.

I've been working two jobs the whole spring and it's taken its toll on me. I was forced to because when they asked me to work for this company, I already had a fixed term contract for weekends as a side job for the same spring. Days off are scarce but I needed the money and experience this job provides me with. I've been pretty stressed out. I do realize that this is my problem and not the company's.

It all culminated last Wednesday when I really wasn't feeling good. I was in a terrible mood the whole day. I didn't yell at anyone or anything, but I expressed my bad mood in an instance that probably raised some eyebrows by giving my coworker a passive-aggressive response and leaving the scene.

The next day, I apologized to my supervisor who was present when it happened. She said that I am forgiven on everyone's behalf. She said that everyone has those days, but expressed disappointment that I was not able to contain my mood better, which was fair. She also said that everyone noticed I was in a bad mood and that's bad news when you're working at customer service, which I am. I didn't lash out on customers or anything, but I probably wasn't as cheerful and polite as I usually am. But nonetheless, she said that I'm forgiven for this. After that everyone has been acting quite normal, including my supervisor and I did my best to maintain a good disposition on Thursday and be extra nice to my coworkers and customers to show everyone I am putting in effort to correct my mistake. My supervisor also went out of her way to chat with me and I read it as a ""we're cool, don't worry about it"". But I was shaken by her words.

In my mind, the fact that everyone noticed my bad mood has somehow translated to everyone gossiping about it behind my back. I was on a vacation on Friday, and I'm afraid they agreed then that my contract won't be renewed because of this and they'll hire someone else for next fall.

This thought has plagued my whole weekend. I keep having anxiety attacks, visualizing in my mind how I'll go to work on Monday, my boss will ask to talk to me and he'll tell me that my contract won't be renewed. I've been crying, feeling like an utter failure because this was my first job in my own field. I have about a week left before my current contract ends and I'm determined to put in effort to do an outstanding job, but I'm not sure if it's enough to save me.

I am extremely hard on myself and beat myself up over mistakes. In a way, I'm giving myself this weekend to wallow in it so that I can return to work on Monday at my best and having put this behind me, whatever the outcome will be. Does my fear sound silly to you or am I right to be worried?

I'm sorry for the wall of text."

I have a few questions and im hoping you guys could help me sort them out. Thank You!

1. I was overanxious and accepted the first job that offered me a position. They made me sign out stuff like Employee Payroll Authorizations and Employee Forms. Now, im finding that i might potentially land an engineering internship, and if i do, would it be possible to decline the job after all that is signed? I heard it was OK, if i gave a 2 week notice beforehand. 

2. Another Job i applied to, was one where the hiring manager was a close teacher that taught me in high school. Although he has not officially offered me a job. I would have alot of trouble potentially declining his offer if he gave me the job, as i feel i would have let him down. How would i deal with this situation? 

3. One of my references are going on vacation and wont respond to any emails until the end of summer. Is it okay if they send an email to the employer instead of waiting for an employer to contact them?

Days off are scarce but I needed the money and experience this job provides me with. I've been pretty stressed out. I do realize that this is my problem and not the company's.

It all culminated last Wednesday when I really wasn't feeling good. I was in a terrible mood the whole day. I didn't yell at anyone or anything, but I expressed my bad mood in an instance that probably raised some eyebrows by giving my coworker a passive-aggressive response and leaving the scene.

The next day, I apologized to my supervisor who was present when it happened. She said that I am forgiven on everyone's behalf. She said that everyone has those days, but expressed disappointment that I was not able to contain my mood better, which was fair. She also said that everyone noticed I was in a bad mood and that's bad news when you're working at customer service, which I am. I didn't lash out on customers or anything, but I probably wasn't as cheerful and polite as I usually am. But nonetheless, she said that I'm forgiven for this. After that everyone has been acting quite normal, including my supervisor and I did my best to maintain a good disposition on Thursday and be extra nice to my coworkers and customers to show everyone I am putting in effort to correct my mistake. My supervisor also went out of her way to chat with me and I read it as a ""we're cool, don't worry about it"". But I was shaken by her words.

In my mind, the fact that everyone noticed my bad mood has somehow translated to everyone gossiping about it behind my back. I was on vacation on Friday, and I'm afraid they agreed then that my contract won't be renewed because of this and they'll hire someone else for next fall.

This thought has plagued my whole weekend. I keep having anxiety attacks, visualizing in my mind how I'll go to work on Monday, my boss will ask to talk to me and he'll tell me that my contract won't be renewed. I've been crying, feeling like an utter failure because this was my first job in my own field and I just went and acted so immature. I have about a week left before my current contract ends and I'm determined to put in effort to do an outstanding job, but I'm not sure if it's enough to save me.

I am extremely hard on myself and beat myself up over mistakes. In a way, I'm giving myself this weekend to wallow in it so that I can return to work on Monday at my best and having put this behind me, whatever the outcome will be. Does my fear sound silly to you or am I right to be worried?

I'm sorry for the wall of text."

Anyway, I've been doing 70\-80 hour type weeks in engineering for the last 4 years in college. Had to keep a 3.5 GPA to maintain scholarships and be able to afford school, so for the first 2 or 3 years, school was ridiculously high\-pressure and high\-stress. The pressure has kind of eased off around senior year, but I took two extremely long lab classes in the fall and spring that kept me working about 20 hours a week just on the lab parts alone.

So for the last four years, I've usually worked all day, 7 days a week, and basically forgot about all hobbies or social life to keep working. I never had friends in college - there were some people I talked to, but we only ever talked about schoolwork. I went all of this last semester without taking a single night off, no going to the movies, no parties, no gaming, no anything.

Now, even that I'm out of school and working on an internship, I just feel depressed all the time and feel like I can never snap out of school mode. I can't fall asleep before 12 AM, because I always stayed up later than that for school \(and I've always been something of a night owl\). It's a problem when you need to be to work at 7:30 AM every day. I just don't feel like anything is fun, and like I should always have something to be working on. I got so bored about sitting in my apartment today that I considered driving into work for some unpaid overtime, just cause I felt like I should be doing something productive. Having roommates around and trying to talk to me just irritates the hell out of me, probably because I've been alone for so long and now it's just a comfort zone. And of course, that just pushes them away and makes me feel even more burned out and isolated.

I don't know if anyone has dealt with this before or how they might have got out of of it, but any advice would be appreciated. This shit sucks."

I'm a Computer Science student for a bachelor degree. I have about 1 year left of school and thought it would be interesting to do some interviews to see how it goes and see what I can get as in the area a lot of students in cs start working quite early.


After several interviews at a certain company, I got an offer for a part time job, which is financially totally reasonable for a position of intern. The position is ""Software Engineer Student"".

The thing is that the domain in which the company is specialized and the product that the company develop doesn't interest me..

I have a few days to give them back an answer and I have not made my choice yet. I can accept the offer, start a job at a company that doesn't quite interests me, or take the risk to refuse, continue to search for a job somewhere else, but potentially not find a job in at least a few months..


How critical is the first job if I know that I want to build my career in a different domain ? Would the experience in that company be countful in my C.V ?

I initially intended on doing a PhD and even accepted on offer from a top 10 CS program, but some very recent family stuff has made the 5-6 year commitment with minimal earnings no longer possible. Because of this I'm beginning to apply to CS jobs. The primary problem is that my background was geared towards doing research and getting in to a top grad program, and not towards industry whatsoever. 

My background is mostly theoretical and very focused on research. In particular, my ""expertise"" is in algorithms and theory in general. Although I do have quite a bit of experience in programming and the more ""practical"" side of CS (graduate level PL course, graduate level ML course, web dev course, OS course) but, as I alluded to, I'm anxious that my background won't lend itself very well to finding a good programming job (I didn't do tech internships, I did research, nor did I do hackathons or things like that and my ""personal projects"" were math based and didn't generally involve large scale software projects). 

I am looking for general advice on how I might market myself and make my profile more attractive to employers as someone who didn't really focus on being employable (Yes, in retrospect this looks stupid, but my goal of getting into a good grad school worked, it's just that the plans changed).

8kppba,9,2018-05-19,Cow Head,macabrenocturnelle,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8kppba/cow_head/,"When it comes to the past time can be kind or cruel. A speck of dust forever immortalized in the never\-fading purgatory of time. All civilizations have three fates to be remembered, stuck in lore or  forgotten. Sometimes fate takes pity on certain civilizations and lets them be discovered on the brink of being fully devoured by mother nature, but at a cost of the truth not being fully known. 

I believe this is what lead me to the path I'm currently on in hopes of becoming an archaeologist. In hopes of discovering the forgotten and solving mysteries. Last spring when I and a group of other students went to Japan to intern at a new archeology site, I wasn't participating in what would be found.  Given that you have to expect anything when it comes to these sites and the treasures they house. No matter how horrific they maybe\-It speaks of how humanity as a whole evolved from such primitive ways of thinking. 

It was a beautiful spring day and the countryside was like that of a fairy tale. Cherry blossom tres with their blushed color flowers swayed gracefully in the breeze. The rice fields and mountains where so serene. It hard to think such places still exist. But even such beauty can house a darkness that goes beyond that man can understand or even comprehend of existing. That is the one thing surprising about the world in which we live.....With all of its beauty, there is just as much terror. 

After what seemed like hours we finally came to the picturesque spot. It didn't look like anything at first glance. Just an open field. We got out of the van stretching out what everybody part felt cramped as we made our way to the professor and his team that would oversee us. Another place of the area the only thing that remains of the village we would be extricating was only the outline of the homes and other buildings that use to be. Almost like a reminding specter to present time forwarning of what could be. We began work right away, I was stationed at what was believed to be a barn. Digging lasted for hours until I saw something... It was extremely small glimpse but it was ivory white. 

Calling the professor over he rushed over and order his team members to come and dig the rest up. When they finished revealed to our disbelief was a  disfigured skeleton. The following days more research was done since it they only full skeleton we could find in the whole entire village. We lovingly nicknamed the skeleton Gozu, since we all agreed it was proper to give the skeleton and identity. Gozu was a young adult male who had Proteus syndrome. Which made his head and face look cow like while at the same time disfiguring other parts of his body as well.  He lived and died during the time of the Yowa famine.

Gozu would have probably never known happiness or love since his condition was so severe he would have been probably thought as a folkloric yokai. I don't know why but I remembering when I was looking at the skeleton, that I felt a distinct mass amount of hatred emanating from it. At that moment I just tallied it up to my thoughts being overwhelmed to how lonely he must have been.   The following days the team was engulfed with euphoria over the finding of Gozu since we thought we would find more. 

The weeks went on and the only other things we found was a few pottery pieces, plates, and a few butchering tools. There was on building spot that seemed to have nothing but ash and sand under what use to be the foundation. It was concluded that the rest of the villagers left and Gozu stayed behind. I couldn't shake off the feeling that something wasn't right, the feeling ha grown after coming back to the site after Gozu was discovered. I couldn't put my finger on it there was just something off.  As the internship was coming to the head the professor decided that the reason why nothing else could be found.The last night, I drifted into an inhume deep slumber. 

I remember feeling nothing at first but then the hard firmness of ground and the weird crunching sound of a light straw. Sitting up I found my self in some type of barn with a single cow. She eyed me from her peripheral. I set myself up and surveyed my surroundings.  There was a dark corner that made my instincts higher more than they already were.  Not daring to turn my head, my suspicions were answered. Slowly moving out of the shadows in a clumsy way was a young man who was horribly disfigured. In fact, he looked exactly like how Gozu must have looked like before death. He had unkept shoulder length hair, clothes dirtied, skin full of scars and blemishes, and a small steady stream of drool that flowed from his gaping mouth. 

Oddly he seemed to not notice my presence and it was when I saw him that I knew I must be dreaming. Having a morbid curiosity of what his life was like, I let this visionary specter guide me through my fantasies. An older man came into the barn clearly frustrated and worn, I could on presume it was Gozu's father. Gozu looked at the man as if in fear. The man stormed over to Gozu and started to beat him, cursing him.  He yelled at Gozu that he is an embarrassment, a curse, that he should have died since no woman would give him a breast to suckle from as a baby and that if it wasn't for the cow he would have died. The man mutter that Gozu was only good for scaring off armies. 

He went even more into a blind rage beating Gozu continuing to spew abuse while Gozu coward and made animals noises.  Sometimes he stopped and looked at the cow. He took a  hatchet that was on a working table and went over to the cow. I believe that the man wanted to kill his son but knew death would be too kind. To hurt the creature that had shamed his family and also to supply food since at this time food rations would have been running low. Started to chop at the cow. The only creature to show Gozu any type of affection. The cow cried in pain and betrayal of how it's master who cared for it for probably years could make it feel nothing but pain and agony. 

It was a long and gruesome kill. There wasn't one place where blood didn't touch.  A steady stream leads to Gozu who looked like his world was shatter into a million of pieces. The man took some a couple of legs and left. It was only when he did that I followed Gozu's lead and took a look at the stable.  The cow had been horribly butcher. Various entrails and bodily bits littered over the cow's corpse and walls. Gozu let out the most animalistic cry that I didn't think was possible for a man to make. My heart pound and my mind raced.

Even though I knew this wasn't real I felt real genuine fear. My instincts telling me to run get away from Gozu\-but I must know what happens, what really happens to the other villagers, the animals, everything. Gozu sat beside the cow's body for a few moments before slowly getting up. His body had a sinister language to it. He went to retrieve a farming tool and slowly went out into the village. My body didn't move, curiosity didn't matter anymore since I knew what was about to take place was going to be the stuff of nightmares. It wasn't even thirty minutes later that I started to hear screams of various people.  I looked out the window of the barn and saw villager silhouettes running frantically away from Gozu who was wildly attacking anything that moved. I moved away from the window and into the nearest corner where I covered my hears trying to deafen the sound of screams. As fast as it had started it ceased. 

I  could hear a wet sloshing sound approaching the barn. I held my breath and kept telling my self that's only a dream, I can't be hurt. Gozu had returned, he slowly turned his head to the corner I huddled and in and slowly came over. My eye widens, my heart felt like that if it could jump out of my chest it would.  He didn't acknowledge me before, so why now.  He got an inch away from my face.  His black eyes pierced mine. He was covered in blood and sniffed me. Closing my eyes not knowing what to expect he let out the inhuman scream that he had done back when the cow was killed. 

I awoke in a cold sweat, safe in my bed. As my group and I were leaving and on our way to the airport. we were notified by the professor and his team that the sand and ash that we had found in one of the buildings wasn't sand or regular ash but of human and various animal bones. "
8kpt7c,2,2018-05-19,Need Help on Deciding What I Want To Do After My Associates,asdfrewq15,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8kpt7c/need_help_on_deciding_what_i_want_to_do_after_my/,"TL;DR when I finish my associates in computer information technology with a concentraiton on programming, should I do another year of CC to meet my transfer requirements to go to a 4 year degree and then get my bachelors in CS

So first off, I am going to see an advisor sometime next week.

But I'd like to hear from people who are in the industry as well

Here's the situation:

Currently I am in a career path associates at my community college that is non-transferable.  *some* of the classes are transferable, but most of these classes would be considered electives by most universities. 

I chose this career path originally because I was never a very good student in high school, and I figured choosing a career path that solely focuses on programming would be a better option for me. **Also another important thing to mention:** per requirements of the career path I have chosen is a mandatory internship to graduate.  

Now next spring semester I will be doing my internship as required, as well as receiving my degree.  I currently have a 3.6 GPA as well.  

Originally I just wanted to take the associates and run off into the industry. But as I get deeper into my self studies, I can't help but feel I'm missing out on not having a 4 year degree. The career path I'm in has given us a lot of real world training on making apps/guis/working with frameworks/scripting etc. stuff we'll see in the real world. But concepts like recursion and data structures just aren't taught at all (I have been self teaching these concepts to myself over this summer btw).  We're simply learning to program apps, and it seems we're being setup to be more web devs than anything.

Now, In order for me to be eligible to transfer to the university I want to go too, I'll have to probably spend another year after receiving my associates at this community college getting rid of the gen ed requirements such as calculus, matrix algebra, american history, stuff like that, etc.

Then I will have to spend 2 years after that to get my bachelors

The cost of the 4 year doesn't concern me at all, it will probably only run me about 18K in to debt (college I want to go to is ~$9000 a year) since my community college is all paid for, and I will have experience from my internship next spring, and plan to do internships while I'm at university as well
_________________________________________

So basically if I finish this year out and immediately try to enter the work force I will have:

- Associates of Computer Information Technology Programming Concentration
- 1 internship

And if I take on the extra schooling and transfer into a traditional CS program I will have

- Associates of Computer Information Technology Programming Concentration
- General Associates (for transfer eligibility)
- Bachelors in Comp Sci
- 2 or possibly more internships

I'd love to just hop right into the workforce, but I feel like I'm at a severe disadvantage if I only get my associates.  And at some point in my life I feel like I want to get a masters.

Any suggestions?

Edit: Here's a rundown of what I would have to take https://imgur.com/KHnRsFe

I would like to know the best way to get to Germany, the Job Seekers visa requires a minimum of 5 years of work experience and I can't get an Employment visa because the Philippines isn't in the list of eligible countries. Is the best way the Specialist Professional work permit? I'd need ""A contract of employment"" and ""Letter of intent or contract offered to you by a German employer, including a detailed description of the employment"" according to http://www.germany-visa.org/work-employment-visa/.

Why Berlin? Good startup environment, I like cold weather, software companies operate in English, the pay is good and the cost of living is low. Would like to experience living in Europe and compare it to life in SEA and the USA. Furthermore, I've read that one can live in Berlin for a month on around 800 euros, so I was thinking maybe 2000 euros is good to get by, what do you think?

I had zero experience coming in.  I understand that it takes time to understand and I should give it a month or two before I finally decide to put my two weeks in.

It's just...the more I think about it the more I don't even want to show up next week for my job. It's not just the job itself, but the people I work with. My manager/head pharmacist is just so condescending and rude. Anytime I do something wrong I get berated in front of everyone.  Then, the person who was training me that day gets yelled at too (you know...so the person training me is pissed at me as well).  Yesterday, was my 8th day in the pharmacy and I had three days off prior to that. I was semi-confused on a task that was asked of me to do. I ended up fucking it up and just caused everything to be backed up (which considering we just started wasn't much). The pharmacist/manager is yelling for my trainer to come help me, but she's busy trying to help the people in line. Then the pharmacist keeps telling me how ""I should know this already"". That didn't make the situation any better...yelling at me that I should know something isn't going to make me suddenly know it.  

The shifts are always like this. The first 2-3 hours go awful and then the rest of the shift smooths out.  Another thing that I've been thinking about is that I'm the only person there in my age range who ISN'T going to school for pharmacy. Of course the other 20-somethings have to listen to her bitching...they need intern hours. I shouldn't have to take her shit.

I am working full time in the bay area right now and I graduated from Waterloo just less than a year ago. I never had a girlfriend when I was in school so I never thought of anything when the two female interns joined my team.

But on Friday this week, when I was waiting for the company bus at the shuttle stop, one of them came to me. She sat beside me on the bus bench and just started a casual conversation with me. It was then I noticed that she is actually really attractive. When I got on the bus, she asked if she could sit beside me and we continued talking. I found out that she was going to a dinner hosted by my former employer from another coop. I offered her all the insights that I could in the hope of improving her liking of me. I even showed her the way and walked a short distance with her to the restaurant she was suppose to go to since I was also having dinner in the area.

Afterward, I immediately started to imagine a life with her, the weight of being in an relationship and kids. She is most of the things that I want; pretty, just a bit younger, single, american born chinese, well off family, and studying cs at Duke. I think I actually have a good shot with her and I am going to seriously try hard for once in my life.

But after waking up this morning, I begin to doubt if I should go for her. There is another female intern on my team and she is subjectively just as attractive as the first one. She is pretty and a chinese international at waterloo. I am now conflicted on who to go after. Both of them has their pros and cons and I have never being this indecisive.

I thought about going for both at the same time but I am well aware that it is a bad idea more likely than not. I should just focus on one and reduce the complexity of this endeavour. I don't want to be seen as a womanizer.

Going for an intern is most likely a hr violation but I am sure it would okay. I just have so many thoughts on this about what I should do at the moment.

tl:dr I like the two female interns on my team, should I go after one of them even though I am pretty sure it is a hr violation."

My brother‚Äôs girlfriend always suffered from lacking self-esteem. She was good in school, but largely because my brother helped her through. After high school, my brother knew he likely wanted to attend university, but he was not sure what he wanted to study, so they decided to take a year or two off so he could figure it out. Meanwhile, the girl decides she wants to become a shop assistant and uses the time to go to school and take the examination. Most of this education revolves around paid internships. She was lucky to find a place very quickly and very unlucky to find a place with a manager who was made up of 50% Hitler, 20% Pol Pot and 30% Napalm. Long story short, she stuck it out but was, as many of us after our first real job experience, disillusioned about what life appears to offer after school; a huge blow to someone who was not that strong-willed in the first place. But hey, at least she was free to pick where she wanted to work now. 


At this point, my brother decides on line at the university, and off they go to the big city. This is where things suddenly takes a turn for the, frankly, incredible. The girl does not want to be a shop assistant. She hated it, and even though she spent two years of her life going through the exam, she knew it was never going to be her calling, and that her life was worth too much to spent time being miserable. Queue the ‚Äúwhaaaaats‚Äù from all of us. Nope, she wanted to become an assistant vet (ish‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know the exact translation for the position, but it is something along those lines). 
I have to be honest at this point. Most of us, outside of my brother, were thinking this was beyond stupid. Yeah, she had a bad experience with the store she worked in, but that did not mean she couldn‚Äôt be happy. After all, happiness is something you have to work for and all the other clich√©s we tell ourselves to make life appear less horrible sometimes. But she was adamant! She loved animals and wanted to work with that for the rest of her life. 


To do this, however, she needed to find a vet who was willing to offer her an internship over the course of the education. These are, at best, very difficult to find. Especially when you arrive with no experience what-so-ever. Did that deter her? Not in the slightest. Over the course of the next 8 months she drove around to every single vet there was in a 200km radius. She brought them resumes, she brought them cover letters and promises of everything she had and more. Ultimately to no avail. 


At this point, most of us, again, were saddened by what was transpiring in front of us‚Ä¶ At least she could take a small job to help them financially. Seeing her being pushed away time after time was horrible, also because my brother was having a very hard time with it too, as you might imagine. 
Instead, she decides that her best chances of pursuing her dream is getting experience. Instead of looking for internships, she starts driving around offering herself as volunteer for pet shelters. After a few more months, this finally pays off. She a place in a small shelter where she can help as much as she likes. Its unpaid, and not authorized as a place where she can do her internship. However, she is happy about the small victory. The lady running the shelter quickly realizes that her new employee wants this more than the average person, so she starts making some calls. It lands her a few interviews, but all of them with the same, grim conclusion. So now she had network and that did not help either. I‚Äôm sure most of us would have given up by now, but not her. No, she knew what she wanted, and she was not afraid to go for it. Which leads us to last month. A vet hospital not too far from where they live suddenly calls her, and ask her to come in for an interview. She goes, thinking that the outcome probably will be the same as always. However, two days later she calls telling us that she has accepted an offer from them, which allows her to start school this fall, and until then she is employed full-time as their assistant. Fuck_yes! 


This has made me realize a few things about this whole process which I thought might be helpful to some of you; it most certainly has given me some extremely important life-lessons:

1.	There is no substitute for hard work. She knew what she wanted, and more importantly what she did not want. And then she gave her everything, every single day until she got it. 

2.	Believe in yourself! If you don‚Äôt bet on yourself, no one will. It starts and ends with you.

3.	Support each other. I am so shameful over my thoughts on the matter. None of us wanted to hurt her, but we did not want to see her go through what she did either. That was the wrong mindset. We should have supported her dreams with no conditions at all, and I will forever not be angry with myself over that.

4.	These things take time. Sometimes you are lucky/skilled to have the stars align and you get the offer you are after. Other times, you have to work stupendously hard for it. You have to change your strategy and approach many times until it works. But it is worth it because it will pay off eventually. 

I hope this story might offer some of you a little bit of hope and reassurance in that going for what you want, even if it will seem impossible at times, is worth it. You deserve to be happy, much like my brother‚Äôs girlfriend. And she has never been happier. And I have never been more proud of her and my brother for working through it all, sticking by each other when the rest of us did not, and ultimately come out successful on the other side!

8kscuh,509,2018-05-20,Self-esteem is incredibly important.,trackerFF,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8kscuh/selfesteem_is_incredibly_important/,"So this post might come off as a bit unusual, but I think it's really important to bring up for the people here on the job hunt. 

Confidence and self-esteem is king. So much good talent goes wasted because they lack self-esteem. Not just the confidence in their CS skills, but in themselves, too - to jump into new things - apply for jobs, take on projects, etc.

A lot of people here are probably faced with rather daunting looking job ads, and are thinking to themselves ""There's no way in hell I qualify for that job. Better keep on looking"", and then they end up with a smaller and smaller list of options. 

It's a terrible self-fulfilling prophecy, as the less you try, the less you actually want to try. And maybe you'll even make a bad habit of conditioning yourself to always move the goal-post. *""Oh, I can't apply for that job yet. I first have to [take x class / master y skill / work on z projects] first""* 

While you're doing that, other people are just jumping right into it. 
 

As a personal note: I never had any internships or relevant jobs during college. Why? I never thought I was good enough. Somehow, I had conditioned myself to believe that every company on earth only wanted 3.5-4.0 GPA students. One year turned into anther, and before I knew it, I had graduated. Five years had passed. 

And then the anxiety set in. What did I have to show for? Mediocre grades and absolutely no experience. Every time I was about to hit the ""submit"" button on recruitment websites, I went through my grades transcript, my anemic resume, and closed the fan. 

Meanwhile, my friends were all getting job offers. People I had mentored during University.  

Now, I did end up with a job, and my self-esteem went up from there. When I was at the rock bottom, I decided to build a plan, and stick with it. I made it a personal project to ""just do it"", as Shia put it. 

I curated a list of every potential employer in my area, got the contact information, read up on EVERY single company:

- What their products / services were 
- How they were doing, and their market 
- Wrote a short segment on them. 

I then wrote a personal analysis of myself, asked friends and family about myself. What were my strengths, weaknesses. How to improve, and how to present myself in the best possible way. 

My next task was to call and send out applications, every single day. I called companies and asked them if they needed people with my skills, and told them I was genuinely interested in what they were doing. 

You can't have the right answers to everything, but you better prepare. It's a cheesy saying ""If you do not believe in yourself, no one else will either"" - but it has some truth: 

You need to apply for the jobs - they won't come for you. You also need to convince those hiring that you're the right man for the job. The more curious and enthusiastic you are, the more genuine you will seem to them. "

I am a CS new grad \(finished my courses in April\), and just started working full\-time as a developer. The pay isn't great compared to a lot of my peers \(I make about 30/hr, which is probably at the bottom 20&amp;#37; of my peers\), but it was my first job, and I was happy with it \(I didn't do coop or internship during my university\). I had a difficult time trying to get a job, took me about two months. :/

My questions sort of is, I now have quite a bit of free time to do what I want, I really want to invest that time to advance my career in the next 5 years as much as possible.  My personal background, by taking classes at UBC, is mostly in a bit of C, TypeScript and a bit of Java, but I haven't coded in Java for years. I personally spent some time learning some Python, but don't really have much systematic knowledge about it.

I want to make my questions a bit more clear, so I list them out down below:

1. What would you recommend me to do/learn so I can become a competitive intermediate/senior dev in 5 years? This might sound too money\-oriented but I'm hoping to double my income, if possible :\)
2. Should I try to learn a few more new languages during my free time? In particular, I am thinking of C#/.NET, as I know nothing about it. I am also thinking of learning a more recent language, such as Julia/Go, would that be helpful?
3. Pretty much everybody is talking about machine learning/AI stuff these days, but I just feel like my background isn't really allowing me to do those stuff \- My grades were kinda bad, which was why I didn't want to do school anymore. And I feel like doing grad school is a must for those skills. Should I still try to ""embrace"" ML/AI stuff and learn them a bit? I took AI, but didn't find them to be super useful.

Thanks in advance for all the advice"

After visiting celebrate UCI day, I was able to really see myself doing well and being happy at Irvine, whereas I might be depressed at Berkeley. My intended major is CS and I would for sure be doing that at Irvine. I also have many friends going into UCI and we would be rooming together. At Berkeley, however I would have to meet a gpa requirement then declare my major as CS at the end of the year. Plus, because I was admitted off the waitlist, I would have to either study abroad in London (which is somewhat appealing) or do a bunch of introductory classes under the Fall Program for Freshman instead of traditionally starting school in the Fall. However, Berkeley is offering me a lot more financial aid &amp; scholarships. It‚Äôs also the ideal choice my parents want me to choose. Additionally, housing for Berkeley has been announced and I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt find a roommate. Now that all that background stuff is out of the way, here are the questions:

Should I go to Berkeley, where it‚Äôs cheaper and I know I‚Äôll get a good education at the expense of my happiness and sanity (from its cutthroat environment) and possibly not being able to do CS to make my parents happy? Or should I go to Irvine, where I know I‚Äôll be happier, with some friends, and know I‚Äôll do computer science at the cost of my parents happiness and a couple extra dollars.

Does the difference in rank truly matter? Berkeley is often thought of as on par with MIT and Stanford when it comes to CS. However, I‚Äôve been told prestige of a school truly doesn‚Äôt matter in this field. I‚Äôve read it only matters when applying to startup companies (as they want the best of the best), however for larger companies like Google, it‚Äôs your resume that counts. Would I still be able to get internship opportunities as good as those at Berkeley? In the summer I could still go to Silicon Valley, as I live close by.

Anyways, we ended up getting into a debate over socioeconomic affirmative action; he questioned whether rich kids even have an advantage in admissions at all, chalking it up to ""laziness vs. motivation"". As a low-income student it got me thinking all the barriers I've had to face, and this is my response.

A very large portion of kids from T20s come from wealthy households, that is without question. There is a variety of reasons for this:

* Extracurriculars: IMO the most important part of your application after you pass a certain bar for grades/test scores. A lot of the most impressive EC's come from wealth. I will detail below some examples that most lower income kids often have no idea about until after they graduate.
* Obscure sports that get such as equestrian, rowing, water polo, fencing etc. that have high costs or are only available in rich neighborhoods, yet might get you actively recruited to ivies.
* Research/Science Fairs: Most are only really accessible in richer schools or to kids who have researchers/scientists as parents, or have family connections to labs. Also requires regular transportation to and from a lab.  
* Starting a business/nonprofit: Most startups require an inital investment that only wealthy parents can afford to pay, and there is complicated paperwork to file in order to start an LLC/nonprofit. I've observed many rich parents who own businesses either help their kids start one or transfer ownership to them for their college resumes; this is not available in lower income households.
* Internships: while a ""normal kid"" might be able to get a minimum wage job as a cashier or something, elite internships at big companies in industries like tech and finance are much harder for a high schooler to obtain; often kids who get these have some kind of family connection (their dad knew a guy/had a friend/gave a job at his own business).  
* Music - Getting into regions/states bands or participating in competitions and doing well in them require a lot of money - costly instruments, costly music lessons, etc.
* Stuff like Model UN conferences, FBLA conferences, cost a lot of money just to sign up and pay for the hotel stay and transportation. 
* In the same vein, service trips, ""cultural immersion"" trips, etc. have high prices or often require expensive plane tickets, hotel stays, etc.
* Most extracurriculars require weekly transportation. If a poorer kid's parents work and he has no ride, or they can not afford to pay for gas, then it rules out most ECs, even those that take place at the school. 
* Also children responsibilities like taking care of siblings/the house or working a job can severly limit time for ECs or schoolwork. 
* Many clubs also charge fees and membership dues, and some schools charge for each club you join, and for each AP class you take.
* Letters of Rec: I don't think rich kids have an advantage in teacher recs; however, I would argue they do have an advantage for supplementary letters of rec, be it from a Congressman their parents know, or a research supervisor, etc that poorer kids might not have access to.
* Course Rigor/Grades: Lower income households often do not place an emphasis on education; thus they fall behind early and due to prereqs do not have a competitive schedule or take advanced classes. They have less access to paid tutoring services like Kumon.
* Testing: First, the simple cost of tests and score sends is prohibitive (there are fee waivers, but not everyone who needs it qualifies). APs for example, cost $95 each - this in addition to any fees such as AP course or dual enrollment fees. Next rich kids have access to private SAT/ACT/AP tutoring services, prep courses, prep books, etc. that other kids may not.
* Internet/Computer access: In the 21st Century, I feel these plus a smartphone are almost necessary to do well in school and be a competitve applicant at top colleges (not to mention access college resources and the CommonApp)
* Quality of School: Lower income kids from underfunded public schools, which simply do not have the same resources, quality of teaching, class sizes, available clubs/sports/music, etc as other schools, especially compared to private boarding schools like Exeter that tend to feed into top universities. It is very difficult to strive for ivies when your school offers no advanced courses, no one in your school has ever gotten in, and most of your peers are simply are not focused on academics. Conversely, if they go to a very wealthy public high school, lower income kids might struggle to meet the level of competition from kids of families with more resources. 
* Neighborhood: The areas where lower income kids grow up is also worse on average, whether it be problems with crumbling infrastructure, drug abuse, violence, home abuse, obesity, or poverty. Hard to focus on academics when your mom is worrying how she is going to keep the lights on for next month.
* Application/Essay: Whereas a normal kid at a public high school might have a counselor who deals with 300 kids and meets with each like once a year, rich kids have access to private admissions consultants, essay writing/editing services, etc. that can give them a huge leg up. 
* Financial aid: A lot of the top schools allocate a certain percentage of spots to students not requesting financial aid, or give them preference in admissions due to budget issues. This is especially true for schools that are need-aware, but also somewhat true for so-called ""need-blind"" schools IMO. For example, about 40% of Harvard students dont receive financial aid - this means their families are paying the full 76.6k cost of attendance per year. The 2018 median US household income is below $60k!
* Legacy/ED benefits: Richer kids are more likely to have their parents have gone to an elite school, getting them preference in admissions due to legacy bonus. Early decision, often having acceptance rates much, much higher than the regular decision rates, also benefits the wealthy, as you're locked into that school and can't compare financial aid packages or even know if you'll be able to afford it if you're not rich. 

This is why I feel socioeconomic affirmative action is necessary, and should be implemented more. "

Any advice on the best way to find a job/explain this in interviews would be significantly appreciated. Thank you.**

I'm graduating from a 5 year engineering program early, but my GPA is around 2.5\-2.8.  My major GPA really isn't that much better, but I have a resume with \(biomedical\) research experience, R&amp;D experience with a biomedical engineering company, and more than sufficient leadership experience in extra\-curriculars and engineering\-related things. All of these things were through school because I couldn't afford to have an internship.

I'm graduating from a prestigious liberal arts institution. Some people have told me to lie about my GPA, but that just seems short\-sighted. 

My GPA is low for a few reasons: 

1. I've worked up to 3 jobs during college to avoid loans \(I ended up taking on loans now and don't work and that's how I've managed to fit in extra\-curricular leadership positions\) 

2. one of my friends died out of nowhere during an accident 

3. I developed depression. 

I'm at a great place in my life now, but I don't know if explaining these things makes me look like I have too much baggage.

My plan is to really study hard to be able to thoroughly discuss the things on my resume, but I don't know if I should be applying through online applications because they'll always include my GPA. I really want to just know someone who can link me up, but I guess that's just a dream for us all isn't it"

Study abroad has been my dream since I was a kid and probably the number one thing I was most excited for in college. It was established since even before I started college that I would study abroad my spring semester of junior year. I talked about it all the time because Ive been so excited for the opportunity. But this summer this came up from my parents abruptly. I need to find an internship before October which is when the deadline to apply to my study abroad program is‚Äî and preferably sooner because spots may fill! 

Is this possible? I‚Äôm a political science major and all I want to do is go to law school. But my parents want me and are CONVINCED for some reason that I need an internship with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citi, or those big banks just because I went to one liberal arts and business event. I‚Äôm kind of freaked out by this.  I don‚Äôt have much professional working experience nor do I really know what exactly the whole internship process. I have good grades and some leadership positions as well. But my big exec positions are for this upcoming semester so I‚Äôm not sure if I could even write them on my resume. 

 For location, ideally it would be Chicago since I‚Äôm from the Midwest but I go to school on the east coast so Philly, NYC, DC are options too. Ideally Chicago is the best location financially because my boyfriend goes to school there and I would be able to stay with him in his apartment for that summer.

8kxbak,10,2018-05-20,I'm a first year student with a QA internship interview coming up this Tuesday. I have no relevant experience and am pretty dang nervous. Any tips?,theSuppleLemur,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/8kxbak/im_a_first_year_student_with_a_qa_internship/,"I switched majors into CS just this last year after a year off from school. Beforehand, as a biochemistry major, I had no clue what I wanted to do. I was not driven. Since then I""ve taken a complete 180 and am trying to be the best student I can be and gain relevant experience as soon as possible. I got lucky and landed an interview with a robotics company for a testing intern position. While I definitely don't aspire to work in QA (I want to be a software engineer), I will take anything relevant, especially since it's my first year back. I'll have 2 more summers after this one to get development internships.

I'm pretty damn nervous, I won't lie. I would absolutely love to have this internship. I have no relevant experience right now. I work full time while in school as is to pay for bills, but to be able to work full time AND be something relevant would be fantastic. My current job is completely unrelated in a warehouse.

So, what might I be able to expect for this interview? It's 30 minutes to an hour in front of two people. Basically the only requirements for the posting were ""second year or later student in computer science"" and ""excellent written/verbal communication skills, ability to complete tasks on deadlines, etc."" Without trying to discriminate against our fellow CS students, I'd say I'm much more social and easy to get along with than a lot, so I have that going for me. But I only have a year's worth of classes where I've covered some basic algorithms and basic data structures in C++. That's it! My resume had literally nothing technical on it besides my three relevant classes I've taken.

Any help or advice would be appreciated!"

I'm a ""super senior"" (I need six more classes to graduate and I just finished my fourth year) CS major Math minor at a large but mediocre state university in the US, Georgia specifically. I have a 3.14 GPA, only one project on my github worth mentioning -- a contrived IoT term project -- and while I've had a part time job of some sort for most of my time at college I've never done anything involving actual software development and I haven't done any internships. 


So, this semester, I suddenly realised that I'm kind of a shit candidate, and I intend to remedy that by forcing myself to complete some side projects I've had laying around for the past year, not skipping classes in my last two semesters, learning .net MVC (or tomcat or whatever the Java equivalent is, given that I've taken Java and not C# classes) and a functional programming language. 


I've used Haskell for simple things before (writing functions to solve Project Euler problems and then running them in GHCI) and I like the syntax better than Scala's, but it seems that integration with Java libraries and the JVM is a pretty significant advantage. Which should I learn? Since I might try to learn .net some should I just learn F#? Given that I live in Georgia, looking for local jobs in Atlanta, and I haven't seen any jobs related to FP posted on job sites yet, is learning a functional language worth my time?  


I'll probably make several more posts asking questions in the weeks to come, I really appreciate any advice y'all can give me.

8kyk2y,2,2018-05-21,SNHU CS degree vs. IT degree for employment,pointe_throwaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8kyk2y/snhu_cs_degree_vs_it_degree_for_employment/,"Hello all,

I'm in an unfortunate situation - I'm a senior at the University of Central Florida, four courses shy of finishing my CS degree. Unlike most (maybe all?) other Computer Science programs, UCF's requires its students to pass a [Foundation Exam](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/files/foundation_exam/FAQ-2017.pdf).

I did not, and this leaves me unable to finish a degree in Computer Science at UCF.

Obviously, I'm really bummed out about this, but I have to keep moving and weigh my options. This brings us to my question: in employers' eyes, how much more valuable is a CS degree than an IT degree? I ask because my choices are now essentially 1) stay at UCF and reclassify as an IT major or 2) transfer to another, potentially less reputable university and keep my CS designation.

I say ""less reputable"" because the school I'm considering transferring to is Southern New Hampshire University. The degree is offered online, and the coursework would probably be considered a joke to most software engineers/CS students (very little in the way of mathematics, data structures/algorithms, etc. included in the curriculum). However, SNHU is an accredited, not-for-profit school and the degree would be in Computer Science.

I should mention that the rigor of SNHU's program doesn't bother me; I've taken all the core CS courses at my current university and have completed an internship, so it's really just about which piece of paper will look better on a resume.

TL;DR: Should I get a (somewhat ""fluffy"") CS degree online, or stay with my current university and get an IT degree?"

Graduated a year ago in phys, bad choice. I drank the kool-aid about how employable the degree was but the truth is I just wanted something hard. Fast forward 5 years (4 in school, 1 wasted jacking off now) applying to every job under the sun and getting rejected again and again and again and again and again. 


Finance, software dev, analytics, business Intel, statistician, a million generalist positions. The dance is the same:

* Phone screen: ""tell me about yourself."" Reply with the shit that's obvious on my resume. No experience, I'm good at math. Not a social retard.

* Assessments: insultingly easy, wasting everyone's time. Basic iq tests, sometimes math tests. All online, never hard and anyone with my background should kill em.

* In person: always seems to go great. (Of course, as you'll surmise if not already, I'm too positive about this, but this is my fucking vent.) I answer awkward questions and brain teasers and do my best to be honest, show interest, play myself up, ask about the position, avoid the various interview don'ts.


Then: ""we regret to inform you that we will not be moving forward with your candidacy.""


Then I sit and take it in. And I think ""who the fuck are you?"" Put me on r/iamverysmart, idc but fuck if I can't do whatever the hell the fucker interviewing me is doing. I know more than my degree, but the interviews never go there. I dicked around in my classes freshman year, I'll freely admit it, then demolished when I learned to take it seriously. My peers were scrubs. But *they're* employed and I'm *not*. Anyone who knows me for real would tell you I can work my ass off, that I'm committed, that everyone better than me has a target on their back so to speak...but that doesn't get to come through in interviews. I can't pretend to have experience, I just *know* I'll be an asset, but that's useless. I get that they can't just take my word for it, but what the hell am supposed to do then to prove I'll rise to any occasion? I am asking for an entry level job here what else do you want from me outside my coursework and internship experience??


I'm not the only one who's been in this spot before. So my interviews can't be going as well as I feel they are. But I try to improve every time. Same result. I've read all the advice. No better returns. I feel hopeless. It's been a year. And soon I'll be shut down just for being unable to find full time work. It's only a matter of time. Then I'll be stuck forever I guess.



Let's talk about the second word in the title of this post. My job hunt is fruitless. I've sent my resume in so many directions, you've probably seen it without realizing. This has now come to disrupt my social life. My friends have real work. We're on different schedules. I'm losing my ways of relating to them. I can't bring myself to date when I'm such a loser that I live with Mom and Dad with no long term plans and funnel all my money into my debts and my dog with none left over for any fun. Soon there will be no friends left and no way to make more. I'm embarrassed admitting to people what's up in my life. I work teaching math to kids. That's becoming my whole social sphere. Wtf. They ask me what the use of it is, I tell them the real world has dick loads of math. What kind of example am I then? If I know so much why is it so useless for me? I spend my weeks engaging with children, they aren't fucking friends. They're students. I hate this.


This post has been triggered by the millionth rejection from a job I know I could do. Evidently I can't do any. My job prospects and my friendships are evaporating by the day and I just can't help but feel it's only a matter of time before all my doors close. I wanna blame everything else but I'm too realistic to do that anymore. It can only be me who is unable to maintain my friends and prove my value to employers. It's been a year and my life is markedly worse than it was when I was in school. So at a certain point we're gonna have to call this whole 24 years to this point a failed attempt at life, doomed to work without intellectual stimulus and fake friendships if that. I hate all of this, why can't I even get a job out of pity? How bad could I be? Can't life just save me one time and give me a shot to prove I'm worth it? I'm sick of this shit. You can assume whatever you want about me, but I don't know what else I can do to sell myself. Wish me luck while a submit a billion more fruitless job applications and stumble through conversations telling former friends how little I'm up to. 


Wow. I'm a fucking whiner too.

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit:** I want to stress something to those reading this. Me calling myself a failure according to my barometers for personal success does not imply anyone else is a failure just because I may have something you lack. You may have dropped out or never gone to school, you may be terrible at math and a host of other subjects, and you may not feel like you fit the popular notions of smartness. My measure of success is only about how I see it for myself in my situation. Another person in the same spot as me with a different mindset could have a totally different feeling about it. I don't think I'd call anyone here a failure if I knew them, I'm not that much of an ass.

8kz2mc,3,2018-05-21,Need advice on negotiating equity/pay in my transition from intern/part time to full time in a startup company.,Squiekee,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8kz2mc/need_advice_on_negotiating_equitypay_in_my/,"So, just as a minor background of who I am, what I do, and what I will be doing.

Who I am: 

I am a graduating senior from Cal Poly Pomona who will be earning a Bachelors of Science in the Business Administration with an emphasis in Computer Information Systems (CIS). I also have involvement in organizations at the school (primarily as a Treasurer for a CIS club on campus with 100+ paid active members, in which I helped grow since it was 40 or so strong). I have also done outside training in the industry I'll be working in, which is Cyber Security.

What I do:

As of last summer, I took an internship which basically resulted in a part time job at a start up company in the Orange County (California) area. The part of the company I work for primarily focuses on E-Commerce as a one stop shop for offensive and defensive cyber security equipment. We develop our own products, resell other company's products based on contracts we have with them, and provide extensive documentation on what we sell. Our customers currently and primarily range from your average Joe security specialist to government agencies. My role in the company thus far has been similar to a business analyst, junior project manager, and assistant operations manager (again, emphasis on startup company).

Since I've been hired I brought in an alumni that is doing technical research/documentation, solidified a pipeline between the club I was in and the company I now work for (in place for future plans we have to expand our audience), and have developed numerous processes/systems that has expanded the companies revenue by at least 20% since I've joined.

What I will be doing:

My role in the company once I'm full time will be to assume the role my boss is currently doing. By this, I mean that he wants me to run the company's operations and implement his CEO envisionary plans. He has a lot of side projects he wants to do and basically wants someone to take his place. I assume a title for this position would be something along the lines of an Operations Manager (kind of hard to say since we are such a small company). He has struggled with bringing in talent and expanding his audience. That is also where I come in, since we have made plans to expand towards a young/entry level professional and college based audience. I will be a vital role in shaping strategy to accommodate that audience and bringing in strong talent as a future alumni.

Background of the company:

The company is about 5 years old and has been seeing continuous growth, but also been limited in how much it grows because it has pretty much only been a 1 man company until I came in. Outside of short term internships and contracted employees, I was his first real employee. At the current time, it is 2 employees under him, in which I am planning to stay long term while the other is using this in place of not being able to find a job elsewhere. From what I know, the company is valued at a little over a million dollars, if that means anything in this conversation.

My pay right now has been $15/hr and I believe he can afford to pay me around $18-19/hr once I'm full time. He has talked about offering equity in the company as compensation for what he can't pay me right now. 

How should I go about negotiating this, and what do you believe is fair as far as stock options, bonus, or other options go? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Let me know if I'm missing anything here."

I'm just here to vent a bit about my life. It probably ain't the shittiest life, but hear me out, I'm really down and suicide looks like a solution.   

Anyway, let's start of with a quote. ""I've made more mistakes than any man, woman, and child on this planet."", Professor Ozpin, RWBY.   

That's my general theme of my rant. That I've made mistakes, mistakes that I regret, mistakes that I can't fix. These mistakes haunt me for so long. Why was I like this? Why did I do that? Why can't I forgive myself even if I repent?   

Long story starts here:   
While I've felt like I was depressed for 7 years, usually through moodswings nowadays, I've felt my depression worsen during my college days. For now, I'll talk about my recent depression swings. It was during this very year, 2018. New year, new me, as they all say. Personally, I'm sure that not a lot of people do that, but I wanted to change that, at least for myself. For the past years of college, I wasn't the most diligent of students. I'm not rule breaker, but I'm not doing my best, and was generally a bad student. It was a weird up and down life, sometimes I'm doing great, other times its horrid. I honestly think I'm the worst student out there. Like, how can someone fail like 5 times in a single subject? (spoiler alert: me) But this new year, I was going to change that. I wanted to change it, I needed to change it. I wanted to graduate.   

Alright, gucci, I've enrolled in internship, I need internship for about 400 hours. That's pretty long. But anyway, I've got an internship course and I'm ready to go. Except when I was at an assembly, it said that I needed another subject with this, or else I would auto fail this internship. Oh shit, we'll I hope I can get that subject. Although it was still enrollment, and the assembly has just finished, I had rushed down to my registrar to see if I can get that subject. But I can't, so that got me down. That got me really down. I sat on a school bench looking like a corpse.   

I don't want to tell my parents about this. I still want to find a job, or at least do something in my downtime. I thought, maybe I'll do some self study. Game design can be done with self study after all. And I have a motivation at that time. I wanted to make a short visual novel for a crush. I'll leave no details because it might make others hurt, but she liked it. It was a great challenge for me.   

All the while I was doing that gift, I was thinking to myself what to do with this downtime. I can get a job, but will it count for my internship? I kept asking myself that question until I had to give the gift. Fortunately, I did get a job, unfortunately it isn't game design. I had time to kill and I was desperate. I took the offer, and early on I was alright, but later on, I wasn't.   

During the early time, I had talked to my adviser, who apparently just allowed me to do this internship, which is pretty sweet, on the condition that the thing I must be doing is game design, which isn't what I was mostly doing. And, I've made a mistake that my internship was instead 600 hours instead of 400. Geez man, how many mistake have I made?   

On the middle parts, I've been growing more depressed by the day, sometimes getting more depressed on certain days. I've not been attending the internship on time, but I'm still eager to work, even if I don't gain any game design skill whatsoever.   

Alright, fast forward to just weeks back, it's the next term. Oh boy, I'm not done with my intership, no sir. I'm tired, and depressed, and now I have classes. I even have Saturday classes. That shortens my rest time to 1 day. Although I wasn't happy that I was taking classes in succession with my intership, I'm at least glad that I get to see some friends in class.   

More fastforwarding, but this is the last. I'm feeling down, tired, exhausted by the 1 day rest per week. I'm such a weakling for getting not enough rest for 1 day. I feel down, defeated, and I want to restart it all.   

All these mistakes I've made, I want to rectify them. But I can't, time and life won't let me so easily. I will fight for this but so far I'm losing the fight, but I do win some rounds though.   

To me, suicide is what I call ""a reset"". All of us here do not know what awaits when we die. My hypothesis is that when it happens, life resets, you get a new life, most likely you'll forget your old life, but it's a new life nontheless. It sounds very enticing. A restart in life, who wouldn't want that? You can fix all the mistakes here and work harder for the better. It's basically new game+.   

I am also aware that there are many ups and downs of when I die. I mean, if I die, how would I meme? I want to make people laugh, and make people smile, such irony from a person who's depressed. How would I play games with my friends? How would I talk to my family?   

Let's start with the good news: Okay so there's one less asshole in the world. Ooof, that already sounds convincing. There's one less mouth to feed, I won't have to annoy people, I won't make mistakes anymore. Alright, what's the bad news?   

Frankly, I don't know. I'm pretty sure my family will be sad of me, or maybe they won't. It's really hard to say, I don't have a close bond with my family. I'll also add the fact that I'm illegitimate, so even if my mom and dad are on good terms, my connections are still very far. Will my friends feel sad? Most likely, I play R6 Siege with them almost everyday, I think they'll mind losing a partner, but it won't be for long term. Neither will my thesis mates probably. In a discord server, if I'd just disappear for a long time, they'll just wonder, but they won't know that I have just died. I expect no one will come to my wake, I expect no one will know who I truly am.   

I am a man that made several mistakes, it may even be countless, but I want to fix the mistakes I've made, but I'm already considering the ""reset"".   

And now that ends my rant. That's pretty long, I'd say. You got an opinion, wanna join the discussion, call me out on the bad things, give me advice, just go comment, I'll read it. Anything is good as of now.   
Oh, lowkey, can you also link down any sites or phones willing to lend an ear? If you are, I'mma leave a small preference that I live in the Philippines. Mental health culture here is pretty bad, but if you happen to have some sites or phones, let me know.   

Thank you for lending your ear... eye... you get the idea, and sorry for having such a long post."

What next after Engineering?,[deleted],Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/8l0ani/need_help_with_career_what_next_after_engineering/,"I've completed my engineering from a tier-2 college from Telangana.

I have little interest in coding. I like to do it if it is fun. I don't think I will be able to survive on that, even though I think I'm good at it. Further career options include

1. MS - Not inclined to go abroad. Wouldn't want to leave country, love family.
2. M.Tech - Not interested, can pursue in hopes of decent packages.
3. MBA - Highly interested for the pay.

Please advice on what should I do, according to you. I know I should follow my heart, but it just wants money and chill. Hard Work optional (lol jk). Please also feel free to ask anything you would want to gain further insight.

8l16gc,474,2018-05-21,Templates will save you from yourself,johnvandyke2,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8l16gc/templates_will_save_you_from_yourself/,"One of the critical aspects of a successful business is time management and one critical element of time management is reducing your administrative burden.  

No matter what kind of business you have you will inevitably run into a certain amount of administrative work to keep it afloat.  Typical administrative burdens include the following:

1.  Quote proposals for new prospective clients
2.  Processing Sales Orders for completed deals
3.  Drafting Delivery Notes (In the case of a physical product) with Packing Slips for boxes
4.  Drafting Sales Invoices with payable terms, and enforcing those terms by following up with overdue clients
5.  Payment Entry to check off client payment.
6.  Offering tracking information or status updates to clients after they have ordered and before they have received their product/service.


The list could go on, it could also include prospecting for new leads, handling social media inquiries, fielding customer service inquiries, and so on.

Because you're just one person, and you might not have an administrative assistant going into this game, guess who is responsible for handling all that?

If you want to stay competitive with people who **DO** have an admin assistant, and an intern named Blake that brings them coffee to boot, you're going to need to find ways to reduce this burden on you so you can focus on what's important, building your client book and fulfilling their demand for your product/service.

Enter templating.

You probably have run into the word before or know it well already, but how often do you use them?  

There's plenty of software out there, but the one my virtual assistants and I use is Gorgias templates.  It's a Chrome extension, you can enter in a large amount of text (with formatting) and then when you type a keyword into Chrome and hit tab, it replaces it like a giant word replacement on your phone.

But the question is, what to template?  

There is a notion in business that nothing ever happens just once.  Which is why I would assert you should template everything.

Now you might be thinking, ""sure, sounds great, but who has the time to template everything they write?""  

To which I would respond, who has the time *not* to template everything they write? 

Once you've written the e-mail, it's there, just waiting to be templated.  Take a look at your sent folder.  Billions and billions of e-mails that, with a copy-paste and an editting out of specific information in 5 seconds, you can turn into a template.  Look at all that time you wasted sending e-mails that weren't templates!  The horror!  You could have been taking Ukulele lessons with all that time.

It's easy to go overboard.  I templated my text message that I send to my pot dealer.  I don't know if he's noticed yet.  You don't need to go that crazy about it, though.

But there's a second advantage to templating all of your business e-mails, and that's a key thing that you really want to prepare yourself for:  

Extracting yourself from your business.

For the first two years of my company it was literally like a baby that became a screaming toddler.  I never left it alone, never took a break, and never trusted a single other person to do anything that I was doing.  After all, it was my baby, and I knew best.

I was dumb, that's a way to work yourself to an early grave.  If you like working 16 hour days, falling asleep crying, and waking up for more of the same, feel free to follow my example.

If you got incapacitated in the middle of your one-person show, would it just collapse?  What value would the company have?  If it relies entirely on you, it has no value independent from you.

Templating your business functions removes the business from you in a very important way.  As you template it, you also systematize it.  As you systematize it, so can you delegate it.

Alright, so onto a practical exercise:

1.  Normal Mode - Start templating e-mails you've sent to people in the past, especially the ones you're sending all the time.  You know the ones.  Download Gorgias or whatever one suits your boat and template away.  You can now delegate simple tasks to someone like a virtual assistant, or do them quickly yourself.

2.  Advanced Mode - Now, start to look at your templates and see how they interact and connect.  Draw flow charts for how templates should follow one another.   Make entire business processes lightning fast/efficient this way.  You can now start to delegate entire business processes out to others.

3.  Super Advanced Mode - Build in metrics into these flow charts, and you can start to tweak the templates to be perfect.  Building lead generation templates?  Sure would be great if it was optimized for response rate.  Building sales templates?  Sure would be great if they were optimized for converting leads into clients.  Now that you've got a system, you can diagnose that system and make it better, faster, stronger...  To do this, you can do something called AB Testing -- suppose you prospect 50 people per day by reaching out on their contact forms.  You can send 25 of them one template, and 25 of the same template but altered slightly, and do it for one week.  After a week, you've sent 175 e-mails of Template A, and 175 e-mails of Template B, all at the same timing interval so excluding that as a control variable, and then you gauge it -- which template received more responses?  You can discard the less effective one, keep the more effective one, and start anew by tweaking it again in another way.  By doing this, even if the system is not great at first, all it will take is time to refine it.  If you approach it like a scientist studying the results of his/her experiments, you will not fall victim to your own internal prejudices about what you think a good e-mail is.  You'll have the cold, hard facts to prove it.  

Hope this was helpful and as interesting as a post about a dry but useful subject can be!  

Have a great week everybody, or as we say in template,  have a great week (FIRST NAME)

8l1755,1,2018-05-21,Second thoughts about project - what to do next?,throwaway_5344,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8l1755/second_thoughts_about_project_what_to_do_next/,"Looking for guidance, thoughts, important questions based on my situation below.  

Took a new high profile role last November with a major company to launch a new suite of products in a high growth market.  This company is huge but the market we're expanding in to is fairly niche.  The project is still on path, but in ""yellow"" status (meaning value may be lower than expected).  My current manager is great and supportive, but I am starting to realize specific strategic errors with the general approach of the internal staff support strategy.

Some concerns I have going forward:

* They're changing my manager in a month, these products will roll up under his profit center.  i like the new manager a lot too, but he's been brought in to fix a department with a lot of expense, process, and customer service issues.

* General admin expenses are, and continue to run very high, for the profit center that these products will roll in to.  I am concerned that we won't be able to hire new people to support these products sufficiently and have problems supporting the business moving forward

* originally, from the beginning, i thought we would have our partner firm do **All** of the legal/compliance work.  Instead, this had been switched by my hire date to reduce consulting fees (and get project approval).  The consulting team would support our team, which I thought consisted of four people, but then is just one person with zero direct experience in this line of business, plus myself working over time to make ends meet. this has put severe strain in hitting our projected milestones as the regulatory/compliance part needs to occur first, and strain on me as i am taking all of the initiative to get stuff done.

* the selection process on the partner firm, which was selected prior to the project, missed a lot of the key financial/compliance/strategy details because it was one person who only had marketing experience, which caused a lot of delays due to our attorneys and finance teams needing to hash things out with their firm

* I am staring to notice the entire internal part of the organization is in crisis mode trying to handle the existing block of business, while also being over budget


If the launch is successful (coming over the next 6-12 months) I had originally thought I might be the profit center owner for the products, however that is no longer the case.  ON the other hand, that may have been unrealistic to believe.  In any case though, I think I will still be the second in command over the products as the products grow, but I don't even know that for sure.   (bringing in an expected $10M per year by year 3).  Also the pay is good and i work from home, so that's nice.  

either way, i don't think i can leave now (need to see how it goes), as if it fails I can use this as a learning opportunity.  I am thinking it is too early to look at exit opportunities now, but I should have a backup plan in case a wave of budget cuts slams my block of business and messes up the whole release.  New senior leadership has been brought on in the past six months too. 

Also, I am working probably 70 hours a week right now to tie everything together and get everything tied together, from which I am feeling burnout symptoms, so I should probably plan a nice extended weekend.  However, my wife started a new internship that has her working Saturdays so I can't bring her with me and feel guilty about doing so.

What should I do, be concerned about?  Just ride it out and see how things continue to go?  what can i do to make this situation better?  "

Sort of a throw away account  
Also a rant/advice question 

I‚Äôm in school, about to turn 20. I‚Äôve been with this company (not too big &lt; 2k people) for almost a year, started off as an intern, doing grunt work. Then got invited to work part time, doing a bit more work in O365, and a bit of incident management. My title now is ‚ÄúCyber security intern‚Äù however I don‚Äôt really feel as if I deserve that title.  I do assist with administration of our AV, deploy it, make sure computers are compliant, with security and software in SCCM. Handle email filtering, and I‚Äôll be setting up our syslog servers. I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm supposed to be level 3 support with a focus in security. We are a full windows shop. We also  have a MSP that does a lot of the technical work. 

I‚Äôve received an offer for a Fortune 10 company. The pay is around 5$/hour more. But it would be in their SOC. I‚Äôd be a ‚ÄúCyber security intern‚Äù as well. But I feel like I‚Äôd learn so much more with them. They asked me Linux questions so I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs what they primarily work in. 

I‚Äôd take the fortune 10 company in a heart beat. But it‚Äôs 50 miles from my house. And I live in Georgia so traffic always sucks. A 100 mile round trip just sounds like hell to me. I‚Äôve asked and apparently they don‚Äôt offer intern housing. 

My current company is 30 miles from home. So I‚Äôm used to driving an hour or so. To get to work/home, but if I take the other job it would be a hour and a half+ more than likely. 

I don‚Äôt know what to really do, I‚Äôve been stressing about this all weekend and I guess this is my last place for advice.

I'm a recent college grad in IT. 
I've applied at hundreds of places it feels like since November, and graduated in December, and I still hear nothing back.
I feel like I need to make a massive change.
I was in school for a long time. My Loans are at their limit.
My Ex left me with a good chunk of credit card debt.
I'm not seeing a way out that leaves me alive with it, if I cant break into industry somehow.
So I've been telling my close friends that, as of July 1st, I would kill myself. I thought it would help spur me on to do something but.. nothing is happening, still. No matter how hard I try, I can never get onto any sort of real interview. Most of my projects were colloborative, and I dont really have much I can point to as my own.

I live with two of my friends. One of them told me that if I would have said he'd be owning a house in three years, he would have told me I was crazy. 

I have an amazing partner. She's absolutely wonderful, and has stuck with me through all of my issue over the last year. I really dont deserve her, and that she loves me through all of this makes me cry from happiness. 

I have three cats at home. They're pretty much my whole life. I wish I could take care of them better, but I'm doing everything I can for them.

My credit is ruined. I cant get a job in my field.
I have a decent job though, but it's just the same data entry junk you'd see anywhere.

Everyone always says they need IT, but for some reason I'm not needed. I just think more and more there's something wrong with me.

Everyone tells me it'll get better, but.. that's not a guarantee. That doesnt always happen in life.
Life has winners, and losers, and.. I just always feel I've been the latter of the two.

I just feel like I'm taking up space that someone else could do something better with. That I've always just been worthless.

When I was actually working in IT for my internship, I was confident after the first two months. I had confidence, I knew what I was doing, and I was having fun.

Now, I just feel broken and worthless.
And I feel like the longer it takes for me to get a job in IT, the more my chances of actually doing it are slipping away.

I've been using Indeed, and ZipRecruiter to look for jobs, along with applying at various websites.

I just want to be successful. Or die trying, I guess.

Thank you for reading."

In college, I was an athlete during my first two years, and wasn‚Äôt actively thinking about life after college at the time.  

Towards the end of my second year, I got hurt, and decided that it was the right time leave college athletics and start thinking about what I wanted to do with my life. 

To save money, I ended up transferring to a school close to where my family lives so I could commute and got a part time job at a grocery
store to make some money.

I was still luckily able to transfer into my new school as a junior, but the problem was I had never previously declared a major because atheltics were consuming so much of my
time in college.  

Coming in as a junior, I had to declare a major and ended up choosing accounting based off what I heard about accounting careers (good job stability, solid money) with zero knowledge of accounting, Public Accounting/CPA exams, and the actual work.

By the time I was able to wrap my head around what accounting actually was, and doing an Accounts Payable internship (which gave me
stress and anxiety), I was two measley semesters away from graduating, so I decided to tough it out.  

What‚Äôs funny was, I was enjoying my job at the grocery store much more.  I enjoyed being on my feet and the customer interaction but didn‚Äôt really see it as a viable career option at the time.

After graduating, I had no interest in pursing becoming a CPA, but wanted to give accounting another try and was fortunate to land a position doing some audting work, which I enjoyed more than my internship, but didn‚Äôt see myself doing it for a career.  

After a year, I left to work in grocery retail where I am now and on the cusp of being a manager.
I would say that I am absolutely more happy and do enjoy going to work most of the days, but the work life balance, career projections, and inherent problems with working in retail are giving me doubts that this is a viable career option even though I do enjoy it more than accounting.  In fact, I really haven‚Äôt thought about accounting at all since I left.

Anyway, the BIG reason I have started this thread is because I am relocating out of state for personal reasons and won‚Äôt be able to stay with my current employer.  I feel like whatever job I end up in next is going to dictate what direction my career goes in and I want to make sure I‚Äôm making the right decision.  

Should I stay im grocery retail and try and climb the management ladder, leveraging my accounting degree along the way, or look for more of a 9-5 that is likely going to be less fulfilling but will have better work life balance and career trajectory?

Thanks!"

8l3yon,1,2018-05-21,CS degree/career advice,peterbquant,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/8l3yon/cs_degreecareer_advice/,"Well hello dear reader! thank you for stopping by. I will try to keep this post short and simple, but it probably won't be that short... so I'll try to keep it entertaining \(while still factually accurate\). If you have time for a long post/rant, check the FULL version. If not, abridged version towards the end of this post with the meaningful facts and the final question/reason for this post.

**FULL VERSION \-\&gt;**

**Past Facts**: I already have a degree; I went to school directly out of high school; Even if my parents didn't actively put any pressure on me \(I took a year off before starting college\) I always felt that implicit pressure of ""this is what is expected of you"". To add to this dangerous cocktail, I didn't know what the hell I wanted to study, really like no clue.

* At the time, I went to at least 4 career advisors, made multiple personality and skills test \(which are almost always non revealing at all, since they tend to be very straight forward about why they ask certain thinks, make in it very easy for your conscious mind to ""cheat"" yourself into any answer you want it to return\). 
* Also, but not unrelated, as anyone that is remotely well performing in school I was bullied in a daily basis, had a really bad time there. It wasn't even that I enjoyed studying, I really didn't put that much effort into it, it was just easy for me. I studied for tests the day before and was consistently number one on my class. All these factors, plus the ""usual"" social awkwardness introverts usually showcase \(I just spend my days in class drawing and my nights at home at my computer\), made my days in HS not so 'happy'. I was depressed every day, asked multiple times to my parents from age 10 to 17 to be taken out of school and just be home schooled or at least let me advance faster \(neither of those requests where granted\). 
* All this made me into a very fearful teenager, ended up with severe social anxiety and panic attacks, which landed me into a psychiatrist \(luckily he was a top notch professional, helped me out of it without drugs and kept me functional. 

With all this stated, when I was offered a scholarship for an engineering degree, I declined it. I just didn't want MORE pressure on top \(I had to pay for the degree myself, and if I ever had my average below 7/9 I would have to pay in full price\).

As my parents still expected me to study something, and my father wanted me to be an Architect, I just enrolled in it. Went through the motions, got a degree.

Of course, when I went out into the ""real world"" I got CREAMED. Couldn't land a decent job; I got part time, non paid internships or sporadic clients \(I did manage though to make to total reforms for house flippers and a 2000 sq meter reform for a school\) which I couldn't make a living out of. Got tired of it all, took the little money I had saved an got myself into survival mode for almost 2 years. In that time, got together with a couple of friends, started a band, recorded two albums and finally run out of money.

When I got back in the horse, I just couldn't take myself back to architectural misery, so I decided to go back to something I could sell. Back in the high school days, when internet was just starting out \(yeah, I am a bit older than what you would expect right??\) I was the only guy who knew how to make a web page. Of course, the web was different back then; almost all static, table based templates, horrible layouts... but still, I knew markup, I knew css, I even had some flash \(RIP\) knowledge; I had advanced from making templates in txt files to frontpage \(remember that cr#p?\) and dreamweaver. So it wasn't too much of a stretch for me to just apply for a job as a markup/prototyping guy in a crappy agency.

Got a job, worked on that, got the rust out. Got a bit better. Changed jobs again, took a JS developer job, continued doing web development gigs.. all this time, my only ""marketing sell point"" was: look, I know design, I understand usability, I can code, Let's go! That backed up with a portfolio of stuff builded and a lot of botched interviews took me this far \(almost 2,5 years going now\).

SHORT VERSION \-\&gt;

**Present facts:** Now I came to a point on my life where I have decided I want to move outside my current country. I am a EU citizen but I am living outside the EU. Since I feel that even with all the courses and certifications I have done some employers will be more open to offer me a job \(specially in a foreign country were things can get harder\) I am seriously considering going back to college to get a CS related degree. Even with my 2.5 years of experience \(real experience I can back it up with references\) I do feel that sometimes I am not taken that seriously because of my lack of formal training.  As stated before, I do have a bachelor degree, but in architecture and not CS related. Locally I can get an analyst programmer degree that takes about 3 years in a college that obviously no one knows about outside my home country. It would cost me about 1.5k USD a year \(so yeah, cheap\)... OOOOR alternatively I could try to get a CS degree INSIDE the EU. That would cost me about 3K USD a year \(a little bit more expensive, but still payable and probably worth it\). The thing is... what would you do? Study for at least 2 more years in your local hometown for the 'not so good but better than nothing' degree or just wing it, go back to the EU and try to get a job WHILE you are studying.I guess since I would be working in the EU, studying there would maybe contribute a bit more towards an EU company employing me than a degree from an unknown uni, but I am not sure how much of a difference would this make.**Age**: 31, **Degree**: Bachelor in Architecture, **Hometown**: under the Equator line, **Citizenship**: EU, **Planning to move to**: Netherlands \(or maybe Switzerland if I can land a job there, but mainly Netherlands, since I can stay there as long as I need to as an EU citizen\), **Savings**: Around 20k USD.

8l46dz,1,2018-05-21,How can I improve my interviewing skills or know my mistakes while I'm receiving zero feedback after rejection?,Vnslover,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8l46dz/how_can_i_improve_my_interviewing_skills_or_know/,"I graduated 2 weeks ago with a computer engineering degree, I've had an internship last summer with a good company in software development 

I'm not gonna say I've been applying excessively, but I've had a few job interviews before my graduation and after,  and so far I have never made it to the final interview stage. Of course I'm not here to complain or say that's unfair, but it would've been great if I had at least received some feedback after the interview. I know for a fact that I get nervous during interviews (can't help it, always been like that). But in all of my interviews, I felt like I did a good job, I have answered all the technical questions and spoke very thoroughly about my projects and work experience. 

I really would like to know what I'm doing wrong so I can improve myself but like I said I have not received any feedback and I just get those generic rejection emails. And since most of my interviews had been through recruiters, I had no contact information for my interviewers so I could ask them for feedback. 

How do you guys deal with this and how can you identify what you did wrong during interviews?"

Hi friends,

I have been asked to speak at a career fair despite not *really* being in my career yet. They are short on people.  I have worked one Internship and taught programming to kiddos and tutored CS students. I also will start work next month as a software engineer. I plan to talk about my Internship mostly but wanted some advice from the professionals in this sub. How can I make the kiddos excited to learn more about technology?

Here are some talking points I've been asked to cover in the 15 minutes allotted to me. I have ~5 minutes for questions. 

1.	What do you do in your job?
2.	What is a typical day like during your workday?
3.	What hours do you work?
4.	What school subjects are important for your job?
5.	How and when did you decide to enter your career choice?
6.	Did you have a career plan that you followed?
7.	What do you like best about your job? Why?
8.	What do you like least about your job? Why?
9.	What can I do to get ready for a job like yours?

I can talk a lot about the preparation (education, interview studying, networking) but am not so sure about the other questions. Any insight on making these kids want to learn to program would be awesome!

Thank you. "

I'm a senior at the moment with a few semesters left. I'm currently looking for employment but don't want to consider retail/restaurant work at this point because I'd desperately like to start filling my resume with actual IT related work in order to assist my transition into the real-world after graduation. I have a entry-level understanding of networks, router/server management, subnetting, the TCP/IP model and layers, SQL, Python.

My school schedule for the last few semesters is going to be pretty inconvenient for myself and potential employers, and the classes are only offered by generally 1-2 professors so there's little option for what I have to work with.
  
Where should I be applying? Help desk positions? Positions clearly out of my reach like 'Jr Network Administrator'? Internships? 

Are there any IT positions that would be somewhat relevant to my end-goal while still offering some flexibility, perhaps allowing me to work odd shifts throughout the week and then all-day Sat/Sun?
  
Any advice is appreciated.

I have no plans and I still have to draft a good resume and make a linkedin and I just feel so down on myself about job prospects. In terms of academic merit, I have a pretty good standing and could probably get into a good grad school but I feel like organizations are not looking for a good student, they're looking for  good worker.
I went to a state school in a mid-sized city in Upstate NY. It's known as being the best school in the SUNY system. I was a double major in English and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality studies with a minor in Global Studies. I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a 3.93 GPA, and am a member of Phi Beta Kappa honor society. I feel like my extracurriculars are not great. I have not been part of many clubs; I had an internship at my cities Human Rights Commission, was a TA for two courses, and won a research grant to conduct studies on human rights related causes. I also was a research assistant to a professor on an academic trip to Morocco. I worked retail last summer.  I know that may sound substantial in list form, but it's really not much to show for 4 years. 

I have severe ADD, anxiety, and depression so trying to keep those in check to keep my grades afloat meant I was not very active in other ways. I should have been involved more on campus, and had more internships. 

Now, I just graduated and I feel anxious and depressed about my future. I feel like there is no way anyone at home (NYC) will want me when the applicant pool is so large. I also do not want to live at home, as my parents are overbearing and not particularly happy about my sexuality.

My ideas: There is no doubt that living at home, I will be open to way more opportunities and possibilities (If I can get a job.) However, I really love my college town. I have been trying to determine whether this comes from a nostalgia about graduating, but I think it is genuine. I like how it has some elements of a city, while maintaining a strong community feel. I like the greenness, and the surrounding areas, and the local community. I have a life here way beyond that of a typical student, in terms of community engagement beyond daily student-centered things. I feel like staying here is exponentially better for my mental health than commuting from my suburb outside NYC to the city every day. I don't want to settle and stay here permanently, but I think it would be a good place to spend the next year as I get my shit together before grad school.

My goals for the next year are to get my drivers license, study and take the GRE, work, and sort out my terrible study habits and anxiety related to schoolwork before grad school. I took a thesis course this semester and wrote a history thesis despite never having taken a history course before. I was one of the only students to get an A in the course, and my professor reached out to say that my work was really special and should I put some work into it, it could get published. The thesis is on a local lesbian separatist group, and all the archives I used to construct it are physical and located at the WGSS department of my university. My question is; if I stayed here next year to work on this thesis and get it published before applying to grad school, along with working serving jobs to maintain myself monetarily, is that an ok way to spend my gap year? I also don't know what higher ed degree I want to go for; options are an MPA, MSW, or even a PhD. This plan seems ideal because it would mean I can live on my own in a place I love, but if it is stupid I don't want to shoot myself in the foot future wise. What do you guys think of this plan?

I had previously held a help desk internship last summer and figured I'd apply for more entry level jobs and internships regarding that, as well as diving into other entry level technology positions. I had a phone interview earlier regarding an IT support position that's part time (16-20/week) and seemed to align with my experience.

During the interview process they had asked me how much I expected salary wise as well as asking if I was interviewing with other companies and had any offers - is that normal? I generally didn't feel comfortable discussing that information right away so I had said I'd rather discuss pay later and she kept pressing me about the offers until I told her I potentially have an immediate one.

She also said that the interview process includes a phone interview, video interview, math test and a practical applications assessment where they would give me a PC and fix common errors that occur in their office. I had asked with all of these steps, how long would it typically take and I was told it would be 3 weeks or could be shorter depending on how long I take.

Is this how IT positions go? This is seems a bit too intensive and if I do get the job I likely won't start till near July anyway, it seems. I have to set up a video interview with the IT manager but I didn't enjoy the phone call I had today, so I'm thinking about pulling back. I don't mind putting in the effort but the company nor job interest me terribly."

I'm in the DevOps field because it was my first offer and decided to try it out. I have been performing very well and everyone is very happy with my work.

I'm bored of the work and want to try software development. If I switch companies before May 2019, I lose my company's retirement contribution portion which is currently sitting at $5,000 and will be between $8,000 and $12,000 by May 2019.

My problem is I don't know if I should forfeit the money in order to ""save"" my career. My development skills are lacking heavily because over the years I've focused more on scripting, DevOps tools, etc. rather than actual software development. I don't have experience working on API's, I barely touch on enterprise OOP languages (e.g. Java) in my day-to-day line of work, and I don't really have great experience with things such as writing solid tests, software development patterns, etc.

Since I'm still early in my career, I may be able to jump into a software development role in a junior position and ramp up quickly. I'm wondering if it's best to make this move as soon as possible, even if that means forfeiting my company retirement contribution. Or.. I could stay for another year, get my money and then jump ship. 

I could switch teams within the company but I'm pretty sure that involves taking a pay cut.

My worst fear is a company will not accept me in a software development role because I've been doing DevOps for too long and lack working on a software development team. And if they do make me offer, I'd have to take a pay cut and start again as a junior.

I accepted to do an unpaid internship with a small company so I could learn a few IT skills prior to college graduation. The internship was done online and I was working with an engineer who would tell me to research and learn IT stuff. I would then notify and tell him what I learned. I did this only for a few hours each week. 

Anyway, almost 3 months happened and then I asked the engineer what the process to quit the internship was because I just graduated and saw no point in staying with them anymore. He said that whenever I wanted to quit, I had to just notify to him and the CEO. I said ""ok, I will end this internship in 4-5 days,"" then he said ""ok, thank you for everything, etc."" The CEO also said ""thank you for everything, etc."" 

Now the problem is that the CEO wants me to stay with them one more week and teach what I learned to someone else in the company before I leave because I didn't notify her with enough time prior to quitting (even though they had about 3 months to talk to me about this...). In addition she wants me to answer email questions after quitting. I don't know what types of questions but I honestly I am tired of working for this company. 

If I accept, I would need to stay with the company more time (which I personally don't want), then teach a person that I don't even know everything I have learned with the company (which would require an extensive amount of time to do). If I refuse, I am afraid that they will give negative feedback about me if companies that I am applying for give them a call. What would you guys recommend me to do?"

The position I'm in doesn't require me to use any of my skills at all. It's pretty much learning about a product and knowing how to process it through the company's systems. It's more a support role if anything. This is NOT what I want to do with my life by any means. 

I took the job because I had a rough upcoming and was nervous about my future. To sum it up, I have always lived in extreme poverty and was facing a huge burden of stress at the realization of having to pay back my loans. When this offer came along, it was dressed up as more of a network engineer role. I realized through the internship that it was actually a solutions/sales engineer position. I couldn't turn it down though because of the salary I was offered. 

I am trying to manage my worsening mental issues. I have depression/anxiety and along with this, I have low self-esteem of being able to perform in a routine work environment if I were hired as a developer. With this in mind and the fact that I was stressed from my financial situation, I decided to just push it through until I managed to feel more financially secure. 

How do I get back to the thing I love most in life? I feel no confidence from other posts I read. Most people say that if you go down the path I did in the beginning, it'll be much harder to re-enter the tech world. I've only been here for a few months, but it feels like ages. I feel like I have shot my reputation to shit and I have no previous work experience in the tech world. 

The only thing I have going for me are my side projects that I try to work on. I am very passionate about computer science and can't imagine a future without it.

Because my main interests lie in GIS and data science, and want to tailor my main skillset around these areas, I thought I would ask the question here. Does anyone know whether Microsoft will continue to integrate VBA within its products, or are they phasing it out, too? Beyond what is required for my internship, should I focus on becoming more adept in the language?

Edit: To clarify, I already know R, as well as some SQL and Python and thus don't need VBA to act as a jumping-off point for my coding ability. I just want to know how useful VBA will be in my future, so that I may prioritize what I learn outside of work."
8l9x11,1,2018-05-22,Help choosing biology-based PhD project on DTP programme?,tommeetucker,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/8l9x11/help_choosing_biologybased_phd_project_on_dtp/,"(copy/pasted from /r/labrats, sorry!) 

So, as above, I'm looking for a bit of advice. I'm currently in my first year of a four year DTP. The DTP is organised into 1 rotation year (two 4-month rotations in different labs), after which you choose one PhD project (3 years). I'm coming towards the end of my 2nd rotation, and am in the really nice, but slightly annoying, position of really liking both of my rotations. 

For a bit of background, my interests are in cancer/cell/molecular biology, and I'm keen to move into biopharma/biotech after my PhD (not interested in further academia - aware that this might change, but that's my goal for now).

The two rotations are as follows:

**1) Using mass spec analysis of a protein pathway (DNA damage response pathway) to find and characterise novel protein-protein interactors.** 

This one is mostly biochemical, which I feel more comfortable with, but also has access to mass spec work which I think could be useful for working in industry. I get on really well with the primary supervisor, but she is a relatively new PI (worked as a post-doc in a very successful lab for 9 years, before transitioning to PI in a different university a couple of years back) and is yet to publish (she has loads of data, so publication is very likely). She has had one PhD student in another country when she was a post-doc. This PhD student was successful, but the system is different in his country (Czech Republic), so I'm slightly hesitant. I'm also aware that things may change rapidly with a new PI, so how things are currently might not be accurate a couple of years down the line. The lab, being a new one, is small - there's just the PI and post-doc currently. I have a good relationship with the post-doc, but he seems fairly inexperienced, as post-docs go. Other people in the shared lab space are supportive, and I got on well with them. However, she has good links with industry and her previous lab, which is a big draw for me currently. I have to do a 3 month internship in an area outside academia, and I talked about this with her. She has contacts in Astrazeneca and a smaller biopharma, which are quite appealing as potential entry points to industry. The secondary supervisor is the mass spec specialist, successful PI etc, but I didn't see him too much during my rotation.

The university itself is slightly less well-regarded than the university of the 2nd rotation, but the project is at a small institute which has a good reputation, albeit with less funding. I quite like the feeling of a smaller, tighter community. Socially speaking, I liked this rotation, but I think I felt more comfortable in my second lab. Speaking of which...

**2) Using super-resolution/advanced microscopy techniques to investigate force-dependent tumour cytoskeletal dynamics.**

My second rotation is more involved with cell biology with a heavy emphasis on biophysics (basically loads of microscopy, which is really cool but I feel slightly more challenged by, particularly the physics side), as well as use of programming (challenging but should be fine). I'm unsure as to how desirable these techniques will be in industry. The primary and secondary supervisors are a physicist and a cell biologist, respectively. They are both very successful in their fields, both publish often in high impact journals, and the biologist in particular is very highly regarded within the department as a PhD supervisor. Also, they're both relatively young (probably late 30s/40s), so are still hungry, which I like. That being said, they're both very busy, so have a more hands-off approach. This isn't a bad thing, I quite liked the freedom and there's plenty of high-quality support in the labs in the form of post-docs (one post-doc is pursuing a project that was quite close to mine [surprise surprise!], but she's potentially leaving after Christmas) and other PhD students. I've been mainly based in the secondary's lab, and there's 5 or 6 other PhD students. This gives a really nice social setting, and I feel more comfortable socially in this lab. However, I do feel like there's a slight risk of me being 'forgotten' somewhat.

I've got a meeting this week with the two supervisors and the potentially-leaving post-doc, where I'm going to ask about future directions of the project, potential, but also whether the post-doc might extend her contract, and what kind of industry contacts they have. I think I'll be honest with them and say how I'm feeling conflicted between the two projects, so need convincing. Any tips on what else to ask about would be handy!

As I said before, the uni is really well funded, highly regarded, good support network, so I've got no problems there.

That's about it. So I guess what I really want to know is (or the TL;DR):

1) Should I take a chance with a young, but relatively unproven PI, because of industry contacts? Or should I stick with busier, but well-regarded supervisors? I'm trying to not think about it personally and be selfish, but am finding it a bit difficult, as I honestly want the supervisor from the first rotation to succeed.

2) Will the skill sets I gain from rotation 1 better position me for biotech/pharma work in industry than those skills I gain from rotation 2?

Many thanks for reading, please let me know if you need more information!"

But the problem is the Atmel Ice programmer is so expensive!  I've been buying Arduino Chinese clones for 2 bucks!  I don't know if my heart can take losing $130 for a simple AVR/SAM programmer.  

No wonder Arduino is popular; its affordable. 

I'm in college, so I'm kinda all over the place with Majors.  I've made really neat libraries with Arduino, but no one gives a shit to bother using them. I realized I wasted too much time in Arduino, and its time to move on.  I know Arduino will only look good for hobbies, but it looks terrible if that's all you have on a resume; jobs want Atmel Studio 7.  But Embedded takes years of experience.  But if you have internships and you've made money; then praise God, you'll definitely get a job.  Thankfully, there are some companies around me who want me to make apps for them.  So I could make apps and make some profit.

 So, I'm not sure Embedded systems is where I want to go, maybe its App development because its easier to sell software than making the software and hardware\(in terms of entrepreneurship\). \*\*This is why so many kids want to major in computer science\*\*

So, which path should I take? App development, Embedded, or make Arduino projects/libraries?  TBH, this is like answering the meaning of life. :D

I'm 25 years old. I graduated in 2016 with a CS degree. I've been working for city level government this whole time, moving departments and working my way up.


I've gone from $15/hour as an intern (2 years), to $27/hour as a full-time employee (1 year), and now $42/hour after my recent promotion/transfer (1 week so far).


A lot of people would love government jobs, but I hate it. I've always embraced engineering culture, and have wanted to be a game developer my whole life, or work for tech companies like Microsoft, Apple, etc. But I found my way to government to support my family (single mom/brother), so I barely see any of my paycheck.

But it's depressing being here, working with lazy people who don't care, clocking in hours just to be here, driving an hour to work each day (I want to live near my friends).

* I just finished up my sophomore year at one of the US' senior military colleges (20 years old). 
* I am majoring in Supply Chain / Logistics and am working towards a minor in Management Information Systems.
* My biggest strength has been good academics - my cumulative GPA is a 3.89 on a 4.0 scale.
* My only work experience up until now has been in property management (helped manage parents' rental properties), and house construction / restoration.

I know that it is essential for me to get a job this summer that at least somewhat relates to my major (Thinking of applying to car manufacturers and warehouses)... But I have honestly never worked for anyone outside of family.

The reason I am making this post is because I am incredibly worried about the interview process / the actual process of getting and keeping a job. **From the research I have done, I see that in today's job market, employers often value things such as ""good fit"" and social skills over things such as qualifications or work ethic. This worries me a great deal because**

 * I am honestly a very dull and boring person to be around (my only interests outside of work are lifting weights, and video games).
 * I become hyper focused when I start working on anything, my classmates at school say I am too robotic in my work ethic (Not joking here, people find it weird when I just sit down and do homework / study for hours on end).
 * I do not have issues talking to people, but I suck at things like small talk / making jokes - I would say I am pretty socially awkward. 
 * I am just not the type of guy that goes out with the boys after work for beers or to go golfing. I suck at networking, and have trouble making friends.

How badly will the above personality traits impact my job hunt / career down the road? Do employers really not hire / actually fire people just for not ""*fitting in*"" with the work environment even though they are perfectly qualified for the job? Would it be bad to state these qualities as my main weakness when interviewing for work, or should I not mention it and pretend to be someone else than who I really am? 

Sorry for the long essay guys, I really appreciate any advice y'all can give me! I really want to have all of this down by the time I will be applying for real internships next year.

The reason I'm asking is because I know I can a part time job a lot easier than a freshman engineering internship, and I don't know whether the internship will help my resume more than personal projects. I'm also aware that it's pretty late to look for internships, and I'm keeping that on my mind.

Also on a side note, my brother is also a freshman, but is a CS Major. He's been able to just learn more about coding and then gain experience because, well, it's coding.

So I'm planning to buy a new watch in the next couple months as a reward for completing an internship in NYC (assuming I get a FT return offer, knock on wood). I've identified a store that has decent prices, and I like to do business in one of my home states and support the local economy (Note: the store claims that only TN residents have to pay sales tax, not that transactions physically happening within TN have to include it; if this is wrong there's a simpler get-around that I see [having the LLC buy it and then having it shipped to MT, meaning that it doesn't directly enter my proximity until it is out of state] but I prefer to do these sorts of transactions in person). That said, I'm not interested in paying an extra $1k to the state government if I don't absolutely have to.

(Edit: to clarify, Montana has no sales/use tax on tangible goods)

I currently have a Montana LLC that was created to hold some assets in common among a few members of our family, but due to some deaths in the past few years I am the now the sole owner of this entity. This LLC currently only has vehicles within it, but I have personally held Montana real estate holdings that should mean I'm allowed to use it for ownership of assets without running afoul of the traditional problems of using a Montana LLC for tax avoidance.

For the record, while I'm a TN resident and this would use a Montana LLC, I'm currently a student in IL and planning to move to NY on a temporary basis if I get an FT offer, so the watch would barely be present in TN after acquisition--which I believe has been the standard for car taxation using MT LLCs.

Here's my questions:

1) Can I as LLC proprietor/owner transfer cash into the LLC and have it buy the watch instead of me and therefore avoid the sales tax in TN?

2) If so, can I as proprietor directly represent the LLC in the transaction, or would I need to use a third party as representation in the acquisition? I'm concerned that it wouldn't pass a sniff test but I'm not certain of the leeway given to LLC proprietors/owners in such matters.

Thanks!"

I have a friend that quit grad school and is looking to update their CV. Long story short: a terrible relationship developed between my friend and their advisor, and they decided to leave rather than continue to be in the toxic relationship. I may be biased (I am biased), but I support their decision as I've seen too many grad students kind of wither away trying to power through a bad situation.

Anyways, my friend is now updating their CV in hopes of trying to get more experience in their field (let's say general STEM) and get more experience with internships and short-term jobs before re-applying for grad school, with some lessons learned.

I offered to help them with their CV, but realized I don't quite know how to suggest handling the departure from a grad program.  They took many applicable classes and gained many skills, and I don't want to advise hiding the ordeal but also don't want to advise advertising the ""failed graduate"" status.

Do you all have any advice on how to professionally and honestly portray this in a CV? If they make it through to an interview I'm sure they can professionally and honestly explain the situation, but I'm trying to help them get through that initial trash bin phase of applicants for a variety of positions.

Last time I was in NYC, and I just started in an office upstate today. The thing is, half of our team is in NYC and I want to transfer there. 

Here are my reasons:

1. I have to live with my parents in this area and it makes me depressed, my parents are overbearing and I completely lack freedom 

2. My boyfriend and best friends are also in the city, who are my support network
3. I have nothing against the team here and the space, it's all fine. I just really do not want to be in this location at all, I feel suffocated. 

4. The city has networking events I want to go to, to network outside of IBM and broaden my scopes for the future.

5. There is much more to do there. much. much. more. I had plans to help my boyfriend's startup, to work on side projects, to see new places and experience new things this summer...

6. I found out that I will mainly be working with another intern at the same location, and that he is actually from NYC and is having a hard time looking for housing in this area. 

7. I also found out that our projects aren't even set yet, so basically we could adjust to projects they have there.

 I feel like these are all reasons that make it perfect to go to the NYC office. The only thing holding me back is that the Co-op is ""assigned"" to this location.

Thank you PFC for helping me learn so much about personal finance, it's been so important in this journey.

As much as I tried budgeting over the few years of getting into this debt spiral, I'm still having issues because of non-consistent income levels. I'm a university student (going in my last year) and some months I'm making a good amount and some others, not so much.

My main goal was to pay this off first before anything else because of the impact it makes on your credit. Now that that's out of the way, I still have a long way to go.

I still have about 5k to pay off. I've come to realize that it is very difficult because I need to focus on school. I do freelance work and have a 15-30 hr/week job during school. Right now I'm just waiting back for an internship opportunity for the summer, which will help a lot.

BUT I don't want to deal with this debt spiral for a year. It's my last year at university and I don't want to stress too much about my debt. I tried applying for a student LoC at TD but got rejected because my income wasn't high enough to pay the interest (which doesn't make sense to me since my income is ~12k and interest payments on 10k are ~$20-30 per month).

I'm in a much better financial situation now, so I can control my spending. My issue is I can't seem to keep up, I pay an amount here but a small portion stays back and just accumulates.

So PFC, what are my options? Are there companies that do private lending or some sort? I don't have access to a co-signer (parents are religious and are against interest), so I'd have to do this on my own. Budgeting with 5k in debt seems like a lost cause when you're barely making ~$1.5k per month. All I want is to worry about this when I graduate and get a full-time job where the income is consistent and I know how my budget will actually look like.

If there isn't any other way, I'll stick to what I've been doing all these years I guess. Just wanted to show my appreciation to this subreddit and see if I could solve this debt spiral issue of mine :)"

I really really don't want to mess it up and potentially permanently lose the opportunity to work there. Please please tell me what I should be doing. I really want to impress and get this position.


Long story short:

-I have a friend I've been friends with for years.

-They got me ahold of someone who worked at a company I am interested in working at.

-That someone got me ahold of the recruiter for that company.

-Now they (the recruiter) want to do a ""15 minute call"" with me. (I am not sure what that will entail exactly and am nervous about messing it up!)




**My concern: How should I prepare or approach this?**

quote: 
""a brief 15 minute call? I‚Äôd like to tell you a bit more about &lt;COMPANY&gt;, as well as get a better understanding of your skills, goals and interests.""

How should I prepare for this? Clearly this is extremely important that I make a very solid first impression.


-I have limited exposure to mobile development from years ago. But I am certain I could pick it up. 

-I did 1.5 years internship working on an FDA regulated medical device where I contributed to significant portions of the code that went directly into production for very critical projects for the company.

It was primarily web development using java/spring/hibernate.

-**I had to go back to school for 8 months after so my skills have become a bit more dull, and this is scaring the heck out of me.** I'm absolutely feeling that impostor syndrome right now and to be frank: in a technical interview I am pretty sure I'd be roadkill if they go into the depths of spring/hibernate.

I have picked up a boatload of Udemy courses I am studying through now, but I am worried that in a technical interview I might get ravaged. I am confident I can do the job, I've done it in the past, but I am worried I will fuck up the extremely critical first impression.



So does anyone have any tips/suggestions for me on how to approach this?

What should I do to prepare?

Should I revamp my resume yet again?

Should I be frantically studying all of my bought Udemy courses and potentially pull an all nighter (or something close to one)?

Should I be practicing basic algorithms like djikstra's and stuff?

I appreciate any feedback you guys can give me on this thing. I'm nervous and excited.

I got an email today from Amazon for an internship in their Seattle HQ inviting me to take a two-part online assessment that involves a debugging and logic/problem solving multiple choice section and also a coding and work style simulation section that may lead to a 45 minute online interview with a developer.

I just finished my second year of Software Engineering and will have my AS in CS after this summer semester. I'm excited for the opportunity but nervous because the job description says they are looking for Seniors and Masters and I literally just became a Junior after this last Spring. On top of that, I don't come from a CS background and only had real experience with coding from two junior high school classes before starting college. I'm super passionate about coding and can literally spend all day in an IDE learning and trying new things. I know I can get the 4 year degree fairly easily as long as I just focus and put hard work in, which is surprising to really think about for me because I feel like I'm kind of seen as someone who's just in it for some reason that isn't genuine but I know I love doing this stuff and don't even want to do anything else as a career even a little bit.

Anyways, I'm just hoping to hear from you guys what you think I should do to stand out from other candidates who are probably going to be Seniors and even Masters. I have all of my projects from school saved and I've been reviewing them all day, mostly the C++ projects because that's what I'm going to use in my assessment. I can study data structures and algorithms, syntax, all that stuff for the actual assessment on my own and I have about 6 days to take it. I just want to actually stand out and seem confident like I know what I'm talking about, enough to be a solid candidate. I've worked with peers in school who have development jobs and they talk about how school doesn't teach you real world software development knowledge. I imagine they're mainly referring to the communication and teamwork aspect but I'm not sure. I'm also going to check out Interview Cake and see if that helps.

This would be a super cool chance for me to get some real experience with a great company. What do you guys think I should do to prepare?

My new job is base pay of minimum wage. I was on my fourth day of training today.

So recently I finished all my exams and my internship and wanted to celebrate a little (in my own way) but for one reason or another it just didn't come together in the weekend. So it's Tuesday, we had lunch together and after a nap I kindly asked my mother to lend me her car because I wanted to get up a twisty road, breathe fresh air, take a couple pictures, smoke a cigarette and come back down. She agreed. I looked it up on the GPS, 1 hour round trip more or less, a road I'm familiar with.

So I go out, windows down, put the cruise control on the highway, reach the twisty road, start climbing, reached the spot, parked up, grabbed my phone and my cigarettes, so far so good. It's a 2 minute walk and next thing you see is a beautiful valley with the sea at the bottom and a bunch of telecom towers on the top, with a gorgeous green scenery and nature all around you. I sat down, smoked a bit, enjoyed the view, then lied on my back and just gazed at the sky and though ""finally man, I feel so relaxed... this is amazing"". I took a selfie and sent it to my sister, had a laugh and went back to the car and though ""I'll just cruise down calmly, fill it up a bit so she'll be happy and I'll thank her for this"".

Now I must say she has a big, comfy car, a jaguar her husband gifted to her not that long ago.

I start riding down and I reach a very tight section where two cars barely fit between each other. A guy in a small van is taking this corner, slightly running up on my lane, as I'm taking the corner myself. I panic react, flick the steering to avoid him, then flick the steering back again to take the turn and it looked okay for a bit but ultimately I ran out of space and couldn't take the corner so I smacked the front right part of the bumper. I stop, that person is nowhere to be found, the bumper is smashed, my dashboard is lit up with warnings, so I drove it down to a straight section, called my mom, she's completely flustered, called the evac, they didn't take long, they load up the car and I also get a taxi home.

The steering is broken. One of the front wheels faces straight and the other one is turned to one side completely. It wasn't a strong hit or anything, my airbags didn't go off at all, I'm completely fine myself. The selfie I took is the best picture I ever took of myself because I really look ugly in pictures for some reason and I though too ""I finally have a picture of myself where I look good and I'm happy"". I'm not worried for the car, she has a good insurance, but I'm really scared about her and her husband. She's not picking up my calls (she told me yesterday she'll ""decide what to do with me"" today because she didn't want to take any decisions while in her emotional state, fair enough) and the insurance company apparently can't reach her either. I don't want to bother my stepfather right now because his work is very demanding and he's probably flustered as well.

This happened right after serious family issues started cooling off a bit, my stepfather's business also got rid of a number of issues that ended up costing them money and I don't want to go into too much detail into this but if my relationship with my mother wasn't delicate enough, now I think it's going to be nearly impossible to fix, at least in the coming months. One lesson I did learn (amongst many yesterday) is no matter what you do or think, this happens without warning. I now have a much greater respect for the value and sanctity of human life.

TL;DR Grabbed my mother's car for a ride to celebrate my grades and my finished internship, enjoyed fresh air for a bit before nearly crashing into someone and ultimately smacking her car and breaking the steering, getting into very serious personal trouble and unsure of what to do next."

Problem is, I know but the basics in programming and we need a team for that, but I‚Äôm not sure of the exactitude of my requirements.

Here‚Äôs the basic pitch, we‚Äôre making a 2D, Point &amp; Click puzzle game. The game is set to be playable on the website of the company. We‚Äôre going with a quite simplistic approach and aspect, having a deadline for an alpha in September. I‚Äôm thinking having full time specialized professionals will do the job, we only need to recruit \(located in the French Riviera  if you‚Äôre somehow interested\).

Here‚Äôs who I think we need :

* Engine : Unity : the game being  a simplistic concept in 2D, I‚Äôm thinking it should be enough but the programmer will really decide what‚Äôs best.
* 1 Programmer/integrator : proper video game programmer. My superiors tend to think a web programmer will do since it‚Äôs an internet game. But for me it‚Äôs obvious we need a real VG programmer.
* 1 graphic artist/designer : to draw all the assets, the artistic direction might change depending on the time it takes.

I‚Äôm in charge of the GD/SD/Writing and maybe Project management but we‚Äôre supposed to have someone for that. The LD will depend on the programmer.

Can you guys give me any sort of advice ? Are my requirements correct from what you‚Äôve understood of the project ? I specifically need info on the programmer, since it‚Äôs not my field of expertise I could use some help on this.

tl;dr : what‚Äôs the ideal team requirements for a 2D Point and click/puzzle game with a deadline for the alpha in September ? I‚Äôm thinking programmer more specifically.

So, I'm a recent graduate with a bachelors in Finance. Got my first internship at Morgan Stanley in Budapest as a financial analyst. It's my third month there now and so far, it isn't going as expectd. Most of my tasks are really boring accounting and back office tasks e.g. daily reports, reconciliations, product control and mainly the stuff that IT fail to automate.

While I was studying for my bachelor's, I got really hooked to programming and tech in general. I started coding for fun, building iot (internet of things) devices, automating everything I could just for the fun of it. Whenever I'm bored at work i'd write macros and try to find out how existing ones work just for fun. While not really caring what the reports themselves represent and how they can affect other financial figures.

So, I thought, since this is the kind of stuff I like about work, then I should apply to more finance-techy positions and so I did. I applied to multiple quantitative analyst and market modelling positions and they all rejected me very quickly mainly because of lack of formal education on maths and programming. Basically, the way they hire is that they'd much rather hire programmers and maths graduates and teach them general finance stuff than do the opposite. When I checked LinkedIn, for the people working at those positions, they were usually physics, maths and cs graduates. I also applied to a lot of fintech positions also with no luck.

My current contract is for 3 months. However, my manager offered me to extend my internship for 3 more months and I'm really hesitant whether I should accept it or not. Especially that I don't really learn much if anything and the pay isn't really that good either. 

Some people say that I should stay for atleast 3 more months as it would strengthen my resume and that it would open more interesting finance positions for me. Others say don't take a job that won't grow your professional skills and benefit your next employer (be it an actual employer or yourself). 

So it basically boils down to choosing between:

1) renew the contract

2) spend the next three months home developing the skills needed for more interesting jobs

I can do both, but work eats a lot of my time and energy making it really hard to do anything but opening a beer and watching neflix when I get home. What do you think I should do?"

I move in the week I start my internship, and the apartment is nothing like the pictures. It's run down and the smell of mold hits you like a brick wall. The management with the apartment complex says that the only thing I can do is to find someone to move in to finish my lease.

I feel very confident in my abilities to handle multiple classes in any given term but would appreciate any suggestions.

8lmkvw,16,2018-05-23,The Truth Behind Startup Life | Part #1,MorganFreakman,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/8lmkvw/the_truth_behind_startup_life_part_1/,"**TL;DR I wish more people documented the gritty truth of start-up life. So I decided to.**

There is one thing that I wish more start-ups did: I wish they had kept a regular step by step process document and logged their experiences throughout the company‚Äôs growth directly from its initial conception. There is so much we can learn from the successes and failures of other companies, and it would have been fascinating to read how other start-ups secured their first customers, dealt with uncertainties, and when they made their big break (if ever).

Therefore, I‚Äôve decided I would write a weekly journal about my experiences of running a start-up to date (currently in Beta, a strong number of clients, upward week on week growth) and then document my future thoughts/feelings of start-up life. I‚Äôm just a regular guy, running a small team, at a regular start-up (definitely not Richard Branson or Elon Musk), but I want to help people who are looking to take the plunge, or have already taken the plunge, into entrepreneurial life and remove the bullshit glamour that seems to precede people's need to found their own company.

To kick things off I will take you back to the very start of the decision to run a business and provide some tips (from experience) on how to nurture an idea, set the groundwork, push through early funding hurdles, and deal with the endless disappointments.

**Why did I decide to start a business?**

Simply put, the 9-5 lifestyle sucks. I wanted to be in control of a day to day that had unlimited upwards potential...and a load of risk.

Getting a ‚Äònormal‚Äô job just didn‚Äôt cut it for me. I had my heart set on becoming a lawyer at university and completed numerous internships and interviews before realising that life was way too short to work for someone else. I refused to work on things I didn‚Äôt particularly enjoy, for people I don‚Äôt particularly like, in order to buy things I don‚Äôt particularly need. It seemed like a boring and too predictable way to live the rest of my life.

So, following my graduation from university, I decided to take the path less travelled and co-found a business. I knew this route would give me the freedom to live my life without regret. Each day I now have the opportunity to wake up and work on what I love. There are no Monday morning blues and there is no ‚Äòworking for the weekend‚Äô mind-set because each day is a holiday when you are working on your passion. It all sounds cliche and isn't always this rosy, but at least I'm not slaving away for someone else and I believe in our mission and process.

If you are undecided about whether or not to start a business here are my top 3 things you should consider when making that decision. You need to really prepare, think, ask very tough questions about how many years you have set aside to make it work. Too many people think 6 months will cut it - when 3 years will offer a much more realistic runway:

**Passion**: if you aren‚Äôt happy or fulfilled at your current job then there is little reason to stay. Not even money. Everyone should work on their passions, and if you aren‚Äôt doing so today hand in your resignation.

**Opportunity**: if you see a market gap or a particular opportunity then it is worth investing some time and energy into solving it. This is key. **Find the market. Speak to people. Build on a clear problem.**

**Learning:** if you feel your current situation isn‚Äôt pushing you to be the best version of yourself and you aren‚Äôt learning, then there is no better way to remedy this than to start a business. Everyday brings new challenges and new obstacles to overcome. It is a steep learning curve but it is incredibly rewarding at the same time.

**Creating a business idea**

This is something that a lot of people struggle with, but ""creating an idea"" shouldn't necessarily be the goal. I‚Äôve just coined this (very loosely) to be the 3 Ps of starting a business:

The first thing I considered when creating my business was what I am truly **passionate** about. And, if you are uncertain what to do, this should be your starting point too. Forget about the money and think about what you would do if money were no object. For example, before starting Impulse, I regularly bought and sold football/soccer boots and sports memorabilia online at a 500% ROI to help pay for university. This ignited a passion in small businesses and online commerce ‚Äì I wanted to find a way to help businesses grow and help them gain exposure to new customers in a collaborative way. The small business world is tough, whether it's dealing with Facebook algorithms, early orders, growth hacking, retaining customers and users - I wanted to help level the playing field.¬†

When I knew what my passion was, I knuckled down and focused on what **problems** existed within that area. If you are interested in space, maybe the issue is with the cost of space travel. If you are interested in cycling, maybe bikes could be designed to be more aerodynamic. And so on. With Impulse it was clear there are a lot of independent companies and products from across the world that aren‚Äôt getting the exposure they deserve. In fact, most of these companies are creating products that are cooler and of a higher-quality than that produced by their multi-million dollar competitors. We knew I had to find a way to help them get their shit discovered. Cheaper, more efficient, and personal solutions to help them fulfil KPI's.

Finally, think about¬†**pay**. How exactly am I going to make money from the problem I am passionate about? Obviously some businesses are easier than others, but I really cannot think of much that cannot be monetised. Even if you have your heart set on travelling for the rest of your life, if that is what you really want it is possible to make money from that way of living. Ultimately cash is king and you want to ensure there are enough revenue streams to keep your future company profitable. With Impulse our initial priority was to help smaller businesses reach wider exposure and build a platform to let people interact with these stores and products. However, this route meant a lighter focus on cash flow and a greater focus on long term business development. Of course we do have potential revenue streams in place as we grow (and we're slowly curating and expanding these.) The point being, ensure you know the importance of cash to your start-up, how quickly you need it, and how long you're runway will be.

**Finally**

I want to help as many people as possible by learning from my own success and failures to date and the trials and triumphs I shall have in the future. We're 3 years into our Start-up lifecycle (with 18 months runway left) and have been through an un-holy number of ups and downs:

* Concept Design

* Market Traction

* Rejected $100,000 Seed Funding

* Business Loans

* Crowdfunding Failure

* Building the Platform (This was tough!)

* Preparing for Launch

* GrowthHacking Pains

Why did you decide to start a business? How did you come up with your business ideas? 

If you have any questions, let me know and I‚Äôd be happy to help."

Hello all. I don‚Äôt know if this is the place to ask so I‚Äôll try to keep it as short as possible. I am basically looking to switch jobs and wanted to make myself more desirable to new software companies than I was when I graduated. I had a rough time finding jobs out of college since I didn‚Äôt have internships and therefore wanted advice on how to describe what I do in terms that a regular software company hiring manager might be able to judge my abilities.

I recently graduated from a university in the southeast US with my Electrical Engineering degree. I learned a lot of programming and did a bunch of projects ranging from embedded systems to android apps. I finally found a job at my current company but wanted to move to an actual software engineering company with better pay.

I currently work at a service company (tutoring company) that uses Google Sheets to manage all its information and run day-to-day business. I had been hired as the web designer since they wanted someone in house with web experience (that they didn‚Äôt need to pay as much). But I quickly moved over to general IT (as I want to call it). Basically, I introduced the idea of using Google Sheets to maintain and manage data and, using Google App Scripting, make the process as automated as possible. We already have a POS System from Square. But since our company is a service company and we feel Square isn‚Äôt really geared towards service companies yet, I had to find workarounds for a bunch of daily and monthly functions.
My basic functions are:

* Created and maintained an active daily appointment sheet using Google App Scripting with Google Sheets that pulls data from our POS system and is a dashboard for our admin staff to perform daily duties such as charge customers for appointments, verify all appointment details, measure complete employee hours and mark special transactions for future keeping (such as unpaid tickets, prepaid customers, etc.).

* Made a system for logging daily student attendance with digital signatures. I built a custom front-end to let tutors see only their respective students every day while all the data is managed through Google Sheets.

* Created a messaging system between tutors and students (and their families) using Google‚Äôs Gmail Service. Basically, the back-end is managed by Gmail and again Google Sheets while the front-end was built to have tutors send session notes to students through an app.

* As the web developer, I also improved the website with structural updates that had to do with the fact they were using a theme in WordPress before. I also do daily updates such as putting in new hires on the website and setting up online booking for appointments.

Since our client base is quite large (around 1500 customers), after I joined, I have been able to reduce a lot of man hours through automation (I understand I might have to give exact numbers on my resume).

I apologize for the long post. Please let me know if there is a better place to ask this. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I want to go somewhere that might provide more structure and sophisticated tools and of course better pay. Thanks so much!"

However, I have yet to have an interview with another smaller startup company who are offering their interns $25/hr on next Tuesday, and I think that I have a pretty good chance of getting the job. The thing is, the big company states that they will only give me until tomorrow morning to accept their offer, and are kind of guilt tripping me with stuff like there are other people who really want this job and it wouldn't be fair to them to make them wait, they're disappointed that I'm not more excited or whatever. I'm not really sure what to do at this point.

From what I hear, $18/hr is a little on the low end, but I'm not sure if I should negotiate for more money with the risk of being replaced. Also, if it were not for the lower pay, I would definitely choose them over the startup due to how they are part of a pretty well known tech company, and I do like company environment. In addition, I would like to mention that I do have previous intern experience at two other companies, if that matters at all.

There's just so little time to think about things and make a final decision, given the big company's pressure. Thanks in advance for any advice!

I started this program because my first attempt at school was atrocious, and I simply needed to get into a program that would get me a degree the quickest with the least amount of bullshit. (Started at my new community college with a 0.0 GPA lol)

I've been in this program for a year now, and will be entering my final year in this program.  I currently have raised my cumulative GPA from a 0.0 to a 2.97, and my institution GPA is a 3.6.

I've decided, based on recommendation of a few colleagues of mine, that it would be in my best interest to complete this A.A.S, and then make an attempt to transfer to a college where I could get a Bachelors in Comp Sci.  

I am aware that after completing my A.A.S, I will have to take additional gen ed classes to meet transfer requirements. 
_________________
Anyways: 

Today I scheduled an appointment to meet with a college advisor at my community college and discuss a plan to set me up to transfer.  

What a mistake that was

Not only was she clueless about any of the requirements (to arguably one of the most transferred to universities at our CC), she was quite rude too.

""Well you made the decision to skip out on a lot of gen eds in order to fast track your degree, so you knew what you were getting into"" is an exact quote she said. Yes. I'm fucking aware. Thats WHY I CAME TO YOU. FOR ADVICE. 

She also was quite insistent that I didn't have the GPA to transfer (minimum GPA to transfer is 2.0, I have a cumulative of 2.97). But I am not looking to transfer this year with my GPA as it stands anyways.  If I finish my A.A.S with an A/B average, which I have maintained every semester I've been at this community college and achieved deans list every semester as well, I will have at the minimum I believe based on my estimation, a 3.3 (minimum GPA to transfer is 2.0 to this particular school and has a 75% transfer acceptance rate). I will also have 1 internship under my belt but I don't think that plays a role in transferring

__________________________________________

So basically I didn't get any help and am just as lost as before.

So far I've emailed admissions at the university I want to transfer too asking for their input on the situation.

But my question for you all. Has anyone here completed an A.A.S and then went on to transfer to a university? What did you have to do in addition to you A.A.S?

**TL;DR:** Community college advisor sucks ass, contacted admissions at transfer university instead looking for advice on transferring after completing my A.A.S, looking for input from those who transferred to 4 years after completing their A.A.S

**UPDATE:** University admissions has returned my email, and gave me great information. In order to transfer I think I'm going to have to do a 3rd year of CC

What they want from me is

- ENG 2
- American Lit
- Fine Art Credit
- Psych 1 and 2
- American Hist
- History Credit
- Physics 1 and 2
- Calc 1 and 2
- Linear Algebra
- Comp Sci 1 and 2 (We take a similar course in my A.A.S, but it uses Java, where as this uses C++ and covers more theory)
- Assembly

So essentially, I'd need to take 15 more classes. 

Now, I'm comfortable with at most taking 5 classes a semester.

I think I could break this up into Fall/Spring semester 5 classes each, and then next summer take 2 summer classes, and the summer before I transfer take 3 summer classes.

Sound like a good plan?"

I have lurked here for a bit trying to glean bits and pieces from seasoned professionals and am ready to finally hop into the fray and ask a question! 

I am a recent college graduate (less than a year ago) with a degree in computer and electrical engineering. I currently work as a design engineer. My job is VERY comfortable, almost too much so. Barely 40 hours a week, relaxed bosses, comfortably company culture, done before 5 every day type of workplace. 

However, I want something more. When it comes to my career I am very driven, and do not feel very challenged in my line of work. I am a people person first and foremost, but appreciate hard work and am very good at math. 

In my first year, I have passed both the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam, and the Professional Engineering Exam (which is usually taken after 4 years of employment). I have achieved more than is usually achieved in my field in one year, and to be perfectly frank I‚Äôm bored. 

I am jealous of those who have high pressure jobs where the stakes are real and the work load is high. I have always had an eye for finance but was always focused on electrical and computer engineering not because I loved it, but because I enjoyed the challenge and knowing I was succeeding in a challenging field. 


To my point, do any of you have any advice for a young engineer who would like to break into the Finance field (investment banking for example but not limited to that)? Do I need an MBA or is there prerequisite for engineers securing a position without one? I have impressive internship experience but none in finance. I see plenty of examples of engineers ending up in this field but I do not see a lot of documentation as to how they got there! Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated. I just would like to know how best to apply myself to make myself attractive to an employer in this field. 

Thank you all in advance! Thankful for reddit in situations like this! "
8lnkrl,5,2018-05-23,Incoming intern: Unfamiliar with entire tech stack,HelpAMans,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8lnkrl/incoming_intern_unfamiliar_with_entire_tech_stack/,"I've been fortunate enough to get a 10 week internship with a large telecom company for the summer and it starts in just over a week. I just got an email from my soon-to-be manager (the first communication between the two of us) explaining the project I'll be working on and the tech stack it uses.

Specifically, he mentioned that is will be 'Based on Angular 2 and above' and 'Microservices built using Java and Spring'. Unfortunately for me I'm entirely unfamiliar with all the technologies listed. In prior internships I've exclusively worked in C/C++. I'm not too worried about learning Java as it's pretty similar to C++ but everything else has me a bit nervous. I know some learning on the job is expected but for such a short internship (10 weeks) I can't afford to spend a month learning the tech stack. My manager indicated in the email that I should brush up on these technologies before starting in June.

Honestly just a bit overwhelmed right now. I'm not sure if they chose the right candidate for this position considering I have zero experience in prior internships and school with these technologies. Even my interview was conducted in C++. 

Related side question: I've been able to do some practice programs in Java from /r/DailyProgrammer built I'm just manually building and running them. Now I'm reading about things such as Maven and Gradle to do all the building for me (same principle as CMake I think?) but I'm having a really tough time with those. I'd assume something like this is a given to be used at a large tech company?

So any thoughts on all this? Just how much am I expected to know? I don't have a ton of free time in the next week in a half so I'm struggling to really put time into learning all these new things.

8lo9wg,0,2018-05-23,"Getting my MPH, concentrating in Healthcare Management, lost A.F.",Valuable_Persimmon,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/8lo9wg/getting_my_mph_concentrating_in_healthcare/,"I need serious help. I am in grad school at one of the best programs in the country for Healthcare Management and public health, but, I am realizing that it is a total nightmare. I am doing the ""accelerated"" track, so I am completing it in 16 months and just finished the first year. You are required to do a practicum \(internship\) but the school does not help or place you. I was going to go to George Washington for my Master's in Health Administration because I thought I wanted to be a supervisor in Long\-Term care \(I had worked as a CNA and in home health care\), but this program offered me a scholarship. My advisor knew this was my goal \(as I met with him in person beforehand and he convinced me of course, this is such a great program\). 

Long story short, the program has been totally restructured the past two years, and this past year they let in exponentially more students than in the past. There are inadequate resources, paid internships, classes etc. It is evident that this program costs an arm and a leg but the school is much more concerned with making more money than actually caring about its students or their success. 

It's becoming clear to myself and many other students that this program does not prepare you for actual jobs in Healthcare Management that you need a Master's for. You're not going to get out of this program and work as a clinic manager or hospital CEO, so most students say they're interested in consulting or are already committed to going on to another Master's degree.

Today, I just broke down because I realized I have wasted so much energy and money on this program, but feel ill\-prepared for anything in healthcare. I still don't have a practicum secured, and I can't stop beating myself up for coming here in the first place. I always wanted to be a nurse practitioner, and now specifically a Pscych. NP, but never really pursued it because my undergraduate degrees were not in the sciences and I struggled with the nursing prerequisite courses. So I convinced myself that even though I was so passionate about health and and helping people and actually love science, that I'm not smart enough or competent to go that route. So healthcare administration \(well, this program's healthcare ""management"" program\), seemed to make sense. 

Of course I know my own issues are at play here as well. I won't even deny that. It just sucks being so alone here in Boston, and being a 26\-year\-old and totally responsible for myself, it's so hard to relate to my classmates who are primarily 21\-year\-olds whose parents pay for everything and they want to go out binge\-drinking til 2 am.  I get along great with everyone, but I'm not comfortable in these situations. I did the binge drinking thing in undergrad. I'm too old and stressed out about what's next for me. Plus, the only way I'm ""dealing"" with the stress of strongly disliking the program and miserable cold of Boston is an eating disorder and excessive exercise. Obviously, a very separate issue. 

I guess I am trying to find the answers to a few things:

\(1\) How do I make the most of my summer and the rest of the program?

\(2\) What am I supposed to do if I can only find an unpaid internship? Boston is a very expensive city and I am already struggling working part\-time and being a Full\-time student.

\(3\) What should I focus on in terms of a ""career"" when I graduate in December? 

Do I pretend I am passionate about getting a job in biotechnology or pharmeuceticals when I don't know a damn thing about these things or, frankly even care? Do I find a way to trying and get into NP school, despite all the money and energy I've wasted on this program? 

\(4\) How do I find better people to be around? Or should I just accept being lonely and exhausted curling up on the couch with a bowl of vegetables and  Netflix? 

\(5\) What kind of skills should I focus on learning? For example, is there a way to teach myself SAS or some other useful knowledge? HELP"
8lpl6h,20,2018-05-23,Conflicted on what to do after graduating with my CS degree.,6lick-6lug-6lucker,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8lpl6h/conflicted_on_what_to_do_after_graduating_with_my/,"Hey everyone, I'm currently about to pursue my 4th year of 5 for my bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. 

I'm sure there are plenty of these out there so I honestly appreciate whatever advice you have.  

So currently I am doing a QA internship at a fortune 500 company.  We do automated tests so thankfully there is still some programming involved, even if it isn't anything too spectacular.  I feel comfortable in the position and it's one of the better internships I had.  However I'm not feeling invested in what I do, dislike the corporate culture, and tend to do a lot more than what I suppose is expected of me.

I really love programming and math, and as a result I tend to do very well in both subjects when I put a little work in for my classes.   I am really interested in the scientific application of computer science as well as game design, which I've always wanted to be involved with in some capacity. 

I think the big thing that makes me feel really down about what I'm doing right now is that I always like to be working on something.  My first internship had me working on a project I was really passionate about and I was spending all the time I had working on it.  This really impressed the owner of the company and helped me get paid really well.  I foolishly left because I thought I was going to pursue a different field entirely at one point in time. I dearly miss working on interesting projects for long hours of the day and really want to go back to that.  

Even today I realized that the interns in the development side of my company don't seem to care about committing to their work.  At a networking meet they told me how they do nothing and leave early and treated me like I was crazy when I said I enjoyed when I had to work on projects for weeks at a time and commit most of my time to it. 

I just want to go into a field in CS where I can do this and maybe have it paying off either financially or simply by seeing a project I'm actually invested in come to fruition. "

Winter: COMP 252(Algorithm), MATH 357(Stat), Algebra 4, Anal 4, Diff Geometry.

I previously hate programming (but was aware that skill would be required at some point) so I only managed to have the minimum amount of comp courses. However, I am doing an internship right now and the experience do changed my mindset and make me want to gain more practical skill in this field. I wish to take more comp courses in U3 (doing a minor) so I need to finish comp 206 beforehand since it is a pre-req to most upper year courses.

When handling the intern job, I have learnt python, html, linux, C++ etc. which are parts of the course material. 

Now I need to decide at which semester that I should take it. Both are heavily loaded. I am leaning toward fall term, since three of them are analysis (real, complex, vector analysis) which should overlap a lot. But comp 252 and comp 206 are both cscourses, I think it might be helpful to take them together.  I'm also curious about the difficulty of Analysis/Algebra 3 vs. Analysis 4/Algebra 4.

For your record I'm doing ok in previous math/comp courses(most passed with A but do struggle a lot ).

8lrhy5,11,2018-05-24,"Made a change in career path from retail/food service to Information Systems at age 27, stopped working to pursue school full-time. How would one tailor their resume after graduation?",LongDot,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8lrhy5/made_a_change_in_career_path_from_retailfood/,"Just had a few job-seeking questions as mentioned in the title.  
  
**Some background:**  
  
I attended college at age 18 with multiple unsuccessful attempts and ended up dropping out at age 22. I worked various retail and food service positions to pay my bills until age 27 when I decided to go back and finally put in 100% effort.  
  
At this point I was fortunate enough to find myself in a financial position to stop working and focus entirely on school full-time. From age 27 to 29 I managed to resurrect my wrecked cumulative GPA of &lt; 1.0 at my previous community colleges up to a 2.3 by starting over entirely and netting a 3.4 overall at my most recent college, graduating with an associates of arts transfer degree.  
  
Reaching a minimum 2.0 and earning an associate's degree finally qualified me for entry with junior status into a neighboring 4-year university majoring in information systems, where I obtained a 4.0 GPA and earned an award for academic performance this past semester. 
  
**(So for those of you who are in a similar position I was in, I'm living proof that it is entirely possible to make a full recovery from a past of poor decisions and achieve your academic goals if you work extremely hard and never stop pushing forward.)**  
  
That being said, I'm currently 29 and scheduled to graduate in December 2019 at the very earliest, which I'll be 31 by then. I fully plan on pursuing at least one internship by next summer, however I'm concerned about my unique situation given my age and employment history due to my academic endeavors.  
  
(My goal is to become a systems, business, or programming analyst after graduation. I'm also strongly considering software development, as many of my courses are heavily involved with programming, software engineering and the SDLC.)  
  
My current plan is to list only the qualifications relevant to the job I'm seeking, omitting the food service and retail work from age 18 to 27. I would list my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems, my internship, awards, and any other qualifications or related experience.  
  
In theory, I should be able to gain employment through an internship or by networking through my college to find an employer who would be willing to hire me, assuming I meet their satisfactions. This post is purely planning for the worst-case scenario in the event I do not find employment from those options.    
  
**My questions:**     

**1. Will someone over 30 years old be at a significant disadvantage with only an internship and/or related part-time work to account for the past 4 1/2 years while attending school?** I have been told that employers view unemployment gaps due to attending college as excusable, however this situation seems different from a typical 22-24 year old grad.          
  
**2. Assuming the worst, and I can't end up finding a related part-time job by the end of college, how badly would this damage my image to potential employers?** As you could probably guess why, I don't plan on returning back to retail or food service ever again unless I absolutely need to. That being said, there is absolutely no reason why I shouldn't be working right now at age 29. I want to work. I'd prefer to utilize my limited time by earning the most relevant experience possible. I have full faith that I can continue to maintain a 4.0 while working at least part-time. I'm also concerned that 4 1/2 years during school may be too large of a gap for someone my age, even with academic results to show for my time away from the workforce.           
  
**3. I've been told it can be beneficial to omit unrelated or irrelevant job history from a resume when changing career paths. Is this a good move for a 31-year-old candidate with no relevant job history before age 27?** I'd imagine an employer would potentially want to know my full employment history, in which I would discuss and explain the odd-jobs during the interview. My concern is I don't want to appear untrustworthy or as though I'm concealing anything, however I also feel that a pizza job from 6 years prior is not appropriate for a systems analyst resume.
    
  
Thank you for your time and advice in advance."

For my internship I work on a scoring subject. I have to score customers on their behaviour regarding emails (will they open the mail or not ?). Basically, my dependent variable is the event 'Mail is opened'

My data contains several variables that describe :

- The content of the mail 
- ...

As every each customer received an almost unique set of email, I thought I could maybe overcome this issue by directly building a model on a set of mails for each customer. I mean, I will gather for one customer every email he got and other characteristics related to him, and build a model on this set. This implies creating a model for each customer.

I found some drawbacks from this method :
- Customer must have received enough mails
- What if there is a new product ? There will be no training data regarding the new product

I wanted to have your opinions about this approach. I wonder if this could actually work. Can you please tell me what you think about it ? Any suggestion ?"

Help?,dontstalkmethrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8ltdoq/unsure_if_i_should_take_this_position_or_not_help/,"Hi! I'm just going to give some background so you understand my position a little bit better. I am currently a high school senior who will be graduating in June, who will be attending one of the best  universities for engineering (not ivey league/MIT, probably just outside, although some consider it on par with top ivey league schools for engineering/cs). I'd rather not specify which program, but it is an engineering program that has some level of CS-related stuff involved. The co-op program begins in first year for engineering students, and I have heard many stories of students having rough times getting placements in first year without side-projects/previous work experience in the tech industry. 

I have found a volunteer web dev position in a not-for-profit organisation which I believe is a good fit for me, and would provide me with invaluable experience. However, I am very new to the CS world. I have a bit of experience with front-end (gone through the HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery/Bootstrap parts on freecodecamp, and I've gone through ~70% of the codecademy python course. I would be doing front-end for the org, so I won't be using python, but I have been told that the volunteer web-dev does not necessarily need to be experienced, and that they are willing to take on a new aspiring web developer. However they have also said a couple things that scare me:

1) Although they are willing to take on a newbie, they said that if I were to take on the position I would need to produce and maintain all the code independently. Even though I would say I am a fast learner (and know how to google things), I am still afraid that I wouldn't be able to figure things out and learn quickly enough to do an effective job, as I have very little experience with web development.

2) They mentioned that I would be repsonsible for updates and whatnot from now until may-june of next year. Since I will be in university next year, I doubt I will have the time to complete everything since I will be quite busy (adjusting to new environment, making friends, homework, interviews for co-op that take place in first year, etc). They said it's approximately 4-8 hrs a week during heavier periods in time, but since I'm new this 4-8 hours is probably closer to 10-15 hours.

All of this said, I'm really desperate for this position as it'd give me some valuable experience and something to show to prospective employers when I apply for internships, but I'm worried about how I'll do for the reasons above. Thoughts? 

TL;dr Really desperate for a volunteer front end web-dev position as a high school senior with no web dev experience. Need to manage all the code myself, but am afraid I won't have the background knowledge to do it, as well as the time for it next year in uni, even though they said they're willing to take in a web developer without much experience.

Last summer, I was able to fill in the gaps of my knowledge between mentor meetings with my programming skills, as I was making a VBA tool that applied to my project.


However, this summer, my mentor (along with all other full-time engineers) are *incredibly* busy with meetings stacked almost every day. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to get ahold of him for longer than 5 minutes at a time. I‚Äôm missing data that he said he‚Äôd help me get, and I need his mentoring to be able to use the software I‚Äôll be using for my project (I already went through all of the basic tutorials).


What can I do in the meantime to be a better intern? Right now I‚Äôm just kind of stuck. Last summer I could keep myself busy because I was fairly knowledgeable about my project. This summer, I pretty much require the mentoring, and I‚Äôm not getting it yet. I‚Äôm 2 weeks in and I feel like my work output is trash. They‚Äôre paying me *incredibly* well, so I‚Äôd like to do better and maybe get some advice from a full-timer who has mentored before. Thanks!"

But my issue is my only mobile project I've worked on that I could show code for is a 2.5 year old github project I worked on before landing my internship.

I just finished my sophomore year at Central Michigan University. I started out there as a Mechanical Engineer but soon realized power and circuitry was super interesting and I switched to Electrical Engineering my sophomore, luckily all of my classes carried over so I was right on track to graduate in four years. But, I decided to sign a minor in Computer Science, which I started my sophomore year, and I am really interested in coding. With that being said, I do not want to code for my entire job. Which has caused me to start debating between switching to Computer Engineering or just staying in Electrical Engineering. 
I currently have an internship at Federal-Mogul Powertrain where I work with PLC's and safety relays to design safety systems and do miscellaneous maintenance work on the PLC's and circuits that run the machines. I have so far really enjoyed it, but I am looking to get a more design type internship with maybe products, my uncle works at Whirlpool so he thinks I have a good shot of getting into their program for next summer. But I was just curious if I should stay Electrical or switch to Computer? I have heard the most of the jobs in both fields can be filled by either major, but I wanted some actual Engineers opinions instead of going on the word of students and advisors who are not in the industry."

I managed to get an internship at a really good company (one of the top startups in India) did well as an intern and recently got a full time offer from the same company at a reasonably good package (The average pay for CS engineers in India for new grads hovers around 3,50,000 INR and I am being offered 7,00,000 INR). Now while this was going on I had also applied for [HackerBay University program](https://university.hackerbay.io/program/index.html).

In summary HackerBay University program is an unpaid remote internship that provides a project based curriculum where you learn and work on real world projects at the same time. If I perform well enough in this remote program it will also lead me to an offer that maybe even better than the one I am currently being offered (from 4,00,000 INR upto 12,00,000 INR) and the job I will be offered is completely remote as well. 

I am in quite a dilemma as to whether to join the startup I had previously interned with and settle for a modest offer or try for the possible offer from HackerBay who may offer me a better package and a completely remote job (which is something I would love). The university program starts on June 15th and my offer from the startup starts on June 18th. Can you please provide some suggestions as to what I can do?"

The four classes are intro to Java, Web Based Applications \(php/html\), Database \(sql\), and then a capstone class on information system analysis and design. 

1.\)Could anyone recommend what certifications I can earn that will make me look more appealing when I inevitably begin to apply for jobs? I've been on code academy and have been completing the intro courses for java, c\+\+, php, and python, but I do not feel these are enough.

2.\)I've been lucky enough to have two internships at a large tech company \(one working with server software tools and the other currently working in the global finance department\), do y'all think the internships will be good enough to help me find a job?

3.\) Lastly, I've been stuck when considering post grad education. Should I go straight to work, pay off student loans, and or pursue an MBA? Or should I take a chance at a masters in MIS and do something related to Data Science?

I am not entirely sure where my skills can take me as of now. Potentially a company like FAST Enterprises that does customer tax software that would tie my programming knowledge into my financial knowledge?

I know that I need to have some alone time to figure out what I should do, but I would appreciate some advice from someone outside of my bubble. Thanks beforehand for any help."

Just turned 24 and graduated from college 2 years ago with a management degree and a 3.9 GPA. I just worked for my dad for a year, then started applying for jobs. With only blue collar experience and no retail experience, I wasn‚Äôt really getting any calls back. I decided to work for this grocery store as an associate for 13 an hour and have been working there for six months in hope of moving up. However, the company hasn‚Äôt been moving people up and lacks care for their employees, so I have started to apply for other jobs. I love the city of Denver and have lots of family there, so I applied for a few jobs out there. By the way, I‚Äôm from Virginia. I received a call back from a roofing company with GREAT employee reviews. I did a phone interview for a sales rep position and it must have gone well because the woman on the phone sent me a personality test to fill out and the branch manager should be reaching out to me in a few days. It‚Äôs commission only, but the average sales rep makes 75,000 and after a year you can become a field supervisor making 150,000 on average. It seems like too good of an opportunity not to pursue, but wold be a big commitment and dramatic change to quit my job in VA and move to Denver in a few weeks, but I have family I can live with throughout the training. Over the years, I‚Äôve become way more extroverted and people enjoy being around me because I‚Äôm the ‚Äúfunny guy‚Äù, which can help me in sales. I love being funny and want to pursue Stand up (my dream) and it will be easier to pursue that in Denver as the comedy scene is growing there. My biggest fear is if i would be a good salesman. If I can be myself and let my sense of humor shine, I think I could do very well. However, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be relaxed enough to be myself. A couple years ago, I tried out an internship attempting to get donations against fracking by going door to door and absolutely sucked at it. Of course, with roofing, the product is actually tangible and something the customer can enjoy. The job would require me to go door to door and inspect roofs for damage and try and get customers to get a new roof, but it would be only through insurance and not out of their own pocket which is good. Also, you get winters off with this company, which will give me time to visit family and friends which is important because I will miss them immensely if I leave VA. It just seems like a great opportunity, but I don‚Äôt want to drive all the way to Denver for their one month training program just to fail and have to come back home. What should I do? "

I recently graduated college with no experience (only did one summer job) and I know it is really hard to find an entry-level position in the accounting major. I actually interviewed an internship with a company for the internal audit intern (which is something I am actually interested in) but has not received a response yet.

The idea of the self argument has been confusing but I'm getting close to understanding it I believe, it's just so much easier in java because java automatically does that part for you with ""this"".

I get that when you make a function you MUST have a self parameter as the first argument, and the target object of the function will be passed into that argument. My question is, when you use self for a constructor, I noticed that later you do not need to pass a self variable, even if there is no ""target"" for the constructor. for example, in making a linked list:

my class node is:

class node:

def \_\_init\_\_\(self, data = None\):

[self.data](https://self.data) = data

[self.next](https://self.next) = None

later on in the linked list class, in an append function I have:

def  append\(self,data\):

new\_node = node\(\)

for the new\_node, why don't I need a 'self' parameter?

Also, what does the data = None for the constructor in the node class do?

Sorry for the rookie questions, everyone keeps saying python is easy to learn but honestly it seems so much more confusing than java. That might just be because I'm far more comfortable with java though

I read somewhere people slap college degrees onto job requirements when the job really shouldn‚Äôt need a college degree. So getting a college degree is basically a prerequisite unless you want to work a trade or be an entrepreneur. It‚Äôs the new ‚ÄúI graduated from high school.‚Äù I know I couldn‚Äôt handle the risk of being an entrepreneur, and me working in the trades is basically asking the person with terrible aim and eyesight to hit the bullseye. So college it is.

Apparently a lot of jobs also won‚Äôt hire you if your major isn‚Äôt in the field you‚Äôre applying to work in. So what major do you pick? The one that‚Äôs from the field you intend to work in. I know you can switch your major, but some colleges say things like ‚Äúif you apply to our College of Arts and Sciences you can‚Äôt switch to our College of Engineering or our College of Whatever,‚Äù prohibiting certain switches. Many colleges want you to show your passion, but it probably looks weird if you apply for chemistry but all your ECs point towards art, and nobody wants to hear in the interview when you inevitably get asked about the discrepancy that ‚ÄúI love art, but I have to pick something else so I‚Äôm not broke.‚Äù And unfortunately, I have a passion in something extremely impractical that I know I can‚Äôt possibly pursue as a career, when kids have been training for it since 5 and still don‚Äôt get the job. Meanwhile, I am not trained or even a gifted amateur who sounds professional. It‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúhigh investment, little payoff‚Äù ECs. And unfortunately, I sunk most of my time into it.

 Now, I know security is extremely important for me. I need to have enough money to not worry about it if a disaster hits. I get there‚Äôs wise budgeting and planning, but it‚Äôs a lot harder to save money if you make minimum wage and have to spend it all on cheap unhealthy food because you literally can‚Äôt afford the healthy food that helps you avoid big hospital bills. So what has security and won‚Äôt be obsoleted by robots? STEM, it makes money and you‚Äôll be building the robots yourself instead of being taken over by them. But everyone‚Äôs going into STEM, because they have the same idea as me. I‚Äôm worried the market will oversaturate, lower salaries drastically, and raise the bar of competition so high that I can‚Äôt compete. But every other type of degree, like a music or English degree, seems like it‚Äôs also a no-go because of too many people and too few positions. There‚Äôs always business, but I hear that‚Äôs insanely competitive, dog-eat-dog, and unfriendly to women (I‚Äôm female, not an SJW but also live in a bubble where I haven‚Äôt developed a resistance to harassment and have no interest in needing to). Maybe I‚Äôm wrong and should do more research. Honestly, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be too interested in finance anyways, but I should probably just suck it up.

It doesn‚Äôt help that I often see people talking about how they‚Äôre still unemployed with a degree, how fast food won‚Äôt accept them and their PhD and how CS majors from top colleges don‚Äôt have any offers. I know you‚Äôre supposed to apply yourself and network or get internships or jobs. Half the internships are insanely competitive. Almost everything requires experience: it‚Äôs the classic ‚Äúyou need experience for the job, even though there are no entry level jobs for you to gain it.‚Äù I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to be six feet under in debt in a degree that‚Äôs useless to my field, still unable to get a job, and burdening my parents by living at home with them.

There‚Äôs so many people who say ‚ÄúI was a good motivated student in high school and then I changed in college and now I‚Äôm doing terribly in life,‚Äù and I‚Äôm scared of that, too. Or ‚ÄúI was the smart kid, now I‚Äôm average and not doing too well.‚Äù I‚Äôm scared of being like them, having things looking like they should go so well for me and then life forces you off the path and beats you down. I read on Reddit (10/10 source choice, but the people here seem authentic with their life experiences and stories, and you get a wide variety of them, it‚Äôs like 29393939 adults‚Äô life wisdom for the price of $0.00) and see so many people having ‚Äúmy high school voted Bob Most Likely To Succeed, now he‚Äôs doing awfully,‚Äù ‚ÄúI was gonna do fine then life screwed me‚Äù type stories. I‚Äôm scared of that. I‚Äôm also not the best person, and I‚Äôm scared of people who seem all meek and nice going /prorevenge on me and ruining my future job prospects because I wasn‚Äôt too nice to them. I mean, people on revenge subs tend to talk about how they seem so unassuming and innocent in real life, but this one thing pushed them too far. Not too far-fetched.

So then what‚Äôs the point of working so hard for great stats, if you‚Äôre not going to get a job and you‚Äôll end up in a trailer park alongside the kids who coasted and did nothing but drugs? I‚Äôm applying to Ivies as an Asian with bad ECs and a below-average-for-them GPA. Williams does their ranking thing with level 1, 2, etc, mostly only admitting 1-2 with little exception if I recall correctly, and I also know that my last two AP exam scores are probably barely passing, if that. That‚Äôs way under their level 2 student. One of them is a math exam, which is really bad because I‚Äôm applying for engineering programs. That‚Äôs not good for the Williams ranking and would probably hit my other applications, too. If it‚Äôs not good enough for Williams it‚Äôs probably an outright rejection from HYPSM. Most of them want SAT II in science and math. I‚Äôm fine with the math, but I know I‚Äôm not comfortable with any science subject tests but physics, and I know I‚Äôll have a ton of work memorizing formulas and self-teaching because we didn‚Äôt cover half that stuff in class. All to chase a pipe dream that I know I won‚Äôt get, to give me a tiny edge on the competition for jobs that I won‚Äôt get anyways (brand name apparently helps give you benefit of the doubt for interviews or things, it helps when things could go either way and gets your foot in the door but isn‚Äôt an auto acceptance) and a stupid ego boost because prestige and all my self esteem is based off of grades and achievements.

This all-consuming pessimism won‚Äôt help me either haha. The prestige thing won‚Äôt help my interviews. I‚Äôm paranoid and arrogant for thinking this but I‚Äôm scared AOs are gonna see this and somehow connect it to me on my actual app and then I‚Äôm out."

CAREER is an important aspect of everyone‚Äôs life. It decides the kind of lifestyle one will lead throughout his lifetime and his/her position in the society (trap). While everyone dreams of a healthy and a comfortable lifestyle, not everyone is able to achieve it.

Be it a boy or a girl, these days career is given a lot of importance in a person‚Äôs life. From the beginning itself, we are asked to concentrate on our studies and score well in the exams. The ultimate motive for doing this is to build a strong base and acquire good grades that would help you in building a lucrative career.
But after doing all this stuff, most people fail to build their successful career because they don‚Äôt have the clarity of what they want in life? Always remember ‚Äì ‚Äúclarity is power‚Äù. Stick with me to learn and master the game of building a rewarding career!

One vision to see career is ‚Äì It‚Äôs the part of the game of life for survival or you can say it THE Game of survival! The vision behind this vision is ‚Äì our mind loves to play games. Imagine what we can do if we see our life as a game rather than being too serious. Everyone wants to become an expert in this game (life), but before mastering it you should understand its rules, guidelines and learn from experts and losers too.
Share your vision by commenting below at the bottom.

Are you READY?

Your whole future will depend on a single decision i.e. The Choice of CAREER ‚Äì The Biggest decision of our life! What you choose today will impact your whole life i.e. your whole life is at stake!

On one side there is ‚Äì what you want to do, what you want to become and

On the other side is ‚Äì what this world wants you to do which includes your friends, family, relatives and
the whole society. They want you to do what all are doing not that what you want
to do and to stay within the norms of society, follow the rules and others etc.

What will you choose?
Do you have the courage to be what you want to be and to do whatever it takes? The person who doesn‚Äôt have the courage to take the biggest decision of his/her life by own, what can he do in life? No matter what, if you are ready to learn then nobody has the courage to stop you from getting success in life! You are the only one who can change your life to make it full of success.

Are you ready?

FINDING THE RIGHT CAREER

Finding the right career (or changing one) proves to be quite challenging for most individuals. The most important questions you should ask yourself before starting your new journey towards success is ‚Äì
‚Ä¢ What do you want in life? ( Acc. to a research only 2% people have well-defined goals)
‚Ä¢ Why do you want it?
‚Ä¢ How much effort can you put in to achieve the same?

Every individual should ask these questions from their self, it will help them to live a directional life.
It‚Äôs very easy to find many people pursuing degrees or doing jobs which are not of their interest. They even don‚Äôt know why they are here? Maybe they find it a good fit for fulfilling their expectations and that‚Äôs how they got trapped in the rat race. Be patient and never expect too much too early, there is no get-rich-quick scheme in reality.
Being said that, let me make it clear for all what to expect from your career and what not to ‚Äì

¬†

¬† ¬† ¬†WHAT TO EXPECT¬†WHAT NOT TO EXPECTMONEYHAPPINESS &amp; SATISFACTIONCOMFORTABLE LIFESTYLENO PROBLEMSLEISURE TIMESTRESS-FREE LIFEFREEDOMNO HARD WORK

¬†

Yes, you read it right. Success can‚Äôt buy you happiness, though temporary satisfaction can be achieved. Majority of people commit these mistakes &amp; continuously find happiness and satisfaction from their work. Have you ever stopped and questioned yourself ‚Äì
‚Ä¢ What is happiness? What is the source of happiness?

If not then I would recommend to ‚Äì stick with this question to acquire mental stability in life. #Beclear#Becrazy

Now that we have the clear mindset, let‚Äôs move towards how to choose the right career for you.

CAREER STRATEGY for a new journey ‚Äì

With the help of this goldmine strategy, you can start your new journey and lead a successful and healthy life. So I want you to give attention for the next few minutes as it can change your life and can be a breakthrough for your life.

1. Self- reflection ‚Äì

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do formalities, be present in present, live and express yourself completely‚Äù

‚Äì Varun Gera

‚Ä¢¬†Analyze your interests¬†‚Äì While growing up certain things become important for us which we enjoy doing and have a keen interest. We will not mind doing it for the whole life even for a lesser amount of money. Analyze your interests. What do you love to do in your spare time? You may have a hobby that could lead to a career. If you want to live a life worth it then you should do what you love to do.

‚Ä¢¬†Your unique strength¬†‚Äì No two personalities are same completely. Everyone is different and unique in their own way. Finding your unique strengths can (confused-solve out most of your problems). You should ‚Äì

1. Find your unique strength
2. Focus on depth, not on the width
3. Say No to almost everything else

Let‚Äôs understand by the following example ‚Äì
‚úì Big ‚Äì Bigger ‚Äì Biggest (exists)
‚úì Small ‚Äì Smaller ‚Äì Smallest (exists)
Ôøº¬†Unique ‚Äì Uniquer ‚Äì Uniquest (doesn‚Äôt exists) ‚úì Unique is unique

‚ÄúIf you try to become best you will be number one‚Äù but
‚ÄúIf you try to be unique you will be the only one‚Äù

‚Ä¢¬†Analyze your skills¬†‚Äì Skills play a major role in everyone‚Äôs life. In today‚Äôs hassle world, everyone wants results, probably you too. To produce results you should have the pre-requisite skills in that particular field. You know what do you like and what you are good at. But when we‚Äôre put under pressure, we find ourselves a little bit confused to tell about our skills. It happens to lots of people especially when it comes to filling out application forms and attending interviews. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a good idea to figure out your skill set in advance.

2. Create your list ‚Äì

Now that you know yourself properly, it‚Äôs time to accept yourself as it is and create a new career list. Your new list must contain the possible fields depending on your interest, talents and abilities which could lead to a satisfying career. While preparing your list, learn from the people who are already in the profession you are planning for and Google is a boon for such tasks.

After creating your list look for available opportunities and future growth. There are many different kinds of occupations matching your educational qualification, list, and experience. Enlist some satisfactory occupations and now narrow down your list and settle for the one that suits you the most and which has some future scope also. While doing so always be ready with a backup plan.

3. Acquire some skills ‚Äì

If your educational qualification and skill set is not enough to seek the occupation of your choice, you must acquire some skills. In the current and the upcoming years ‚ÄúSkills matters the most degrees don`t.‚ÄùThe old generation has passed away and now we all have unlimited opportunities, the catch is just to see it with a broad vision and attempt to take benefit from them.

4. Intern or temp ‚Äì

By now you have a goal and a direction in your life hopefully. Now it‚Äôs time to kick-start your career and I would say internship or temp is the right way to start! Internship opportunities help set the foundation for your career. It is an opportunity to receive experience in applying theories learned until now.

Some major advantages of internship are ‚Äì
1. Gain valuable work experience
2. Explore a career path
3. Gives you an edge
4. Develop and refine skills
5. Earn while learning
6. Network with professionals in the field
7. Gain confidence
8. Convert into a job (optional)

5. Learn and Bounce Back ‚Äì

Nobody is and can‚Äôt be perfect in the world because every information which we consume is limited as the source (our senses) itself is limited. Therefore the sky of perfection is just a mirage! You should try your best and never give up i.e. keep trying!

‚ÄúFailures are the plan of nature to test ‚Äì our strength and how fast we can bounce back‚Äù
‚Äì Varun Gera

No matter in which profession you want to go or already in, there are always new innovations, tools, techniques, and others etc. i.e. everything changes (almost everything). Never stop learning otherwise you will stop growing in life and those who stop growing are similar to dead.

‚ÄúThe one person to distrust is who never makes a mistake.‚Äù

KEY TAKEAWAYS

CLARITY IS POWER!
LIFE IS A GAME, let‚Äôs play it together!
TAKE THE CAREER DECISION YOURSELF!
Don‚Äôt copy OTHERS, because you are UNIQUE!
LEARNING NEVER ENDS!

And last but not the least ‚Äì Always be open to the unexpected and remember it‚Äôs never too late to try something new!

8m1nc6,1,2018-05-25,How to define what I do at my current job?,Susy_La_Adelita,Resume,https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/8m1nc6/how_to_define_what_i_do_at_my_current_job/,"TL;DR: I don‚Äôt know how to define the work that I do (or even the position at work) for my resume. I tried to detail my job functions in the listed items below. I am looking to switch jobs so wanted your guys‚Äô help.

Hello all. I don‚Äôt know if this is the place to ask so I‚Äôll try to keep it as short as possible. I am basically looking to switch jobs and wanted to make myself more desirable to new software companies than I was when I graduated. I had a rough time finding jobs out of college since I didn‚Äôt have internships and therefore wanted advice on how to describe what I do in terms that a regular software company hiring manager might be able to judge my abilities.

I recently graduated from a university in the southeast US with my Electrical Engineering degree. I learned a lot of programming and did a bunch of projects ranging from embedded systems to android apps. I finally found a job at my current company but wanted to move to an actual software engineering company with better pay.

I currently work at a service company (tutoring company) that uses Google Sheets to manage all its information and run day-to-day business. I had been hired as the web designer since they wanted someone in house with web experience (that they didn‚Äôt need to pay as much). But I quickly moved over to general IT (as I want to call it). Basically, I introduced the idea of using Google Sheets to maintain and manage data and, using Google App Scripting, make the process as automated as possible. We already have a POS System from Square. But since our company is a service company and we feel Square isn‚Äôt really geared towards service companies yet, I had to find workarounds for a bunch of daily and monthly functions.
My basic functions are:

* Created and maintained an active daily appointment sheet using Google App Scripting with Google Sheets that pulls data from our POS system and is a dashboard for our admin staff to perform daily duties such as charge customers for appointments, verify all appointment details, measure complete employee hours and mark special transactions for future keeping (such as unpaid tickets, prepaid customers, etc.).

* Made a system for logging daily student attendance with digital signatures. I built a custom front-end to let tutors see only their respective students every day while all the data is managed through Google Sheets.

* Created a messaging system between tutors and students (and their families) using Google‚Äôs Gmail Service. Basically, the back-end is managed by Gmail and again Google Sheets while the front-end was built to have tutors send session notes to students through an app.

* As the web developer, I also improved the website with structural updates that had to do with the fact they were using a theme in WordPress before. I also do daily updates such as putting in new hires on the website and setting up online booking for appointments.

Since our client base is quite large (around 1500 customers), after I joined, I have been able to reduce a lot of man hours through automation (I understand I might have to give exact numbers on my resume).

I apologize for the long post. Please let me know if there is a better place to ask this. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I want to go somewhere that might provide more structure and sophisticated tools and of course better pay. Thanks so much!"

The problem I encountered was that the take home had a very specific problem and creating an extensible solution proved to be difficult. How can I improve myself in that aspect? How does one improve the ""production quality"" level of their code without being on the job and learning from others?

My bad course planning made my semester a mess but somehow managed to overcome them.

Anyway, unfortunately I happened to miss out the PEY application period for this year, and right now I have little/no hope on the internship applications I sent out months ago. 

That being said, knowing that June is coming, should I continue searching for summer internships by now, or just chill off and try finding some casual part-time and meanwhile develop side projects during this summer? 
(Also planning to do PEY after 4th year since I dropped some courses to cope with the required ones, so a 5th year full time is for sure.)

Another question that I've got in mind: How ""complete"" should the side projects be so it can be presented as a legit proof of experience? If we are including course projects too would that also be fine?

Any suggestion are welcome! 
Also I would really appreciate if you can share about your plans :)

First off, I am not young. I am in my early\-mid 30's. 

I went to college, thinking I wanted to be a journalist or something in the media or publishing word. I ended up working as something similar to a paralegal. After a few years, I got out of that, and landed an entry level writing job at a big cable news company.

Years passed and I stayed in the same position. My schedule was overnight starting out, and eventually it became something more tolerable. Finally, I started branching out. I asked people in other departments if I could shadow them. I had some interesting experiences and brushes with some very famous people. I moved up into a highly demanding blogging role. I gave it everything I had and cranked out tons of blog posts. But it wore me out. I was terminated for confusing reasons, it felt like a misunderstanding. But there was no opportunity for clarification.

That was almost two years ago and I never really recovered. I moved to another city to be closer to my girlfriend and get a new start, but it hasn't exactly worked out. I floundered for a year, eventually getting a part time job in a coffee roastery, and an internship at my local public radio station. I've reported a couple of stories from them which I'm proud of. But I don't particularly like reporting. I am shy and non confrontational and prefer to keep to myself when possible.

In the meantime I've also been trying to learn web development. I took a course, which was great, and have been trying to keep working on that, but it's hard to focus on that when there are so many things I need to do and figure out. I need a paycheck. Also, my girlfriend got a job back in New York where we came from originally, so now I am moving back too so that we don't break up.

So, to sum up: I have experience writing, but don't really love it. I am considering technical writing. Audio editing/mixing. And frontend web development. They are all areas I want to explore. I can't afford not to make a good living that will let me provide for myself and my family.

Please, if anyone out there reads this, I would like to hear what you think about what I should do. Thanks!"
8m3wfr,53,2018-05-25,My guide to getting into an IT helpdesk career from an internship,Colton6692,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8m3wfr/my_guide_to_getting_into_an_it_helpdesk_career/,"It seems like a lot of people are struggling to find a job in IT. In 5 years I was able to go from making 15 an hour as an intern to a 55k a year salary. I know that isn't much for some of you, but that's enough to live pretty comfortable. I'm just going to make a post to give you ideas and how to stick out from the competition as an intern. When you start out, keep in mind you're going to be at the bottom of the totem pole. You need to work for the job you want, which might take some time. 

If you're in College, take some sort of career development class that requires an internship. This should help you get in the door for an Internship at a bigger company, as this typically signifies you're almost done with a 2\-4 year degree\(at least at my school\). I took this my last semester for an Associates of applied sciences, and landed a summer internship at an oil and gas company. When I first started, the main duties were to image computers, learn how ticketing systems work and how to document everything you do. There were 3 interns and I was the only one who got hired because of what I did:

If the techs above you stop giving you work, ask for more. Don't sit around waiting for someone to tell you to do something. If you completed all the work that was given, ask your manager for more. If they say there is nothing more to do for now, ask who the manager of accounting / HR / Accounts payable is. Go to their office, introduce yourself as the intern. Tell them you completed all of your work for the day, and was wondering if they need any help filing anything\(trust me, they will need help and nobody wants to do it\). Don't pay attention to whatever the other people are doing, just keep yourself busy, and try to learn how the business works. At least for me, I knew the company was most likely going to hire someone after the internship. I didn't consider this brown nosing or sucking up to people, all I was trying to do was keep myself busy and do more than anyone else. You have to think: ""This could be the start of my career.  I need to do whatever it takes to get this job."" and it happened. They fired the guy that was working there \(he was pretty awful\) to hire me because i proved I could do more. In the 3 years I worked there I was promoted every year. By the end, I was flying all over the country to do support for the company on\-site. I made friends with everyone at the company that I could. When the oil field had a turn down, I was the last helpdesk tech to be let go. I was very upset, but I didn't let it effect me. Not even a month into being unemployed, one of the managers at my old company got me an interview for another job, where I currently am. I never asked for anything, they just did it. Make friends with people, don't just treat it like a job. Being in IT you will communicate with literally everyone in the company at some point, so be pleasant, friendly and helpful. There will be people you cannot stand, but still treat them like they're your best friend. You never know who will put in a good word for you. If you're not a people person, this job isn't for you. 

Things you need to do when helping people:

\-If the perosn needing help is in your office / building, do not call them. you go to their office. No excuses. No matter how quick it is, always go to their office and ask to help in person. People really like this.

\-Always try to keep yourself busy. If you're sitting around, there is almost always something you can be doing. 

\-Know who is more important that others. If a manager has a problem, and you're helping someone under them first for the same problem, that's no bueno. 

To all the ex\-intern out there, what did you do to help you land a job? Share your stories! If you have anything to add, let me know!"

We majored in the same field(IT) and all my friends got job offers immediately after graduating(Granted they applied before graduating, while I'm applying now). They got $70k+ a year offers and I just feel so jealous thinking about it. I've been working for a home improvement retail for the past three years while going to college and I make around $20k a year. I'm truly happy for them because we all worked really hard to get here, but seeing them making that much is killing me. 

They got an offer from the companies they intern for. I did a one year long internship for a local city government, but because they city is so small, they only need one person in their IT department, so I did not get an offer from them.

I had my resume and cover letter reviewed at my school career services and I applied to over 15 business analyst positions last week. I haven't heard from any yet. 

How do I stop myself from constantly comparing myself to them?"

Quick background: BS Bioengineering, Coding camp (python/java) , MS Georgia Tech Computer Science (in progress).

I got an offer from a company my dad works at to start next summer as a full time junior developer in their robotics testing unit. 
I have a decent base in this company, I interned there in their clinical department, did my senior design externship as an undergrad with them, my dad is a director.

I havent dug into the job search process too deeply (Im trying to do my own DIY machine learning bootcamp this summer) however from 30-50 applications I sent out I got 0 responses (all internship applications). I am aware that this is a very low number to send out

This company starts everyone off as an intern and as long as you arent retarded they give an offer. The offer in their department for engineers of all degrees (at the undergraduate level ) is 100k + 15% bonus (if the company doesnt flop) and around 60k-100 k (BS, MS, PHD) in stock sign on bonus /4 years. 

In one outlook it is a job offer and experience ( A WHOLE YEAR from now) at the same time, I hate the company, I hated the employees, I dont want to get into robotics .

Should I keep waiting over the next year or tell the boss its a yes from my side? "

There's a TL/DR...*


First, accept the fact that interviewing is an incredibly subjective process, different people are looking for different things.  That said, if you cover as many bases as possible, you will be protected over most of those specific things that each interviewer notices more than others.  These suggestions are to directly address the most common reasons I get for a decline after interview.  These points have less to do with specific technology because that aspect will vary greatly depending on the role.  To qualify, I have personally conducted literally hundreds of IT interviews for roles from C-level to internships and arranged or debriefed people after even more.  If some of this seems nitpicky, it‚Äôs because your interviewer may or may not be sensitive to a very specific factor, so prepare for anything.  A lot of this is common sense, but I have multiple stories of declines for running afoul of each and every one of these points:


**The Basics**


* First and most importantly is your mindset, an interview is not a test or an interrogation.  You are not there to prove yourself worthy; don‚Äôt immediately put yourself in an inferior position regardless of how low level the job is.  You are there to have a mutual conversation with someone to discover if there is an alignment between your goals/assets and theirs.  You hope there is, but there might not be.  You‚Äôre willing to spend 30-60 minutes of your time to find out, and gosh you really hope it‚Äôs worth your time.  Think confidence, not arrogance; mutual respect.

* Arrive in the building 5-10 minutes early, no more no less, overcompensate the time you leave and spend a few minutes in your car or somewhere across the street if you have to.

* A suit with a jacket, shirt, and tie is the ONLY acceptable interview attire for men as far as I‚Äôm concerned - I don‚Äôt care what the employees wear.  For women, dress conservatively in business professional attire, there‚Äôs more variation there but you get my drift.  For men and women, clothing should ideally be dry cleaned, but clean and wrinkle free at a minimum.

* Hygiene: I shouldn‚Äôt have to say this but for God‚Äôs sake show up clean, brush your teeth, and pop a couple breath mints before you go in if you just had a coffee and a garlic bagel.  Common sense here, but I‚Äôve seen it cost people jobs; cologne and perfume should be kept to a bare minimum if at all.  Trimmed, clean nails and well kempt hair/facial hair, polished dress shoes.  Remove any piercings you can, ears for women are the exception.

* EVERY person you meet or are introduced to gets a handshake and a ‚Äúnice to meet you‚Äù with a smile and eye contact, don‚Äôt risk alienating anyone by acknowledging people more or less based on their role in your interview.  If a panel, make sure everyone is involved, ask a direct question of the person that isn't talking.

* Carry a small portfolio with clean, printed copies of your resume just in case (5 or so), it‚Äôs acceptable to have a small notepad to jot down key points (keep this to a bare minimum).

* Pitch matching: critically important, match the tempo and communication style of your interviewer as much as possible: are they bubbly and enthusiastic?  Be more energetic than you normally would and make small talk.  Short, direct questions and an ‚Äúall right angles‚Äù straightforward type?  Give short, simple, concise answers.  You get the idea.

* Research basics about the company: how do they make money, how big are they, where does this office fit in, and where does the job you‚Äôre interviewing for fit in.  Don‚Äôt overdo it.  Memorizing their core values or knowing that their CEO likes Snickers bars won‚Äôt come up.

* Body Language: poised, but comfortable.  Don‚Äôt slump down in the seat, feel free to adjust your posture a few times like you would in any other seated conversation and give eye contact that is engaging and indicative of attention without staring the whole time.  Avoid any nervous ticks: the bouncing leg, the back and forth chair swivel, tapping a pen, etc.

* TURN OFF YOUR CELL PHONE!  Not on silent, not on airplane mode, OFF.  Leaving it in your car is even better but if you take it with you, it never leaves your pocket.


**The Conversation**


* See how I called it a conversation?  That‚Äôs what it should be.  If you have a bad interviewer who is reading off a list of questions, go ahead and accommodate that style.  It‚Äôs wrong, but they‚Äôre welcome to do that.  Try to get things to flow organically.  Unless they're very reserved, try to get a smile out of them.  Make a little joke or something.  It lightens the mood and both of you will relax a bit more.

* When they ask you a question, they are telling you what‚Äôs important, dig in on those things and ask an intelligent follow-up.  Example: ‚ÄúDo you have experience troubleshooting network connectivity issues?‚Äù  Answer: ‚ÄúYes, I often dealt with remote employees that had trouble accessing the VPN and had to walk them through a series of troubleshooting steps.  I handled a variety of other network issues, that was just the most common.  What kind of network issues do your current help desk people run into most frequently?‚Äù

* If you have been talking for more than 30 seconds without your interviewer speaking, you are rambling - very common when nervous.  Stop yourself and simply say, ‚Äúdoes that answer your question?‚Äù or ‚Äúis that what you were looking for?‚Äù  Most interviewers will accept that invitation and let you know if your answer didn‚Äôt touch on the specific thing they were asking about.  People won‚Äôt interrupt a rambler, it‚Äôs embarrassing.  What they will do is wait til you leave and then tell everyone about how you couldn‚Äôt shut up.

* If a question catches you off guard, buy a little time.  ""I've never had anyone ask me that, let me think here..."" ""Interesting question, mind if I mull that over for a second?""  Take 5-10 seconds organizing your thoughts and then speak.  If you don't understand a question, say so.  ""So are you asking if I've trained people personally or just been involved in creating a training program?""  Clarifying is fine, don't operate on an assumption and roll the dice.

* Craft intelligent questions and allow them to flow into short conversations on those topics.  Ask questions about things you genuinely want to know, not stuff people told you to ask.  Compensation, hours, benefits, time off, etc. are between you and HR, save those for your recruiter.  This time is not for those purposes.

* End the interview by walking out with your interviewer and waiting until you know you‚Äôre parting ways for the handshake, eye contact, and a simple ‚Äúthanks for taking the time to meet with me, I appreciate it.‚Äù  Avoid the awkward double goodbye where you shake their hand once in the room and once in the lobby, not a big deal but it is a bit unnatural.

* A brief email to the interviewer thanking them for taking the time to meet with you is a nice courtesy, but by no means a necessity.  It‚Äôs a nice touch, but entirely up to you and will not make the difference.

These are the biggies, but you could increase this list infinitely.  Hopefully this is a good baseline for anyone that is either inexperienced interviewing or struggles with it.  Good luck!

**TL/DR: Be confident, don't do anything stupid, chill out.**

8m71ha,6,2018-05-25,Leaving An Internship 4 Weeks In To Pursue A Different 8 Week Internship?,2018summerinternhelp,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8m71ha/leaving_an_internship_4_weeks_in_to_pursue_a/,"Hi,

So I'm a rising sophomore college student currently studying business and computer science at my state university. I am seeking to enter the consulting or possibly quantitative finance industry after college.

I was originally planning on interning at 1 company this summer. This company is a really small pharmaceutical company \(one small office and a small laboratory run by one retired person\) and my role in the company is to mainly perform image analysis and possibly Android development if there is time. I get paid, although very little relatively. Additionally, I don't have much interest in healthcare/pharmaceuticals. One thing to note is that the owner has no constraints on the start/end dates.

During my internship search, I was in talks with a different, larger manufacturing company \(\~1000 employees\), and after I accepted the offer with the pharmaceutical company, an analyst from the manufacturing company said he wanted me to come intern at his company this summer. My role at this company would involve business development and business analytics, involving both consulting and data analytical skills. The salary would be much better than the first company's salary. I told the analyst I already accepted a different internship offer, but he said that he would still be open to me coming in later this summer to help out if I had time.

Again, I was originally planning to only intern at the pharmaceutical company the entire summer, which I told the company's owner. I believe it would be in my interests to intern at the second company, but I would feel morally wrong to renege and not intern at the pharmaceutical company at all, so I would like to intern there at least for 4 weeks. I checked my summer schedule and I can intern at the pharma company for 4 weeks and the manufacturing company for 8 weeks. Given I have the pharma company owner's approval, would it be morally ok to quit the internship at the pharmaceutical company 4 weeks in to pursue this second internship at the manufacturing company?"

Anyways here's my dilemna. I'm taking a robotics internship this summer and am looking at laptops for the classes. I've narrowed it down to three options but can't decide, so I am posting here to try and get the opinions of people more experienced than I.

[Second option](https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GS63VR-Stealth-Pro-034-i7-6700HQ/dp/B01IO9YB8K)

[Third option](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Stealth-Touchscreen-Ultrabook-Generation/dp/B01L3EX8Y6) paired with [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B076PZ6PRK/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1527301617&amp;sr=8-1&amp;pi=AC_SX236_SY340_FMwebp_QL65&amp;keywords=aorus+gaming+box&amp;dpPl=1&amp;dpID=516Ee5QZlDL&amp;ref=plSrch)

The one thing I am currently unsure of is whether or not the Blade Stealth has an internal HDD slot. Also, I do video editing on occasion so a laptop geared for both productivity and gaming while still keeping below the 2.5k price point would be perfect. Thanks in advance. Also, if you know of a laptop that would suit this better feel free to link it.

- National Science Honors Society / Math Club / Engineering Internship Same as above.         
- Quite a bit of community service, with multiple leadership roles.     
- Chorus, choirs, vocal lessons    
- Multiple musical theatre endeavors, with leading roles and stage managing positions    

I will be attending the University of Central Florida in the fall with the intention to major in mathematics.  I chose UCF because of location and opportunities available, but the primary reason was price.  Their National Merit offer is astoundingly generous and ultimately too good to pass up.  If I play my cards right, I'll graduate with more money than I started with.

Looking for advice on how to get entry level job/internship now

So I just recently moved to the Bay area after being verbally told I had an internship lined up here. Unfortunately, they ended up canceling the internship, so now I'm stuck looking for either another internship or an entry level software engineer position near SF.

I pretty much graduated a year ago with a BS in Math from a pretty good tech school in Massachusetts. Since then I've picked up Ruby, RoR, SQL, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. Also took a few online courses from Coursera and Udacity on Algorithms, MVC architecture, Machine Learning, etc. 

Does anyone have an recommendations for someone in my position? I don't have any huge projects done, only programs I've learned in these courses or some online tutorials I've followed. I'm confident I can do well as a software engineer, I just can't seem to find a company who wants to hire me, internship or full time.

Edit: changed the confident statement because people are getting tripped by that. I don't know everything, just being optimistic. 

Note: I appreciate everyone's response. From what it looks like, I should work on some projects to show I'm actually good with these languages and frameworks. That and make some website that could be my resume and portfolio together.

I understand that moving to the Bay Area makes the market highly competitive and whatnot. However I'm trying to be in the company of other software engineers and absorbing everything I can. I can guarantee you that it's much better here than where I was a few months ago. "

I‚Äôve been applying to mainly Software Engineering internships since the beginning of February. Before last week I had only gotten one ‚Äúinterview‚Äù (one-way video interview) after which I was rejected. Everything else was either no response or rejection. 

I applied for an IT support internship about two weeks ago and last week they asked me to do a phone interview. It seems like it went pretty well since they‚Äôve now asked me to do an in-person interview in four days. The first interview was mostly about my personality and my ability to prioritize tasks. It made me feel good when the interviewer responded to one of my answers with ‚ÄúWow, I couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself!‚Äù. The next interview will be more technical, they told me. 

So this is where I‚Äôm terrified because while I have lots of experience as a computer user and I‚Äôm pretty good at Googling things, I don‚Äôt know the first thing about IT. Some other posts that I found on this subreddit said that it doesn‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt know anything, the interviewers are just looking at your problem-solving abilities. The thing is, these commenters were responding to people who have certs and degrees in IT. Those people had some knowledge but they at least knew what IT was all about. I don‚Äôt know anything. I don‚Äôt want to reply with ‚ÄúI‚Äôd Google it‚Äù for every single question. 

I have a decent amount of customer service experience from working in a library for four years and from working in a grocery story this summer and last summer. I also have experience helping other CS students debug their code and solve some basic computer/config issues. I was able to leverage this experience in the first interview pretty well but if they ask me to connect a printer to the network or something during this next interview, I‚Äôll be lost. 

What kind of materials are there for me to use to get a brief overview of some sorts of things I‚Äôd need to know in order to give a company IT support? They said they mostly use Macs but have Debian servers. If there are also some wiki pages I didn‚Äôt see, please direct me to them. Thank you. "

I came as a cs major and have taken more cs classes. I recently transferred into operations and information management which focuses on the business side but still has some data manipulation and light cs ideas in it (although it is a bachelors of business administration). I have taken enough cs classes to get my cs minor. I'm trying to choose between the two to get out in 4 years.

I'm not sure what opportunities I will have as a OIM major/cs minor vs Cs major. I was hoping to work as a consultant at IBM and I think OIM would really help with that but I'm afraid I'm pigeon holing myself into one position while CS is so general that I could do many things.

I cannot do both in 4 years but there is also the option of staying extra time, it is a state school so tuition is cheap. The cs school and business school (Isenberg) at UMass amherst are both pretty good as well. 

This summer I have an internship with a private equity firm on the quantitative analysis team doing CSish stuff but it still kind of falls in line with OIM so I think it will be applicable experience either way.

I tried to detail my job functions in the listed items below. I am looking to switch jobs so wanted your guys‚Äô help.

Hello all. I don‚Äôt know if this is the place to ask so I‚Äôll try to keep it as short as possible. I am basically looking to switch jobs and wanted to make myself more desirable to new software companies than I was when I graduated. I had a rough time finding jobs out of college since I didn‚Äôt have internships and therefore wanted advice on how to describe what I do in terms that a regular software company hiring manager might be able to judge my abilities.

I recently graduated from a university in the southeast US with my Electrical Engineering degree. I learned a lot of programming and did a bunch of projects ranging from embedded systems to android apps. I finally found a job at my current company but wanted to move to an actual software engineering company with better pay.

I currently work at a service company (tutoring company) that uses Google Sheets to manage all its information and run day-to-day business. I had been hired as the web designer since they wanted someone in house with web experience (that they didn‚Äôt need to pay as much). But I quickly moved over to general IT (as I want to call it). Basically, I introduced the idea of using Google Sheets to maintain and manage data and, using Google App Scripting, make the process as automated as possible. We already have a POS System from Square. But since our company is a service company and we feel Square isn‚Äôt really geared towards service companies yet, I had to find workarounds for a bunch of daily and monthly functions.
My basic functions are:

* Created and maintained an active daily appointment sheet using Google App Scripting with Google Sheets that pulls data from our POS system and is a dashboard for our admin staff to perform daily duties such as charge customers for appointments, verify all appointment details, measure complete employee hours and mark special transactions for future keeping (such as unpaid tickets, prepaid customers, etc.).

* Made a system for logging daily student attendance with digital signatures. I built a custom front-end to let tutors see only their respective students every day while all the data is managed through Google Sheets.

* Created a messaging system between tutors and students (and their families) using Google‚Äôs Gmail Service. Basically, the back-end is managed by Gmail and again Google Sheets while the front-end was built to have tutors send session notes to students through an app.

* As the web developer, I also improved the website with structural updates that had to do with the fact they were using a theme in WordPress before. I also do daily updates such as putting in new hires on the website and setting up online booking for appointments.

Since our client base is quite large (around 1500 customers), after I joined, I have been able to reduce a lot of man hours through automation (I understand I might have to give exact numbers on my resume).

I apologize for the long post. Please let me know if there is a better place to ask this. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I want to go somewhere that might provide more structure and sophisticated tools and of course better pay. Thanks so much!"

The issue I have is that there is a one week overlap between the two internships. Ideally I would like to try to do both internships, but I am wondering how difficult it will be to take leave during the final week of the 8 week programme (due to the fact that this is the week when presentations of the projects will be given).

I understand that taking leave from this final week is likely to significantly reduce my chances of obtaining a full-time job with the firm, but am not too worried about this, as I am planning on applying for banking internships next summer anyway, so probably wouldn't accept a job offer anyway.

Do you think I should try my best to take leave on this last week of the first one? If so, is there anything in particular that would be good to say to the employer for them to allow this? Paid leave is given on the internship, I just think the timing will make it difficult.

(x-posted from the resume advice thread in /r/cscareerquestions)

I just finished my third year of college and am preparing my resume early to start applying for full-time jobs in the fall. I've blocked out space for my summer internship but haven't filled out the info yet. I've got a few things I'm specifically looking for input on, but other comments and suggestions are welcome as well.

1. I left my high school in for a few reasons. One, I thought the right column was a bit too empty without it and I didn't want to mess with the column sizes of the template. Two, I go to school in the same state as my hometown and I've met quite a few recruiters/interviewers from around my area which can be a nice conversation starter. Three, my test scores. However, while I think it's fine to list your high school when applying for internships, I'm not too sure about it for full-time positions. Thoughts?

2. (Might be a bit too CS-specific for this sub) I plan to personalize the completed coursework listed for different jobs, the ones currently listed are just an example. Applying for internships, I always listed stuff like algorithms and data structures to show that I'd already completed those courses, but I feel like they're kind of a given for graduating students so I'm not sure if I should leave them off now.

3. (Might be a bit too CS-specific for this sub) What sorts of technologies should I be including? Should I split them up into sections like frameworks, software, etc? I'll be changing the order to highlight whatever's specifically listed in each job description but I'm not sure what else to do with that section.

I am currently working as a front-end intern for a well known retail company and handle the majority of coding out their website content, along with my boss. I honestly think they just wanted an intern to do all the work of a full developer but for much lower pay, but that's another discussion.

They told me they'd let me know pretty soon if they were going to hire me as a full developer soon, I'm about 4 months into the 6-month internship. I'm having a kid soon and really would like the job security so I'm weighing my options and am now trying to come up with a solid backup plan if they don't hire me.

My question to all of you, should I go to a boot camp after this? Or should I trust that the experience i've built at this interview should be enough to make me more hirable while I continue teaching myself to code? Or hell am I being an idiot to quit school at all? I'm really not looking for someone to give me the answers, just some different perspectives, and open up a dialogue.

I put in a ton of applications before getting this internship and barely received any return calls, and the ones who did call me weren't interested as soon as they found out I didn't have a degree..hence why I'm not paranoid about being able to get a job out of this.. and a boot camp to me seems like a decent option."

8mfvpz,11,2018-05-27,We Are Cows in a Slaughterhouse,boxnumber10053,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/8mfvpz/we_are_cows_in_a_slaughterhouse/,"The title is no exaggeration, and you have the right to an explanation why. Let me tell you my story. 

I recently attended UCSD for 3 years, studying computer science. I was an extremely dillegent and successful student. I spoke to recruiters, made friends, saught internships, and participated in rec classes. Those TOP early access programs that got you first in line at career fairs - I did all of those. Like many of you, I BUSTED my ass at UCSD.

But something was wrong. I was very unhappy. And everyone else around me was too. It wasn't just on reddit - it was in person, behind closed doors. People were deeply dissatisfied with the school, and very willing to share it after some inquiry. Why was it this way? Why did so many people go to CAPS? Why was the food and HDH so bad? Why did they so readily fine you 60 dollars for failing to follow an incredibly inconsistent and frustrating parking system? Why was sun God getting worse every year? Why are people afraid to talk to each other? Why do I learn more from the internet than my classes? Why am I told to go TO the internet in my classes? Why am I PAYING for this?

That misery drove me to do something. Two quarters before my graduation date I dropped out and flew to Texas with nothing but my backpack, my clothes, my laptop, and 1000 in my bank account. I found free housing with a friend, and took out thousands on credit cards to invest. Within months I was completely self sufficient. But most of all - happy. 

I found that the work ethic that I had at UCSD was just as present in Texas. The FREEDOM I had gained after unburdening the enormous ANXIETY and STRESS I had experienced at UCSD emboldened me and propelled me forward to achieving my goals. 

A few months into all this I had a dream. 

Myself and thousands of other college age students were gathered up and put into the same trucks used to transport livestock, like cows. We were driven through the beautiful streets of San Francisco until we reached a massive industrial building that took up the whole block. The trucks drove us into the building in a single file line. The inside was enormous and shadowy as little light came in through the rusted metal sheet walls. Machinery sounded and steam poured from open pipes. In the center was a massive conveyor belt leading up towards the ceiling, where a pair of large gnashing gears were. The trucks drove us to the belt and ejected us onto it. We were all in a deep stupor, so none of us flinched. As the belt brought me closer to the gears I started to see past them and witnessed what the students who passed through them looked like. I jumped off the belt and ran outside where the comforting streets, fresh air, and beautiful shoreline greeted me. 

I share this in hopes of freeing any who are still trapped

At the moment, my prospective schools, based on research interests, faculty, and the works by those faculty I have read, are the University of Washington at Seattle, the Ohio State University, the University of Pennsylvania, UC San Diego, and the University of Cambridge. I am leaving my undergraduate field and pursuing something closer to my heart, International Relations and Security and defense intelligence.  


I wish to pursue a law degree \(JD\) specializing in international law alongside a PhD as a supplement, that I may better understand the work I will do in the future. I have no aspirations to be a lawyer, but seek to be rounded in it nonetheless.  I have contacted most of these schools, and they have already given me the assurance that as long as I am admitted into both programs separately, arrangements can be made to accommodate my desired curriculum to pursue them simultaneously.

So my last job was shit, it was horrible and demotivating. The founders started a software company in the heart of London claiming to be part of a billion dollar industry and hired me to be part of it. I was most definitely qualified for the role I signed up for, but I was lead to believe that management knew exactly what they were doing and would mentor hand help me if needed.

Turns out they didn't know how to code at all (lets name them,one was Mr IT guy, one was Mr ""I am the next Elon Musk/Steve Jobs"" guy that had ZERO real profession or qualifications), and I was left alone to build their rapidly changing ideas/thoughts/brain-farts on my own. I got roped in with a good salary, *stock options* and a promise of a better life since my last job was just bug fixing other developers work. 

About a few months into it as I was slowly catching on to what was really going on, coding for these guys in the cold garage underneath a ¬£2m townhouse (which belonged Mr IT guy), it turned from being a passion thing to being a thing that happens from 9-5. At 5pm every day I was out, because I seriously couldn't handle it anymore. 

The work situation:

* No other developers
* No senior staff I can call on for guidance
* Milestones/goals are changed before they were completed and the existing deadline will stay intact despite asking for an extension.
* Constant criticism for not being able to meet deadlines for the point above, my ability/mental state was questioned multiple times.
* Eventually brought on ""Interns"" to work for experience (no pay), whom I have to invest in to train and they would leave within a few months at a time.

Around 6 months in, Mr "" I am Elon/Steve"" sat me down and told me I'm not working hard enough, and if I continue to work like this, I will never be as successful as him or Mr IT guy. He even went as far as to compare me to Steve Jobs and say that ""Steve"" used to sleep in his office and not go home until every problem was solved, and that I ""will never be capable of that level of working capacity"". This job has officially destroyed me now. I left after ~6 months of work, 2 weeks notice was given the night of the talk with Mr ""I am Elon/Steve"".

I went and got a Tech support job because, after the criticism I was put through I no longer feel I am confident enough to develop/work on a software product. I still keep up with coding news, I still fiddle around with new tools at home. But when I have a great idea that can be pursued as an exercise, I just can't do it. I can't even start, or draw it out, or research about it.

I just don't know how to get back in. I want to start again, because IT doesn't have the same feeling of fulfilment I used to get when I got code to compile and run.

Has anyone been down in the dumps and managed to get back up? Can you help me? Is there anywhere this can be x-posted for better exposure?

Thanks in advance!!!

I took the IBDP in high school, which I graduated from a few days ago and am currently taking a gap year. But I need to know what I should do during this gap year.

I'm planning to take AP Computer Science and do a few online CS courses (like CS50x). I'm also planning to intern at a local IT company as well as probably support a few start ups with their IT stuff. I'm also planning to create and publish a few apps.

**Please recommend other good online CS courses for me if you know any and please tell me what else should I do during my gap year.**

*NOTE: I'm aiming for very competitive unis like UCLA, USC, UMich, etc.*

PS: The last time I did programming was in Grade 10 so I'm basically starting from the basics as I've forgotten nearly everything.

There is one thing that I wish more start-ups did: I wish they had kept a regular step by step process document and logged their experiences throughout the company‚Äôs growth directly from its initial conception. There is so much we can learn from the successes and failures of other companies, and it would have been fascinating to read how other start-ups secured their first customers, dealt with uncertainties, and when they made their big break (if ever).

Therefore, I‚Äôve decided I would write a weekly journal about my experiences of running a start-up to date (currently in Beta, a strong number of clients, upward week on week growth) and then document my future thoughts/feelings of start-up life. I‚Äôm just a regular guy, running a small team, at a regular start-up (definitely not Richard Branson or Elon Musk), but I want to help people who are looking to take the plunge, or have already taken the plunge, into entrepreneurial life and remove the bullshit glamour that seems to precede people's need to found their own company.

To kick things off I will take you back to the very start of the decision to run a business and provide some tips (from experience) on how to nurture an idea, set the groundwork, push through early funding hurdles, and deal with the endless disappointments.

**Why did I decide to start a business?**

Simply put, the 9-5 lifestyle sucks. I wanted to be in control of a day to day that had unlimited upwards potential...and a load of risk.

Getting a ‚Äònormal‚Äô job just didn‚Äôt cut it for me. I had my heart set on becoming a lawyer at university and completed numerous internships and interviews before realising that life was way too short to work for someone else. I refused to work on things I didn‚Äôt particularly enjoy, for people I don‚Äôt particularly like, in order to buy things I don‚Äôt particularly need. It seemed like a boring and too predictable way to live the rest of my life.

So, following my graduation from university, I decided to take the path less travelled and co-found a business. I knew this route would give me the freedom to live my life without regret. Each day I now have the opportunity to wake up and work on what I love. There are no Monday morning blues and there is no ‚Äòworking for the weekend‚Äô mind-set because each day is a holiday when you are working on your passion. It all sounds cliche and isn't always this rosy, but at least I'm not slaving away for someone else and I believe in our mission and process.

If you are undecided about whether or not to start a business here are my top 3 things you should consider when making that decision. You need to really prepare, think, ask very tough questions about how many years you have set aside to make it work. Too many people think 6 months will cut it - when 3 years will offer a much more realistic runway:

**Passion**: if you aren‚Äôt happy or fulfilled at your current job then there is little reason to stay. Not even money. Everyone should work on their passions, and if you aren‚Äôt doing so today hand in your resignation.

**Opportunity**: if you see a market gap or a particular opportunity then it is worth investing some time and energy into solving it. This is key. **Find the market. Speak to people. Build on a clear problem.**

**Learning:** if you feel your current situation isn‚Äôt pushing you to be the best version of yourself and you aren‚Äôt learning, then there is no better way to remedy this than to start a business. Everyday brings new challenges and new obstacles to overcome. It is a steep learning curve but it is incredibly rewarding at the same time.

**Creating a business idea**

This is something that a lot of people struggle with, but ""creating an idea"" shouldn't necessarily be the goal. I‚Äôve just coined this (very loosely) to be the 3 Ps of starting a business:

The first thing I considered when creating my business was what I am truly **passionate** about. And, if you are uncertain what to do, this should be your starting point too. Forget about the money and think about what you would do if money were no object. For example, before starting Impulse, I regularly bought and sold football/soccer boots and sports memorabilia online at a 500% ROI to help pay for university. This ignited a passion in small businesses and online commerce ‚Äì I wanted to find a way to help businesses grow and help them gain exposure to new customers in a collaborative way. The small business world is tough, whether it's dealing with Facebook algorithms, early orders, growth hacking, retaining customers and users - I wanted to help level the playing field.¬†

When I knew what my passion was, I knuckled down and focused on what **problems** existed within that area. If you are interested in space, maybe the issue is with the cost of space travel. If you are interested in cycling, maybe bikes could be designed to be more aerodynamic. And so on. With Impulse it was clear there are a lot of independent companies and products from across the world that aren‚Äôt getting the exposure they deserve. In fact, most of these companies are creating products that are cooler and of a higher quality than that produced by their multi-million dollar competitors. We knew I had to find a way to help them get their shit discovered. Cheaper, more efficient, and personal solutions to help them fulfil KPI's.

Finally, think about¬†**pay**. How exactly am I going to make money from the problem I am passionate about? Obviously some businesses are easier than others, but I really cannot think of much that cannot be monetised. Even if you have your heart set on travelling for the rest of your life, if that is what you really want it is possible to make money from that way of living. Ultimately cash is king and you want to ensure there are enough revenue streams to keep your future company profitable. With Impulse our initial priority was to help smaller businesses reach wider exposure and build a platform to let people interact with these stores and products. However, this route meant a lighter focus on cash flow and a greater focus on long term business development. Of course we do have potential revenue streams in place as we grow (and we're slowly curating and expanding these.) The point being, ensure you know the importance of cash to your start-up, how quickly you need it, and how long you're runway will be.

**Finally**

I want to help as many people as possible by learning from my own success and failures to date and the trials and triumphs I shall have in the future. We're 3 years into our Start-up lifecycle (with 18 months runway left) and have been through an un\-holy number of ups and downs:

* Concept Design
* Market Traction
* Rejected $100,000 Seed Funding
* Business Loans
* Crowdfunding Failure
* Building the Platform \(This was tough!\)
* Preparing for Launch
* GrowthHacking Pains

Why did you decide to start a business? How did you come up with your business ideas?

If you have any questions, let me know and I‚Äôd be happy to help."

The American president has recently made a declaration to land American astronauts on the moon within a decade. 

This has sparked a desire in the Politburo to begin the Union‚Äôs own program to land on the moon, preferably before the Americans. Due to a wish to allow the Americans to work lacadasily on their rockets and training, it is mandated that all aspects of this new program be kept confidential on the threat of death. This shall be no issue, as all Comrades here have been thoroughly vetted for revisionist tendencies.

I have been selected as the premier Foreman and Manager for the overall rocket project, and am immensely grateful that my labor and merits throughout the years in the Union have been rightfully rewarded with such an honor. 

This will serve as the initial log that documents the design, training, launch, and return of our brave Cosmonauts from their triumphant journey to and from the Moon. We shall show the workers of the world that it is only through the combined efforts of all persons within Soviet Socialism can they achieve the most, and that their liberal Capitalist oligarchy seeks to selfishly use the worker for the sake of enhancing the Capitalist‚Äôs prestige. 

The logs will not be only written by myself. 

The other departments, and their leaders, consisting of:

* Department of Worker Assessment; Alexandrova Tashka Dmitrievna
* Department of Psychology and Admissions; Alexandrova Tashka Dmitrievna
* Department of Engineering; Stepankov Matvey Petrovich

* Department of Cosmos Satellites and Communications; Afanasijovych De
* Department of Logistics; Afanasijovych Demyden
* Department of Rocketry and Physics; ych Demydenko
* Red Army Specialist Detachment (No leader, collective responsibility)

These departments will all contribute to the records as well, preferably with every update on the progress in their department. Only the Department Heads will record status logs, unless a lower-level member of said Department(s) obtain written permission from the Department Heads. Additionally, the Department Head is not required to read any status log written by lower-level members.

1. Involvement in the **Young Pioneers** organization with no record of misbehavior or early counter-revolutionary thought, public or private.

* * Exceptions were added during the selection phase for persons who displayed belief or potential for belief in counter-revolutionary ideas, but subsequently became a devoted and active member of the Party with no relapse into Capitalist Propaganda.

1. Parents must hold a spotless record of activity, contribution, and participation in local Soviets; or, if strictly Proletariat or Agrarian, they must have never withheld their quotas, nor slaughtered livestock, nor sabotaged industrial equipment, nor stifle fellow workers‚Äô assemblies or strikes. 

1. Near-perfect scores, marks, attendance, and ability at the University-level in the fields of one or more of the following:

The selection process of potential Cosmonauts is underway. 

The designs for our rocket that will take our Cosmonauts are swiftly being completed under the masterful work of the gather soviet of engineers, working diligently and after-hours 

I find it humorous for the general Directors of the project to still be bickering about it‚Äôs name. They cannot get a consensus to take the name *Proton* or *Soyuz*. I will track their progress so that we may all have a wonderful laugh after the Cosmonauts return, this heated-argument becoming a trifle among friends in comparison. 

The only department that is unwilling to share much of their logs is the Psychology and Admissions department. They have completed numerous logs, with the numbers increasing in the header each time I request one for log notes. As far as I know, I am the only one who has submitted logs and spoken openly about it. All other departments have declared themselves too busy with the Project to begin their logs, at least until later. 

The Crew Assessment and Psychological team have not made such declarations, and avoid the question entirely. I do not understand their need for secrecy, for they could give any number of explanations to why they must maintain utmost secrecy for their logs. So many easy ways to avert suspicion, yet they are almost goading me into a game of Cat-and-Mouse for they cannot help but hint at some nefarious purpose for their silence.

We are still awaiting a decision to be made on the name for the vessel. Comrade Filippovich could not keep a straight face in relaying the indecision of the Board of Directors. My crew have managed to contain themselves because we do not find it particularly humorous, but I suppose each person has their niche humor. 

We are on schedule to begin importing materials and supplies for crafting the vessel alongside the designs agreed upon. 

The crews work ethic is spectacular as we begin to organize ourselves and our tools, ready to begin the moment the materials arrive by train. There has even been an exceptional increase in the number of rail-yard workers, no doubt to ensure that the sheer magnitude of the resources to be unloaded does not slow down our efforts. 

The only issue we currently are having is a severe lack of vodka. If the state has yet to supply us with all the materials we need to get started, why not supply us with enough material to pass the time? Then again, I don‚Äôt suppose any quality of work will be completed if all of us work one-hour-shifts with eight-hours-nap-breaks and lunch-breaks for throwing up. 

I have been told to await questionnaires and interviews for the members of my crew from the Crew Assessment and Psychological team; no doubt to ensure we have the most competent and loyal crew. I am confident that every person shall be seen as a model comrade, and any spies will be uncovered and harshly punished.

I have been selected to undergo a psychiatric evaluation by our Crew Assessment and Psychological team. These have been told to be part of mandatory reevaluations of the current members of the crews as well as their leaders regardless of rank or seniority, and an effort to ensure loyalty, secrecy, and ultimate devotion.

I am recording this log for posterity because I have asked various department heads outside of the Crew Assessment and Psychological team, and they have stated they have received no memorandums like mine for themselves nor their crew-members.

Undoubtedly this is related to my previous critiques of the operations and clandestine nature of the Psychological team that seemed unnecessary and therefore raising questions of both ethics and adherence to non-liberal activity. 

I will continue to file my logs into the public record unlike the team that has called for my psychiatric evaluation so that it may be recorded that I have been open and honest patriot during the efforts to build-up this program. Furthermore, I hope that this record will serve as a method to bridge the divide between the rest of the teams and the Psychological team for the sake of united construction of this wonderous monument to the workers.

He remains under House Arrest with severe restriction on communication with anyone save for myself or those I sign temporary approval for.

Due to the Crew Assessment and Psychological Team‚Äôs uncovering of this agent of capitalism before he could undo the people's work, I have been voted as the new Foreman and Manager for Project *Proton-1* through a consensus of both the current workforce and general body of Directors. This is a fantastic opportunity given to me to serve the people, the workers, and the Union and I am eternally grateful for it. We shall be conducting investigations of the broader staff.

I am eternally grateful for this opportunity to become more experienced with empowering leadership roles.

The final selection of the Cosmonauts that will have the honor of manning the *Proton-1* vessel to Luna have finished, and I shall write the successful candidates down in the order of their both national origin and sister-republic location, then their names, and finally their gender:

* Russian SSR: Gusin Ustin Savelievich Male
* Ukrainian SSR: Dmytro Afanasijovych Sych Male
* Poland SSR: Szarlota Lubianska Female
* Hungarian SSR: Katona Kamilla Female

Our intention was to select a diverse crew to exemplify the breaking down of national and ethnic barriers to show that all peoples may work and triumph together, but there was never consideration for also promoting the Marxist ideal of gender equality and the liberation of women. This is a welcome surprise and list of accomplished Cosmonauts that serve the empowerment of unity, stability, and the peoples. 

The failed candidates, who were still exceptionally talented, will be retained on the premises with a communication-blackout for outside Project contact for the sake of maintaining the secrecy of the Luna mission. They shall be added to the overall potential replacement index should any issue befall our current selection of Cosmonauts. They shall additionally receive commendation after mission success for their dedication, confidence, and skill despite their preliminary rejection.

I was severely mistaken about the integrity of the infiltrators I had first considered as fellow comrades and workers. Slightly over half of my departments original staff have been removed and subject to house arrest until after the completion and successful mission of Project * Proton-1*. The nefarious and clandestine abilities of these imperialist spies are great, but in the end even these skilled persons have been purged before they may harm the Project. 

I also thank the leadership for maintaining a vast list of potential replacements for all staff, including my own department of course. The original intention was to have available manpower should a comrade be injured, fall ill, or become burned out by the intense pressure of working for the benefit of all the Union.

These replacements act differently than the former saboteur-staff. They are predominately silent and keep to themselves. They take rest and meal breaks with all of their fellow comrades, but they say little to nothing at all. I appreciate that this new staff seems to understand the importance of the task before them, their social sacrifice for repairing any sabotage by the spies, and dedication to labor without giving into unnecessary distractions. I cannot wait for this Project to be finished so that I may fully come to know these magnificent comrades, and celebrate our accomplishments together. 

Additionally, much more vodka has been supplied, that of which I am also grateful.

The shuttle has been completed far ahead of schedule and is a testament to the power and ingenuity of the unifying Marxist-Leninist ideology, as well as the immense efforts undertaken by the present staff.

The training of the Cosmonauts will soon be completed; all that remains is rebriefing on the mission, education on its importance, and being shown the location of medical supplies and how to engage non-obvious redundant systems. Given the effort put forth by the engineering team, I have no doubt that the selected and talented Cosmonauts shall also complete their final conditioning ahead of schedule. 

Given these unexpected but welcomed developments, the launch of the *Proton-1* shuttle has been drastically pulled to a much earlier date, the previously intended date being July 17, 1969.

Upon return of the shuttle and the other Cosmonauts, the Cosmodrome 3 shall be renamed in her honor and the Politburo will discuss and selection additional monuments to this heroic Cosmonaut of unparalleled ability before being ruthlessly assassinated by cowardly imperialist agents. 

Due to the compromising nature of these previous developments and hard evidence of their perpetration, I shall enact another cycle of investigations, interrogations, and ultimately purge of these newer dissident infiltrators. The direct perpetrator will be summarily executed soon after capture, their fate sealed due to the severity of their crime against our Comrades and the Motherland.

We have lost contact with the *Proton-1* vessel due to an unexpected, sudden, and devastating Solar Flare that was followed by a Coronal Mass Ejection. Despite a loss of contact due to communication equipment disruption, we still have the ability to track the vessel and it appears that this event and possible damaged guidance equipment has caused the vessel to divert from its planned route. 

Several calculations have been made, recalculated hundreds of times, and the projections have all been grim and alarming. Current calculations of the projected trajectory of *Proton-1* following this disruption and diversion have concluded that the most likely outcome is that *Proton-1*, and our brave Cosmonauts, shall pass around Luna and will be swung around by its gravity and their speed to a new course that will forcibly shoot the craft outside of the Solar System. Into the greatest unknown, the farthest beyond. 

This tragedy is only known certain members of the Communications Department, and the highest ranking authorities.
 
There is no sabotage involved in this tragedy, I am sure of it. Every system, every algorithm, every redundant system, and almost every possible potential mishap gave the impression of a flawless craft, mission, crew, and systems. All was prepared for but the damned Sun. 

I take morbid peace with the knowledge that we placed more than necessary cyanide capsules in their medical supplies and informing them of that. We never thought they would need them whilst traversing the Cosmos, but rather if their return landing catastrophically failed due to the environment or their landing spot. I pray they take them soon, before the void claims them.

After a period of mourning, I have returned to my duties and responsibilities with solemn vigour with the intention of honoring these now-lost Cosmonauts and preventing anyone outside the facility from being as devastated as us by these events.

I am mandating debriefing for every single staff-member at this facility, those who frequently come-and-go, incoming railway and automobile delivery persons, and even to the dust in the lost Comrades‚Äô forevermore empty bunks. This debriefing will include, but is not limited to and subject to alterations, the following measures:

* No celebrations or acknowledgements of any national or personal holidays (Including birthdays, successful workday celebration, and more) until an appropriate time of mourning and respect, with duration not yet determined, has passed after the recording of this log. 

* No staff, including replacements and staff who do not have knowledge of this tragedy are prevented from leaving until adequate measures have been taken to ensure that they will not divulge this catastrophe to anyone after being allowed to return to their homes. 
* * This includes a ban on speaking in any capacity on this matter outside of this facility, even with staff members in any future setting or situation. 

* Grief counseling shall be offered to all mourners who require additional support from their fellow comrades in coming to terms with these awful events. 

* * Such offerings shall be conducted by members of the Admissions and Psychological Team in their respective annex. This available for all staff, for any time so-long as it is scheduled with their reception office.

* Speaking to them about the incident is permitted, even after all staff are permitted to return home with the understanding that both situations are subject to confidential records of each session. 

* Excessive drunkenness is prohibited during the mourning, and is no excuse for violation.

* * One‚Äôs excessive drunkenness will up to the judgement of NKVD agents, Red Army guards, and fellow staff members; any report by staff members will remain anonymous to the accused. 

* Religious services will be offered in the soon-to-be-constructed Orthodox chapel on the Launchpad, where a permanent vigil will be set up as well as a monument to the lost Cosmonauts courage and sacrifice. 

* Logs henceforth submitted by any department or individual are subject to immediate review.

I cannot contain my grief for this tragedy. I feel wholly responsible for this outcome, for not taking all the necessary precautions I should have accounted for to ensure the full-safety of the brave Cosmonauts. 

I have been assured that there is no suspected sabotage that rendered any equipment nor system on the *Proton-1* more vulnerable to this Solar Flare. They also inform me that every aspect of the shuttle was in better than expected, and almost perfect, quality and ability. This has not softened the pain, and rather it has enhanced it. No outside sabotage, no noticeable system issues. I have no comfort in at least believing any sabotage was beyond my control. A lack of notable system, craft, or equipment issues only means that the possible many that existed were not noticed and therefore my unintended negligence must be to blame. 

Though I am a devout Socialist, and did everything in my ability to ensure the success of this mission, I have still failed and shamed my workers and comrades

*(Note: The following record was not a piece of the original recorded log, but it‚Äôs tone, timing, and references indicate it was written immediately after or during the log it is attached to. This is the first personal writing provided by the defectors.)*

I cannot decide how to achieve some measure of salvation through penance for this disaster. I may turn myself in to the KGB agents, but the process of receiving comfort from just punishment would be long and arduous without increasing any feeling of solace for my dreadful crimes against these Cosmonauts. I have also considered suicide as an honor-preserving option, punishing myself in the most powerful way for my transgressions. I believe it would show that I recognized my deadly blunders, and resolved to exact personal punishment rather than flee from this necessary rectification.

That is what I shall do. I will take my own life to prove my understanding of my crimes, and show I am not afraid to undergo consequences by inflicted them upon myself due to my guilt. I was provided with a ceremonial handgun, a TT-30 that is reported as taking fascist lives in the conquest of Berlin, and I shall ensure it takes the life of one more monster. 

I shall do it soon as well, before the projected date of May 26 for when the Cosmonauts shall be hurdled into the cosmic abyss.

Additional regulations have been adopted in the wake of the newer coping methods used by staff and directors. These regulations apply retroactively to any perpetrators who acted in defiance of these new regulations before they were adopted: 

* Taking one‚Äôs own life will see reduced labor vouchers for the suicidal staffs‚Äô family.

* Excessive alcohol consumption is permitted, provided one does it after 18:00, is in the presence of no more than two other staff members of similar inebriation as well as at least one sober staff member.

I began receiving signals from what initially appeared to be an unknown object from beyond the inner orbits of the solar system one hour ago at 02:00. I had initially believed this was some reflective space debris or potential incoming meteor, due to it perfectly mimicking our departments cosmic detection broadcasts. 

At 03:00, the identity of this object became fully clear as it is travelling along the planned and intended return path, almost flawlessly, of our Luna shuttle. It is *Proton-1* returning home. 

I will alert my superiors. This anomaly should not have occured.

I do plan on building my own PC as soon as I can afford it, but being in college that may be a little ways away. 

Anyway, the specs that I think I need would be 1080p, 60Hz at the minimum. A fully adjustable stand would also be nice, but anything else I'm lenient on. I'm looking into the price range of $150 - $250.

I really like the look of Dell professional monitors, just because they are very sleek with thin bezels and have a fully adjustable stand on as well.

I'm a recent college graduate who has 2 work options and I'm having a hard time choosing between them:

* Option 1: Full time offer from Moody's Analytics Knowledge Center as a Junior Investment Research Analyst. 

* Option 2: 6 Months Internship from KraftHeinz in their Finance Department, which will later CAN become a Trainee Full Time (once a Trainee you will 100% develop into a permanent position after 1 year). So it would look like this Graduate - Intern (6 months) - Trainee (1 year) - Full time defined position.

Additional information:

* I live in Costa Rica and my goal in the next 4-5 years in to apply to a top MBA program in the US.

* I like both companies and offers, I think KraftHeinz has a bigger name but I would have to spend 6 months as an intern and the Trainee position is not guaranteed, while the Moody's offer is full time and guaranteed into the future.

* The salary discrepancy is big, the internship offers only $500 per month while the Moody's offer is around $2000 per month.

In a vacuum in which all else stays the same, which offer would you take and why? I'm hoping to hear different opinions which will make the decision clearer and easier for me.

Thank you for your time.

I‚Äôm in Canada so the universities I‚Äôll be mentioning are Canadian universities. 

For the last year I‚Äôve wanted to go away to uOttawa for school. My cousin went there and I visited and fell in love with the school. I‚Äôve always loved the idea of going away to school and everyone except my parents have told me what a good experience it is. I live in Toronto so Ottawa is pretty far. I‚Äôm considering the Software Engineering program which I got into. 

My other option is UofT. I got into Engineering Science which for those of you who dont know is a pretty hard program to get into, but its very hard. It‚Äôs two years of general engineering followed by 2 years of a specified stream. 6 courses a semester and 30-35 hours a week of classes with 20+ hours of work/assignments. The course is rigorous and I‚Äôd have to commute an hour and a half each way, every day. I did the math and it left me with 2 hours of free time per day.  I value my part time job and my social life so this is obviously a turnoff for me. 

The problem I‚Äôm facing is trying to decide on a school. To me, going away is something I really want to do because I feel like I really need that experience. I have a few friends going to Ottawa and a couple going to UofT as well. Ottawa has a mandatory co-op which would be 4 or 5 co-op terms I believe, all paid with guaranteed placement. UofT has a PEY which is an internship after third year. This is a 12-16 month internship. I‚Äôm scared for my GPA if I go to UofT and I‚Äôm scared of losing a lot of me time. However, I‚Äôm also scared of making the wrong decision by going to Ottawa and choosing a program that might be considered ‚Äúworse‚Äù by employers. 

I hate how this decision is gonna impact the rest of my life but its obviously gonna be a decision I have to make by the deadline, June 1st.

I am seriously considering applying to grad school after my undergrad. I am entering my senior year and I have done several internships at top tech companies. I've done some independent research at one of the Big 4's and the paper is currently pending publication at a conference. This paper isn't anything too significant and is the area of computer architecture/distributed systems. All my internships have been in software except for my current one which is more data science/machine learning.

I am leaning towards doing a PhD in AI/machine learning or perhaps even a PhD in Statistics in the States/top 10 AI school. I am trying to decide between two potential undergrad research projects I work on in my remaining terms before applying to grad school.

This first professor I know fairly well through an OS course and we've hit it off well during/after class. He knows that I was one of the top students in the class and is very open to me doing a research project with him. His research area is primarily in low\-level systems/OS. His alma mater for both his Master's and PhD are both at schools I'm looking at \(top 10 CS/AI grad schools\) so I believe he has many valuable connections.

I have also been in contact with another professor who's area of research is in AI/NLP/machine learning. I do not know this professor too well outside of the few times we've had conversations about a potential research project. He did his PhD at top 10 AI grad school that I am somewhat looking into.

I would probably be more interested in the work and project with professor #2. Professor #2 does not know me as well as professor #1 so I am not sure he will write as strong of a recommendation letter. Professor #1 will most probably write me a very strong recommendation letter. While he has connections to his alma mater \(schools I am interested in\), he did do his grad degrees in systems so I am unsure how much weight his letter carries relative to professor #1."

Last November, I was called in for a 'Development Intern' interview but ended up impressing them a 'bit too much' and got a permanent role as 'System Engineer' :D

I had no prior experience in any job and was just out of college. I have a CS Engineering degree.

I had a vague idea of 'Systems Engineering' as a role that works with Servers, Networks,Cloud and troubleshooting stuff. I was extremely excited to start the role, even though I was a good developer, because a truck load of people in here are developers and thought taking a different role would be better for my career. And also, I thought I can keep my coding skill sharp in the free time.

I was sure I would excel in the new role because I was a self starter, self learner and could google my way through every single issue I faced while coding. I coded my entire college project alone in 4 days in a marathon sitting session and could troubleshoot everything that came in front of me then.

Now, fast forward 6 months and turns out that 'Systems Engineer' is just a cover up name and I am basically doing 'Application support'. We have no access to the code base and namesake documentation. Worse of all, NO TRAINING AT ALL. I am unable to figure out how the application works in the first place let alone troubleshoot it in a high pressure environment. I am asked to 'shadow' my seniors and learn the stuff. But none of the seniors or even the developers who coded the damn thing have a solid idea of the application's working. Also, I don't know what to learn because you don't know a particular issue exists until it shows up.

Now, I am working basically every weekend, with night shifts and my coding skills has gone non existent. I work hard and got appreciations from the higher ups. But the thing is, I don't LOVE this stuff at all. I haven't learn anything that I can use at another job. no one cares how much I know about this particular application. I wanted to work with more general stuff on which I can learn and improve every day.


The company is cool and the pay is about decent for entry level in here. Co-workers are cool too. But, this job sucked away my passion for IT.

Is there an escape ? Should I hang on to this job ? Should I learn something else on the side and move out after a year ? Is my one year experience of no use and will I have to restart my career ? Will things get better ? I haven't faced this kinda situation before. That is why I am asking you guys.

That was the word around town for humanities students here. I hated it. It made no sense to me. I am paying a fortune for my tuition and I am putting in a lot of work into my education. Why should my career start on a lottery pick that one of my friends might land me a job that I may or may not enjoy doing? Graduate prospects didn't seem all that much brighter. For the mountainous amount of work they did, their only saving grace is if maybe they get their PhD and maybe get a job teaching. It made no sense to me.

So after completing my second year, I spent an entire summer studying math, chemistry and physics from high school (I never took them before). then I took some math, physics and cs classes at UofT and attempted CSC subject post and I failed.

So I transferred. After two years, I now have a comfortable internship position. Speaking of jobs and pay, I remember talking to a neuroscience graduate about his job. He proudly told me that he's been working with Rogers for three years, because of a friend who helped him get this job. He gets paid about 50K and emphasized how important networking is.

But here's the thing. I make 50K at my current internship. I didn't need to know anyone. I simply applied through my school's internship program, got a bunch of offers, prepared for my interview and got it... No lottery, no panic, just a decent average and a handful of unimpressive GitHub projects that I've done from my classes.

My point is this. If you are doing one of these majors that are infamous for not getting you a decent job after graduation, change it. Don't stay in it. If you know your grades aren't high enough for law or med school, don't finish it. Being obstinate and pushing through with a useless degree is only going to leave you with a lot of student loan and a buyer's remorse.

I hope you take my advice to heart and join me. In a brighter world. So that you don't make the same mistakes I did. (after all, I didn't really need two full years worth of electives)"
8mqbdv,17,2018-05-28,Duke '22 for legal studies,hey-its-the-d,collegeresults,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/8mqbdv/duke_22_for_legal_studies/,"Schools: accepted: UNC Chapel-Hill, Clemson, Fordham, Emory Oxford campus, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, and Duke. Everything was rd except Fordham and Clemson.

Waitlisted: University of Chicago, Emory main campus, Penn, and Yale

Rejected: USC (would be accepted if I took a gap year) and Harvard

Financial aid: Full ride to Chapel-Hill through FA and merit scholarships, 20k scholarship to Clemson, 1/4 tuition for Johns Hopkins, half ride to Duke through FA and a merit scholarship.

Demographics: Biracial female (white/Jamaican), from NC, low-income public school

Intended major: legal studies

ACT: 33 (34 superscore)

SAT II: 1500

Class rank: 7/185

UW/W GPA: 3.9, 4.8

Coursework: So far, I've taken APUSH (4), AP Govt &amp; Politics (5), Calc AB (4), English Lang (5), and took English Lit, Psych, and Statistics this year. Mostly honors classes my freshman and sophomore year and mostly AP the last two years.

Awards: Duke TIP Summer Studies Participation Award (2014-2016), North Carolina Scholar (2015-2017), Junior Marshal (2016-2017), VIZ Program Award Recipient (2016-2017; this is a local community service award), AP Scholar with Distinction (2017), Coca-Cola Scholars Semifinalist (2017). I've received two state titles with my cross country team and several all-state awards for indoor/outdoor track as well.

Extracurriculars: 
Taking pictures for my dad's photography business - helped to take pictures at winter sporting venues and manage new employees 

Internship at Daughters of the American Revolution - internship through dad's photo business; assisted DAR members with utilizing tablets to buy pictures; took pictures at state dinners and assisting with camera work

Duke Talent Identification Program - talent search program; admits students based on performance on the SAT or ACT in their 7th grade year; received state recognition for SAT score in 2013 and received awards for participation in Summer Studies from 2013-2016

Church youth group - North Carolina representative for my youth group; been involved in the organization since 2012; became the church youth group leader in 2015; organized fundraisers and benefits for the church and to help low-income youth group members afford to attend regional events

Varsity track and cross country - team captain for outdoor track and sprinting team captain; won several regional and state awards in both sports

Essays: I spent a painfully long time on my essays, each having multiple proofreaders. I'm not sure if this is done for every accepted applicant, but when I got into Duke, the Dean sent a card along with my application telling me that my CA essay was one of his favorites. I wrote my Common App essay on my life being a metaphor for Plato's Cave, and how, as time went on and I experienced more of the world, I discovered what ""true"" success was as opposed to the ""shadows"" of success.

Overall, I would categorize myself as an average applicant to top schools. I initially didn't expect to get into any of the top schools I applied to, because on paper, there was nothing really remarkable in my application. However, I think what helped me was that I showed a lot of commitment in my extracurriculars, having been involved in most of them for years, and my essays were well-written. I would encourage anyone to get advice from their parents and multiple teachers when writing essays, while making sure you have a clear message you want to portray to the school. 

Also, coming from a low-income area, I noticed that most people either went to community college or straight to work. Most of my friends, some of whom were above me in class rank, only applied to state/safety schools. Most people didn't apply to T20s because they didn't think they could get in, which I feel is a harmful mindset. If you think you're an ""average"" applicant (like myself), then I strongly encourage you to apply to top schools. I never would have guessed I would have ended up at Duke and I was even more surprised when I saw the amount of money they had given (my family makes about 200k a year so we were anticipating no financial aid). 

If I had this process to do over again, the only thing I would have done differently would be to apply to comparable ivies instead of Johns Hopkins and Northwestern -- as I feel like I would have gotten better financial aid had I been accepted.

For some context: I am a US citizen. I was born in the US but was raised in the Philippines so I have dual citizenship. I opted to go to university here since my family lives here and it was cheaper compared to US universities. I want to get a job in the US when I graduate in 2 years. I figured that if I get an internship in the US it will be easier to get a full time job there. 


From what I've seen here in the subreddit, companies will fly you out for an on-site after some phone screens. However, since I am living far away, I am wondering how would that work out for me. Flying out would be too much of a hassle for me because my university only allows a limited number of absences. It would also cost too much for me if the company would not pay for my flight. Are there companies that give an option to just do a skype-interview?¬†How would I tell them about my situation?

I have been lurking this sub for a while, and seen that there are many helpful suggestions that people share here, so I decided to try my luck, maybe you guys can help/encourage/suggest something.

Im just finishing my MA in East Asian Studies, my BA was International Relations, Im from Hungary, I speak Hungarian and English fluently, I have studied Japanese and Spanish to B2 level but Im forgetting them nowadays, as I focus on Chinese (its also on B2 level currently).

I plan to go back to China to study the language there for one more year in order to be able to work with it. I will need to find a job during that time there, otherwise I will have to come back to Hungary, where Im doubtful that I will find a decent job utilizing Chinese language.

I tried thinking hard what kind of job I would enjoy doing, and the three things that keep popping up in my mind are event management, sales and marketing. During my studies I had two HR internships at multinational companies but I realized that I would never enjoy HR.

I regret not doing an economics/business degree, but at the same time I feel that I would never have learned and experienced so many things that my majors led me to. 

This way however, Im terrified that my lack of sales/marketing studies/experience will kick me in the butt, and I wont have a chance to get any entry level job in the areas I could imagine myself as they all advertise themselves requiring these.

What do you guys think about my situation? How can I improve my chances in the next year before Im finished with studying at universities?

On top of that, are there any resources for me to try and find last minute internship or part time job opportunities?

Side note: I got an offer to intern for a tech company, but would basically be entering in data to Excel the whole summer. I know, super fun. I could try to automate the data input with Python or something similar and that could be a cool learning experience and takeaway. Either way, Would it be fine to take that internship? Also, I am waiting to hear back from like 2\-3 other companies, but those chances are pretty slim. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.

TLDR: I'm an idiot and didn't start applying to internships early enough. What are my options?

Edit: I did get opportunities to intern for companies in Houston and Philadelphia, but I wanted to be home for first summer of college, as I plan on staying in SF the next couple of summers."

What makes me nervous is that I don't know what to expect from the interview. I know that if I have to learn new stuff I will learn it effectively, as I always did, but if he asks me to do something at the moment on R or Excel, or asks me some kind of ""What would you do in X situation?"" then that would be awkward.

8mvdav,1,2018-05-28,I don't know what I should do in this scenario,aFrustratedDev,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8mvdav/i_dont_know_what_i_should_do_in_this_scenario/,"I am going to keep a lot of things pretty vague for my own anonymity  

I want to know if this is a good idea to quit or not

First and foremost, by quit, I mean to start looking for jobs behind my companies back.

Backstory, I started a Software Development internship very recently, and the stipulation is that I have to finish my degree to get the higher wage I had asked for. I have at least 6 months more before I finish school. I am not a CS major btw, I self taught myself code.

I get paid $15/hr, but because of various reasons I only am allowed to work 30 hours within a week. My biggest issue is that really more than anything. 

Doing the math, 15 x 30 == 450

but 450/40 is 11.25, which is above minimum wage, but not by a whole lot, and I made much more than this in my previous profession.  

This probably would bother me less, but along with this I must do school full time, and the job while yes is a 30 hour week, I often spend 35\-50 hours to get my work done, and this does not factor my school work in, and because of the lower pay this just demotivates me. I am still a junior dev, but I feel like to some extent I am undervalued because I clearly can do the job, and no joke it is a hard job, but doing all of this keeps me 2 money catastrophes away from being able to pay my bills vs. not being able to. 

I do like most of my co\-workers, and love the company atmosphere, and I do appreciate that the company is gave me this opportunity, but to a large extent, I feel highly undervalued. At the same time I don't want to appear disloyal to other companies by jumping ship. Also finding new jobs is a bit of a bitch at my experience just because getting your foot in the door is really difficult. 

Anyway, tell me your thoughts people"

8mvy7u,27,2018-05-28,My suicide note,PKMNtrainerKing,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8mvy7u/my_suicide_note/,"Today I am going to hang myself

Before I finally step into that noose to finally achieve peace, I‚Äôd like to first record exactly why I want to end my life so badly. A simple suicide note about my depression just doesn‚Äôt do my tragic life the justice it deserves. So, here I am, half drunk and half high on my medication, sitting in front of my monitor typing away at my keyboard. Each letter I type brings me one letter closer to my death, which brings me comfort. Anyway, I‚Äôve dragged this out a bit too long, so I‚Äôll tell you my story.

We had gone out to get a sandwich at our favorite little place downtown as we did every Saturday for lunch. This week she paid because I had only about $12 in my checking account. Caroline was my best friend, we had been that way ever since freshman year of University. We were mere months from graduation at this point, and we wanted to make every day last before she leaves for Atlanta, Georgia for her internship at CNN. It has always been her dream to be a reporter, as she always felt passionate about honest journalism, which she tells me died some time ago. She was always a dreamer, but what I admired most about her was the fact that she was actively pursuing her dreams. She didn‚Äôt wait around and live a mundane life, hoping for some stroke of dumb luck to magically knock on her door like many already do. Make no mistake, however, we never dated. We discussed it, actually, and concluded that we didn‚Äôt want to be a couple. Our relationship was‚Ä¶ different. As beautiful and sweet as she was, I simply couldn‚Äôt date her. I never felt that way about her. Neither of us had significant others. Occasionally we would go on dates with other people but nothing long term ever evolved.
We finished our meal and hopped back into my old F150. It started up with a cough and died, which was a common occurrence. I tried again and it came to life with a death-defying roar, almost as if to say ‚Äúnot today.‚Äù It was 1pm right about then, it took 20 minutes to get back to her house. I lived only a few minutes away, in a single-bedroom apartment. Her parents had built the house for her, as she came from some significant wealth, but insistent on being independent she now supports herself fully. Mortgage payments, student loans, Carline was completely self-sufficient. She had everything going for her. 

Traffic was light, so I thought maybe it would only take 15 minutes. Anyway, we had been in the car for about 10 minutes and a song came on the radio, one I did not recognize. I looked at the radio to see the title, and I could not have looked down for more than a quarter of a second, and when I looked up a large black SUV had run a stop sign at a 3-way intersection. In that moment time slowed down to almost a standstill. Caroline‚Äôs face was still calm, the way it was, for her mind had not yet processed what was coming. I watched the front of my truck crunch against the left side of the SUV and I felt a huge thrust of forward momentum on my body. Caroline was ejected from her seat. It was at the moment of impact I realized she was not restrained by a seatbelt, so I was forced to watch her head go through my windshield. Time began to speed up again at this point, and I watched in real time the SUV slide into the oncoming lane, my truck being thrown in the opposite direction, and Caroline‚Äôs body flying through the air. I swear she must have gone 50 yards before her head finally bounced off of the ground. Her scream as she soared was something I cannot stop hearing in my head, it was filled with pain and fear. Countless times have we seen horror movies together, have we prank-scared each other, and been on roller coaster rides together. None of the screams I‚Äôve heard from her, or from anybody, could possibly compare to what I heard that afternoon. Her scream was one that knew it came from someone‚Äôs final breath. It echoed between my ears, and if I shut my eyes I can hear it all over again. Nothing has ever made me feel the way I did in that moment. My throat was tight, filled completely by the heart that must have skipped a beat or two. Breathing went from an automatic process to a chore, as I struggled to get even the smallest amount of air in. 

The moment her head bounced off of the asphalt the screaming came to an immediate stop. Then all I could hear was my own heartbeat. I watched her lift her arm with agonizing slowness, trying to grab on to something. Anything. Then it flopped down, and her chest stopped rising. I watched her die, right there in the middle of the street. My legs were pinned, I felt overwhelming helplessness and then everything went black. I came to on a gurney being rushed through a hospital with a doctor holding one of those breath-mask-pump thingies against my face. You know what I‚Äôm talking about, right? Anyway, I saw that for about 3 seconds and I fell back into unconsciousness. I slipped into a coma.

I awoke laying in a lush, green field with a hill before me. There was nothing else but a clear blue sky above me. No trees, nor bushes, just green for miles in all directions. On top of the hill was my house, the house I had grown up in. I stood up and walked towards it, longing for something familiar. In that moment, I had forgotten about the crash. That moment was short lived, however, when the house exploded in a fiery display of what I could only assume was the Devil himself. Caroline‚Äôs body flew from the house, the same way it was thrown from my truck. She screamed the exact same way she did on that day, but it seemed to last longer this time. She landed only a few yards in front of me, still clinging to life by a thread. I went to run to her but there was a second explosion where the house was, and I saw her body do as it did seconds before. It too landed a few yards in front of me, but the first body was gone. I stopped moving after a few more times but it just kept happening anyway. I laid on the ground and covered my ears, clenching my teeth, and squeezing my eyelids shut tight. It happened over and over more times than I could count and I sobbed into the grass until I fell asleep.

I woke again in bed, but not my bed. Just‚Ä¶ a bed. I did not recall what had happened the day before, this version of me was living as he always did. In this reality, I lived in this house with my girlfriend, Caroline. Yes, the same Caroline, the one I said I didn‚Äôt want to have as a girlfriend. I cannot explain to you why my subconscious created this reality, but I digress. She was in the kitchen making pancakes for the two of us. We ate breakfast and talked like we always did. The conversations we had during this experience are hazy, I think my mind just told me You guys are having a conversation right now, even if what we said was pure gibberish. You know what I mean? Like my mind just kinda convinced me that this happened or something, I can‚Äôt be sure. But I remember feeling happiness whenever I saw her or talked to her. I was truly in love with Caroline, and one day I proposed to her. It‚Äôs as if my actions in this reality were predestined, because it felt as though my body did all of this on its own, without instruction from my brain. Well, my brain as in the brain of the fictional me that my real brain created. She said yes and practically tackled me with excitement. My mind skipped to our wedding day, we were in this church out in Oakland Hills, this small town about 20 miles from her home in Tennessee. We both invited our entire families, which was relatively small. It was a crowd of about 30 people total, but it was perfect. Her blonde hair cascaded down her shoulders like a waterfall of beauty. The way she curled it made her look absolutely gorgeous. We finally said ‚ÄúI do‚Äù and that was that, we were married.

We honeymooned in Honolulu, where she always dreamed of travelling to. We stayed there for a week, and it was there that she became pregnant with my daughter. We never asked the doctor if it was a boy or a girl, I just somehow knew. Throughout this entire experience, I had never considered that this reality was false, a figment of my imagination. My brain was powerful enough to create an entire world for me to live in but was not powerful enough to alter it at will. We decided to name her Elise, after her mother. I had never felt happiness quite like I did the day Elise was born. It was truly a unique experience that I can never relive, holding your first-born child in your arms. I loved her so much, both Caroline and Elise. 
They became my entire world, I would spend all of my spare time either with my wife or my new daughter. They were my best friends, and I would die for them. I remember the first day of preschool for Elise. I set her down so she could run into her classroom, she took a few steps, turned back around and gave me a big hug goodbye. I was so proud of her in that moment that I damn near cried. I went to sleep that night content; my life was perfect. When I woke up in the morning I was standing in the same field I was on the first day, but something was different. I was surrounded by people. My family. And Caroline‚Äôs family. They were all dressed in black, standing around a casket in a horseshoe formation. I couldn‚Äôt find Caroline. I asked Elise where mommy was and she looked at me and told me ‚ÄúYou said she was in a better place, daddy.‚Äù I choked up, and I stood motionless as her body was lowered into the ground. Her mother came up to me and said ‚ÄúYou killed her. You killed my daughter.‚Äù Her face had no expression. No anger, no pain, it was as if she was merely stating a fact. That was the most painful part of it, there was no malice in anybody‚Äôs voice. Nobody looked upset with me for any reason, but one by one they all blamed me. They all told me how much they hated me for taking Caroline from them. When Elise told me she would never forgive me I collapsed, I could not move from that spot. I sobbed until my head hurt and my nose bled from sniffling so often. Everybody gathered around me in silence. I heard murmurs among the people attending the funeral that slowly became louder. One shouted ‚ÄúHey he‚Äôs waking up!‚Äù and another yelled ‚ÄúSomebody go get the doctor!‚Äù I blacked out.

In that instant I woke up in a hospital bed surrounded by my family and Caroline‚Äôs family, at least our immediate families. They told me about what happened, about the accident and her death. Her funeral was 3 days after the accident, she was buried with a photo of me in her hands. I began to sob uncontrollably. I could not stop apologizing to Caroline‚Äôs mother, but she just hugged me and told me it wasn‚Äôt my fault. She forgave me. From what I was told, corrective surgery fixed my legs to 100% functionality, and my coma lasted 6 months. My parents and Caroline‚Äôs parents came by every day at 6 pm to check on me, right after work. Sometimes they stayed about 10 minutes, other times they spent the night in my room. My mother didn‚Äôt leave the room for 11 solid days when I was admitted into the hospital. They had to bring one of those plastic toilet seat things for her because she refused to move. I met with a therapist a day later and told him everything. He told me I was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, it was very bad. I was still trying to cope with the fact that the life I had lived for almost 5 years was nothing but a hoax, a cruel illusion created by my mind.

I was allowed to go home yesterday, so today marks 4 days that I‚Äôve been awake now. I drank myself to sleep last night, and now I‚Äôm kind sober. I have a beer at my desk that‚Äôs half finished now, and 7 other empty bottles on the floor. I don‚Äôt care. All that‚Äôs left to do is figure out how to attach a noose to something from my wheelchair (remember how I haven‚Äôt walked in 6 months? Surgery was successful but I still need physical therapy). I‚Äôll never be able to cope with reality, I‚Äôll never be normal again, and I‚Äôll never be able to get the sound of her screaming out of my mind. This is my last moment on earth.

I was able to throw the rope over the ceiling fan, now I can secure the end of it to my door or something.

I‚Äôve got a stool set up underneath the fan. Once I finish this I‚Äôm gonna lift myself out of my wheelchair onto the stool, put my brand-new necktie on, and tip the stool over.

8mw4j6,7,2018-05-28,I think I want to switch majors...please talk me out of it.,SmoothVadr24,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/8mw4j6/i_think_i_want_to_switch_majorsplease_talk_me_out/,"Warning this is going to be a long r/self style post looking for advice, I hope you all can indulge me.

I currently just finished up my freshman year in computer science. This summer I was gunning for an internship \(I didn't get it because they found people that already learned the language so they didn't need me to learn the language\), however I needed to learn ruby on rails and this is where roadblocks started and doubt started to set in. This was my first time learning a language on my own, and I struggle to find the motivation to keep at it. I currently know C,C\+\+, and Java, so webdev was definitely something new to me. This to me seemed to show a deeper problem, the fact that I struggle to/can't find the motivation to learn a new language means that I \(probably won't succeed in this industry\). Along with this, I was looking over throughout the year and I realized that my favorite assignments for my CS class were the topics that required little actual computer science knowledge: a research project on the way the internet effected music creation/consumption \(a musicological/sociological/historical project, but definetly not a technical one\). Add to that the ""Hackathon"" at my university was something I really enjoyed, except it was much more of a business exercise than a technical one \(we just had to pitch an idea for a technical solution to a problem w/o actually doing the implementation\). It was all this along with the idea that I don't do side projects. I don't code outside of class. Will this lack of want to code outside of class hurt me in the long run? Given some research on line and the couple of interviews I had for internships this summer \(the topics of personal projects came up as a question in all 3 of my interviews\), that does seem to be the case. I do enjoy math and the theory of computer science, but I struggle to find the want to code and work on personal projects outside of class. Let me be clear, I have achieved A's in all my computer science classes this past year, however I'm just not sure if this is really the field for me. I want to work in cryptography, but after finding I don't enjoy webdev, I'm not sure that would be the most viable career choice for me. I was thinking about changing majors to EE since as I've gone up the abstraction chain of languages I've enjoyed them less \(my favorite language I've coded in so far being C\). Have any of you guys ever felt this way, and how did you overcome it? Did you switch majors, or was there some class that you took that rekindled your love, and affirmed your own position in this field? I don't enjoy coding as a hobby, and I'm afraid by the time I graduate the market will not be tolerant of someone who sees CS as a 9 to 5 job, and nothing more.

TL;DR I don't feel I can survive in this field \(despite enjoying maths and attaining high marks in my CS classes and actually enjoying my intro to comp theory class\) because I don't have the innate passion to learn new languages and technologies.

Edit: word choice

Edit2:I don't want to change majors \(hence the title\). since I believe that there was some innate reason I chose this field. That being said recently I've had the feelings that this might not be for me and I should switch to EE or econ. "
8mwdx0,0,2018-05-29,"Advice Needed: Attend bootcamp or hold out and keep applying? (Two degrees, one in IT)",old-new-programmer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8mwdx0/advice_needed_attend_bootcamp_or_hold_out_and/,"Hi, 

I have asked some questions here before and admittedly, I think they were out of desperation. I got basically very negative feedback and it was probably deserved. 

I am asking for advice from those that have maybe in the same situation. 

Background: 

I have two degrees: a BA in Psychology and a BS in IT. My IT degree, which I just wrapped up this month (3.74 gpa), allowed me to basically pick either a more traditional IT track or a programming track, I chose to take programming courses, specifically all the Java courses (except one of them), web dev. courses (too basic to really have learned anything), and a C# course, which I really liked as it was the most challenging course I took, but really drove home OOP. 

Currently, I tutor on Wyzant as a Java tutor. I have helped all sorts of students from middle school to graduate school. I wasn't sure if I would be a good tutor because of my limited background, but I actually think I am a decent tutor and I selfishly use the experience to drive home concepts for myself. 

Previously, I have done everything from sales to managed a restaurant. My resume link is here:
https://imgur.com/a/obMqJiV

My resume was crafted over about five months with a Hiring Manager from a Tech company here in Colorado. 

I WAS getting at least some emails back and or calls from recruiters, but it has really gone no where lately. I tried to get internships while in school and no one would give me the time of day. 

I am currently using Wyzant and Instacart to fund my life. It feels like such a bummer to have to continue to ""hustle"" when I have skills that I feel like I could apply to a company, but I get that this is the game in tech. 

Where I think I am going: 

I have been accepted into the Thinkful bootcamp. My thinking with Thinkful, is they have connections in the Denver and Boulder area and they guarantee a job or money back. I would actually like to learn JS as the language is one that I struggle with, but I also think I would be able to do fairly well in the boot camp given my prior background. During admissions test, they basically had me use psuedo code to describe a Stack, which they were calling a ""List"". I didn't struggle at all and the guy was like ""Oh wow, yeah that was nothing for you, you are good to go,"" leading me to believe I could succeed there fairly easily. 

I have applied to roughly 70 jobs in Colorado. I have really only been concentrating on staying in my state. At the moment, I would really love to stay here. If Thinkful can get me a job here, I could care less of how much it costs me or how much I'd have to give back to them. I just need someone to believe in me. 

If you were me, would you keep applying, keep hustling, and hopefully something will eventually come together or would you try to get more education?  

TLDR: Two degrees, technical is a BS in IT, but took all programming courses. Thinking about attending Thinkful bootcamp. Advice needed. Resume: https://imgur.com/a/obMqJiV

Sophomore here, majoring in Computer Science. Mainly looking for full stack/front-end/back-end work for the summer, but am willing to do IT, too.

In terms of languages, I am knowledgeable in:

(c) Python
(d) C

I would prefer entry-level or an internship with the above as I want to work my way up.

In terms of IT-related skills, I have extensive knowledge in all things Window (this includes Windows Vista, XP, 7, 8, or 10). I have worked with Microsoft tools for a couple of years (Word, Excel, Office, Powerpoint).

I mainly focus on software, rather than hardware-related work.

I‚Äôm a very communicative person, I‚Äôve done customer support for a few years and loved every minute of it. I‚Äôm a team-player while also having the capability to work on my own. Just a desperate college student in need of work to fill my time, but note that I won‚Äôt waste yours.

And if you have any recommendations as to other places I could look, or things to look out for, please do let me know. I am really trying to put myself out there.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the navigator,‚Äù Andy replied flatly, ‚ÄúYou tell me.‚Äù

Cynthia grunted. ‚ÄúI swear to God, Mike, if you say we‚Äôre lost and we wind up in a creepy cabin in the woods and getting picked off one by one‚Ä¶‚Äù

Mike fiddled with his phone. ‚ÄúRelax. I‚Äôm just kidding. We‚Äôre almost there.‚Äù

I wrapped an arm around Cynthia‚Äôs shoulders and pulled her close to me. ‚ÄúWell I can‚Äôt imagine a more romantic way to die than slowly being dismembered by my favorite person on earth.‚Äù

‚ÄúAww babe,‚Äù she cooed.

Mike craned his neck back to look at us. ‚ÄúUhhh, he meant *me*.‚Äù

Cynthia kicked his seat as hard as she could.

I could hear the annoyance in Andy‚Äôs voice as he replied, ‚ÄúSettle down, kids.‚Äù

The three of us answered in unison, ‚ÄúOkay, dad.‚Äù

He sighed and rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúI should just leave you all on the side of the road.‚Äù

‚ÄúTake the next left,‚Äù said Mike, ‚ÄúNot me, though, right? You‚Äôd never get rid of me!‚Äù

Andy grunted. ‚Äú*Especially* you.‚Äù

Mike let out a whimper. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hurt. I thought we had something special. All those late night cram sessions‚Ä¶‚Äù

The car turned left, onto a narrow gravel path.

‚ÄúYou mean the nights *I* spent studying and *you* spent getting drunk in my dorm room hiding from your creepy roommate,‚Äù Andy replied.

‚ÄúHey! I‚Äôm not creepy!‚Äù I shouted.

Mike cackled. ‚ÄúHA HA. Buuuuuuuurn!‚Äù He stretched in satisfaction and settled back into his seat. ‚ÄúJust keep going straight. The parking lot should be at the end of this road.‚Äù

Mike closed his map app and switched to social media. My phone dinged. I‚Äôd been tagged in a post. ‚ÄòOVERNIGHT CAMPING TRIP WITH THESE LOZERS‚Äô. All caps. Losers spelled with a ‚ÄòZ‚Äô. Classic Mike. Cynthia‚Äôs phone dinged seconds later. She looked at the screen, and then at me.

She winked. ‚ÄúI got this.‚Äù

She kicked Mike‚Äôs seat again. He toppled forward a little bit, then settled back in the seat and chuckled.

Andy pulled up to a slightly wider gravel area. ‚ÄúThis looks about right.‚Äù 

There were a few cars there already, half on the gravel and half on the grass. One of them was so caked in fallen leaves, I couldn‚Äôt see inside. It must have gotten caught in the storm a few days before. I remembered having to peel leaves off my own car in the morning. Of course, it hadn‚Äôt helped I parked right under a maple tree. My mistake.

We got out of the car and grabbed our camping gear.

‚ÄúGot everything?‚Äù asked Andy.

Mike lifted a case of beer. ‚ÄúEverything that matters!‚Äù

I checked the back seat to make sure I hadn‚Äôt forgotten anything.

‚ÄúOk, so where‚Äôs the campsite?‚Äù asked Cynthia.

Andy looked around. ‚ÄúThere should be a trail somewhere around here.‚Äù

I closed the car door and joined the three by the hood. I looked for the trail, but, since the ground was covered in leaves, nothing stood out. It‚Äôs hard to find the one dirt path when there‚Äôs a blanket of red and yellow all over the place.

Mike pointed towards an opening in the trees. ‚ÄúThere!‚Äù

Cynthia quirked a brow. ‚ÄúAre you *sure* that‚Äôs the trail? Shouldn‚Äôt there be a sign?‚Äù

Mike shrugged. ‚ÄúMight have blown away in that storm this week. The wind was so strong, my umbrella flipped THREE times walking from the library to the social sciences building!‚Äù

Andy turned towards him. ‚ÄúWait. What were *you* doing in the social sciences building?‚Äù

Mike turned redder than a tomato dipped in tomato sauce. ‚ÄúUh. I. Um. I like the fen shui of their study hall?‚Äù

Cynthia snickered. ‚Äú‚ÄôOl Mikey over here has a crush on the barista working there.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt say,‚Äù murmured Andy.

I could see the cogs in Andy‚Äôs head start to turn.

Mike waved his arms dismissively. ‚ÄúI-it‚Äôs more of a mutual understanding and respect for the art of coffee!‚Äù He took a few steps towards the treeline. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really not important. What‚Äôs important is setting up camp before dark. Come on, I‚Äôm sure this is the way.‚Äù

Cynthia grunted. ‚ÄúWe are *soooooo* getting murdered, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù

We followed Mike because, honestly? Even if no one was sure he knew the way, no one else wanted to take the lead and be wrong. Mike was an easy scapegoat. We figured we‚Äôd double back to the car if he led us down the wrong path and make him wear the proverbial cone of shame for the rest of the trip. It‚Äôd be a great team-building exercise. Unfortunately, it looked like he was right, because after trudging along for half an hour, we came across a clearing.

‚ÄúWell, well, well, look who *didn‚Äôt* lead you right into the arms of an axe murderer?‚Äù Mike asked proudly.

‚ÄúThis is your greatest achievement yet, Mikey,‚Äù I replied.

The clearing was surrounded by tall pine trees which, based on the amount of pine needles on the ground, hadn‚Äôt fared much better in the storm than their non-coniferous brethren. There were two tents around the site. I assumed the muddiest and‚Ä¶uh, pine-needleliest‚Ä¶one belonged to the driver of the truck covered in leaves. There was a large fire pit in the middle of the site with a still roaring fire and a few logs stacked in a circle around it. If the other campers were around, they didn‚Äôt bother to say hello.

""Man, these are some messy sons of bitches,"" Mike said loudly.

He motioned to a few piles of ash and come discarded pieces of clothing scattered around the site.

Cynthia set her gear down and started sweeping pine needles with her foot. ‚ÄúCould be worse. Could be pee jugs.‚Äù

Mike shuddered at the thought.

Andy started unloading the tent. ‚ÄúWe might fill some tonight.‚Äù

Mike‚Äôs face drained of color. ‚ÄúAre you serious? Do you know how disgusting that is?‚Äù He gagged. ‚ÄúNope. Not going there. Change of subject. Cynthia, how‚Äôs school?‚Äù

Cynthia shrugged. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

It didn‚Äôt sound fine, but neither Mike nor myself were going to push her for answers. We were here to relax, not worry about college. I grabbed the assembly instructions while Cynthia finished clearing a spot to pitch the tent. Andy ripped the instructions out of my hands and tossed them in the tent‚Äôs carrying case.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I shouted.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need that,‚Äù he replied flatly.

‚Äú*You* might not need that, but I-‚Äù

He pulled a band off the flat tent, and it suddenly exploded into its proper shape.

‚ÄúIn my defense, no one told me you bought a pop-up tent,‚Äù I mumbled.

‚ÄúPass me the stakes,‚Äù answered Andy.

He nailed the tent in place while I helped occasionally by handing him another stake. At least I was being more helpful than Mike, who meandered around the campsite kicking stranger‚Äôs dirty clothes into a single pile. I guess he needed the peace of mind of knowing they were all in one place and he wouldn‚Äôt be walking on them. Cynthia, in the meantime, tossed our sleeping bags and other belongings in the tent, and then set up our electric grill.

We cooked ourselves hot dogs and sat around the campfire making idle conversation for most of the evening. There might have been a bit of drinking involved.

‚ÄúWhere is everyone anyways?‚Äù Cynthia asked.

OK. Maybe a *lot* of drinking.

I huddled up closer to her to steal her body heat. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? We‚Äôre all here, babe.‚Äù

She pointed to the extra tents. ‚ÄúThe sun‚Äôs been down for HOURS.‚Äù

Andy, sitting on the other side of the flames, narrowed his eyes. The angle of the light made him look sinister. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an old legend around these parts about a dark shadowy creature that crawls into tents in the middle of the night and eats campers alive.‚Äù

Cynthia rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúYou are so full of shit, Andy. I‚Äôm serious. What if they went hiking and one of them, I don‚Äôt know, slipped on a mossy rock and fell over the side of the mountain and his friend tried to save him but also slipped down and now they‚Äôre both almost dead at the bottom of a canyon, quietly trying to scream for help but their throats got crushed and they can‚Äôt make a sound? Or, I dunno, they‚Äôre lost? Shouldn‚Äôt we try to find a ranger?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this park *has* rangers, does it?‚Äù I asked.

Mike shrugged. ‚ÄúNo idea, man.‚Äù

Cynthia started shivering, so I held her tighter.

‚ÄúOk well, whatever. We‚Äôll let those poor souls suffer and die at the bottom of a cliff,‚Äù said Cynthia.

Andy stared at the crackling fire in front of him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre fine. They left just before we showed up, so I guess they‚Äôre used to hiking in the dark.‚Äù

Mike snorted. ‚ÄúHow d‚Äôyou figure that, Sherlock?‚Äù

He motioned to the fire. ‚ÄúThe fire was burning when we got here. That means *someone* was around to tend to it.‚Äù

Cynthia shivered. ‚ÄúBrrrrr! I‚Äôm going to get my sleeping bag.‚Äù

She pried herself free and stumbled to the tent. The sudden absence of her body heat made *me* shiver.

‚ÄúIt really *is* cold,‚Äù I mumbled.

Andy shrugged. ‚ÄúGet closer to the fire, then.‚Äù

I got up, rolled my log a few feet closer, and sat back down. It didn‚Äôt help.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still shivering,‚Äù Mike said.

‚ÄúYeah, well, it‚Äôs still really cold,‚Äù I replied.

He grinned and tossed me a beer. ‚ÄúThis should warm you up!‚Äù

I popped the cap off and chugged it like a nerd trying to prove he‚Äôs cool enough to join a frat. I felt a flush of warmth radiating from within me, but it didn‚Äôt keep the cold from seeping in.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something odd about the fire,‚Äù Andy said.

Mike looked up. ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

‚ÄúHas *anyone* fed it since we got here?‚Äù Andy asked.

I shook my head, so did Mike.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think so,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúEither one of you up for a game of fire chicken?‚Äù

‚ÄúFire *what*?‚Äù asked Mike.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs when you play chicken with a fire. Two people slowly move their hand towards the flame. The first one to pull away loses,‚Äù I explained. I looked at Andy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm game.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt understand what Andy had in mind, but I was always up for drunken shenanigans. We stood on opposite ends of the fire. The look in Andy‚Äôs eyes was intense. I‚Äôd only ever seen that amount of focused determination during midterms. He stared at that fire like he‚Äôd just caught it in bed with his girlfriend, mom, *and* grandma. We stretched our arms out.

‚ÄúReady?‚Äù asked Andy.

‚ÄúReady.‚Äù I replied.

Mike bounced in his seat. ‚ÄúSet. GO!‚Äù

We mirrored each other in speed, but not in intensity. Andy was trying to prove something, while I was just having dumb fun. He took a step, I took a step. My arm felt cold. Or was it hot? It was hard to tell. There was something heavy in the air, overwhelming me with dread.

‚ÄúThis is stupid,‚Äù I whispered.

Andy didn‚Äôt pull away, so neither did I.

‚ÄúChrist almighty, what are you DOING?‚Äù shouted Cynthia.

I started to turn to look at her, but Andy, with his damn cat-like reflexes, reached through the flames and yanked my hand in.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you doing?‚Äù I screamed.

He held me there for a good thirty seconds before I realized something: the flames didn‚Äôt burn. I looked at Andy incredulously. He let me go and focussed his attention on the fire. He knelt down and hovered his hand at the bottom, where the flames were supposed to be hottest.

Cynthia hopped over to us like a kid in a potato sack race, with her sleeping bag zipped all the way up to her neck. She was speechless.

‚ÄúDude, doesn‚Äôt that hurt?‚Äù Mike asked.

Andy wiggled his fingers. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe fire‚Äôs not hot,‚Äù I told Mike.

Mike stared at us. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean the fire‚Äôs not hot? It‚Äôs FIRE!‚Äù

I backed away and stumbled, landing on my log. It was like I‚Äôd waved my hand through thin air. Scary thin air, like the kind you find in a dark room as you paw around trying to hit the light switch, but thin air nonetheless. Cynthia dropped next to me, her eyes on my arm rather than Andy‚Äôs. I could tell she was trying to size it up to see whether I‚Äôd burned myself. When she saw I was fine, she unzipped her arm free and whacked me upside the head.

‚ÄúWhat the HELL were you thinking?‚Äù she screamed.

‚ÄúNothing, I-‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúHow stupid can you be? Do you know how PAINFUL third degree burns are? Do you have *any* idea how hard they are to treat?‚Äù

I should have known her internship in the burn unit was bothering her. She hadn‚Äôt been the same since she started it.

‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm okay,‚Äù I whispered, wiggling my fingers.

She looked away coldly. ‚ÄúI worry about you sometimes.‚Äù

‚ÄúDuuuude this is so fucking cool,‚Äù screamed Mike.

He‚Äôd joined Andy by the fire. Andy pulled his arm out and gave Mike room to play as he inspected his skin. It looked fine. Mike swung his arms horizontally, cutting through the flames. He looked like he was having the time of his life.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs this even possible?‚Äù Cynthia asked.

Mike jumped into the fire pit. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs a hologram?‚Äù
 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see a projector,‚Äù answered Andy, scanning the area.

Mike shrugged and began to dance a weird fake tribal dance in the middle of the fire pit. ‚ÄúFear me, mortals,‚Äù he bellowed, as he waved his arms and stomped his feet to an unheard beat, ‚Äú**I am Ra, god of FIRE!**‚Äù

‚ÄúSun,‚Äù corrected Andy, ‚ÄúRa is the god of the *sun*.‚Äù

Mike ignored him. He spun around and lifted his arms to the sky, ‚Äú**I AM RA! GOD OF FIRE!**‚Äù

Through it all, the flames never seemed fazed. They never faltered, never weakened, and never swayed as a direct result of Mike‚Äôs movements. Maybe he was right about it being a hologram.

‚ÄúWe need to document this,‚Äù said Andy, pulling out his phone to record what was happening.

You would *think* the novelty of the fire *wouldn‚Äôt* wear off too quickly, but it did. You can only stare into a funhouse mirror for so long before it stops being funny. With the night getting colder and the fire not providing us anything in terms of warmth, we retreated to the tent about an hour later. A tent which might have struggled to fit four adults comfortably, but *definitely* didn‚Äôt fit four *drunk* adults comfortably. I found myself pinned between Cynthia and Mike, with each snoring in my ear, and Mike drooling in my hair. He kept twitching and smacking me in his sleep. Suffice to say, I didn‚Äôt get much rest that night.

Come morning, Mike was holding me in a lover‚Äôs embrace. I *might* have pushed him away, but I‚Äôll take my body heat where I can get it, I guess. Andy was the first to ‚Äúofficially‚Äù wake up, and he left the tent before I even had the chance to whisper hello. Cynthia was next, and as soon as she saw the giant slug holding me captive, she whipped him with a shirt like a football coach with a towel in the locker room.

Mike grunted and unhooked from me. ‚ÄúI was having such a nice dream.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow d‚Äôyou sleep, babe?‚Äù asked Cynthia.

‚ÄúPretty well,‚Äù answered Mike.

‚ÄúAnnnnd I just threw up in my mouth. Thanks, Mike.‚Äù

I laughed. It was great seeing my friends and girlfriend getting along.

‚ÄúWhere Andy?‚Äù Mike asked.

‚ÄúOutside,‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm joining him. Come out when you‚Äôre ready.‚Äù

I yawned and got up. Well, crouched up. There wasn‚Äôt enough room to properly stand in our tent. I left the tent and heard all my bones cracking in protest as I stretched myself straight. Andy was sitting by the fire taking a million photos.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still going?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYup,‚Äù answered Andy. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to come back with some equipment. Try to figure out what‚Äôs going on here.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, well in the meantime, you want to help me pack up? I‚Äôm dying for a shower.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

We kicked the two sleepier ones out of the tent and started rolling up sleeping bags and disassembling the tent. Sans-instructions, might I add. Within about an hour, we were ready to leave. Andy snapped a few extra photos, and we went back down the trail.

We never did see the other campers.

We dropped Cynthia off first, and then headed to the dorms. All I could think about was my bed, with its warm down comforter, fluffy pillows, and all that glorious room to sprawl out on. Once home, Mike made a beeline for the fridge, and I went right for my bed, throwing my coat in the laundry hamper before passing out on my pillow. I vaguely recall hearing my phone ring at some point, but I was off in dream land.

***

A sharp, stinging sensation woke me up a few hours later. I opened my eyes, but the smell hit me before my brain could process the images. Something was burning. I felt a spike of adrenaline as I saw smoke rising from the laundry hamper. I jumped to my feet and ran to it, finding flames chewing up my coat‚Äôs right sleeve. I pulled it out and quickly tossed it in my bathtub before it could spread to anything else‚Ä¶or so I thought. Now that my attention wasn‚Äôt split anymore, I noticed the fibers of my shirt‚Äôs right sleeve slowly sizzling with microscopic ambers.

My entire arm was in agony. I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was searing hot or frozen cold, I just kept getting hit with wave upon wave of terrible, radiating pain. The only thing more sickening than the feeling was the smell. A disgusting scent like rancid beef on a frying pan. My sleeve had become a wick, and the wick was burning, no, *melting*. I ripped the shirt off without thinking. I could feel my skin pulling as I did it. Pieces of skin stayed on the shirt, pieces of shirt stayed on my skin. I could see the melted, woven fabric embedded into the reddened surface of my skin. My arm became a patchy mess of red and sickly yellow, like a blanket of autumn leaves on a forest floor. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I needed someone to tell me what to do.

My phone went off.

Somehow, through the agonizing pangs of pain blurring my mind, I managed to grab the phone.

Andy was calling, and I had a new voicemail.

I picked up.

‚ÄúGet Mike to a doctor NOW,‚Äù he shouted, with no regard for *my* well-being.

But I think he‚Äôd figured out what was happening, whereas I could only think about how much pain I was in and how nothing I did could make it stop. The burn didn‚Äôt get worse, but the pain wasn‚Äôt letting up for a second. It was excruciating.

‚ÄúThe doctor, Mike, now,‚Äù Andy insisted.

I could hear him say it through gritted teeth. He was choking back the tears that were already falling from *my* eyes. The authority in his voice was enough to snap me into action. I ran out of my room, whining at every air current that licked my raw, bubbling skin.

‚ÄúMike,‚Äù I whimpered.

Why was it so hard to speak? My arm was burnt, but my throat worked just fine. I think the problem was having to speak through the need to scream. Mike was sitting in front of the TV. He looked at me, then winced at the sight of my arm.

‚ÄúHoly shit, dude. What the fuck happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúDoctor,‚Äù I stuttered.

‚ÄúYeah man, I‚Äôll call an ambulance. Holy fuck.‚Äù

I was shaking. I wanted it all to stop. I wanted someone to knock me out so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to feel the pain anymore. Mike called 9-1-1 while I stuck my arm in the freezer, feeling very little relief. I couldn‚Äôt even tell you how long it took for the paramedics to get there. I was in shock.

When they arrived and ripped me away from the freezer, I remember hearing Andy‚Äôs voice again in my head. *Get Mike to a doctor NOW.* I was dazed. Disoriented. I couldn‚Äôt think. I could barely breathe, but at the pit of my stomach, I knew I had to get the message across.

I pointed to Mike and screamed, ‚ÄúHim!‚Äù

They all seemed very confused, even Mike. One of them said he could ride along. That was enough. I tried to give in to my need to pass out, but the spikes of pain refused to let me. I simultaneously remember every single minute of agony spent in the back of that ambulance, and yet I couldn‚Äôt tell you if it took two minutes, ten, or thirty. I just remember, at some point, Mike‚Äôs screams drowned out my own.

My admittance into the ER was a blur. People kept asking me questions. Something about chemicals. I couldn‚Äôt answer. I remember seeing Mike thrashing in the background. I remember seeing Andy sitting on a hospital bed. I remember a needle.

The pain in my arm started to decompress, and the panic slowly subsided. Then, it hit me. Whatever happened to me probably happened to Andy, and would probably happen to Mike.

And then my stomach dropped.

Andy and I had put our arms in the fire. Mike had *jumped* in. Mike had danced in the flames that wouldn‚Äôt burn. He‚Äôd spent so much time in there dancing and laughing and making a royal ass of himself.

‚ÄúMake it stop!‚Äù he screamed. ‚ÄúIt hurts!‚Äù

I could hear him all the way down the hall. I jumped to my feet and ran out of the room. All I cared about was Mike, and trying to help him in whichever way I could. I met a wall of orderlies who held me back. Doctors and nurses were running into Mike‚Äôs room.

‚ÄúLet me through! I need to see my friend!‚Äù I screamed.

I had enough adrenaline pumping through my veins that I actually thought I could overpower them, but I guess that was just in my head. They were accustomed to dealing with grieving family members. It wasn‚Äôt any effort on their part to hold me back.

A bright, flickering light poured out of the doorway to Mike‚Äôs room. I heard gasps and prayers and panic all around, but nothing was louder than Mike‚Äôs last scream. It poured out of him in one, long, horrifying stream. It started rough and primal, but tapered off into the cry of a child looking for his mother. The light went out, and smoke took its place.

All that was left of Mike was a pile of ash, and the stink of burn that spread to every corner of the hospital. It felt like it happened in an instant, but I heard it took over half an hour, and there was nothing anyone could to do stop it. I heard the nurses talking about it. They said his skin melted away, his blood boiled, his fat melted, and he finally caught fire. It all happened very slowly, and he was alive and awake to suffer through it all.

I hope to god that‚Äôs not true, because I finally got around to checking that voicemail on my phone.

‚ÄúHey babe, just letting you know I‚Äôm taking the girls to see that fire! I‚Äôll be back tomorrow. Love you!‚Äù

By now, it‚Äôs already too late. I know, because I saw the photos she posted online of her and her friends dancing in the [flames](https://www.facebook.com/lyset.manen)."

Some companies lead to list 1 and other to list 2. Task 1 from list 2 goes to list 3 while task 2 goes to list 2.

I'll have to adjust the number of columns and analyse the path taken.

I know the OSCP is the answer here. I do not have time for that commitment. To reiterate, I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO COMMIT TO THE OSCP; I still have classes.

I am working on some web application/cloud stuff, so I have chosen the AWS Associate Architect (cheap, applicable, working on a project that reolves around it).

Network+/Security+ are also cheap, but I hear a lot of ups and downs.

The OSWP interests me because it appears applicable to netowrking with a penetration testing spin on it. Arguably, it's a tad outdated.

The CEH is too expensive. Period.

No one had heard of the eJPT, though it fits everything I need it to, penetration testing, hands-on, good price, etc, etc.

What would you recommend? Is an AWS, OSWP, Sec+/eJPT not a good lineup for the summer?

I performed very well in undergrad to get a mathematics degree with lots of courses in statistics and comp sci. I landed several internships as software engineers and was eventually hired as a full-time engineer. Through out undergrad and working full-time, I definitely felt exhausted. However, I could always find a way to meet or exceed expectations and so I thought it was just me being lazy or depressive. 

After a year of working and feeling like I didn't really accomplish anything at my engineering job, I decided to go back to graduate school. It felt great, and I was excited to land an internship at a local startup in my new location to hold me over until grad school started. The burnout got even worse as this startup was constantly trying to hustle everyone into being amazing. Thankfully, that ended and grad school started. Unfortunately, grad school was worse than anything I had imagined. The courses are interesting, but my department is severely out of touch with industry. When I try to ask questions about what we would do in industry, it becomes clear none of my professors even know how to respond and some even get frustrated. 

I have typically been a motivated self-learner. I attribute that to me getting my software internships early on while being a math guy. However, now I'm sitting at the end of my first year of graduate school questioning the real value in it and worried about my mental and physical health. I feel as if I could have learned everything I did over the year in only 3-4 months of dedicated study on my own. I would also be able to target marketable skills while learning it. 

What I need advice on is this: is it bad to take a year off for mental rest and self-learning? I think I need extended time off away from everything to just get myself into a position where I can actually enjoy what I do again find the curiosity I used to have. I technically only have one year left in my masters program, but it feels like an impossibility to even consider taking classes again (not even mentioning comprehensive exams). Any advice would be appreciated on my situation."

A little bit about me: I started to work as PHP Backend Developer in November 2016. Last summer I finished my university with Master diploma and I firmly resolved to learn English, \(programmer without English != programmer\). I sold my car, bought a English course and in September I flew to Malta.. In November I found a job here. It was hard but somehow I found a little web studio which was not afraid to mess around with my documents and my English \(at that moment I had B1 level\). 

But I've been always dreaming to get into the USA. But you know how it is difficult to find a job offer in the United States from abroad even if you're a great great senior. That's why I'm thinking about an internship \- it will be much easier to stay after.

All companies that I found are usually huge and they're looking for recent graduates with deep academic knowledge \(algorithms, math etc\) I'm not good at it \- I learn frameworks, features, databases, PHP stuff. 

So, how do you think? Is it possible to find paid internship in the USA in my situation? 

Thank you."

I am doing a internship via private contract for a company. Myself and a fellow classmate are building a web app using entity core, ASP.NET Core MVC 6, unit testing, selenium web deiver, among other things like build automation ect.

We are having to learn almost all of it on our own. It's becoming draining and we get limited help with it. It took us 2 weeks (no days off) to figure out how to make automated builds and have them deploy to azure just have the same issues a week later without even changing anything within the build agents.

Anyway my question is, in a company, do you usually have other people helping you with things like this, especially if your new, or are you expected to figure it out on your own? Thanks for the insight! "

I had three calls last week with Roku, where I am trying to intern this summer. I had one call about two weeks ago, which was a phone screen. I think the calls last week went pretty well. I am pretty sure last week was the final round(I didn't ask any of the three people I talked to for whatever reason but whatever). I had two technical calls and one communications(how I would interact with other engineers) call. I didn't expect to get a reply Friday or during the long weekend, but I did expect them to get back to me today but it seems like they aren't going to get back to me(the last call I had was on Friday at around 10 their time). The only reason I am anxious is because this internship would be out in the Bay Area and I am on the East Coast. 

Should I contact the technical recruiter or the hiring manager I talked to? I feel like they will just say they haven't made a decision yet.

Thanks."

Something I have never realized is how do many of my university classmates are able to find summer internships during October of the school year. I really envy that. Anyways...

I'm sitting here in my apartment finishing class this week and realized I have nothing planned for a immersive job. I currently am abroad in Spain and the pizza place I usually used to work at said they've overhired since I left and done need me.

Because I don't have that, I have notjing to go home to this summer, and I don't wanna go home to my parents house and be a lazy shit, so I thought it might be smart to try and be proactive and try and apply for an internship in some city. 

But I have no idea how to do that. 

On top of that I've been studying in a foreign country for the past year without working. I just feel a bit lost. If anyone like knows any good websites or organizations where they hire college kids for a month or two, please drop the links.

I taught myself programming in middle/high school \(it's not like I had friends or anything to occupy my time\) and am both interested in and reasonably good at it. My GPA is 3.8, at a fairly high ranking University \(although my grades are slipping this quarter; I guess due to depression\). So I should be able to succeed, but I don't know what I'm doing.

I have never met or spoken to a professor \(or lecturer\) in the CS department. The CS classes here are large \(a couple hundred people, or more like 60 for smaller classes\). I don't really know many of my classmates either; in one class this quarter, there's a partner project, but without a partner I'm not going to get a good score on that \(perhaps a zero, but I'll try turning in something myself\). I would like to contact professors about opportunities to get involved in research \(fairly common at this university\), but of course haven't done that. I wanted to do an internship this summer, but I didn't end up going to the career fair any quarter this year, and after one video interview \(for which I wasn't hired\), I wasn't going to try again. At first I tried going to various school clubs to meet people, but I've been giving up on that \(and any other  way to socialize\), and sometimes I bike to campus, try to go to an event, but just circle the building a few times and leave holding back tears because of anxiety.

Then, I'm not really sure I want to work as a programmer, even though I like computers and programming. I'm not really that fond of the tech industry, honestly \(I'm a fan of open source\). I might prefer to go to graduate school...

As a result of my difficulty achieving both social and academic/career goals, due to social anxiety, I'm feeling lonely and sinking into depression. To a large extent, I just wish there was someone I could talk to \(ideally IRL\) about these things. Of course, there are... but anxiety prevents that. But then, how can you just be open about \(among other things\) having thoughts of killing yourself? Admitting that could have a large impact, and I don't know how much it would be lessened by saying that I don't think there's any immediate danger I would do that \(but do I even know?\)."

I never list that place as a reference but still, I'm in the process of getting interviews and scared this might come up.

Last summer I had this awful fashion PR internship. The interns were just pack mules and ran around all day and boxed things up, sent things out, etc. Still, the place wouldn't run without them. Anyways, I had signed up for it and stayed in the city for it and even though I was losing money I was determined to make the best of it. I never want someone to regret hiring me. My boss was really passive aggressive, too, so I tried to overcompensate to not get on her bad side, to not be subject to that hostility. Ugh. 


If it matters, the boss I ended up having wasn't even the one I interviewed with. The one I had interviewed with actually was fired or quit(?) right before the internship started, so another employee looking for interns reached out to me and asked if I would want to just join her for the summer. I said ok...


Literally a week and a half before the internship was over, she fires me. I came in a few hours late because I had a check in with my psychiatrist far away, on the opposite side of the city, and I forgot about it until the morning of, right when I was about to get on the subway to my job. It wasn't therapy or anything, she just wanted to see how I was doing on the new meds. I said it was a doc appointment. I texted my boss (she's like 27, and she always texted the interns casually throughout the day about tasks) a heads up that I'd be coming in late. I guess that could be unprofessional or annoying, sure. It was hard to ever schedule things because most weeks we came in different days. I understand getting a scolding for that, but... But I get back to my job, and she immediately tells me we need to talk, takes me into another room, and says 'it's not working out' and asks for my badge.


I was stunned. She had literally never given me any previous feedback or anything on my performance, and she made it seem like coming in late was the last straw. I thought I had been doing great other than that morning. I think before that I had called out maybe one day, IF that. And I was only late a couple times throughout the summer. I worked really hard. There was another intern assigned to her, but my boss decided to blame some bad record keeping the previous week ALL on me, too‚Äîthat week I was there not even half the time the other intern was, and the other intern was there on the two days that I WAS there. The record keeping (taking stock online/updating what clothing came in and out of the office) had become second nature to me‚ÄîI was like a robot with it, so meticulous about it, so for her to just throw that on me was such a slap in the face. It was like...if anything, the ONE thing I never forgot to do. I mean, I didn't really ever forget to do anything, but it was so frustrating for her to do that. Especially since when it supposedly happened, I was barely even there. And I couldn't even refute it because it was pointless. 


She also scolded me for texting her ""unprofessionally,"" using an acronym in my text to her about the doctor. And she said I always rolled my eyes when she told me to do something, which was such bullshit, my god. I was probably obviously not enthusiastic about fashion (my entire life I've been told I look mad or mean and have a permanent bitchface so that probably didn't help) but I did everything she told me and everything I was supposed to and would never be so blatantly annoyed. I'm not an idiot.


What also didn't help was that I was really depressed at the time. I told her that, that it affected my enthusiasm and how upbeat I was, and she just shrugged it off and kind of ignored it. I was on medication but it wasn't great. So she decided to start talking about other ways I was in the wrong. 


She was an asshole, too. One time she lost track of a duplicate of a dress and freaked out and me and my co-intern, and when it ended up being her mistake, she didn't even apologize. That happened more than once. 


It was just a terrible time and extremely demoralizing. Dealing with depression, I know I have to work harder to not look dead sometimes. And I was trying SO hard, so when I got fired, I was like wow, how will I ever hold a job in the real world? I can try this hard and people still think I'm slacking or unassimilable or whatever?



I also had been really careful to do well because my school gave me a grant to be there for the summer since the internship was unpaid, and obviously I wasn't supposed to get fired. 

It really hurt me and took me by such surprise. Since I have such limited experience on my resume, I have to have it there, so that I'm worried about it coming up. 

Would this be a dealbreaker in hiring? What if a potential employer calls that company? Should I tell them ahead of time? I never really thought about having to tell them until recently :/"

My name is (name) and I would like offer my services by applying to your Summer 2018 (position) Internship position. Majoring in Computer Science as a Senior at(university name)(Class of 2018), I have been recognized for projects in both object-oriented programming for games and 3D modeling. A recent project I have worked on was a 3D Model of a colossal dam surrounded by a canyon using various textures and other details. I successfully uploaded this project along with several others into Unity and Unreal Engine 4. For front-end programming I have most experience with Java and C but know C# and C++ as well, learning these languages on my own time. One of my most engaging activities in this field was starting up a group to create a VR game for driving simulations.

8nbxyg,86,2018-05-30,LOOKING FOR A SUMMER JOBS? Here are some tips from my job search,throwawayfarway2017,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/8nbxyg/looking_for_a_summer_jobs_here_are_some_tips_from/,"I spent the past semester trying to look for internships \(didn‚Äôt get it\). Now I‚Äôm looking for a part time temporary summer job so I can work full time \(I already have another part time job that continues in the Fall\) so I've spent lots of times looking around.  I‚Äôm a COLA major so I went in looking for a job thinking they all want Business and Engineering majors. I realized that there are actually **LOTS** of options for **people with different majors, skills and n**eeds so I want to share to those who are looking for a summer job or just in general. I hope it‚Äôll be helpful

**TLDR: go in knowing what you want and your criteria then eliminate those that dont apply to you. there are jobs that will fit your skills and needs. dont give up too early and its okay to apply to several places.**

* **Do you want full time? Part time? Long term? Temporary/ seasonal job?** I only want a temporary job for the summer. At first I thought it‚Äôll be hard to find cause lots of places don‚Äôt want to train someone that will leave. Guess what? **There are jobs that don‚Äôt need training and only need someone for a short period of time.** Don‚Äôt be discouraged and not search for it. **Try it!** Chances are you will find something that suits you.  I‚Äôve found office assistant job, summer camp, cashier, retail jobs etc that only need someone for the summer. Put in different keyword, like ‚Äútemporary‚Äù, ""temporary part time‚Äù,‚Äùshort term‚Äù , ‚Äúsummer‚Äù, etc depending on your need. **Play around so you get more options**
* **What is your desired wage?** If you don‚Äôt care and just want to earn some money, then you have lots of options. My current job pays well so I want something similar. If I see something that‚Äôs lower than my range, I‚Äôll pass on it so I don‚Äôt waste my and their time. **Know what you want**, usually cashier or retail jobs are closer to minimum wage, but assistant or office jobs can go up to $13\-$15. I found a job posting for a sitter for a UT staff‚Äôs 14 year old twins that pay $17 \(Hirealonghorn\) just to hang out, take them to activities, cook, and clean a bit!
* **What kind of jobs do you want?** Do you want to do labor work, at school or in office setting? Something more academic like research, analyzing, tutoring? Do you want to gain more professional experiences or just get a job to earn some cash on the side? Take this into consideration and **explore all the keyword and sites** so you can find all the available postings
* **Your schedule:** are you free all week? Only want to work weekday? Just 3 days a week? night shifts only? Use this and all the suggestions above to **eliminate job postings that don‚Äôt apply to you**. Some jobs will specify the day/time that they want so if it‚Äôs not what you want, move on. This will help narrow down your choices
* **Distance, location and transportation:**  If you have a car, this is great as lots of jobs ask for it.Some will reimburse you too if they need you to run errands.  If not, find ones near where you live. I‚Äôve seen several postings with stores and offices near campus if you live on campus. Others are all over and outside of Austin so chances are you‚Äôll find something near you if you don‚Äôt have a car
* **Know your skills and majors:** I‚Äôve found babysitting and jobs at daycare that want Education, Child development major or just someone that likes kids and have babysitting experiences, pool jobs that only ask that you watch the pool \(pool attendant\), or know how to swim and they‚Äôll train you in CPR,  jobs in bakery if you‚Äôre in Culinary major, accounting/marketing etc for Business major, office assistant that ask you to run errands, pick up the phones etc things that all of us can do,IT jobs, jobs in law firm if you‚Äôre a Law major, jobs in hospital, doctor clinic, in X\-ray if you‚Äôre Pre\-Med/Pharm major, tutor jobs \(esp if you‚Äôre good at Math, Physic etc\), jobs in drawing/designing, telecommunication, retails and grocery stores to learn customer service, deliver and pick up mails if you have a car, to something that‚Äôs random as moving chairs and tables out of a school for a month with $12 an hour if you like labor works or working out lol **there are things for everyone !** even if you only have a car, or if you speak Spanish, or you‚Äôre healthy and can do labor works, that already opens up several jobs for you so don‚Äôt be afraid to keep looking!
* **Exhaust all your resources!:** Linked is more for professional jobs while you can find all kind of things on Indeed and Glassdoor, Hirealonghorn is also good for jobs near campus or if UT staffs need someone to tutor or babysit their children \(you prob get a good recommendation letter if you do well\).  I don‚Äôt like Craiglist due to the format and so much spams but you can try. Keep looking and checking every other day. **The City of Austin currently have lots of job postings so check them out. They all pay pretty well.** Don‚Äôt give up if you don‚Äôt see anything you like. Keep looking, I‚Äôve seen jobs I want popping up after I am about to quit looking. You can set alerts too. Also, ask your friends, classmates and family members in case they know someone who‚Äôs hiring. You can casually bring it up in conversation too, you‚Äôll never know if they know some**o**ne

It doesn‚Äôt hurt to apply to several places either. You‚Äôll never know until you get an offer. I used to think what if I apply to too many places, how can I decide if 2\-3 places offer me a job? Jokes on me, I didn‚Äôt get anything lol after that, I apply for several places and don‚Äôt say no to any place until I get an offer in my hand. Good luck and hang in there! I hope the formatting is fine and feel free to ask questions or add your own tips"
8nbydv,7,2018-05-30,Recent Graduate debating on pursuing a Data Science Masters,myomic,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/8nbydv/recent_graduate_debating_on_pursuing_a_data/,"I graduated from an Ivy League this May from an undergraduate business school, studying Finance and Business Analytics. My past internships mainly centered around business/finance. However, late junior year and senior year, I became very interested in computer science, and pursued minors in computer science and data science through the Engineering School at my university. I got As in all my classes and over the past year, it has become very clear that computer science is truly a passion of mine and that I want to pursue a career in the field in a technical capacity.

I was recently accepted to a masters program at the same university in Data Science (at my school, the Data Science degree consists of all CS classes, just with a greater emphasis on ML/AI and statistics), as an internal admit. I'm now debating on whether or not I should do this program. 

As a pro, it is from a well-reputed university in Computer Science and a prestigious university overall. The Data Science masters can also be taken as entirely all CS classes, so the education would be identical. The con: the money, as well as the fact that I wouldn't have Computer Science on my degree. I wanted to apply to CS, but at my school, you have to apply to submatriculate in CS by junior year, and I hadn't taken enough CS courses at that point to be able to do that. There is the option to transfer from Data Science into CS (relatively high probability), but there is also the risk I would not be able to do that. 

If I don't do this Masters, I would probably take the GRE and try to reapply for pure CS masters programs elsewhere. I have a high GPA (summa cum laude) and am confident I can do well on the GRE, but I don't have research experience in CS and probably only mediocre recommendations from my CS professors, as I do not have an especially strong relationship with any of them. I am open to improving that by working for a year and doing research at a lab near my city and getting recommendations in that way, but again there is a risk associated with that. I am unsure if I could get into a similar caliber (Top 20) CS program, especially given my business background. 

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!"

Ok I have been having a headache recently because I don‚Äôt know what to do with my life. This summer I need to focus on developing my skills and resume so that I can land a job or internship in a year, which is when I graduate. Here are some of the relevant courses I‚Äôve taken:

\-C\+\+ and Java courses up to Data Structures and Algorithms \-Big Data and Databases \-C language under Unix

I will be required to take a Software engineering course and two other courses in the next year. I would like my decision on which starting job to pursue to inform my decision.

My goal is to land a decent job once I graduate. I go to a solid university, but I don‚Äôt have any projects or internships to show for it. Given my current situation, I want to commit myself to a plan so that I can spend a lot of time making progress by practicing and creating projects. The problem is I‚Äôm not sure if I should commit to software development or data science.

Data science sounds interesting to me, but I don‚Äôt know anything about machine learning yet. So far, I only know SQL, a little NOSQL, JDBC. I don‚Äôt know R, Python, and I haven‚Äôt taken a statistics course since high school.

Part of me thinks I should pursue software because of my current skill set and knowledge base. ALSO, I like the idea of being able to free lance as well so that is a big plus. It seems like data science is less freelance friendly, but if someone could explain to me what they think, that would be great.

So first off I am a college student. I have an internship thing that I am going to be doing part time starting in June, but I need to be busy and work while I am not doing that. 

For the last 3 summers, I have been working at a warehouse. I really enjoy being at that warehouse, I love the people there, and I seem to know it pretty well by this point. However, being in the warehouse very negatively affects my head. I am not sure how to really describe it. It is something physical, I do not know what exactly, but something about the warehouse (maybe the insane amounts of dust or other debris) messes with my head so much. I get these feelings where I feel like I am a zombie: not being able to focus on anything, missing large portions of conversation and feeling like I am not even physically present. Last year I noticed it and suffered greatly but I thought it was a concussion. However, from my 3 days there so far, I have again been having these feelings. I cannot work there if I feel like I have been feeling, as it has made my life terrible the last few days.

So, as a rising junior in college studying computer science, what other options do I have for a part time job? Of course, I could apply to food establishments if I desperately need something, but is there something better for me? I was thinking some sort of IT, but I am not entirely sure if places hire for such a small amount of time.

Any advice is greatly appreciated :)"

Two weeks ago my manager asked me what i wanted to do in the future;  I answered software development. I was honest and made sure he knew that i basically have no education in the area.

I now have access to their source code and I am clueless. Looking at one of their main web applications, I don't understand any of it or even know how to test \(compile?\) it.  It is full of errors is this normal?

I've spent my free time \(haven't had any assignments last two weeks\) making a CRUD webapp  using java servlets and jsps.  This was my first time using tomcat as well as a database.  Took me 3 days and I've just been twiddling my thumbs ever since because i have no idea how to begin to test/understand the source code

There is no documentation and i do not have a mentor.

I have received admits to the MS Computer Engineering program at USC, and MS Computer Science program at Northeastern. 

**USC - MS Computer Engineering**

2 year program - 27 credits

*Not sure how Computer Engineering is ranked* but USC in general, especially for CS is ranked very high and is very reputed.


No co-ops and internships

Starts in Spring 2019

Tuition - around $75k

**Northeastern University - MS Computer Science**

2 year program - 32 credits

NEU ranks okayish for Computer Science from what I've researched

Excellent for co-ops

Starts in Fall 2018 at Boston Campus

Tuition - around $65k


My interests - My bachelor's degree was in Computer Science and I'm interested in both low level stuff (embedded systems, computer architecture) AND also high level software development, AI / Machine Learning, Distributed Systems etc. Basically, I'm interested in both Computer Science AND Computer Engineering, and don't mind choosing either depending on the job prospects and overall quality of degree.



I'm finding it difficult to make a choice. Northeastern University is good given the co-op so I'm inclined more towards it but if USC is more reputed with better job prospects, I would reconsider.

*so if I want to be a successful scriptwriter I pretty much have to go to a prestigious film school like NYU or USC or UCLA so that means my only option rn is transferring if I don‚Äôt get off the waitlist (which seems increasingly likely rn)

*questions for solutions: does NYU or UCLA or USC accept transfer credits from a school like VT and will they let me transfer into film even tho I‚Äôm not a film major (bc as explained above w my parents majoring film at VT is impossible)

I'm just starting out as an undergrad in maths at a university in Germany, being although already pretty sure, that it will eventually lead to getting a PhD in pure maths or mathematical modeling. Nevertheless and regardless of the major, my question for the profs/researchers out here, whether you would reject an intern or a PhD applicant solely based on his appearance; namely, I'm seriously thinking on getting a couple visible facial piercings and maybe a small tattoo on the neck. Nothing totally gross, though.  


I'm asking, because I'm not really sure about the attitude towards this kind of stuff in university circles. Sure, we all have kind of an image that it would be very inappropriate at a consulting company, for example, but the situation is much more vague for me when it comes to academia. So far \(I'm doing a pre\-course at the uni I'm going to study at later on\) I've *never* stumbled upon any prejudices, though the more serious it gets, the more fears one, of course, develops.  


Surely it's always better to look just normal, but I'm still kinda into pursuing the style I want to create for myself, so I don't think that I'll be totally satisfied with advice like 'forget this'.

Everyone on my team is easy to work with and it's more money and freedom than I've ever had at a job. 

However, I know that I'm not growing as a developer. There are development tasks every now and then but most of the work is in test automation and maintenance. 

If I leave early, the worst thing that might happen is that I would be banned from my school's coop program and burn some bridges.

However, in other internships where people are learning a lot of things, the work life balance appears to be much worse (more micromanagement and less freedom).

Should I just coast through the remaining 12 months and enjoy a chill intern life with little professional growth or should I leave early and again put myself through the crazy interview process for the reward of doing more work at the next job?

What would you do in this situation?

NOTE: If I leave early, I would just go back to school in the fall and continue with the 3rd year of my CS degree. "
8ne2kw,2,2018-05-30,Need Advice. Overwhelmed for different areas of development and stuck between them.,OlecraMarcelO,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8ne2kw/need_advice_overwhelmed_for_different_areas_of/,"First thanks for taking time to read this.

I know this is going to sound very familiar to other posts but i really need a personal advice here.


**How do you deal when you feel interested in too many areas of developing and also dealing with the time you should dedicate to this areas without feeling you are just wasting your time?**


I feel that time is going away and i will get older (right now i'am 24 yo) quick and i'm currently in a job (in an area i don't see myself the rest of my work life).

I mean, in my case, i'm very interested in Videogame Development (PC or Mobile, specially with Unity) but also Web Development (Frontend mainly but Backend is really interesting). I constantly feel i will not have enough time to learn both and i end stuck between them.

I was able to learn the very basics of both. Over the last year i learn how to use Unity, C#, and  i have been making some games of my own (just prototypes) or with a group of friends, in the other hand i also try to learn Web developlment through FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy, etc. I consider myself a little above beginner level in HTML, CSS, Javascript. But just the basics won't give me a chance in getting a job in real life, in the end i always end stuck, in both of areas i see a lot of new technologies, new tools, new frameworks and i feel too overwhelmed.

I must say that it is not easy consider leaving my current job (well internship about to finish) and start freelancing or something similar. In my country it is really difficult to get a decent job. i could give details about this, but i think it will not contribute nothing on the subject.

Too put all this in the summary:

* i'm 24 yo. i started an internship months ago, but i don't see myself in this specific area of development in the next years (or the rest of my work life).
* I'm interested and passionate about Videogame and web development, but i constantly feel overwhelmed about the options in both fields and i get paralyzed really often.
* Leaving my actual job oportunity isn't easy, beacuase of the situation in my country (even if i do and i get another job i feel i will stuck in the same dilema, since there aren't jobs offers in the game development for example).

So what are your opinions / advice? 

Thanks

I applied to many, many places and even had a few interviews but could not nail down a job. The responses I got from different firms mostly came down to the fact that some other candidate had more experience. I am not from the type of family that is heavily connected (like a lot of the kids who go here), so I never had a backup move or anything like that. All of this was extremely frustrating, as I have a very good GPA (3.87) and worked hard on many cover letters, etc. 

I am interested in consulting coming out of school and will try to attend as many recruiting events as I can this fall. What advice would you give me moving forward. Is there any advantage to joining a club like Nexicon as a Junior?

I feel like I've neglected everything the CS department has to offer during my time here at UT and really just focused on enjoying the other aspects of UT and Austin, such as clubs, athletics, campus events, and everything to do in the city of Austin. As a result, I feel really left out of the CS community and definitely feel like my skills as a software developer/programmer are really lacking.

I am definitely guilty of really just trying to memorize material to get good grades rather than absorbing that knowledge to improve my skills. I really enjoyed 312 and 314 and felt strong through those classes, but I was carried prettied hard through 429 and 439 by my friends, and as a result, feel like I am under qualified/underprepared to transition into a real world job, even though I have an ok GPA (3.2).

I've had 2 internships here with the same Fortune 500 company doing software development (front end) last summer (I really struggled through that one as I was completely incompetent for the position and had to do a lot of learning on my own) and in Product Management this summer.

I'm scheduled to take Software Engineering with Downing as well as the Android App Development class this coming fall, but I was wondering what advice you guys might have on how I can really make the most of the little time that I have left here at UT and get my shit straight enough that I feel confident working full time for a company as a software engineer or for any position really.

Anything is helpful, but also I would ask you guys to be real with me if I'm pretty fucked here. Thanks!"

And, as a note, I know doctors are human; they can misdiagnose or not see something wrong, but after seven years of a clear problem... My patience runs out.

Anyways, eight years ago, on my 10th birthday, I was running in my yard when there was this ""popping"" (truly a dislocation that goes back in on it's own) sensation in my knee. I fell to the ground with a scream.
The next day I went to urgent care, got a stabilizing knee brace and crutches. 
As time passed, these dislocations became more and more frequent. My doctor told my parents that I would grow out of this or that it would resolve itself. 
Eventually, about three years later, my other knee began to dislocate. I went to an orthopedic doctor and they discovered I have femoral anteversion in both legs which causes patellar subluxation. Between that time and now, I have went through three rounds of physical therapy with no improvement.
I can no longer run, jump, jog, skate, etc. because my knees cannot handle it. It has gotten to the point where I've dislocated my knees while rolling over in bed. 
I went back to the orthopedist this year, and he said the subluxation was the worst he's seen. I remember he turned to his intern and whispered ""it's usually not this severe.""

I've been scheduled for a surgery next month where they derotate my femurs. They need to do both legs, and possible ligament work on my knees. 

This could've been fixed earlier in my life. I could've avoided so much pain. All the times I was mocked for being in a wheelchair at school, all the times I've needed to sit out of some game my friends are playing because it's too risky for me. I trusted that I really would grow out of this condition, but it only got worse.  I miss being able to do the things I once did, like rollerblading and jumping on a trampoline. I miss being able to go down a flight of stairs without clutching onto the rail, worrying I'll fall down like last time.

I hope I'll be able to do all those things in the years to come."

8ni50t,0,2018-05-31,What looks better?,dotobird,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8ni50t/what_looks_better/,"I just finished my short (few months) stint with a startup, and I decided not to stay. Technically the position was an internship for people who are no longer students like myself. I am now pursuing other roles that align my interests more. Everyone here likes me, and I could stay longer but it was a case where they wanted a more long-term commitment from me that I wasn't interested in. 

Anyways the small dilemma that I am in now is that I am not sure how I should describe this short-term experience on my resume. I was technically an intern but also an independent contractor (1099). My boss describes my role as 'software developer.' If I chose the latter description (contractor), I think it would raise more suspicion and questions as to why it was so short despite it being normal? I suppose both positions are inherently short-term. I was contributing full-time as a full stack developer, making commits for new features and fixing bugs that others couldn't apparently solve. With that said, I am worried that an intern label might undersell that. 

Right now I am leaning towards just labeling it as an independent contractor.

TLDR: Given my situation described above, what looks better on a resume: intern or independent contractor?"

So here is the deal, I just finished a 10 month unpaid internship (also 18 hours towards my masters) and now I am eligible to take my boards and become a registered dietitian. My exam date is July 11th, and I have absolutely zero motivation to study...

I have been working towards becoming a dietitian since I was 18 and started college - 4 years of undergrad, 2 years worth of internships total. I have been busting my ass for so long and now that the ‚Äúfinish line‚Äù is in site I‚Äôm losing momentum.

I think part of it is it‚Äôs not truly a finish line. After I‚Äôm licensed I have to start job hunting, and I‚Äôm transferring schools to finish my masters program, my wife and I are also moving cities at the end of July, and I‚Äôve been battling mild depression and anxiety for the last 6 months.

I am a power lifter so most of my stress gets vented at the gym. We have two dogs and a bunny so I get lots of cuddles and I walk about 2-3miles a day. I am usually a very driven person, I have not stopped busting my ass since I met my wife in 8th grade and realized she was going places I wouldn‚Äôt- went from a straight D and F student to straight A‚Äôs the next semester. I pride myself on thriving on pressure, I usually love hard work and pushing myself. But lately I just want to sit - read, play video games, and not even look outside...

My main question is this: when you‚Äôve suffered periods of lower motivation than normal, what do you do to start turning around and getting back on track?"

I was lucky in a sense someone reached out to me and gave me an opportunity to create something and in hindsight, I picked up some key learnings I would like to impart to anyone who is feeling lost as well, perhaps they can work for you too, as they did for me.

Here is the article I wrote:

Title: Feeling lost? Congratulations. Here's how to move forward.

It may be a feeling you have been putting off for a while, or it comes instantly with you asking ‚ÄúWhat the hell am I doing? Is this what I desire for myself?‚Äù Chances are, it‚Äôs a little of both of all of us. Congratulations, you are one step closer to finding yourself, please enjoy this ugly paintMS drawing as your gift:



Ironically enough, my ‚ÄòWhy the hell‚Äù moment came through travelling alone. With no one to turn to, I had to face up to the fact that I have been lying to myself about wanting to pursue the HR consultancy field for the past 2 years.

 

How did I progressed from feeling lost in my future career to creating my own business? These are 3 key lessons that I want to share to help you move past this stage of your life. Let‚Äôs begin:


LESSON 1: ADMIT YOU ARE LOST

I know its daunting, heck its even depressing. When I first realized I was truly lost with 4 months left to graduation I felt terrible. I shut myself off in my room and gamed constantly for over half a month, escaping from the truth. Some of you may have felt this way too, doing things that distract you from real conflict.

 

The breaking point came when my good friend asked me ‚ÄòMarcus, have you applied for any jobs yet?‚Äô

 

‚ÄòNo, I haven‚Äôt found anything I like yet‚Äô. I muttered under my breath.

 

Unknowingly, I have admitted that amidst the pool of students searching for a job, I am the one in limbo. No doubt I felt shame, but in that moment I started to accept that fact that I was lost and needed some form of direction, and I sure as hell knew that a corporate job was not the way to go for myself from past internships. To me, feeling lost beats mindlessly applying for a job that I didn‚Äôt even know why I would apply for other than material incentives. It may be the case for you too. If so, read on.

 

Talk to people around you, admit that you are lost. Takes a lot of self-destruction of the ego. Tough? Yes, nobody said it was easy. However, I can guarantee it is a whole lot liberating than following the status quo mindlessly.

 

Most importantly, take your time, it took me 2 months of feeling lost before I decided which path I wanted to take. (And with this post I want you to take lesser time than I did)

 

As long as you are doing something about it that rather than escaping from the reality you are lost, you are progressing.

 

Take your time.

 


LESSON 2: TALK TO 30 PEOPLE (AT LEAST)

Remember what I said about talking to people around you? Talk to 30 of them, tell them you are having trouble looking for a career that means something to you. Chances are, many people will try to give you advice on what to do and most of the time the advice is crap or unrelatable to you. I have talked to multiple people, my parents, my friends, all of which gave me the same advice ‚Äì ‚ÄúJust look for a job first and gain experience, then find out what you like‚Äù. To me, that advice was completely backwards because it missed out the crucial question:


 

‚ÄúWhat do you see yourself doing in the immediate future that fits into your dream life?‚Äù

 


The idea is to sieve through as much information as possible and find one that resonates with you. To increase your chances of finding that golden piece of information or opportunity to find your direction, seek out someone who has been down the same path as you. Few out there have been in your position and came out better but talking to as many people as possible gives you the highest chances of finding these people. Your goal is to look for as many avenues as possible for the answer to come to you. Remember, the answer is in yourself all along, it just needs an avenue to surface (see above).

 

My answer to my lostness came unexpectedly from a friend whom I have not seen for 6 months. He reached out to me, we talked, and he directed me to a coach that both of us have worked with. I knew something had to be done, it took me great courage to face my fear of rejection and ask for help from my coach. That‚Äôs where I found that if I wanted to live up to my dream life by 35, I had to create something of my own.

 


LESSON 3: LOOK FOR A ‚ÄòMAYBE‚Äô, ‚ÄòYES‚Äô IS A BONUS

The most important step in overcoming feeling lost is to do something about it, anything with relation to the question:

 

‚ÄúWhat career do you see yourself doing in the immediate future that fits into your dream life?‚Äù

 

Cross out anything that is an outright ‚ÄòNo‚Äô in your life. For me, its was a 9-5 corporate job. Explore options, go to talks, conventions, open your mind to any possible opportunities that isn‚Äôt an outright ‚ÄòNo‚Äô for you.

 

There is a difference between ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think I am up for that‚Äô as compared to ‚ÄòI hate doing that and can never see myself living that life‚Äô

 

The hard truth is if you are searching for a 100% ‚ÄòYes‚Äô now in what you want to do then you will be sorely disappointed. Start with something, it may not be the ‚ÄòYes‚Äô answer you are looking for but it‚Äôs the first step toward that.

 

WRAPPING UP

Feeling lost is perfectly ok no matter who tells you otherwise. In fact, I find it hard to believe that given how unique everyone is, many of us are fitted into the homogenous working system of a 9-5 desk job. So, take a moment, congratulate yourself for feeling lost.

Accept it.

 

Talk to people.

 

Start looking for an answer in yourself.

8njm4b,310,2018-05-31,"If you're going to be a Junior this fall, start studying for the PSAT now.",ScholarGrade,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8njm4b/if_youre_going_to_be_a_junior_this_fall_start/,"The PSAT is a standardized test like the SAT that measures scholastic aptitude.  Many people say the PSAT is just a ""practice"" SAT, and that is mostly true.  However, it is used to determine National Merit Finalist status which can win you a huge scholarship to dozens of colleges.

To win the major awards, you will have to score in the top ~1% of students.  This is a tall order, but given the demographics of this sub, many of you have a good shot.  Studying can help you immensely here because almost no one studies for the PSAT.  This is probably the easiest chance you have at a full ride scholarship.  Seriously, you could study for a 5 hours a week all summer and win a scholarship worth over $150K.  $2,500 per hour is not a bad wage to pay yourself.

How do you cash in?  Study like crazy, get a qualifying score on the PSAT during your junior year, then follow the steps once you are notified if you made the cutoff.  You can find more information at www.NationalMerit.org.

Note that while National Merit status is not particularly impressive to T20 schools, it will be a quality, national award at many colleges and could be very helpful for gaining admission or winning other merit awards.

Below is a list of large merit awards for National Merit Finalists and Semifinalists.  If any of these interest you, be sure to check the schools website to verify the awards, criteria, deadlines, and process.  Some of these may be outdated or may change, so look them up if you're interested.  If any of these links are broken, just go to the school's financial aid page and look up their merit scholarship offerings and you should be able to find the most up-to-date info.

One additional note worth mentioning - you will see that most of the awards are for National Merit Finalists.  These awards are broken up into tiers: 

- NMCS: National Merit Commended Student.  This is the top ~4% of students or about 50k.

- NMSF: National Merit Semi-Finalist.  This is the top ~1% of students or about 16k.

- NMF: National Merit Finalist.  This is the Semi Finalists who are able to complete the application materials on time, take the SAT (and not bomb it), and jump through the hoops.  Every year there are around 1,000 students who just let this fall through the cracks or bomb the SAT.  Don't let this be you.  If you are a NMSF, **do the paperwork and take the SAT seriously** so you can get the NMF status.  That's the easiest way to get a massive scholarship. 

Other notes in the list:

exp- stipend for experiential learning (internship, study abroad, etc., allowable uses vary by college)

Full Tuition- covers the cost of tuition for 4 years

Full Ride- covers Tuition, Room, and Board for 4 years (may include other benefits as well)

Section 1 ‚Äì Full Tuition or better, no residency required, automatically qualification

 This is a compilation of large scholarship awards for National Merit Semifinalists and Finalists. The awards included in this section meet the following criteria:
1. At least Full Tuition/Full Ride in magnitude (or equivalent)
2. Automatically awarded (not a competitive process or a limited number of awards).  Note that this means you don't have to meet any other requirements to win, but you still may have to fill out some paperwork or apply by a certain deadline.
3. Available to out-of-state students
4. College must be accredited, public or non-profit private, 4-year degree-granting institution

Majoring in Computer Science as a Senior at\(university name\)\(Class of 2018\), I have been recognized for projects in both object\-oriented programming for games and 3D modeling. A recent project I have worked on was a 3D Model of a colossal dam surrounded by a canyon using various textures and other details. I successfully uploaded this project along with several others into Unity and Unreal Engine 4. For front\-end programming I have most experience with Java and C but know C# and C\+\+ as well, learning these languages on my own time. One of my most engaging activities in this field was starting up a group to create a VR game for driving simulations. I demonstrated my ability to plan and recruit gameplay programmers and 3D modelers mainly from my other clubs all while making sure I kept up with my other work in college. I am certain I can implement vehicle control and test the simulator with external applications. I have experience with Toyota‚Äôs services and would appreciate the opportunity to work with Simulation Environment technology as a have great passion for simulations created using Virtual and Augmented Reality also.

I'm aware that my school's career office is a useful tool for a lot of this, but they're not really that helpful when it comes to technology/computer science oriented career paths. Regardless, with mostly rejections or not hearing back from anywhere which is pretty disheartening since I was hoping to have an internship this summer I'd like some advice on my resume. All critiques are welcomed cause I know my resume definitely needs improvement.

I don't have any computer science related work experience hence why I can only list my freelance graphic design work and volunteer experience, but I have listed projects I've worked on and Computer Science related programs I've taken part in where I was a Student Leader for. I've been applying or mostly software engineering and developer internships.

I‚Äôm a lowly coordinator here. About a year ago a VP of a different department acquired my team and gutted the department. He‚Äôs laid off tons and tons of people and is responsible for making huge changes at the company. I‚Äôve met with him multiple times at work and outside of work at events and know him fairly well.

Now, he just wiped out several departments so myself and hundreds of others are all losing our jobs effective 3 months from now. The one girl I know who wasn‚Äôt laid off (a close friend) was mentioning how she feels very uncomfortable working under him alone because he has always stared at her weird, acted a bit creepy, told her he‚Äôd ‚Äútake care of her‚Äù moving forward, and has tried to force her to drink lots of tequila at events when she didn‚Äôt want to. She‚Äôs mid twenties and also a lowly coordinator.

Upon expressing this, several male coworkers who have worked with this VP for years and years said ‚Äúohh... you guys don‚Äôt know.‚Äù And told us tons and tons of stories of several office affairs he had (he‚Äôs married with young kids) with coordinators who work under him. Apparently it was common knowledge for the department. He also exclusively hired female interns and several women complained to the guys that told us this that he had said gross and creepy things to them. They also said he went after vulnerable women often entering relationships with them while they had a lot going on in their lives. Regardless if some of this was consensual, he was their boss and is a high up VP and they were all coordinators. Something definitely not allowed at a big media company that publicly defends ‚Äúme too‚Äù movement and such. 

Now, this was apparently an open secret and when I‚Äôve asked some others they‚Äôve confirmed the stories often giving more details ‚Äúhis wife was pregnant and found out‚Äù ‚ÄúHR had to have a talk with one of the girls he slept with‚Äù etc.

Now, he has gotten away with all of this and continues to have a LOT of control at this company. I‚Äôm already laid off so I don‚Äôt feel like I have anything to lose to try and take him down. But he has never done anything to me personally.

I‚Äôd like to casually mention to HR in my exit interview and maybe ask something like ‚Äúis anything going to be done about the fact that he makes women very uncomfortable?‚Äù

In 2018 I think the company should be very afraid of stuff leaking. I really want to do something with this info and I want him to be fired. My mom doesn‚Äôt want me to say anything for fear of hurting myself.

Okay thank you!"

I did well in school, participated in every activity in the sun, always volunteered, always tried to make the mood happier but it's just not worth it anymore. I graduated with a degree in Engineering in 2016, found a good job but was laid off when the department closed only within 6 months. After that I've been applying to every job I could find. 

Not even a fucking bite. That fucking made me spiral down, I took 2 shitty minimum wage jobs just to support myself. Ruined my body and my mental health, but I couldn't afford shit. I turned to just selling myself to really desperate men. I fucking hate myself for it. 

Now I had hopes of getting in graduate school. I interviewed for a really prestigious internship that could just get me some experience and out of the slump. I was really happy to start, however fuck ups with the school just dashed those dreams now. They fucking lied to me about the amount of stipend I would be getting, the classes I would have to take and fucked my enrollment to the point where financial aid is no longer eligible. Now I can't afford shit, stuck with prostituting myself to make ends meat, work in a shitty minimum wage job where people treat me like shit. 

I'm just really frustrated and feel taken advantage of on all aspects of my life. The school admissions fucked me up more than prostituting, at least you get fucking money. I have no one to rely on. I don't know. I just want to be able to just not be hungry and have a roof over my head and for everyone to let me be. "

No internship experience but I had a job as a full-time credit analyst and have moved into a sales role with the same company. I also worked as an IT student worker on campus and was an officer of the university's finance club.

The dilemma

Not really sure what sort of jobs I should be looking for. I have my mind set on Dallas because I have a couple of relatives in the area, my sister plans on moving there when she graduates, and my parents will be trying to move down there within the next two years.

Fortunately, opportunities in finance are not all that difficult to come by in Dallas, but I want to maximize the utility of my search and applications since I can only complete 4 to 6 a day to the level that I can stand behind.

I have a hard date set of August 1st (when I'd like to be in Dallas and have a job ideally) in order to keep myself accountable. It's not life or death, but I'm trying to be serious about sticking to this timeframe.

So, given my situation, what should I do to effectively allocate my time and give myself the best opportunity of finding a good entry-level job before I move? I'm very open to any industry and most positions.

Thanks in advance!"

I'm considering applying to this program but the quarter system (as opposed to the semester system) is throwing me off. I've read that many internships are only eligible for ""full-time"" students, so is that 2 classes per quarter or is it more? As someone new to programming/CS I don't know how comfortable I'd be taking more than 2 classes per quarter.



I tried researching this with the search function but the only sort of relevant post that came up was about housing benefits from the GI bill.

Thanks!"

But I also think I can spend and dedicate my time towards learning by myself.  I also think why not both? I could do both side projects and internship over summer.

8nmj5h,0,2018-05-31,"Coming from a non-CS background, should I focus on starting my career first or going back to school first?",hobolow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8nmj5h/coming_from_a_noncs_background_should_i_focus_on/,"TL;DR: Should I dive into web development (via self-study) and aim to get an internship/entry-level development position before attempting to go to grad school or should I primarily focus on building more CS-focused knowledge first?

For background: I graduated college in May 2017 with a BS (non-CS). In August 2017 I was offered a job at a non-profit (relating to renewable energy/sustainability, what I studied in undergrad) but in October the funding fell through and I lost the position. Since that position was a unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity I decided afterwards that I would pursue a computer-related career instead of one relating to my major. CS was an interest I fell in love with late in my junior year of college, so too late for me to have switched majors. I found an online, terminal Masters program in CS that appeals to me, but I know I would have to build up my technical experience and knowledge should I wish to ever be accepted.

After a few false starts, I eventually decided that I would pursue web development through self-study (e.g., via Colt Steele's Udemy courses, The Odin Project, Udacity, etc.) to gain more immediate, hands-on experience before studying traditional CS topics. My reasoning was partially that I had difficulty learning the theory-heavy CS first without having more concrete programming skills (aside from some relatively basic programming abilities in languages like Python or Ruby). So I eventually figured that if I pursued web development first then I could more quickly gain concrete, applicable knowledge, build a portfolio, and pursue an internship or entry-level position. This would allow me to get professional experience that I could list on my grad school application to help make up for the fact that I come from a non-CS background. My problem arises in the fact that the grad program concentration I'm most interested in is Machine Learning, to which web development isn't the most relevant background. 

I was hoping to be in a position that would allow me to pursue web dev employment in approximately 12-18 months and apply to grad school within 24-36 months (12 months after beginning employment). (In the meantime I have a job at the local grocery store.)

My question boils down to; if my ultimate goal is to pursue a masters in CS with a concentration in ML, should I pursue web development first to get immediate hands-on experience/build a portfolio/help with my grad app, while simultaneously studying CS topics? Or should I pursue only traditional CS topics while avoiding web development due to a lack of relevance to the grad school curriculum?

I debated whether to post this to r/csmajors, r/learnprogramming, or here, so I apologize if this isn't the correct sub to ask such a question as mine. Ultimately, I'm excited about both web development and the more traditional CS curriculum so I look forward to learning both, but I want to maximize my return on time investment as I'd like to start my career as soon as possible. Thank you all for any advice/opinions/answers, it is much appreciated. "
8nmjyb,1,2018-05-31,What direction to go?,mixato,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8nmjyb/what_direction_to_go/,I am working on my BT in IT: cybersecurity and digital forensics.

But, I feel like I have no grasp on the tools and technology the project I'm working on uses. I was given a high\-level overview of the presentation and I think I understand the abstraction, but I was thrown into the deep end when given the actual code. My mentor just send me the codebase of the project, which has like a dozen files, each with about 400 lines of code, in a language and framework I do not know. 

I brought this up with my manager and mentor and they seemed understand enough, and said I have some time to pick up the language's intricacies \(because this isn't just ""create and run function in this language"" but uses stuff more unique to the language\) and understand the codebase. However, I feel like this is just a whole lot of stuff in a very short time. 

How do you guys deal with this? Where do you even start? My particular case is asynchronous programming in TypeScript \(so async\-await and promises\) and there aren't too many tutorials online. I want a return offer with this company so I would like to try my best.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks!"

A little background; I got a job during my last month of college, back in March, working as an administrative assistant for a startup social Investment firm, the CEO is an old family friend who was looking for an admin. I absolutely loved it, and it is an insanely good opportunity. I work remotely, am paid well, and have even gotten the chance to travel for work.


My degree is in international development and economics, so I felt this was a good place to start.

However, the work environment and my boss are making this job nearly impossible to mentally survive. It seems everything I do angers her, or she doesn't not appreciate when I do things right, and expects me to be responsive 24/7. 

I signed on for forty hours a week, and am easily going over that by almost double. I spoke to her about this, and even she has even mentioned that I work too much. But it quickly devolves back into text at 1am asking for urgent help, or asking me to rearrange entire days with no notice. Then she'll get angry that I am emailing people too much to change the plans. Much of this job is trying to read her mind, and having to change all the time.

To be clear, I am very good at my job, and she tells me so, but the lack of awareness and the tone she uses to speak to us makes wanting to work rare.

I understand that founding a company and being a CEO is very difficult, and at this level mistakes are not to be made. However, our entire staff, besides our CEO is made up of me, and two college interns.

That's it, that is who is behind the CEO. We are responsible for everything, and it is not a viable way to run things, especially since we are younger and would like to attempt to have lives after work.

I mostly feel that I jumped into a full time, very high demanding job too quickly, and that I am wasting my early twenties being a workaholic. I always have to have my phone on me at the ready, and people in my life have begun to notice. I do not have time to go out, I have to steal time to eat, shower, sleep, etc.

 I would kill to have a clearly defined 9-5 job in an office, I want that more than anything right now. I am deeply, deeply, unhappy, very stressed out, and rarely make it through the day without losing it.

But still, I want to be practical about this, and understand if leaving after 6 months (I am 3 months in) will make employers question why I didn't last, thus making me an unattractive candidate. 

Would it look bad to an employer to see I left a job, even amicably, after six months just out of college?


TL;DR
My job is a great opportunity, but the mental stress and emotional rollercoaster is making it very hard to envision staying on any longer than September. Help?"
